# 1 Corinthians 15:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On this occasion, over five hundred brethren were gathered together, most likely in Galilee. This is a remarkable and undeniable evidence of the resurrection, as the majority of them were still alive at the time of writing, providing a significant number of witnesses to confirm the truth of this event. It is incredible to think about the magnitude of disciples that Jesus had, far beyond what is commonly known. The fact that there were so many who could be assembled in one place speaks to the widespread influence and following Jesus had during his ministry.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He is relating what he had received and preached to them."
2. "It appears that others besides the eleven witnessed the appearance on the mountain in Galilee."
3. "Not here in its commoner meaning of 'once for all,' but at once, at one and the same time."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He 'appointed' this place, as one remote from Jerusalem, so that believers might assemble there more freely and securely."
2. "The number of disciples (Acts 1:15) at Jerusalem shortly after, was one hundred and twenty, those in Galilee and elsewhere not being reckoned."
3. "Andronicus and JUNIUS were, perhaps, of the number: they are said to be 'among the apostles' (who all were witnesses of the resurrection)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is remarkable that this fact is omitted by all the evangelists; but why they should have omitted so remarkable a proof of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, is unknown."
2. "Jesus had spent most of his public life in Galilee. He had made most of his disciples there.It was proper, therefore, that those disciples, who would, of course, hear of his death, should have some public confirmation of the fact that he had risen."
3. "One thing is proved by this, that the Lord Jesus had many more disciples than is generally supposed. If there were five hundred who could be assembled at once in a single part of the land where he had preached, there is every reason to suppose that there were many more in other parts of Judea."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The strength of this witness lies in the fact that the majority (ο πλειους) of them were still living when Paul wrote this Epistle, say spring of A.D. 54 or 55, not over 25 years after Christ's resurrection."
2. "This incident is the one described in Matthew 28:16 the prearranged meeting on the mountain in Galilee."
3. "To above five hundred brethren at once (επανω πεντακοσιοις αδελφοις εφαπαξ). Επανω here is just an adverb with no effect on the case. As a preposition with the ablative see Matthew 5:14."

### John Gill:
1. "And this being signified by the apostles to the brethren there, it is no wonder that there was such a number of them gathered on that occasion."
2. "Of whom the greater part remain unto this present; and so might be personally applied unto for the truth of this..."
3. "Though doubtless these had surviving friends, relations, and acquaintance, to whom they had communicated this important case, and who were ready to attest what they had heard them in the most solemn manner declare."

### John Wesley:
1. Above five hundred — Probably in Galilee. A glorious and incontestable proof! The greater part remain - Alive.
