# 1 Corinthians 15:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This appearance of Jesus to James was not included in the widely known accounts of His post-resurrection appearances to the disciples, but the apostle Paul affirms its occurrence. It is likely that this appearance was a personal and private encounter between Jesus and James, strengthening his faith in the resurrection. The title apostle in this context refers not only to the twelve disciples but also to a broader group of followers, possibly including the seventy and those sent to spread the gospel to the Gentiles.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Probably, from no distinguishing epithet being added, the celebrated James, the brother of the Lord." 
2. "This is decisive for the much wider use of the term ἀπόστολος than as applying to the Twelve only: and a strong presumption that James, just mentioned, and evidently here and Galatians 1:19, included among the ἀπόστολοι, was not one of the Twelve." 
3. "Chrys. (ubi supra) extends the term to the Seventy of Luke 10:0 and others: ἦσαν γὰρ καὶ ἄλλοι ἀπόστολοι, ὡς οἱ ἑβδομήκοντα."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "James swore he would not eat bread from the hour that he drank the cup of the Lord, till he should see Him rising again from the dead."
2. "The term here includes many others besides 'the Twelve' already enumerated: perhaps the seventy disciples."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is probable that the Lord Jesus appeared often to the disciples, since he was 40 days on earth after his resurrection, and the evangelists have only mentioned the more prominent instances, and enough to substantiate the fact of his resurrection."
2. "The other James was dead (see Acts 12:1) when this Epistle was written. This James, the author of the Epistle that bears his name, was stationed in Jerusalem."
3. "It is highly probable that Paul would state to him the vision which he had of the Lord Jesus on his way to Damascus, and that James also would state to Paul the fact that he had seen him after he rose. This may be the reason why Paul here mentions the fact, because he had it from the lips of James himself."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This James, we believe, was 'James the Lord's brother,' not James the apostle."
2. "It has been thought that this special manifestation was what removed his last misgivings as to the claims of Jesus."
3. "It has been thought, too, that this special manifestation to James no doubt communicated to the apostles along with his blood-relationship to the Lord Himself, had something to do with the leading place assigned to him at Jerusalem."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "To James (Ιακωβω). The brother of the Lord."
2. "This fact explains the presence of the brothers of Jesus in the upper room (Acts 1:14)."
3. "To all the apostles (τοις αποστολοις πασιν). The Ascension of Christ from Olivet."

### John Gill:
1. "This appearance was made unto him when alone; and though the Scripture elsewhere makes no mention of it, there is no room to doubt it, since the apostle here affirms it."
2. "As for the account of the appearance of Christ to this James, immediately after his resurrection, recorded by Jerom as he found it in the Gospel according to the Hebrews, it seems to be fabulous."
3. "Then of all the apostles; at the Mount of Olives, when he led them out of Jerusalem, as far as Bethany, blessed them, and was parted from them, and ascended to heaven out of their sight."

### John Wesley:
1. "Then by all the apostles — The twelve were mentioned1Corinthians15:5."
2. "This title here, therefore, seems to include the seventy; if not all those, likewise, whom God afterwards sent to plant the gospel in heathen nations."
