# 1 Corinthians 15:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul humbly describes himself as one born out of due time, comparing his apostleship to an untimely birth. This emphasizes the remarkable nature of his encounter with the ascended Christ in heaven, distinct from the other disciples who had seen Him on earth. Paul's use of this analogy highlights his deep sense of unworthiness and underscores the grace of God in calling him to be an apostle, despite considering himself undeserving of such an esteemed title.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "as to the abortively born, the one whose relation to the rest in point of worthiness, was as that of the immature and deformed child to the rest of the family." 
2. "That this is the meaning is evident from 1 Corinthians 15:9, which drops the figure."
3. "He appeared to me also: viz. on the road to Damascus. This, and this only, can here be meant; as he is speaking, not of a succession of visions, but of some one definite apparition."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "the one abortively born": the abortion in the family of the apostles.
2. "I am the least of the apostles," scarcely "meet to be called an apostle"; a supernumerary taken into the college of apostles out of regular course.
3. "Begotten again by the resurrection of Jesus." Jesus' appearance to Paul, on the way to Damascus, is the one here referred to.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This passage proves that the apostle Paul saw the same Lord Jesus, the same 'body' which had been seen by the others, or else his assertion would be no proof that he was risen from the dead."
2. "It was not a fancy, therefore, that he had seen him; it was not the work of imagination; it was not even a 'revelation' that he had risen; it was a real vision of the ascended Redeemer."
3. "The expression seems to be proverbial, and to denote anything that is vile, offensive, loathsome, unworthy."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word does not mean an untimely living birth, but a dead abortion, and suggests no notion of lateness of birth, but rather of being born before the time."
2. "Connect rather with He appeared: last of all He appeared unto me as unto the abortion. Paul means that when Christ appeared to him and called him, he was - as compared with the disciples who had known and followed Him from the first, and whom he had been persecuting - no better than an unperfected foetus among living men."
3. "The attempt to explain by a reference to Paul's insignificant appearance, from which he was nicknamed 'The Abortion' by his enemies, requires no refutation."

### John Calvin:
1. "he confesses his unworthiness, and...compares himself to one that is born prematurely...so the Lord observed a regular period of time in creating, nourishing, and forming his Apostles."
2. "This premature birth renders the grace of God more illustrious in Paul than if he had...grown up to maturity in Christ."
3. "to St. Paul he appeared at the first moment of his spiritual conception, and before he was formed or moulded."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The allusion is no doubt to the great manifestation at Damascus."
2. "As unto one born out of due time (Gr. ‘the abortion,’ ‘the mistimed birth’)"
3. "He appeared to me also."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "As unto one born out of due time" (ωσπερε τω εκτρωματ). Literal, as to the miscarriage (or untimely birth).
2. "Paul means that the appearance to him came after Jesus had ascended to heaven."

### John Gill:
1. "This was a sight of Christ in heaven, not on earth, such an one as Stephen had, and was a corporeal one; otherwise it would have been impertinent to have mentioned it, with the rest of the ocular testimonies of Christ's resurrection."
2. "The apostle adds, as of one born out of due time: or 'as an abortive'; not that he was really one, but like one."
3. "he refers to a 'posthumous' birth, to one that is born after the death of his father; because that the rest of the apostles were all chosen, and called, and sent forth, whilst Christ, their everlasting Father, was living on earth, but he not till after his death, resurrection from the dead, and ascension to heaven."

### John Wesley:
1. "An untimely birth — It was impossible to abase himself more than he does by this single appellation."
2. "As an abortion is not worthy the name of a man, so he affirms himself to be not worthy the name of an apostle."
