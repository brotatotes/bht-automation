# 1 Corinthians 15:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
True believers are often deeply humbled by the sins they committed before they came to faith. This is the case with the apostle Paul, who acknowledges that he persecuted the church of God. Even though he had been forgiven by God, he still carries the weight of his past actions and considers himself unworthy to be called an apostle. This serves as a reminder that even after experiencing God's grace and forgiveness, the memory of our past sins can humble us and remind us of the great mercy and love that God has shown us.

3. "Humility does not disqualify a man to give testimony, but rather furnishes an additional qualification.
