# 1 Corinthians 16:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The use of the term saints instead of the poor in the passage serves to remind the Corinthians of their responsibility to provide for their fellow believers. By emphasizing the communal nature of their faith, the passage encourages the Corinthians to give generously to those within their own faith community. This distinction highlights the importance of supporting and caring for one another, as they are all part of the same spiritual family.

1.
