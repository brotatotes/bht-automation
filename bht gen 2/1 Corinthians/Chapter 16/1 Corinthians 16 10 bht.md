Let him be without fear, not despised for his youth, as he works in service of the Lord, deserving of respect and support, as he carries out the work of the ministry and the advancement of the kingdom of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There must have been some special reason for this caution respecting Timothy, besides that assigned by Meyer, al., that he would naturally be depreciated as only a subordinate of Paul, whom so many of them opposed."
2. "His youth occurs to us, mentioned 1 Timothy 4:12; but even that is not enough, and would hardly be intended here, without some reference to it."
3. "De Wette’s conjecture may not be without foundation, that he was perhaps of a timid disposition. Meyer objects that we have no historical trace of this: but I think some are to be found in 1 Tim.: e.g. 1 Timothy 3:15; 1 Timothy 5:22-23."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The undesigned coincidence between the Epistle and the history, and the clearing up of the meaning of the former (which does not mention the journey to Macedonia at all) by the latter, is a sure mark of genuineness."
2. "It is not certain that Timothy actually reached Corinth; for in Acts 19:22 only Macedonia is mentioned; but it does not follow that though Macedonia was the immediate object of his mission, Corinth was not the ultimate object."
3. "Without fear- Referring perhaps to a nervous timidity in Timothy's character. His youth would add to this feeling, as well as his country, Lystra, likely to be despised in refined Corinth."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Let him be received kindly and affectionately."
2. "Paul asks them to encourage him, to receive him kindly, and not to embarrass him."
3. "He is engaged in the service of the Lord; and he is worthy of your confidence, and worthy to be sustained by you."

### John Calvin:
1. "Hence we infer, that the Church of Christ ought to be concerned for the preservation of the lives of ministers."
2. "Assuredly, it is reasonable, that, in proportion as an individual is endowed with superior gifts for the edification of believers, and applies himself to it the more strenuously, his life ought to be so much dearer to us."
3. "The clause — as I also do, is made use of, either to express his excellence, or simply to point out the similarity as to office, inasmuch as both labored in the word."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "See that he be with you without fear."
2. "The apostle is anxious he should be well received, for he worketh the work of the Lord."
3. "A similar fine testimony to Timothy in Philippians 2:19-22."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  That he be without fear  (ινα αφοβως γενητα). Evidently he had reason to fear the treatment that Timothy might receive in Corinth as shown in 1 Corinthians 4:17-21. 

### John Gill:
1. "See that he may be with you without fear; should he come to them, the apostle desires they would take care of him, that he might be safe and secure from enemies of every sort." 
2. "For he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do; which is a reason why they should be careful of him, that nobody molest him, and put him into fear."
3. "though he was not in so high an office as the apostle, yet he was called to the same work of the ministry, was engaged in the same service of Christ, and was zealous in promoting the same common cause, interest, and kingdom of the Redeemer."

### John Wesley:
1. "Without fear — Of any one's despising him for his youth."
2. "For he worketh the work of the Lord — The true ground of reverence to pastors."
3. "Those who do so, none ought to despise."
