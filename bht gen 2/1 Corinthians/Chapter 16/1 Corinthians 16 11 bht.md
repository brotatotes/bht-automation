We should not let anyone despise him on account of his youth, but instead, we should set him forward on his journey in peace, showing him the respect and support he deserves. It is important to accompany him on his way, providing him with the necessary assistance and wishing him success. For I eagerly await his arrival along with the brethren who are accompanying him.
