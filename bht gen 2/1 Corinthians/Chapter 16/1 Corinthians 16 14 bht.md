# 1 Corinthians 16:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let all that you do, all your obedience, actions, and conduct, be done in love. Your love for Christ should be the source of your obedience to Him, and your love for one another should govern your behavior towards each other, especially in church affairs. Without love, all your possessions and actions are meaningless. This exhortation was necessary for the Corinthians, who were plagued with factions and divisions. Let love be the guiding principle in everything you do.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Let all your things ... - All that you do. This direction is repeated on account of its great importance, and because it is a summing up of all that he had said in this Epistle."
2. "Here he says, that charity, or love, was to regulate all that they did. This was a simple rule; and if this was observed, every thing would be done well."

### John Calvin:
1. "Let all your things be done in love." - He wishes, then, that love shall be the directress; because the Corinthians erred chiefly in this respect — that every one looked to himself without caring for others.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Let all that ye do be done in love."
2. "While the four preceding things express the sterner features of Christian duty, this pours suavity into them, and, being itself 'the bond of perfectness,' encircles and beautifies the whole character."

### John Gill:
1. "Let all your things be done with charity." - The whole of their obedience to Christ, their observation of, and subjection to all his ordinances and commands, should spring from, and be done in love to him.
2. "The whole of their conduct and behaviour towards one another ought to be with charity, which bears all things, and covers a multitude of sins." - All their church affairs, their business at church meetings, should be transacted, not with strife and vain glory, but in peace, and with mutual affection, with a concern for the good of each other, and of the whole body, and for the glory of God.
3. "Without charity or love, and the exercise of this grace, it signifies little what men either have or do." - Such an exhortation was necessary to this church, since it was full of factions, contentions, and divisions.
