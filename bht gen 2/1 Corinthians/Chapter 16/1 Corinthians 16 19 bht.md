## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "On Aquila and Priscilla, see Romans 16:3-4; Acts 18:2. They had removed from Corinth to Ephesus, and had there, as subsequently at Rome, an assembly of the faithful meeting in their dwelling."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Aquila and Priscilla... had come to Corinth and then had removed with Paul from Corinth to Ephesus. Here, as at Rome subsequently, they set up a Church at their house. A pattern to Christian husbands and wives, their Christian self-devoting love appears wherever they were."
2. "Even the gifted Apollos... owed much of his knowledge to them."
3. "Christ's followers when dispersed from one another cease to be a congregation (synagogue), but still are a Church, having the common bond of union to the same Head by the same faith and hope."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The churches of Asia - The word 'Asia' in the New Testament usually denotes Asia Minor in general... This is the region undoubtedly which is intended here." 
2. "Salute you - Greet you; send respectful and affectionate Christian regards."
3. "Much in the Lord - With affectionate Christian salutations; or as Christians. Wishing the blessing and favor of the Lord."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Asia. See on Acts 2:9. Aquila and Prisca. See on Romans 16:3.

### John Calvin:
1. "A magnificent eulogium, inasmuch as the name of the Church is applied to a single family!"
2. "It is befitting, that all the families of the pious should be regulated in such a manner as to be so many little Churches."
3. "His saluting them in the name of Aquila and Priscilla, confirms what I have noticed above â€” that the Epistle was written at Ephesus, not at Philippi."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This Christian 'salutation' was no unmeaning ceremony: it was the Hebrew 'Peace be unto you' in its highest, warmest sense, which was first uttered in that new sense by our Lord Himself (Luke 24:36; John 20:21), and left by Himself as His legacy to His own in words which have carried it into myriads of receptive bosoms in every land, and will do, as long as there are such on earth."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The churches of Asia (Î± ÎµÎºÎºÎ»Î·ÏƒÎ¹Î± Ï„Î·Ï‚ Î‘ÏƒÎ¹Î±Ï‚). True of the Roman province (Acts 10:10; Acts 10:26; Colossians 1:6; Colossians 2:1; Colossians 4:13; Colossians 4:16). The gospel spread rapidly from Ephesus."
2. "With the church that is in their house (ÏƒÏ…Î½ Ï„Î· ÎºÎ±Ï„' Î¿Î¹ÎºÎ¿Î½ Î±Ï…Ï„Ï‰Î½ ÎµÎºÎºÎ»Î·ÏƒÎ¹Î±). Paul had long ago left the synagogue for the school house of Tyrannus (Acts 19:9). But Aquila and Prisca opened their house here for the services."
3. "The churches had to meet where they could. Paul had laboured and lived with this family in Corinth (Acts 18:2) and now again in Ephesus (Acts 18:19; Acts 20:34). It was their habit wherever they lived (Romans 16:5)."

### John Gill:
1. "This shows, that this epistle was not written from Philippi, as the subscription to it attests, for then he would rather have said; the churches of Macedonia salute you, but at Ephesus, where he now was."
2. "Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord...send their Christian salutations to them, with great affection and respect."
3. "Their family consisting of believers, and being kept in such good decorum, and employed daily in singing, praying, expounding, and conferring together about divine things, looked like a little church."

### John Wesley:
1. Aquila and Priscilla had formerly made some abode at Corinth, and there St. Paul's acquaintance with them began, Acts 18:1,2.
