# 1 Corinthians 16:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The first day of the week holds significance for Christians in terms of observing religious duty and offering contributions. Rather than waiting for a specific time or moment, each individual should consider it their duty and privilege to give, treasuring up at home in accordance with their prosperity. This act of giving should stem from a settled principle, not merely an occasional impulse. The choice of the first day of the week as the designated time for giving aligns with the practice of early Christians gathering for worship, hearing the word, and participating in the ordinances of Christ.

### John Gill:
1. "The reason of his fixing upon the first day of the week was, because on this day the disciples of Christ, and the primitive churches, met together for divine worship, to hear the word, and observe the ordinances of Christ."
2. "It was usual for the primitive churches in the age following that of the apostles, after the worship of God was over, to collect money for widows and orphans, and for saints in distress."
