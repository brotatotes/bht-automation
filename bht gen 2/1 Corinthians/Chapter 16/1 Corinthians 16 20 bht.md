# 1 Corinthians 16:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle Paul, along with the Christians he was connected to in Ephesus, sent their Christian salutations to the church in Corinth. In this letter, Paul encourages the Corinthians to greet one another with a holy kiss, a token of mutual love among fellow Christians, especially during the Lord's Supper. This custom, which originated from the East and was later adopted by the churches, serves as a symbol of a higher fellowship. It is important for churches to consider the cultural context and local customs when practicing such expressions of good feeling.
