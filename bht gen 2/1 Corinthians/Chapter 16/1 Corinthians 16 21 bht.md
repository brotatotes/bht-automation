# 1 Corinthians 16:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle Paul, in writing this letter, had an amanuensis who wrote down the words as he dictated them. However, he took it upon himself to personally write the salutation at the end of the letter with his own hand. This act served as a way to verify the authenticity of the letter, ensuring that it truly came from him. It was his unique way of assuring the recipients of the genuineness of the epistle.
