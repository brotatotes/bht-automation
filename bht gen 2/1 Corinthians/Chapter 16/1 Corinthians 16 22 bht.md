# 1 Corinthians 16:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle is cautioning against those who lack love for the Lord Jesus Christ, not referring to those who are ignorant of him. He emphasizes that such individuals should be rejected and separated from the fellowship of believers, as their lovelessness is deserving of a curse. The term 'Anathema' carries the meaning of something categorically devoted to destruction. The apostle deliberately wrote this impactful sentence in his own hand, positioning it between his greeting and benediction to ensure its importance and attention.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "On the distinction between φιλεῖν and ἀγαπᾷν see notes on John 21:15."
2. "The negation here of the feeling of personal affection, 'has no love in his heart for,' is worthy of note, as connected with the curse which follows."
3. "μαραναθά: An Aramaic expression, מָרַן אֲתָא or מָרָנָא אֲתָא the (or our) Lord cometh (or, is come, as Chrys., al., ὁ κυρ . ἡμ . ἦλθε: in 1Jn 4:2 the same Syriac form is used to express ἐληλυθότα): probably unconnected with ἀνάθεμα: and added perhaps (Mey.) as recalling some remembrance of the time when Paul was among them: at all events, as a weighty watchword tending to recall to them the nearness of His coming, and the duty of being found ready for it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Lord who ought to be 'loved' above all."
2. "A motto or watchword to urge them to preparedness for the Lord's coming."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was designed to direct them to the great and essential matter of religion, the love of the Lord Jesus."
2. "Though, therefore, those who did not love the Lord Jesus could not be punished by people, yet they could not escape divine condemnation."
3. "The solemn declaration stands here, that if they do not love the Lord Jesus, they will be, and they ought to be, devoted to destruction."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Maranatha means the Lord cometh. It was a reminder of the second coming."
2. "The reason for the use of the Aramaic phrase is unknown."
3. "It is found in 'The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles,' ch. 10, at the conclusion of the post-communion prayer."

### John Calvin:
1. "For he is not speaking of strangers, who avowedly hated the Christian name, but of pretenders and hypocrites, who troubled the Churches for the sake of their own belly, or from empty boasting."
2. "What he immediately adds — Maranatha, is somewhat more difficult. Almost all of the ancients are agreed, that they are Syriac terms. Jerome, however, explains it: The Lord cometh; while others render it, At the coming of the Lord, or, Until the Lord comes."
3. "Paul, then, after pronouncing an anathema on those who do not love Christ, deeply affected with the seriousness of the matter, as if he reckoned that he had not said enough, added a term that was in common use among the Jews, and which they made use of in pronouncing a sentence of anathema."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If any man loveth not the Lord, that is, the Lord Jesus, let him be Anathema." 
2. "Maran atha. This is the Aramaean or Syriac expression for 'Our Lord cometh;' a solemn warning that the approaching Advent of the Lord would see that dreadful curse visited upon such." 
3. "What I mean is, if any man hath not such love of Him who laid down His life for us that he would lay down his own life for Him, rejoicing to be counted worthy to suffer for His name."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The refusal to love Christ (ου φιλε) on the part of a nominal Christian deserves αναθεμα."
2. "Μαραν αθα...expressing the lively hope that the Lord will come."
3. "It was a curious blunder in the King James Version that connected Μαραν αθα with Αναθεμα."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle here does not so much mean profane and unregenerate sinners, who are destitute of love to Christ, from ignorance of him."
2. "let him be anathema... signifies that such persons that love not the Lord Jesus, should be rejected by the saints, and separated from their communion."
3. "it is best to consider this word, or rather these two words, 'maran atha', 'our Lord cometh', as added by the apostle, to put persons in mind of the coming of Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ... Let him be Anathema." 
2. "Anathema signifies a thing devoted to destruction." 
3. "This weighty sentence the apostle chose to write with his own hand; and to insert it between his salutation and solemn benediction, that it might be the more attentively regarded."
