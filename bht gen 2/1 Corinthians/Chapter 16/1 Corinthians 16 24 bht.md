# 1 Corinthians 16:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
May the love that I have for all of you, extending without exception, be always accepted by you.

It is my earnest desire and firm belief that this love will always be mutual and fruitful among us.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Because the Epistle had contained so much that was of a severe character, he concludes it with an expression of affection."
2. "ἐν χρ. Ἰησ.] τουτέστιν, οὐδὲν ἀνθρώπινον ἢ σαρκικὸν ἡ ἀγάπη μου ἔχει, ἀλλὰ πνευματική ἐστι καὶ ἐν χριστῷ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "After having administered some severe rebukes, he closes with expressions of 'love': his very rebukes were prompted by love, and therefore are altogether in harmony with the profession of love here made."
2. "It was love in Christ Jesus, and therefore embraced 'all' who loved Him."
3. "The subscription represents the Epistle as written from Philippi, but shows it was written at Ephesus."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In Christ Jesus - Through Christ Jesus; or in connection with your love to him; that is, as Christians. This is an expression of tender regard to them as Christian brethren; of his love for the church; and his earnest desire for their welfare."
2. "The Epistle bears internal marks that it was written from Ephesus, though there is every probability that it was sent by three of the persons who are mentioned here."
