# 1 Corinthians 16:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage speaks of the Corinthians choosing trustworthy individuals to accompany their collection. These individuals would be recommended by the church in Corinth through their letters of approval. The apostle Paul, as the steward of the collection, would also send them with his own letters of commendation to the elders and church in Jerusalem. Paul's desire was for the Corinthians to have confidence in the proper administration of the funds and to understand that their giving was an expression of God's grace.
