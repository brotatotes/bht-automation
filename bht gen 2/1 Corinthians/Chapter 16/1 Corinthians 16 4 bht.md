# 1 Corinthians 16:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If the collections are sufficient to warrant an apostolic journey and receive a warm welcome in Jerusalem, it would be fitting for me to accompany the messengers. This would not only demonstrate my commitment, but also remove any potential suspicion. Rather than sending letters of recommendation, I would personally go with them in order to ensure transparency and integrity in handling pecuniary matters. By doing so, we would maintain a blameless reputation and prevent any doubts about the use of the collected funds.
