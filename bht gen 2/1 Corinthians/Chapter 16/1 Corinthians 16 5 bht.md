# 1 Corinthians 16:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul intends to pass through Macedonia on his way to Corinth, a change from his original plan. This decision was made out of concern for the Corinthians, so that he would not visit them in sorrow and severity. The present tense used indicates his now matured plan, rather than implying that he was already in Macedonia. In making this decision, Paul is choosing a route that is more direct and favorable for his journey.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This plan was a change from his former intention, which had been (see 2 Corinthians 1:15-16, and note), to pass through them to Macedonia, and again return to them from Macedonia, and thence to Judæa."
2. "For this he was charged (2 Corinthians 1:17 ff.) with levity of purpose: but his real motive was, lenity towards them, that he might not come to them in sorrow and severity (2 Corinthians 1:23; 2Co 2:1)."
3. "The pres. implies, as in E. V., his now matured plan, not, as in the erroneous subscription of the Epistle, that he was on his way through Macedonia when he wrote the word."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "His first intention had been to pass through them to Macedonia, and again return to them from Macedonia, and so to Judea; this he had announced in the lost epistle... now having laid aside this intention... he announces his second plan... passing through Macedonia first on his way to them, and then tarrying a while, and even abiding and wintering with them."
2. "For I do pass—as much as to say, 'This is what I at last resolve upon'... implying that there had been some previous communication upon the subject of the journey, and also that there had been some indecisiveness in the apostle's plan."
3. "'Pass through' is opposed to 'abide'... He was not yet in Macedonia, but at Ephesus; but he was thinking of passing through it (not abiding as he purposed to do at Corinth)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Now I will come unto you - I purpose to come unto you."
2. "He proposed to go to Macedonia first, and, having passed through that country, visiting the churches, to go to Corinth."
3. "Though he had abandoned, from some cause, the design of passing through Corinth on his way to Macedonia, yet he had not given up the design itself. It was still his intention to go there."

### John Calvin:
1. "Thence he could sail by a straight course to Achaia. For visiting Macedonia, a long circuit was needed, and a more disagreeable route."
2. "By this he shows his affection towards them. For what reason had he for delay, except that he was concerned as to their welfare?"
3. "With this reservation, saints ought to follow up all their plans and deliberations; for it is an instance of great rashness to undertake and determine many things for the future, while we have not even a moment in our power."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The apostle had given the Corinthians to expect two visits from him, one on his way to, the other on his return from, Macedonia."
2. "For this change of plan he had been captiously charged with 'lightness' (fickleness, insincerity, 2 Corinthians 1:17); whereas it was out of tenderness to them, after the severity with which he had ordered them to expel the incestuous member of their church, that he was induced to defer his visit till his return from Macedonia."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "When I shall have passed through Macedonia." (οταν Μακεδονιαν διελθω).
2. "Whenever I pass through Macedonia." (see construction in verse 1 Corinthians 16:3).
3. "I do pass through." (διερχομα).

### John Gill:
1. "Now I will come unto you... though some had given out that he would not come to them any more..." 
2. "When I shall pass through Macedonia... fixing the time when he intended to visit them after he had gone through that country..."
3. "For I do pass through Macedonia... he should take his tour through Macedonia; and so coming into Greece, he intended to come to Corinth..."

### John Wesley:
1. I pass through Macedonia — I purpose going that way.
