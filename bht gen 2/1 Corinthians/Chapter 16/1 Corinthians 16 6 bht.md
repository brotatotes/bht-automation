# 1 Corinthians 16:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is possible that the speaker will stay, or even spend the winter, with the audience. The uncertainty lies in the plans determined by Providence, which may require the speaker's presence elsewhere. As we read in Acts 20:1, the speaker stayed in Greece for three months, including the winter. The audience is asked to accompany the speaker on their journey, providing both personal support and necessary provisions.
