## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "at Ephesus—whence Paul writes this Epistle. Compare  :-, 'Asia,' wherein Ephesus was."
2. "until Pentecost—He seems to have stayed as he here purposes: for just when the tumult which drove him away broke out, he was already intending to leave Ephesus (Acts 19:21; Acts 19:22)."
3. "Combined with 1 Corinthians 5:7; 1 Corinthians 5:8, this verse fixes the date of this Epistle to a few weeks before Pentecost, and very soon after the Passover."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This passage proves that this letter was written from Ephesus."
2. "Doubtless the great festivals of the Jews were well known among most of the cities of Greece."
3. "It is no improbable supposition, also, that Christians everywhere regarded this day with deep interest, as being the day on which the Holy Spirit descended on the apostles and on the people of Jerusalem."

### John Calvin:
1. "He accordingly tells them beforehand that he will remain at Ephesus until Pentecost, adding the reason — in order that they may wait for him the more patiently."
2. "Thus, when he was hastening forward to Jerusalem, he assigned as the reason of his haste, that he might arrive there at Pentecost, but while others presented themselves there for the purpose of sacrificing according to the ritual of the law, he himself had another object in view — that his ministry might be the more useful in proportion to the largeness of the attendance."
3. "It were, however, an excessively poor meaning to understand Paul here as simply specifying fifty days. Besides, when he expressly says τὴν πεντηκοστήν (the Pentecost,) he cannot but be understood as speaking of a particular day."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The allusion here to Pentecost fixes the date of this Epistle."
2. "The allusion to Ephesus shows from whence it was written."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Until Pentecost  (εως της Πεντηκοστης). He writes them in the spring before pentecost. Apparently the uproar by Demetrius hurried Paul away from Ephesus (Acts 20:1). 

### John Gill:
1. "The feast of weeks, or of harvest, which was fifty days from the passover; :- which though abrogated at the death of Christ, was observed by the Jews, and is mentioned by the apostle, not as a festival that the Christians were obliged to regard, or did regard, but as pointing out the time he intended to stay at Ephesus."
2. "And we elsewhere read, that he was greatly desirous of being at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost, Acts 20:16 not to keep it, but because there would then be abundance of people from all parts there, to whom he should have an opportunity of preaching the Gospel."

### John Wesley:
1. I will stay at Ephesus — Where he was at this time.
