# 1 Corinthians 16:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For a great opportunity of ministering the word, one must consider the number of hearers, as well as the effects it can have on them. However, it is important to acknowledge that with such opportunities, many adversaries will arise, seeking to obstruct the spread of the Gospel. This is a constant battle against the forces of Satan, but it is necessary for believers to bear witness to the truth, defend it against opposition, and strengthen and establish fellow believers in the face of numerous adversaries.
