# 1 Corinthians 2:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle, not relying on the eloquence and wisdom of human rhetoric, chose not to dress up the message of Christ crucified with a high and sophisticated style, for it required no such adornment. Instead, he simply and plainly declared the testimony of God, relying on the truth of the matter and the evidence by which it was supported. It was not about impressive speech or human wisdom, but about faithfully proclaiming what God had given him to testify concerning His Son.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I also (as one of the ἡμεῖς of ch. 1 Corinthians 1:23, and also with reference to the preceding verse, ὁ καυχ. ἐν κυρ. καυχάσθω) when I came to you, brethren, came, not with excellency of speech or wisdom announcing (pres. part., not fut., as in ref., and in Xen. Hell. ii. 1. 29, ἐς τὰς Ἀθήνας ἔπλευσεν ἀγγέλλουσα τὰ γεγονότα." 
2. "The time taken in the voyage is overlooked, and the announcement regarded as beginning when the voyage began) to you the testimony of (concerning) God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "No more fitting birthplace could there have been for the apostle of the Gentiles than Tarsus, free as it was from the warping influences of Rome, Alexandria, and Athens."
2. "Greek cultivation, Roman polity, and the divine law given to the Jews, combined just at Christ's time, to prepare the world for the Gospel."
3. "Christ is God, the testimony of God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The apostle here evidently alludes to that nice and studied choice of language; to those gracefully formed sentences, and to that skill of arrangement in discourse and argument which was so much an object of regard with the Greek rhetoricians."
2. "The testimony of God - The testimony or the witnessing which God has borne to the gospel of Christ by miracles, and by attending it everywhere with his presence and blessing."

### John Calvin:
1. "He allows therefore that he had not had any of the aids of human eloquence or wisdom to qualify him for producing any effect, but while he acknowledges himself to be destitute of such resources, he hints at the inference to be drawn from this — that the power of God shone the more illustriously in his ministry, from its standing in no need of such helps."
2. "This latter idea, however, he will be found bringing forward shortly afterwards. For the present he simply grants that he has nothing of human wisdom, and in the meantime reserves to himself this much — that he published the testimony of God."
3. "He now distinguishes between speech and wisdom (λόγον ἀπὸ τὢς σοφίας.) Hence what I noticed before (103) is here confirmed — that hitherto he has not been speaking of mere empty prattling, but has included the entire training of human learning."

3. "It was enough in plain words, and easy language, to declare it, with the evidence by which it was supported."
