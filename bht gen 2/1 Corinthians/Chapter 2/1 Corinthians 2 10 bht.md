### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The secrets of revelation are secret to some, not because those who know them will not reveal them (for indeed, the very notion of revelation implies an unveiling of what had been veiled), but because those to whom they are announced have not the will or power to comprehend them."
2. "Intelligent men may understand the outline of doctrines; but without the Holy Spirit's revelation to the heart, these will be to them a mere outline—a skeleton, correct perhaps, but wanting life."
3. "The Spirit delights to explore the infinite depths of His own divine mind, and then reveal them to us, according as we are capable of understanding them."

2. "The Holy Spirit has an intimate knowledge of all things. It is not to be supposed that he searches, or inquires as people do who are ignorant; but that he has an intimate and profound knowledge, such as is usually the result of a close and accurate search."
3. "The Spirit is omniscient. He searches or clearly understands 'all things' - the very definition of omniscience. He understands all the profound plans and counsels of God. And how can there be a higher demonstration of omniscience than to 'know God?' - But if omniscient, the Holy Spirit is divine - for this is one of the incommunicable attributes of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Searcheth [ερευνα] . See on John 5:39. Not, searcheth in order to discover; but of the ever active, accurate, careful sounding of the depths of God by the Spirit.

### John Calvin:
1. "Having shut up all mankind in blindness, and having taken away from the human intellect the power of attaining to a knowledge of God by its own resources, he now shows in what way believers are exempted from this blindness." 
2. "Hence the greater the bluntness of the human intellect for understanding the mysteries of God, and the greater the uncertainty under which it labors, so much the surer is our faith, which rests for its support on the revelation of God's Spirit."

2. "Note here the relation and interaction of ‘God’ and ‘the Spirit.’"
