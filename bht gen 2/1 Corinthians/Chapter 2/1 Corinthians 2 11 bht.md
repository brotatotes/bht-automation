# 1 Corinthians 2:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The thoughts and intentions of a person's heart can only be truly known by that individual, as no one else can probe the depths of their mind. Similarly, the things of God cannot be comprehended by humans unless revealed by the Spirit of God. Just as a person's own spirit is the only one that truly knows their innermost thoughts, the Spirit of God alone possesses the knowledge and understanding of the things of God. Thus, the Spirit of God is divine, having an intimate knowledge that surpasses all others.
