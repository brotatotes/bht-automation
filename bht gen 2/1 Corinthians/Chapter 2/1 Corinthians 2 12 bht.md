# 1 Corinthians 2:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Spirit we have received is not the spirit of the world, which everyone has. As Christians, we have received the Spirit of God, given to us as an illuminator, bringing faith, comfort, adoption, truth, and serving as a seal and an earnest of future glory. Through this Spirit, we come to know the things freely given to us by God, including justification, forgiveness, adoption, and eternal life. This knowledge is not merely intellectual, but it is experiential, transformative, and leads us to humility and obedience.
