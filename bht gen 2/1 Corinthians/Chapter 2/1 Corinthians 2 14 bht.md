# 1 Corinthians 2:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The natural man, devoid of spiritual perception, relies solely on his senses and natural understanding. Consequently, the things revealed by the Spirit of God are deemed foolishness to him, causing him to despise them. These truths can only be discerned through the Spirit and the spiritual senses which the unregenerate man lacks.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The animal man, as distinguished from the spiritual man, is he, whose governing principle and highest reference of all things is the ψυχή, the animal soul."
2. "The ψυχή is that side of the human soul, so to speak, which is turned towards the flesh, the world, the devil."
3. "He cannot know them (τὰ τοῦ πνεύματος, the matter of our spiritual teaching) because they are spiritually judged of."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The natural man...is governed by the animal soul, which overbears his spirit, which latter is without the Spirit of God." 
2. "The carnal man...is closely akin; so too the 'earthly.'"
3. "They [the things of God] are foolishness unto him—whereas he seeks 'wisdom'...neither can he...know them, and therefore has no wish to 'receive' them."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'natural' here stands opposed evidently to 'spiritual.' It denotes those who are governed and influenced by the natural instincts; the animal passions and desires, in opposition to those who are influenced by the Spirit of God."
2. "The passage here proves that while a man is thus sensual, the things of the Spirit will appear to him to be folly... It is a simple fact, that while he is intemperate, or licentious, or false, he can perceive no beauty in these doctrines."
3. "The disputed phrase, therefore, must be understood of all unregenerate persons, however free from gross sin, or eminent in intellectual attainment. Indeed it is the 'proud wisdom' of the world, and not its sensuality, that the apostle throughout has chiefly in view."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The contrast is between a man governed by the divine Spirit and one from whom that Spirit is absent."
2. "The man, therefore, whose cognition of truth depends solely upon his natural insight is yucikov natural, as contrasted with the spiritual man [πνευματικος] to whom divine insight is imparted."
3. "The apostle condemns all these impatient human praejudicia which anticipate the final judgment, reserving his case for the great tribunal, where at length all the evidence will be forthcoming and a satisfactory verdict can be given."

### John Calvin:
1. "He shows that we ought to make no account of a contempt of such a nature as proceeds from ignorance, and that it ought, consequently, to be no hindrance in the way of our going forward in the race of faith, unless perhaps we choose to shut our eyes upon the brightness of the sun, because it is not seen by the blind."
2. "In short, while ignorant persons depreciate the gospel, because they measure its value by the estimation in which it is held by men, Paul derives an argument from this for extolling more highly its dignity."
3. "Hence infer, that all mankind are by nature destitute of the Spirit of God: otherwise the argument would be inconclusive."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "With him 'the natural man' is he who in spiritual things has only his natural human faculties to guide him, without spiritual perception or apprehension, but not necessarily the slave of grovelling impulses."
2. "True it is, that all unrenewed, unspiritual men, even the best and most refined, being dominated by sensible things, may thus far be said to be under the dominion of the lower part of their nature; for the true capacities of their higher nature can only be drawn forth when they become 'new creatures.'"
3. "But it is an utter perversion of such statements to maintain, as fanatics do, that there is in the natural man any organic constitutional incapacity of spiritual perception, requiring to be created in them by the Holy Ghost. For maintaining this an eminent Lutheran professor of divinity, soon after Luther’s death, had to be deposed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The ψυχικος man is the unregenerate man while the πνευματικος man is the renewed man, born again of the Spirit of God."
2. "Certainly the initiative comes from God whose Holy Spirit makes it possible for us to accept the things of the Spirit of God."
3. "His helpless condition calls for pity in place of impatience on our part, though such an one usually poses as a paragon of wisdom and commiserates the deluded followers of Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "Not a babe in Christ, one that is newly born again, for though such have but little knowledge of spiritual things, yet they have a taste, and do relish and desire, and receive the sincere milk of the word, and grow thereby; but an unregenerate man, that has no knowledge at all of such things."
2. "Every man in a state of nature, who is as he was born, whatever may be the inward furniture of his mind, or his outward conduct of life, is but a natural man, and such an onereceiveth not the things of the Spirit of God..."
3. "They are looked upon by him as absurd, and contrary to reason; they do not agree with his taste, he disrelishes and rejects them as things insipid and distasteful; he regards them as the effects of a crazy brain, and the reveries of a distempered head."

### John Wesley:
1. "The natural man...has no other way of obtaining knowledge, but by his senses and natural understanding."
2. "The things revealed by the Spirit of God...are foolishness to him...he utterly despises them."
3. "They can only be discerned by the aid of that Spirit, and by those spiritual senses, which he has not."
