# 1 Corinthians 2:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The spiritual man possesses a deep understanding of the truths that the natural man is blind to. He can distinguish between the teachings that come from God and the inventions of man. He discerns not only spiritual matters but also the things that pertain to the natural man. However, the natural man lacks the ability to have a true knowledge of the spiritual man or to judge him rightly. Those who do not possess the Spirit cannot comprehend his thoughts or his words.
