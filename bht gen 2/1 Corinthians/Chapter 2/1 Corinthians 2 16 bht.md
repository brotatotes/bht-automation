# 1 Corinthians 2:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The ordinary man lacks the knowledge and understanding of the mind of the Lord, which is only known by the spiritual man. The spiritual man, including the apostles, possesses the mind of Christ, comprehending the divine wisdom and purposes of the gospel salvation. This distinction between natural and spiritual wisdom is significant, highlighting the necessity of divine revelation and discernment for true understanding. Isaiah 40:13 underscores the vastness and depth of God's understanding, emphasizing our reliance on His wisdom.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In order for an unassisted man, not gifted from Christ, to judge the πνευματικός, he must know the νοῦς κυρίου, the intent and disposition of Christ; yea more, must be able to teach, to instruct, Christ being not, as the πνευματικός, taught by Him, he must have an independent wisdom of his own, which Christ has not."
2. "But we (πνευματικοί, among whom he includes himself and the other Apostles) have (not a wisdom independent of Christ, nor do we know His mind, nor can we teach Him, but) the mind of Christ: the same mind, in our degree of apprehensiveness of it, by the imparting of His Spirit, which is in Him, and so can judge all things."
3. "The νοῦς κυρίου is the spiritual intent and designs of Christ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In order to judge the spiritual man, the ordinary man must 'know the mind of the Lord.' But 'who of ordinary men knows' that?"
2. "Natural men who judge spiritual men, living according to the mind of God ('We have the mind of Christ'), are virtually wishing to instruct God, and bring Him to another mind, as counsellors setting to right their king."
3. "We have the mind of Christ—in our degree of capability to apprehend it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The faith of Christians does not stand in the wisdom of man. Every Christian has evidence in his own heart, in his experience, and in the transformation of his character, that none but God could have made the change on his soul."
2. "The great mass of Christians are just as well satisfied of the truth of religion, as they are of their own existence; and that a Christian will die for his love to the Saviour, just as he will die for his wife, and children, and country."
3. "Christians have views of the beauties of religion, and have consolations arising from these views, which the world does not have."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Mind [νουν] . See on Romans 7:23. The understanding of the Lord. The divine counsels or purposes which are the results of the divine thought. See on Romans 11:34. Instruct [συμβιβασει] . See on proving, Acts 9:22. 

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul, by this interrogation, designs to teach that his secret counsel which is contained in the gospel is far removed from the understanding of men."
2. "He says, then, that the servants of the Lord are taught by the paramount authority of the Spirit, what is farthest removed from the judgment of the flesh, that they may speak fearlessly as from the mouth of the Lord."
3. "Calvin...views the expression, 'We have the mind of Christ,' as applicable to believers universally - 'believers are in possession of the Lord’s mind, because they have received not the spirit of this world, but that which has been given them by God, whereby they are instructed as to his otherwise incomprehensible goodness.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Though none can penetrate Jehovah’s mind, yet since in Christ are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge..."
2. "The contrast here so sharply drawn between Divine and human wisdom is far-reaching..."
3. "The deep diversities of Christendom cease to be stumbling. For the family of the spiritual dwell alone in the world."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The πνευματικος man is superior to others who attempt even to instruct God himself."
2. "Paul and all πνευματικο men are superior to those who try to shake their faith in Christ, the mystery of God."
3. "I know him whom I have believed. I believe; therefore I have spoken."

### John Gill:
1. "not any natural man, by the light of truth and strength of reason, has known any of these things."
2. "but the spiritual man, whom a natural man, being ignorant of the mind of the Lord, cannot instruct; and so the words give a very proper and sufficient reason why the spiritual man is not discerned, judged, convinced, and instructed by the natural man."
3. "we have the mind of Christ; the same with 'the mind of the Lord' which proves that Christ is the Lord, or Jehovah, and so truly and properly God."

### John Wesley:
1. Who — What natural man.We — Spiritual men; apostles in particular.Have — Know, understand.The mind of Christ — Concerning the whole plan of gospel salvation. Isaiah 40:13
