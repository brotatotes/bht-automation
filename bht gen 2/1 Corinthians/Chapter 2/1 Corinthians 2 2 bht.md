# 1 Corinthians 2:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul's unwavering focus was on proclaiming the knowledge of Jesus Christ and His crucifixion. He recognized that this message, though offensive to some, held the key to salvation. Paul deliberately excluded any other teachings or doctrines from his preaching, understanding that the power and wisdom of God were embodied in the person and office of Christ. By emphasizing the crucifixion, Paul sought to bring about the conversion of sinners and provide comfort to the distressed. It was through Christ's sacrifice on the cross that true faith and salvation could be found.

### Henry Alford:
1. "The only thing that I made it definitely my business to know, was" the Person of Jesus Christ and His Office as the crucified one.
2. "We must not overlook, that Paul does not say ‘to know any thing of or concerning Christ,’ but to know HIM HIMSELF, to preach HIM HIMSELF."
3. "It is universally CHRIST HIMSELF, the crucified and the risen One, who is the subject of preaching, and is also Wisdom itself: for His history evermore lives and repeats itself in the whole church and in every member of it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The only definite thing that I made it my business to know among you, was to know Jesus Christ (His person) and Him crucified (His office)" [ALFORD].
2. "The historical fact of Christ's crucifixion had probably been put less prominently forward by the seekers after human wisdom in the Corinthian church, to avoid offending learned heathens and Jews."
3. "Christ's person and Christ's office constitute the sum of the Gospel."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Paul made this resolution, knowing the special fondness of the Greeks for subtle disquisitions, and for graceful and finished elocution; that he formed it when his own mind, as we may judge from his writings, was strongly inclined by nature to an abstruse and metaphysical kind of discussion..."
2. "...he formed, and adhered to this resolution, though it might expose him to contempt; and though they might reject and despise his message."
3. "The preaching of the cross is the only kind of preaching that will be attended with success...there is a power about that kind of preaching which philosophy and human reason have not."

3. "No kind of knowledge was in my view of so much importance as to lead me to desire anything but Christ, crucified though he was."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He would not only know but one theme, but would hold that forth in precisely the light which he knew would prove the most repulsive to their fastidious ears and corrupt taste."
2. "For this being that in which every fact of His life has its explanations, and from which the whole principle of His work takes its character, he felt he could neither keep it back, nor soften it down."
3. "Yet this was no bravado. He was tremblingly alive to the possible effect of making this the pivot of His ministry."

3. "That which was the greatest offence to others was the most delightful to him, because salvation comes through and by the cross of Christ; and he dwelt upon this, and determined to do so; it being most for the glory of Christ, and what was owned for the conversion of sinners, the comfort of distressed minds, and is suitable food for faith, as he knew by his own experience."

### John Wesley:
