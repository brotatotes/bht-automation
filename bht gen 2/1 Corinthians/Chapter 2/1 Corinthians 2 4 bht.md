# 1 Corinthians 2:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
My words, whether in private conversations or public preaching, did not rely on clever and persuasive human wisdom. Instead, the Holy Spirit guided me to speak with a demonstration of His power. This demonstration, which originates from the Spirit, brings forth conviction and conviction with undeniable clarity and convincing evidence. It is not based on the wisdom of man, but on the divine intervention and working of the Spirit in the hearts of those who hear.

1. "And my speech and my preaching, the ‘message’ itself as well as its clothing, were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in the power of God."

3. "Of course, however, there is nothing here disparaging to the right use of human culture in the Christian ministry."

### John Gill:

2. "He [the apostle] made use of solid proofs out of the writings of the Old Testament, indited by the Spirit of God, and which amounted to a demonstration of the truths he delivered."

3. "which works on the conscience with the most convincing light, and the most persuasive evidence."
