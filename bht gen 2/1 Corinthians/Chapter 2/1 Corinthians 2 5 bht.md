# 1 Corinthians 2:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The origin and continuance of faith do not depend on human caprice, but rather on the power of God. Our faith should not stand or rely on the wisdom of men, but instead find its foundation and support in the power of God. Through the work of the Holy Spirit, faith is continuously begotten and sustained, proving that the religion we embrace is not from man, but from God. It is through this firm and solid demonstration of God's power that our faith in Him is strengthened and steadfast.
