# 1 Corinthians 2:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The wisdom that Paul and his fellow ministers preached was not folly, but the truest and most excellent wisdom. It was not a wisdom of this world or of the rulers of this world that come to nothing. Rather, it was a wisdom that went beyond the teachings of the world and encompassed the most sublime and abstruse parts of the Christian doctrine. This wisdom was not limited to the present age but belonged to the enduring and eternal.

3. "Paul does not mean by the 'mystery' or 'hidden wisdom' some hidden tradition distinct from the Gospel, but the unfolding of the treasures of knowledge, once hidden in God's counsels, but now announced to all, which would be intelligently comprehended in proportion as the hearer's inner life became perfectly transformed into the image of Christ."

### Albert Barnes:
