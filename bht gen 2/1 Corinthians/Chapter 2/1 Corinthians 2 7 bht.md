# 1 Corinthians 2:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Gospel contains the divine wisdom that surpasses the understanding of humanity. This wisdom, hidden throughout the ages and even now from those who are not in Christ, is a product of God's eternal plan. It is not a fleeting human invention, but a purpose predestined by God before the creation of the world. As believers, we are privileged to partake in this wisdom, which is destined to bring glory to us through the glory of our Lord.
