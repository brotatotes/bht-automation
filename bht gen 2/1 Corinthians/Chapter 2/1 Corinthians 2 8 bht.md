# 1 Corinthians 2:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The rulers of the world had no knowledge of the wisdom of God and were unaware of the prophecies about Jesus. If they had known and understood this wisdom, they would not have subjected the Lord of glory to a shameful death. It is important to note that in referring to Jesus as the Lord of glory, a title reserved for the divine, it becomes evident that he is indeed the supreme God. Consequently, their ignorance and subsequent persecution of Jesus can be seen as a display of their rejection of divine truth.
