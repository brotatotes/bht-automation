# 1 Corinthians 2:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The blessings of the Messiah's kingdom, which were previously unknown to the princes of this world, have been unveiled through the Gospel. These mysteries of the Gospel are not comprehended intellectually, but spiritually and savingly through the grace of God. Isaiah prophesied that no natural man can see, hear, or know the things that God has prepared for those who love Him. This fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy emphasizes the surpassing wisdom and hidden treasures of the Gospel that are now more clearly discerned by believers.
