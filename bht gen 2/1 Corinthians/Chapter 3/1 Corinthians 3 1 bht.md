# 1 Corinthians 3:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle was not able to speak to them as mature and spiritually-minded believers, but was compelled to address them as mere men of flesh. He acknowledged their lingering tendencies towards arrogance and pride, which made it difficult for them to fully embrace the simplicity of the gospel. They were like babes in Christ, still undeveloped in their spiritual understanding and unable to receive the deeper wisdom of God. While they had been enriched in gifts and knowledge, they were lacking in the maturity and growth that should have accompanied their faith.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He was compelled to speak to them as to men of flesh: not ὡς σαρκικοῖς, for that they really were, and he asserts them yet to be... I was obliged to regard you as mere men of flesh, without the Spirit: and it is not far different even now: ye are yet fleshly, ye retain the same character."
2. "Both the σάρκινοι, the mere men of the flesh, and the σαρκικοί, the carnally disposed, are included under the more general ψυχικοί, which therefore, as Meyer observes, is not here used, because this distinction was to be made."
3. "He speaks of his first visit to Corinth, when they were recently admitted into the faith of Christ, and excuses his merely elementary teaching by the fact that they then required it. Not this, but their still requiring it, is adduced as matter of blame to them."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And I—that is, as the natural (animal) man cannot receive, so I also could not speak unto you the deep things of God, as I would to the spiritual; but I was compelled to speak to you as I would to MEN OF FLESH."
2. "Carnal, or fleshly, implies not they were wholly natural or unregenerate, but that they had much of a carnal tendency; for example their divisions."
3. "He blames them for being still in a degree (not altogether), babes in Christ, when by this time they ought to have 'come unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Yet, they would recollect that he had not addressed them as such, but had confined himself to the more elementary parts of religion when he came among them."
2. "The reason was one that was most humbling to their pride; but it was the true reason, and faithfulness demanded that it should be stated."
3. "He refers here, doubtless, to his instructions when he founded the church at Corinth."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Carnal... made of flesh."
2. "Babes... strictly, non-speakers."
3. "Contrasted with perfect."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is probable, that in mercantile minds like theirs there was too much confidence and arrogance still lingering, so that it was not without much ado and great difficulty that they could bring themselves to embrace the simplicity of the gospel."
2. "He declares, that they belong to the company of those who, stupefied by carnal sense, are not prepared to receive the spiritual wisdom of God."
3. "They had still greatly too much of carnal sense, so that the flesh prevailed over the Spirit, and did as it were drown out his light."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Those in whom the spiritual principles, like the higher faculties in a babe, lie all undeveloped."
2. "Spiritual, indeed, they were, for they were "in Christ;" but it was only as babes, unfit to digest the 'strong meat' of that 'hidden wisdom'."
3. "The apostle longed to impart [wisdom] to them as soon as they should reach the stage of 'the perfect'."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "But as unto carnal (αλλ' ως σαρκινοις). Latin carneus. 'As men o' flesh,' Braid Scots; 'as worldlings,' Moffatt. This form in -ινος like λιθινος in 2 Corinthians 3:3 means the material of flesh, 'not on tablets of stone, but on fleshen tablets on hearts.'"
2. "It is not wrong to be σαρκινος, for we all live in the flesh (εν σαρκ, Galatians 2:20), but we are not to live according to the flesh (κατα σαρκα, Romans 8:12)."
3. "It is one of the tragedies of the minister's life that he has to keep on speaking to the church members 'as unto babes in Christ' (ως νηπιοις εν Χριστω), who actually glory in their long babyhood whereas they ought to be teachers of the gospel instead of belonging to the cradle roll."

### John Gill:
1. "They had carnal conceptions of things, were in carnal frames of soul, and walked in a carnal conversation with each other."
2. "Though babes and weaklings in it, they were believers in Christ, converted persons, yet children in understanding, knowledge, and experience."
3. "They were enriched in all utterance and knowledge, and in no gift came behind members of other churches."

### John Wesley:
1. "He spoke before, 1 Corinthians 2:1, of his entrance, now of his progress, among them."
2. "Could not speak to you as unto spiritual - Adult, experienced Christians."
3. "But as unto men who were still in great measure carnal, as unto babes in Christ - Still weak in grace, though eminent in gifts, 1 Corinthians 1:5."
