## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The œáŒ¨œÅŒπœÇ is not the peculiar grace of his apostleship for an apostle was not always required to lay the foundation, e.g. in Rome: but that given to him in common with all Christians (1Co 3:5), only in a degree proportioned to the work which God had for him to do."
2. "The proof of this skill is given, in his laying a foundation: the unskilful master-builder lays none, see Luke 6:49. The foundation (1Co 3:11) was and must be, JESUS CHRIST: the facts of redemption by Him (obj.), and the reception of Him and His work by faith (subj.)."
3. "·ºÑŒªŒªŒøœÇ, 'whoever comes after me,' another: not only Apollos. ·ºêœÄŒøŒπŒ∫ŒøŒ¥ŒøŒºŒµ·øñ, pres., as the necessary state and condition of the subsequent teacher, be he who he may. The building on, over the foundation, imports the carrying them onward in knowledge and intelligent faith."
