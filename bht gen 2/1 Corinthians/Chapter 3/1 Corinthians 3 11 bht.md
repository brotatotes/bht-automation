# 1 Corinthians 3:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ is the only true foundation upon which the Church is built. Any other foundation is insufficient and cannot stand. Paul emphasizes the importance of laying the foundation of faith in Christ alone, as he faithfully preached the doctrine of Jesus during his ministry. It is through Jesus that we learn the truth and find salvation. As believers, we must build upon this foundation, aligning our beliefs and actions with the teachings of Christ. He is the firm Rock of Ages, capable of bearing the weight of our faith and providing eternal security.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

2. "All who build on other foundations are not συνεργοὶ θεοῦ, nor is their building θεοῦ οἰκοδομή at all."
3. "JESUS HIMSELF (see var. readd.)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For other foundation can no man lay, than that which has (already) been laid (by God) Jesus Christ, the person, not the mere abstract doctrine about Him, though the latter also is included." 
2. "Jesus, GOD-SAVIOUR; Christ, MESSIAH or ANOINTED."

2. "Now the fundamental doctrine, which it were unlawful to undermine, is, that we learn Christ, for Christ is the only foundation of the Church."
3. "But as Paul’s ministry had contemplated rather the founding of the Corinthians than the raising up among them of the top-stone of the building, he merely shows here what he had done in respect of his having preached Christ in purity."

1. "For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ."

2. "Men ought to lay no other foundation than that which is laid by Jehovah the Father, who appointed Christ to be the Saviour and Redeemer of his people."
