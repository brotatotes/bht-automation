# 1 Corinthians 3:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A strong foundation, such as Jesus Christ, calls for teachings that are valuable, pure, and substantial, just like gold, silver, and precious stones. These teachings weigh heavy with truth and integrity. Conversely, teachings that lack substance, like wood, hay, and stubble, fall short. It is imperative to discern which teachings align with the grace of God, the person and work of Christ, and the transformative power of the Holy Spirit. By prioritizing sound doctrine, we can build a solid structure of faith that will withstand the test of time and exemplify the truth of God's Word.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Î´Î­ implies that though there can be but one foundation, there are many ways of building upon it."
2. "That gold, silver, &c., refer to the matter of the ministersâ€™ teaching, primarily; and by inference to those whom that teaching penetrates and builds up in Christ, who should be the living stones of the temple."
3. "That the builder of the worthless and unsubstantial is in the end SAVED: so that even his preaching was preaching of Christ, and he himself was in earnest."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The 'gold, silver, precious stones,' which all can withstand fire, are teachings that will stand the fiery test of judgment."
2. "Wood, hay, stubble are those which cannot stand it; not positive heresy, but teaching mixed up with human philosophy and Judaism, curious rather than useful."
3. "Where there is the least grain of real gold of faith, it shall never be lost."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The main discussion doubtless, has respect to the teachers of religion."
2. "It would be absurd to work them in with those which are valuable; it would be absurd to work in, in rearing a building, wood, and hay, and stubble, with gold, and silver, and precious stones; there would be a lack of concinnity and beauty in this."
3. "Those who are referred to may be building on the Lord Jesus, and may be true Christians. Yet there is much error among those who are not Christians."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He speaks of the body of truth and doctrine which different teachers may erect on the one true foundation - Jesus Christ."
2. "These [contributions] are not intended to represent specific forms of truth or of error, but none of them are to be regarded as anti-Christian, which would be inconsistent with building on the true foundation."
3. "The whole structure will be brought to a final and decisive test at the day of judgment, when the true value of each teacher's work shall be manifested, and that which is worthless shall be destroyed."

### John Calvin:
1. "He pursues still farther the metaphor. It would not have been enough to have laid the foundation if the entire superstructure did not correspond..." (17 words)
2. "By gold, then, and silver, and precious stones, he means doctrine worthy of Christ, and of such a nature as to be a superstructure corresponding to such a foundation." (34 words)
3. "He forewarns them that every manâ€™s work will one day be made manifest of what sort it is, however it may be for a time concealed..." (28 words)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The one set of materials as incombustible as they are valuable-represent those ministers of Christ whose teaching is sound and faithful; the other as inflammable as they are inferior in value represent those whose teaching is the reverse of the former." 
2. "The figure is an old biblical one, used in Psalms 118:22, 'The stone which the builders refused is become the head (stone) of the corner.' This our Lord appropriates to Himself, as rejected by the builders of His day (Matthew 21:42)." 
3. "Now, since in all these places the  foundation  is 'Jesus Christ,' it follows that what is 'built thereupon' must mean what is taught regarding Him considered as sound or unsound, wholesome or noxious."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The durable materials are three (gold, silver, marble or precious stones), perishable materials (pieces of wood, hay, stubble), 'of a palace on the one hand, of a mud hut on the other' (Lightfoot)."
2. "Gold was freely used by the ancients in their palaces. Their marble and granite pillars are still the wonder and despair of modern men."
3. "It is not made clear whether Paul's metaphor refers to the persons as in God's building in verse 1 Corinthians 3:9 or to the character of the teaching as in verse 1 Corinthians 3:13. Probably both ideas are involved."

### John Gill:
1. "The different materials laid by one and the same man, on this foundation, or the different doctrines advanced upon it, are some of them comparable to gold, silver, precious stones; for their intrinsic worth and value; for the purity and sincerity of them; for their weight, importance, solidity, and substantiality."
2. "Others are like to wood, hay, stubble; by which are meant, not heretical doctrines, damnable heresies, such as are diametrically opposite to, and overturn the foundation; but empty, trifling, useless things are meant; such as fables, endless genealogies, human traditions, Jewish rites and ceremonies."
3. "Everything that may now be advanced in the Gospel ministry, not so honourable to the grace of God, or so becoming the person, blood, and righteousness of Christ, nor so consistent with the Spirit's work of grace, may be meant hereby."

### John Wesley:
1. "Gold, silver, costly stones... true and solid doctrines."
2. "Wood, hay, stubble... all but the substantial, vital truths of Christianity."
