# 1 Corinthians 3:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The day of the Lord is approaching when the true nature of every man's work will be revealed. This testing will be fierce, like a consuming fire, exposing the quality of each person's work. The day will scrutinize our doctrines, separating what is solid and approved from what is inconsistent and false. Our work should not be like a flimsy building that crumbles in the face of fire, but rather, it should withstand the flames and stand firm in its righteousness.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "What every man has built on this foundation shall be seen. Whether he has held truth or error; whether he has had correct views of piety or false; whether what he has done has been what he should have done or not."
2. "The burning fires of that Day, Paul says, shall reveal the character of every man’s work, as fire sheds light on all around, and discloses the true nature of things."
3. "The power of fire to try or test the nature of metals, or other objects, is often referred to in the Scripture... It is not to be supposed here that the material fire of the last Day shall have any tendency to purify the soul, or to remove that which is unsound; but that the investigations and trials of the Judgment shall remove all that is evil, as fire acts with reference to gold and silver."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Apostle forewarns us, that it cannot always remain a secret who have acted fraudulently in the work of the Lord, or who have conducted themselves with fidelity, as though he had said: 'The darkness will not always remain: the light will one day break forth; which will make all things manifest.'"
2. "That night, however, will not always continue. For ambition is blind — man’s favor is blind — the world’s applause is blind, but this darkness God afterwards dispels in his own time."

3. "By the fire is meant, not the general conflagration of the world, when that, and all that is therein, will be burnt up; much less the fire of purgatory, the 'papists' dream of, for the punishment of evil actions; for the apostle is not speaking of the actions of men, good or bad, but of the doctrines of ministers."
