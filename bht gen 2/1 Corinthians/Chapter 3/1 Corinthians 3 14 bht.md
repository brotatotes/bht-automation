# 1 Corinthians 3:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The work done by ministers and believers will be tested by fire, determining its worth and whether it will endure. Those who have built upon the true foundation and have taught genuine and pure doctrines will receive a reward that goes beyond earthly accolades. This reward is not dependent on human estimation but on the judgment of heaven. The verses caution against relying on the empty praises of the world and emphasize the need to focus on the ultimate reward, which is given by Christ Himself.
