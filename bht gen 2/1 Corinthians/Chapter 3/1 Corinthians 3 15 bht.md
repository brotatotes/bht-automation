# 1 Corinthians 3:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The minister, though saved by grace through faith in Christ, may suffer a loss of reward for his labor in teaching potentially erroneous doctrines or promoting practices that are not in line with the gospel. His work, if it is found to be inconsistent or of little value, will be consumed by fire and disappear. However, his salvation remains secure, for it is based on the foundation of Christ. While he may experience the loss of his earthly efforts, he himself will be saved by God's eternal grace.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If his doctrines have not been true; if he has had mistaken views of piety; if he has nourished feelings which he thought were those of religion; and inculcated practices which, however well meant, are not such as the gospel produces; if he has fallen into error of opinion, feeling, practice, however conscientious, yet he shall suffer loss."
2. "He shall suffer loss - (...) This, compared with what he expected, may be regarded as a loss."
3. "The apostle all along has supposed that the true foundation was laid, and if that is laid, and the edifice is reared upon that, the person who does it shall be safe.
