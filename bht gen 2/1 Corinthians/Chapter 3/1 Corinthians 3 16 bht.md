# 1 Corinthians 3:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Christians, we are the temple of God, a dwelling place that is nobler than any other building. Just as the temple in Jerusalem was regarded as sacred and ensured safety for those who sought refuge there, we too are a temple where God dwells. The Holy Spirit now resides among us, just as God dwelled in the tabernacle and temple in the past. Let us remember that we are the sacred temple of God and strive to live pure and holy lives.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This building is now, as in Malachi 3:1, and as indeed by implication in the foregoing verses, the temple of God, the habitation of His Spirit."
2. "Are ye ignorant that... an expression of surprise arising out of their conduct."
3. "The temple of God is the temple of God, not a temple of God: for Paul does not conceive of the various churches as various temples of God, but of each Christian church as, sensu mystico, the temple of Jehovah."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Ye know and ought to remember, ye are the noblest kind of building, 'the temple of God.'"
2. "No literal 'temple' is recognized by the New Testament in the Christian Church. The only one is the spiritual temple, the whole body of believing worshippers in which the Holy Spirit dwells."
3. "God now too has His earthly temple, not one of wood and stone, but the congregation of believers, the 'living stones' on the 'spiritual house.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Christians are that building, the sacred temple which God had reared; and that, therefore, they should be pure and holy."
2. "The temple at Jerusalem was not only most magnificent, but was regarded as most sacred...Those who took refuge there were safe."
3. "As God dwelt formerly in the tabernacle, and afterward in the temple, so His Spirit now dwells among Christians."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Temple [ναος] . Or sanctuary. See on Matthew 4:5. Compare Ephesians 2:21; 2 Corinthians 6:16.

### John Calvin:
1. "It is sacrilege, then, if they give themselves up to the service of men."
2. "For this reason are ye the temples of God, because He dwells in you by his Spirit; for no unclean place can be the habitation of God."
3. "In this passage we have an explicit testimony for maintaining the divinity of the Holy Spirit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God?" - a sudden transition, apparently, from the teachers to the taught; yet this is more in appearance than reality. 
2. "For the transition is simply from warnings against a dangerous pandering in teachers to the corrupted taste of their hearers to warnings directed to those vitiated hearers themselves." 
3. "The word rendered 'temple' here means, classically, ‘the dwelling-place of a deity.’ In the New Testament, when applied to the temple of Jerusalem, it denotes the holy of holies that most sacred part of it where of old the Shechinah, or visible symbol of the Divine Presence, was manifested. As applied to believers under the new economy, it means that they are 'a habitation of God through the Spirit' (Ephesians 2:22)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Ye are a temple of God." 
2. "The Spirit of God makes his home in us."

### John Gill:
1. "The church is said to be the temple of God, because it is of his building, and in which he dwells."
2. "This furnishes out a considerable proof of the deity and distinct personality of the Spirit, since this is mentioned as an evidence of the saints being the temple of God, which would not be one, if the Spirit was not God, who dwells therein."
3. "Since he [the Spirit] is mentioned as distinct from God, whose Spirit he is, and dwelling, a personal action is ascribed to him, he must be a distinct divine person."

### John Wesley:
1. Ye — All Christians.Are the temple of God — The most noble kind of building, 1 Corinthians 3:9.
