# 1 Corinthians 3:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If anyone corrupts the teachings of God or leads others astray with false doctrines or divisions, they will face destruction from God. This destruction refers not only to punishment in the present life, but also in the afterlife. This warning is given because the temple of God, which represents the Christian believers, is sacred and set apart. Just as the temple in the Old Testament was holy, so must the body of Christ be kept pure and unblemished. Thus, those who defile or harm the community of believers will face judgment and condemnation.
