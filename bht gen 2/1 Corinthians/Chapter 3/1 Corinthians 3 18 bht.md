# 1 Corinthians 3:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let no man be deceived by the false hopes of escaping God's wrath for spreading error and discord. If anyone thinks they are wise by worldly standards, let them become a fool in the eyes of the world, so that they may truly become wise in the eyes of God. They must acknowledge their own folly, embrace the Gospel, submit to the teachings of Christ, and take up their cross. Only then can they attain true wisdom from God.
