# 1 Corinthians 3:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The wisdom of this world is nothing in comparison to the wisdom of God. The world may think highly of its own understanding, but God sees it as foolishness. He takes the wise in their own craftiness, using their own wisdom as a snare to catch them. This serves as a reminder that true wisdom comes from God, not from the wisdom of the world. We must be careful not to rely on our own understanding, but to seek God's wisdom and guidance in all things.
