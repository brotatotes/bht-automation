# 1 Corinthians 3:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle Paul describes how he fed the Corinthians with milk, representing the elementary truths of the Gospel. This milk consists of simple and easy-to-understand doctrines like repentance, faith, and the new birth. However, as believers mature in their faith, they are ready for solid food, which represents the deeper and more profound mysteries of the Gospel. Wise teachers, like Paul, adapt their teaching to the capacity of their audience, ensuring they start with foundational principles before delving into more complex truths. This approach allows for spiritual growth and a deeper understanding of God's Word.

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ is at once milk to babes, and strong meat to those that are of full age, the same truth of the gospel is administered to both, but so as to suit their capacity."
2. "Hence it is the part of a wise teacher to accommodate himself to the capacity of those whom he has undertaken to instruct, so that in dealing with the weak and ignorant, he begins with first principles, and does not go higher than they are able to follow."
3. "For ye were not yet able to bear it...they ought at least, in putting on Christ, to have put off the flesh; and thus we see that Paul complains that the success which his doctrine ought to have had was impeded."

2. "He prudently adapted things to their capacities, and that in perfect consistence with that faithfulness and integrity, for which he was so remarkable."
3. "The apostle seems to allude to the manner and custom of the Jews, in training up their children to learning; as to their age when they admit them scholars, their rule is this, 'according to the child's strength, and the make of his body, and less than six years of age they do not take any in.'"

### John Wesley:
1. I fed you, as babes, with milk - The first and plainest truths of the gospel. So should every preacher suit his doctrine to his hearers.
