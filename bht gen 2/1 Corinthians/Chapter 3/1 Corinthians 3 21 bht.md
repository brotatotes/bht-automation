# 1 Corinthians 3:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let no one boast or divide into factions based on their allegiance to different ministers. For the true object of glorying is in the Lord alone, not in fallible men. All things, including ministers themselves, are for the benefit and service of believers. So, do not idolize any minister or pin your faith on them, for they are your servants, not your lords.
