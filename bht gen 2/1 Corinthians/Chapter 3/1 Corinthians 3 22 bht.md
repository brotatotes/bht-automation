# 1 Corinthians 3:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As followers of Christ, we are reminded that we are all part of one body, with Christ as our sole master. The diversity of gifts within the Church serves the purpose of benefiting each other, rather than promoting division. The present circumstances, whether they bring trials or blessings, are all meant to promote our welfare and salvation. Our focus should not be on the leaders or parties, but rather on the unity and love that should characterize our relationships within the body of Christ. Let us not engage in unnecessary disputes, but instead be united in our common blessings.
