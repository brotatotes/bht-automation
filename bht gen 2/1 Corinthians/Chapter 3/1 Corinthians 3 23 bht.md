# 1 Corinthians 3:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
You belong to Christ, as his chosen people, his redeemed and beloved ones. And Christ himself belongs to God, as his Son and servant, who completes the will and purpose of his Father.

As we recognize our identity in Christ and submit ourselves to his authority, we can fulfill our purpose and bring glory to God.
