# 1 Corinthians 3:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Corinthians, although believers, are still influenced by the corrupt principles of the world, as shown by their divisions and conflicts. Their jealousy and strife stem from their fleshly desires, rather than the work of the Spirit in them. Instead of walking according to the Spirit and manifesting the wisdom of God, they conduct themselves in the same divisive manner as the unregenerate. The evidence of their carnality is seen in their envy, disputes, and the formation of factions. They continue to live as mere human beings, lacking the transformative power of the Spirit.

2. "The proof is derived from the effects; for as envying, and strifes, and divisions, are the fruits of the flesh, wherever they are seen, it is certain that the root is there in its rigor."
