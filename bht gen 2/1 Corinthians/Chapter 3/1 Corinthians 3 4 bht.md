# 1 Corinthians 3:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The mention of Paul and Apollos in this context points to the sectarian and divisive tendencies among the Corinthians. The idea is not to identify specific factions, but to highlight the worldly mindset prevalent among them. By addressing their carnality, the apostle reproves their depraved dispositions and undermines their empty talkativeness and ambition. The emphasis is on serving as opposed to leading parties. The Spirit of God rejects any form of party zeal, emphasizing the need for unity and cooperation. This serves as a reminder to prioritize Christ and His message above personal preferences or affiliations.
