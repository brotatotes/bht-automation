# 1 Corinthians 3:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The ministers mentioned in this passage are described as servants, not leaders or sources of their own authority. They were mere instruments through whom people came to believe in Christ. It is emphasized that the ability to bring others to faith comes from the Lord himself, as he gives to each person according to his will. This reminds us to recognize and honor God as the true source of all blessings and to view the ministers as humble servants carrying out the work of God.

1. "God is the fountain of all your blessings, and whoever may have been the 'instrument' by whom you have believed, it is improper to regard them as, in any sense the fountain of your blessings, or to arrange yourselves under their name."
2. "The original word Œ¥ŒπŒ±ÃÅŒ∫ŒøŒΩŒøŒπ diakonoi denotes properly 'servants' in contradistinction from 'masters'... and denotes those of course who are in an inferior rank of life... They did not have original authority, nor are they the source of influence or power."
3. "The idea here is, that they were the mere instruments or servants by whom God conveyed all blessings to the Corinthians; that they as ministers were on a level, were engaged in the same work, and that therefore, it was improper for them to form parties that should be called by their names."

### John Calvin:
1. "What else are all ministers appointed for, but to bring you to faith through means of their preaching?"
