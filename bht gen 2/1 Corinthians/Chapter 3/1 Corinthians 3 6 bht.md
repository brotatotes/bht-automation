# 1 Corinthians 3:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul, the first preacher in Corinth, faithfully planted the seeds of the Gospel and was instrumental in the conversion of many souls. Apollos, following Paul's work, watered and nurtured the growing church. Each minister has their own gifts, work, and usefulness in God's field. However, it is crucial to recognize that the success and increase of the church ultimately come from the Lord, who blesses the labors of His servants.
