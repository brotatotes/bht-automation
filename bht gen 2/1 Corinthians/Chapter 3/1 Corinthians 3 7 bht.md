# 1 Corinthians 3:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our contributions as believers, whether in planting or watering, pale in comparison to the significance of God's work. He alone is the source of growth and increase. In recognizing our dependence on Him, we acknowledge that our efforts are futile without His provision and empowerment. As we faithfully labor and serve, we must humbly acknowledge that it is only through God's grace and guidance that we can achieve anything of true value. All credit and glory belong to Him as the ultimate giver of growth and success in our lives and ministries.
