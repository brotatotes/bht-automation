# 1 Corinthians 3:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The ministers, though engaged in different aspects of their ministry, are united in purpose, serving the one Lord and working towards the same end. This unity should discourage divisions and factions among believers. Each minister is individually accountable for the results of their work and will be rewarded accordingly, not based on their success but on their faithful labor. This should encourage and uplift those who may face obstacles and discouragements in their service, reminding them that they are instruments in God's hands, relying on His blessing for fruitfulness.
