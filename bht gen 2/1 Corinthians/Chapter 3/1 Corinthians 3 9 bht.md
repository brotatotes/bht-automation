# 1 Corinthians 3:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The role of the ministers of the Gospel is not one of idleness, but of diligent work in God's vineyard. Their work is demanding, both physically and mentally. They are not only workers for God, but also with each other, collaboratively building and advancing the Kingdom. Similarly, believers in a church are God's dwelling place, a house carefully constructed by Him. Just as a field, garden, and vineyard are encompassed in the term 'husbandry,' so too are we encompassed in God's care as His laborers and His building.
