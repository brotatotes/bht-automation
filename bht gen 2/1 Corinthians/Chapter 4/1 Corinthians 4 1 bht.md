# 1 Corinthians 4:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Ministers of Christ are to be esteemed and honored for their works, as they are the servants and stewards who labor faithfully in preaching the Gospel and dispensing the mysteries of God. These ministers take great pains in their Lord's work, and it is important to pray for more of them to be found. Their role is one of great dignity, entrusted with the secret and hidden truths of the gospel, and they are to faithfully dispense these truths to others.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Church is the οἶκος θεοῦ and those appointed to minister in it are οἰκονόμοι, stewards and dispensers of the property and stores of the οἰκοδεσπότης."
2. "These last are the μυστήρια, hidden treasures, of God, i.e. the riches of his grace, now manifested in Christ."
3. "The best refutation of this is given by himself: 'sed cum ipse Paulus dixerit primo capite, Non misit me Christus baptizare, sed evangelizare, rectius est ut mysteria Dei intelligantur fidei nostræ dogmata.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Church is not the appendage to the priesthood; but the minister is the steward of God to the Church."
2. "The pagan (like the modern Romish) priest was rather to conceal than to explain 'the mysteries of God.' The minister's office is to 'preach'... the deep truths of God... so far as they have been revealed, and so far as his hearers are disposed to receive them."
3. "The Jewish religion made known to all the people the mysteries of their religion, while the pagans concealed from all but the 'initiated' few, the mysteries of theirs."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Let them form a true estimate of us and our office - not as the head of a faction; not as designing to form parties, but as unitedly and entirely the servants of Christ."
2. "The office of a minister of the gospel, and a steward of its mysteries, is to dispense such instructions, guidance, counsel, etc., as may be requisite to build up the church of Christ; to make known those sublime truths which are contained in the gospel, but which had not been made known before the revelation of Jesus Christ, and which are, therefore, called 'mysteries.'"
3. "Christians should endeavor to form and cherish just ideas of ministers; to give them their TRUE honor; but not to overrate their importance."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Ministers [υπηρετας] . See on officer, Matthew 5:25. Only here in Paul 's epistles. Stewards. See on Luke 16:1.

### John Calvin:
1. "In the first place, Paul describes the office of a pastor of the Church."
2. "For both of these things are exceedingly dangerous, because, when ministers are lowered, contempt of the word arises, while, on the other hand, if they are extolled beyond measure, they abuse liberty, and become “wanton against the Lord."
3. "By this he intimates, that their office extends no farther than this, that they are stewards of the mysteries of God. In other words, what the Lord has committed to their charge they deliver over to men from hand to hand."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Even as we received mercy not so much, mercy to 'put us into the ministry,' as mercy for the courageous discharge of it."
2. "We faint not."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

### John Gill:

3. "...they are to be regarded as stewards, the highest officers in the house of God; to whose care are committed the secret and hidden things of God..."

### John Wesley:
1. "The original word properly signifies such servants as laboured at the oar in rowing vessels; and, accordingly, intimates the pains which every faithful minister takes in his Lord's work."
