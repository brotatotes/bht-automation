# 1 Corinthians 4:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostles embraced the role of fools for the sake of Christ, willingly enduring reproach and persecution from the world. Meanwhile, the Corinthians prided themselves on their perceived wisdom in Christ, using it as a means to gain honor and acclaim in the eyes of society. Their desire to retain worldly commendation for their wisdom stood in stark contrast to the apostles' humble commitment to preaching Christ crucified. The Corinthians' pursuit of honor in the world displayed a misplaced understanding of true wisdom, while the apostles' willingness to be regarded as fools exemplified their unwavering devotion to Christ.
