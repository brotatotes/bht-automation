# 1 Corinthians 4:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Being reviled, we bless. Being persecuted, we endure. These words highlight the mindset and actions of true followers of Christ. Instead of retaliating or seeking revenge, they respond with blessings, even in the face of adversity. By enduring persecution and maintaining a spirit of patience and forgiveness, they demonstrate a deep trust in God's sovereignty and a willingness to follow in the footsteps of their Savior.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "As testimonies to Paul’s working with his own hands, see Acts 18:3; Acts 20:34; ch. 1 Corinthians 9:6; 1 Thessalonians 2:9; 2 Thessalonians 3:8."
2. "That the other Apostles did the same, need not necessarily be inferred from this passage, for he may be describing the state of all by himself as a sample; but it is conceivable, and indeed probable, that they did."
3. "‘So far are we from vindicating to ourselves places of earthly honour and distinction, that we tamely submit to reproach, persecution, and evil repute; nay, we return blessing, and patience, and soft words.’"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "working with our own hands—namely, 'even unto this present hour'".
2. "The undesignedness of the coincidence thus indirectly brought out is incompatible with forgery."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Being reviled - That they were often reviled or reproached, their history everywhere shows. They were reviled or ridiculed as Jews by the Gentiles; and jeered by all as 'Nazarenes,' and as deluded followers of Jesus; as the victims of a foolish superstition and enthusiasm."
2. "We bless - We return good for evil. In this they followed the explicit direction of the Saviour."
3. "Being persecuted - See the note at Matthew 5:11. We suffer it - We sustain it; we do not revenge it; we abstain from resenting or resisting it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Labor [κοπιωμεν] . Rev., toil. Unto weariness. See on Luke 5:5. Reviled [λοιδορουμενοι] . See on Acts 23:4. We bless [ευλογουμεν] . See on blessed, John 12:13. We suffer [ανεχομεθα] . Lit., we hold or bear up.

### John Calvin:
1. "He intimates that he is not merely afflicted and abased by God, by means of the cross, but is also endowed with a disposition to abase himself willingly."
2. "In this, perhaps, he gives a stroke to the false apostles, who were so effeminate and tender, that they could not bear to be touched even with your little finger."
3. "I do not merely gain a livelihood for myself by my own labor, but by mean labor, working with my own hands."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "and we toil, working with our own hands"
2. "Indeed he had to vindicate his liberty to preach at Corinth without hire"
3. "in order to do this he had to work for his own support"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Greeks despised manual labour; St. Paul glories in it" (Robertson and Plummer).
2. "Being reviled we bless" (λοιδορουμενο ευλογουμεν). Almost the language of Peter about Jesus (1 Peter 2:23) in harmony with the words of Jesus in Matthew 5:44; Luke 6:27.
3. "Being persecuted we endure" (διωκομενο ανεχομεθα). We hold back and do not retaliate. Turn to Paul's other picture of his experiences in the vivid contrasts in 2 Corinthians 4:7-10; 2 Corinthians 6:3-10 for an interpretation of his language here.

### John Gill:
1. "And labour, working with our own hands... to set an example of diligence and industry to others." 
2. "Being reviled, we bless... and the apostle himself directed and exhorted to." 
3. "Being persecuted, we suffer it... taking all in good part, as what is the will of God, and will make for his glory."

### John Wesley:
1. We bless-suffer it-intreat — We do not return revilings, persecution, defamation; nothing but blessing.
