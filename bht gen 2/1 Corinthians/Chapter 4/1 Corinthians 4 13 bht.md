# 1 Corinthians 4:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Being defamed and blasphemed, we entreat and pray for our detractors, asking God to convict them of their wrongdoing, grant them repentance, and forgive their sins. We are treated with contempt, regarded as the refuse of the world, like the vile and worthless individuals who were sacrificed as expiatory offerings. These sacrifices were subjected to curses and insults on their way to the altars, and our own lives are marked by curses, affronts, and injuries. Just as the ashes of those sacrifices were thrown into the sea, we are treated as an afterthought, discarded and despised.

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul, in adding the preposition περὶ (around) seems to have had an eye to the expiatory rite itself, inasmuch as those unhappy men who were devoted to execrations were led round through the streets, that they might carry away with them whatever there was of evil in any corner, that the cleansing might be the more complete."
2. "Paul, with the view of expressing his extreme degradation, says that he is held in abomination by the whole world, like a man set apart for expiation, and that, like offscourings, he is nauseous to all."
