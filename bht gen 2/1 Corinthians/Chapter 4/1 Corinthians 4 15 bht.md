# 1 Corinthians 4:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A spiritual father has a unique and intimate bond with their children, unlike any other relationship. The presence of numerous instructors does not diminish the special status and authority a spiritual father holds. The number of instructors may be exaggerated, but the truth remains that a spiritual father has a distinct right to guide and admonish. This relationship is rooted in the spiritual regeneration that occurs through the power of God, and it is through the proclamation of the gospel that individuals are brought into this special spiritual family.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He evidently shews by μυρίους, that these παιδαγωγοί were more in number than he could wish, including among them doubtless the false and party teachers."
2. "ἀλλ ʼ οὐ brings out the contrast strongly, giving almost the sense of ‘at non ideo.’"
3. "For in Christ Jesus (as the spiritual element in which the begetting took place: so commonly ἐν χριστῷ, applied to relations of life) by means of the gospel I begat you."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Ten thousand—implying that the Corinthians had more of them than was desirable."
2. "Instructors—tutors who had the care of rearing, but had not the rights, or peculiar affection, of the father, who alone had begotten them spiritually."
3. "In Christ—Paul admits that these 'instructors' were not mere legalists, but evangelical teachers."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It matters not how many you have, yet it is still true that I only sustain the relation to you of spiritual father, and whatever respect it is proper for you to have toward them, yet there is a special right which I have to admonish you."
2. "The authority which Paul claims here, is that which a father has in preference to such an instructor."
3. "I was the instrument of your conversion. Through the gospel - By means of the gospel; by preaching it to you, that is, by the truth."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Paedagogus was a slave to whom boys were entrusted on leaving the care of the females, which was somewhere about their sixteenth year."
2. "The office was one of general guardianship, not of instruction, though sometimes the paedagogus acted as teacher."
3. "He accompanied the boy to school, carrying his books, etc., and attended him to the gymnasium and elsewhere."

### John Calvin:
1. "He alone has begotten them in Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For if you should have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I begat you through the Gospel."
2. "Three agencies are named here as factors in conversion: Christ, as the proper Agent (through His Spirit); the Gospel, as the instrumental means; and the preacher who brings the message (in this case the apostle himself)."
3. "Every spiritual father will feel something of the jealousy here expressed, in relation to others who after him have dealings with his converts; and all the more, since any insensibility to or forgetfulness of what they owe to their spiritual father argues either decline in their spiritual life, or some unwholesome influences operating upon them."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "Tutors (παιδαγωγους). This old word (παις, boy, αγωγος, leader) was used for the guide or attendant of the child..."
