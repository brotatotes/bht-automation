# 1 Corinthians 4:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Some Corinthians are puffed up with their own talents and believe they can continue in their ways without consequence. Others are puffed up against their fellow believers, thinking they will never see the apostle Paul again to hold them accountable. The arrogant and sinful individuals among them believe that Paul would never come back to confront them for their actions. However, Paul is aware of their thoughts and uses his letter and the presence of Timothy to address their misconceptions.
