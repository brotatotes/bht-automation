# 1 Corinthians 4:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul expresses his determination to visit them soon and emphasizes that this decision is dependent on the will of the Lord. It is a reminder that all plans and purposes should be made with the knowledge that God can easily frustrate them if it is His will. Paul is not interested in the mere words of those who are puffed up, but in the power demonstrated in their ministry, wanting to see if they truly have the Spirit's power working through them.

3. "I desire to know is 'their power,' whether they be really powerful in the Spirit, or not."
