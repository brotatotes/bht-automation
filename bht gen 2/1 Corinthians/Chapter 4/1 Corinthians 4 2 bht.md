# 1 Corinthians 4:2 Commentary Help Text

Moreover, in the case of stewards, it is necessary for a man to be found faithful. This means that a minister should not only strive to please people or gain popularity, but rather be focused on preaching the pure Gospel of Christ without any human additions or personal agendas. A faithful steward is not driven by self-glory or the admiration of others, but rather seeks to honor Christ and serve the spiritual well-being of others.
