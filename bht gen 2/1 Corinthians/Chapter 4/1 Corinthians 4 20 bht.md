# 1 Corinthians 4:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The kingdom of God, or real religion, is not about empty talk or eloquence, but about the power of God reigning in the hearts of believers. It is not just the proclamation of words, but the life-transforming power of the Spirit. The Gospel, as a message from the King, is the means by which the kingdom of grace is established in the hearts of those who believe. This kingdom is not a realm of mere words, but it is marked by the power of the Holy Spirit, which brings dead sinners to life.
