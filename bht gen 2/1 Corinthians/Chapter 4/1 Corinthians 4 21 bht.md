# 1 Corinthians 4:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul presents the Corinthians with a choice: should he come to them with a rod of correction and discipline, or with love and a spirit of meekness? This choice reflects the apostle's ability to exercise authority and punishment when necessary, but also his desire to approach them with affection and gentleness. It is important for the Corinthians to understand the consequences of their actions and to respond accordingly, so that there may be no need for Paul to come to them with severity.
