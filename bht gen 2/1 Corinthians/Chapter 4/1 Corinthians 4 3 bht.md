# 1 Corinthians 4:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul declares that he does not hold his own opinion as the final judgment of his spiritual standing. He recognizes that his own judgment may be flawed or biased. Instead, he places his ultimate trust in God's judgment, acknowledging that the Lord alone has the authority and ability to judge him rightly. Paul's humility and reliance on God's judgment serve as a reminder for us to place our confidence in the Lord rather than in our own self-assessment.
