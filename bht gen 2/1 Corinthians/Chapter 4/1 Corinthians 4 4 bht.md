# 1 Corinthians 4:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Though Paul may not be aware of any wrong in his actions, he is not claiming his own righteousness as the means of justification. He recognizes that it is God who ultimately judges him, and his conscience alone is not enough to declare him innocent. Ultimately, it is God's judgment that matters and to whom he submits himself.

2. "I am not justified because I am not conscious of a failure in my duty. I know that God the judge may see imperfections where I see none. I know that I may be deceived; and therefore, I do not pronounce a judgment on myself as if it were infallible and final."
3. "By his judgment I am to abide; and by his judgment I am to receive my eternal sentence, and not by my own view of myself. He searcheth the hearts. He may see evil where I see none. I would not, therefore, be self-confident; but would, with humility, refer the whole case to him."
