# 1 Corinthians 4:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our understanding and judgments are limited, as we cannot see the hidden motives and intentions of the heart. Therefore, we should refrain from passing harsh and hasty opinions on others. Instead, we should await the coming of the Lord, who will fully reveal the hidden things of darkness and bring to light the secrets of our hearts. In that day, each individual will receive what is due to their character, and every faithful servant will receive praise from God.
