# 1 Corinthians 4:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For the sake of the church members, Paul uses himself, Apollos, and Cephas as illustrations to teach them proper understanding and respect. They should not idolize or diminish any preacher, recognizing that they are mere instruments in God's hands. Instead, they should be united in their common cause, not exalting anyone beyond what Scripture allows.
