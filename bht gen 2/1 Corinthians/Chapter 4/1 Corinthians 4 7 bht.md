# 1 Corinthians 4:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
All distinctions and differences among people are ordained by God himself. It is not by our own doing, but by his grace and mercy, that we receive any gifts or graces. We must not boast or think highly of ourselves, as if we have achieved these things on our own. We are all recipients of the blessings bestowed upon us by God.
