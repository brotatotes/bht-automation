# 1 Corinthians 4:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Corinthians were filled with self-complacency and arrogance, lacking humility and gratitude for the gifts they had received. They boasted of their own abundance and looked down upon the apostles who suffered and worked tirelessly for their sake. Meanwhile, the apostles desired that the Corinthians would truly excel in spiritual growth and maturity. They yearned to partake in the joy and glory of the Corinthians, not out of envy, but as fathers in Christ sharing in the spiritual prosperity of their children. The Corinthians' attitude reflects a common prideful mindset, renouncing the hope of true salvation.
