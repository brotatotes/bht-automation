# 1 Corinthians 4:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostles, despite being called last, were not objects of honor but of contempt and suffering. They were like a show presented to the world, observed not only by human beings but also by angels. Just as the spectacle in the amphitheater delighted in the suffering of the participants, so did the world witness the hardships endured by the apostles. This spectacle, encompassing both good and bad angels, was appointed by God to serve His divine purposes.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For us who were last called to be Apostles, God set forth before the eyes of the world, as persons condemned to death." 
2. "We have become a spectacle to the world, as well to angels as to men."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Paul tacitly implies that though 'last' and lowest in the world's judgment, Christ's servants are deemed by angels a spectacle worthy of their most intense regard." 
2. "The spectators (in the image drawn from the amphitheater) gaze at the show with savage delight, rather than with sympathy for the sufferers."
3. "The generality of the term 'angels,' and its frequent use in a good sense, as well as Ephesians 3:10; 1 Peter 1:12, incline me to include good as well as bad angels, though, for the reasons stated above, the bad may be principally meant."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Whatever might be their condition, Paul says that the condition of himself and his fellow-laborers was one of much contempt and suffering; and the inference seems to be, that they ought to doubt whether they were in a right state, or had any occasion for their self-congratulation, since they so little resembled those whom God had set forth."
2. "Paul represents himself as on this arena or stage, contending with foes, and destined to death. Around him and above him are an immense host of human beings and angels, looking on at the conflict, and awaiting the issue. He is not alone or unobserved."
3. "The whole verse is designed to convey the idea that God had, for wise purposes, appointed them in the sight of the universe, to pains, and trials, and persecutions, and poverty, and want, which would terminate only in their death."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "You have come to reign, but the case is very different with us, for I think, etc."
2. "The vast range of an amphitheatre under the open sky, well represents the magnificent vision of all created things, from men up to angels, gazing on the dreadful death-struggle..."
3. "This comprehensive use of the word kosmos is remarkable...the apostle uses it of the spiritual as well as the physical totality of existence."

### John Calvin:
1. "Should any one be inclined to extend it farther, I shall have no particular objection, provided only he does not understand it as Chrysostom does, to mean that the apostles were as if for the sake of ignominy reserved to the last place."
2. "For such is the meaning of the word exhibited ‚Äî as those who on occasion of a triumph were led round for the sake of show, and were afterwards hurried away to prison to be strangled."
3. "Observe here the admirable steadfastness of Paul, who, while he saw himself to be dealt with by God in this manner, was nevertheless not broken or dispirited."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "God hath set forth us the apostles last of all, as men doomed to death ... a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men." 
2. "To exhibit men's enmity to the truth."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In this grand pageant Paul and other apostles come last (ŒµœÉœáŒ±œÑŒøœÖœÇ, predicate accusative after Œ±œÄŒµŒ¥ŒµŒπŒæŒµŒΩ) as a grand finale."
2. "The gladiators would say morituri salutamus. All this in violent contrast to the kingly Messianic pretensions of the Corinthians."
3. "Here the spectators include 'the world, both to angels and men' (œÑœâ Œ∫ŒøœÉŒºœâ Œ∫Œ± Œ±Œ≥Œ≥ŒµŒªŒøŒπœÇ Œ∫Œ± Œ±ŒΩŒ∏œÅœâœÄŒøŒπœÇ), dative case of personal interest."

"God hath set forth us last, as appointed to death" - Alluding to the Roman custom of bringing forth those persons last on the stage, either to fight with each other, or with wild beasts, who were devoted to death; so that, if they escaped one day, they were brought out again and again, till they were killed.
