# 1 Corinthians 5:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Corinthians were not only divided in their allegiance to ministers, but they also allowed immoral behavior to take place among them without reproof. This included a reprehensible act that even the Gentiles would consider abhorrent - a man having a sexual relationship with his stepmother while his father was still alive. It is important to note that the term fornication here encompasses all forms of illicit sexual activity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "the character of   πόρνος  is borne (by some) among you, fornication is borne as a character among you"
2. "And fornication of such a sort (the καί rises in a climax, there being an ellipsis of οὐ μόνον …‚ ἀλλὰ … before it; so Aristoph. Ran. 116, ὦ σχέτλιε , τολμήσεις γὰρ ἰέναι καὶ σύ γε ? see Hartung, Partikellehre, i. 134),  as (is) not (borne as a character)  even among the heathen."
3. "So that one among yon has (  as wife most probably, not merely  as concubine : the word ἔχω in such cases universally in the N. T. signifying  to possess in marriage"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is reported," implies, that the Corinthians, though they "wrote" to Paul on other points, gave him no information on those things which bore against themselves.
2. The oldest manuscripts and authorities omit "named": "Fornication of such a gross kind as (exists) not even among the heathen, so that one (of you) hath (in concubinage) his father's wife," that is, his stepmother, while his father is still alive. She was perhaps a heathen, for which reason he does not direct his rebuke against her.
3. ALFORD thinks "have" means have in marriage: but the connection is called "fornication," and neither Christian nor Gentile law would have sanctioned such a marriage, however Corinth's notorious profligacy might wink at the concubinage.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That rumor had been brought to Paul, probably by the members of the family of Chloe." 
2. "This greatly aggravated the offence, that in a Christian church a crime should be tolerated among its members which even gross pagans would regard with abhorrence."
3. "Whitby supposes that this offence that was tolerated in the church at Corinth gave rise to the scandals that were circulated among the pagan respecting the early Christians, that they allowed of licentious contact among the members of their churches."

1. "Ecein to have is commonly used in the New Testament of marriage."

### John Calvin:
1. "First of all, he shows them what enormous wickedness it is to allow one of their society to have an illicit connection with his mother-in-law."
2. "When, therefore, he affirms that it was not named among the Gentiles, he does not mean by this, that no such thing had ever existed among them, or was not recorded in their annals, for even tragedies have been founded upon it; but that it was held in detestation by the Gentiles, as a shameful and abominable monstrosity, for it is a beastly lust, which destroys even natural modesty."
3. "The Corinthians are accused, not because one of their number has sinned, but because, as is stated afterwards, they encouraged by connivance a crime that was deserving of the severest punishment."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word is used here in its widest sense for all violations of the seventh commandment."

3. "The Corinthian Christians were actually trying to win pagans to Christ and living more loosely than the Corinthian heathen among whom the very word 'Corinthianize' meant to live in sexual wantonness and license."

### John Gill:

2. "It was done among them; not only by one of their citizens, nor merely by one of their hearers, but by one of their members, and so was cognizable by them as a church."
