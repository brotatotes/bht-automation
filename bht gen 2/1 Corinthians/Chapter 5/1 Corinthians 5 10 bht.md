# 1 Corinthians 5:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We are not to make fornicators our companions and friends, but we are not prohibited from having any kind of civil conversation with them, as it is impossible to avoid interaction with those guilty of such sins in the unbelieving world. While it is important to separate ourselves and not be corrupted by their example, complete withdrawal from society would hinder our ability to support our families and be a light in the world. Thus, we are called to discern and maintain a balance between separation and engagement with the world.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "οὐ πάντως limits the prohibition, which perhaps had been complained of owing to its strictness, and the impossibility of complying with it in so dissolute a place as Corinth, and excepts the fornicators of this world, i.e. who are not professing Christians."
2. "οὐ, not μή, because not the whole context of the prohibition is negatived, but only one portion of it, and thus οὐ πάντως τ. π. τ. κός. τ. stands together as one idea."
3. "πλεονέκταις and ἅρπαξιν are joined by καί, as belonging to the same class that of covetous persons; πλεονέκτης being an avaricious person, not a lascivious one, as sometimes rendered."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "As in dissolute Corinth to 'company with no fornicators,' c., would be almost to company with none in the (unbelieving) world”.
2. "Ye need not utterly ('altogether') forego intercourse with fornicators, c., of the unbelieving world”.
3. "The attempt to get 'out of the world,' in violation of God's will that believers should remain in it but keep themselves from its evil, led to monasticism and its consequent evils".

### Albert Barnes:
1. "You are not to make them companions and friends."
2. "We are to be separate; and are to be connected with them only in those things which we may have 'in common' with them; and which are not inconsistent with the holy rules of the Christian religion."
3. "We are not so to associate with them as to be corrupted by their example; or so as to be led by that example to neglect prayer and the sanctuary, and the deeds of charity, and the effort to do good to the souls of people."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "This is the earliest known instance of the use of the word." 
2. "New-Testament usage does not confine the term to the worship of images, but extends it to the soul's devotion to any object which usurps the place of God."

### John Calvin:
1. "We must live among thorns so long as we sojourn on earth...you do not keep company with fornicators, who wish to be regarded as brethren."
2. "Paul here took for granted what was true — that, where there is the power of excommunication, there is an easy remedy for effecting a separation between the good and the bad if Churches do their duty."
3. "What need have you of an injunction as to the children of this world, for having once for all renounced the world, it becomes you to stand aloof from their society."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Observe the caution 'not altogether' restricting the allowed intercourse with them to what was necessary and safe."
2. "The collocation of 'the covetous and extortioners' with 'fornicators and idolaters' sounds strange to us; but it is a favourite classification with our apostle (Ephesians 5:3; Colossians 3:5)."
3. "Perhaps the explanation of this may be found in Galatians 5:19-21, where these are all ranked under the head of 'works of the flesh,' any one of which might, according to individual bent, stir up another."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul thus puts a limitation on his prohibition and confines it to members of the church."
2. "Bandits, hijackers, grafters they would be called today."
3. "This neat Greek idiom of επε with the imperfect indicative (ωφειλετε, from οφειλω, to be under obligation) is really the conclusion of a second-class condition with the condition unexpressed."

### John Gill:
1. "His former prohibition of keeping company with fornicators was not to be understood as referring to such persons as were, out of the church, as if no sort of civil conversation and commerce were to be had with men of such, and the like infamous characters..."
2. "...since the world abounded with men guilty of these several vices, all kind of civil correspondence with them could not be avoided..."
3. "...if all trade and conversation with them were to be forbidden, the families of God's people could never be supported, nor the interest of religion maintained; a stop would soon be put to worldly business, and saints would have little or nothing to do in the world..."

### John Wesley:
1. "But I did not mean that you should altogether refrain from conversing with heathens, though they are guilty in some of these respects."
2. "Then all civil commerce must cease. So that going out of the world, which some account a perfection, St. Paul accounts an utter absurdity."
