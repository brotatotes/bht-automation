# 1 Corinthians 5:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the apostle instructs not to keep company with certain individuals, he specifically refers to those who are called brothers, fellow Christians, who have been received into the church. This prohibition is important for upholding the honor of the faith and preventing the weak from stumbling. Additionally, not eating with such individuals is meant to bring them to shame and encourage repentance, as it signifies the lowest degree of familiarity.
