# 1 Corinthians 5:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christians should focus on judging and disciplining those within their own community, rather than concerning themselves with passing judgment on unbelievers outside the Church. It is within the Church's jurisdiction to exercise discipline and to separate from unworthy individuals within their own ranks. God, on the other hand, will judge those outside the Church, including even the devil himself. Therefore, Christians should turn their attention to their own conduct and the proper exercise of discipline within the Church, leaving the judgment of those outside to God.
