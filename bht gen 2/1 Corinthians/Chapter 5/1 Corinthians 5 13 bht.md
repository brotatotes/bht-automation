# 1 Corinthians 5:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Put away from among yourselves that wicked person. The exercise of discipline belongs to the Church itself, and it is important not to tolerate wicked persons. By expelling the offender, God's judgment and punishment will be served for their actions. The saints have the duty to watch over one another and reprove when necessary. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the church to take away that wicked person from their midst.
