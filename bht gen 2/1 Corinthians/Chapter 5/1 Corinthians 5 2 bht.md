# 1 Corinthians 5:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They should have recognized the seriousness of the situation and mourned over the sin committed. Instead, they embraced pride and failed to grieve over the presence of such wickedness in their midst. It was their duty as a church to mourn over the faults of their members and take immediate action to remove the offender from their community. The gravity of the sin demanded a response that would demonstrate their commitment to purity and godliness.
