# 1 Corinthians 5:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul, though absent in person, declares his judgment as if he were present and had witnessed the scandalous act firsthand. He firmly resolves to take action against the offender and exercises his apostolic authority to deliver him over to the adversary. This severe discipline is not meant to destroy the individual but to correct and protect the sanctity of the church. It is in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that such just discipline should be administered, whether it involves binding or loosing.
