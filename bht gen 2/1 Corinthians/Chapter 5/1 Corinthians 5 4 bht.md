## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It was a delegation to the Corinthian church of a special power, reserved to the Apostles themselves, of inflicting corporeal death or disease as a punishment for sin."
2. "What the ὄλεθρος τ . σαρκός was to be, does not appear: certainly more than the mere destruction of his pride and lust by repentance, as some suppose."
3. "Paul could not say ὄλεθρον τοῦ σώματος, seeing that the body is to partake of the salvation of the spirit; but not the σάρξ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Join this with 'to deliver such a one unto Satan.' The clause... stands in a parenthesis between. Paul speaking of himself uses the word 'spirit'; of Christ, 'power.' Christ's power was promised to be present with HIS Church." 
2. "Here Paul by inspiration gives a special promise of his apostolic spirit, which in such cases was guided by the Holy Spirit, ratifying their decree passed according to his judgment."
3. "This power of infallible judgment was limited to the apostles; for they alone had the power of working miracles as their credentials to attest their infallibility."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The authority to administer discipline is derived from the Lord Jesus Christ, and is to be exercised in his name, and to promote his honor."
2. "This passage proves that discipline belongs to the church itself; and so deep was Paul’s conviction of this, that even he would not administer it, without their concurrence and action."
3. "The miraculous power which will be evinced in the case will proceed from the Lord Jesus... for the preservation of the purity of his church."

### John Calvin:
1. "He, it is true, takes the lead, and shows the way, but, in taking others as his associates, he intimates with sufficient plainness, that this authority does not belong to any one individual."
2. "Let us take notice, then, that in excommunicating this limitation be observed — that this part of discipline be exercised by the common counsel of the elders, and with the consent of the people, and that this is a remedy in opposition to tyranny."
3. "Then only do men make an auspicious commencement of anything that they take in hand to do, when they with their heart call upon the Lord that they may be governed by his Spirit, and that their plans may, by his grace, be directed to a happy issue."

### John Gill:
1. "It would be done 'in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ'; by his command, power, and authority, and for his glory."
2. "When ye are gathered together... to acknowledge the justice of God in it, and that they might fear and take warning by it."
3. "The extraordinary gift of the Spirit of God bestowed on him would be visibly exercised upon this man before them all, as if he himself was in the midst of them."

### John Wesley:
1. And my spirit — Present with you.With the power of the Lord Jesus Christ — To confirm my sentence.
