# 1 Corinthians 5:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By delivering such an offender to Satan, Paul exercises his apostolic authority to inflict the highest form of punishment in the Christian church. It is important to note that this decision was made by Paul himself, not the Corinthians. By doing so, Satan is permitted to afflict the individual with pain or sickness, serving as a means to bring about their repentance and restoration. If the offender does not quickly repent, there is a risk of their flesh facing gradual destruction. Therefore, the purpose of this severe discipline is to ultimately bring about repentance and salvation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The aim of the ὄλεθρ . τ . σαρ ., which he said ἤδη τῷ διαβόλῳ νόμους τιθείς, καὶ οὐκ ἀφιεὶς αὐτὸν περαιτέρω προβῆναι, as Chrys. p. 128."
2. "Thus the proposed punishment, severe as it might seem, would be in reality a merciful one, tending to the eternal happiness of the offender."
3. "The delivering to Satan for the destruction of the spirit can belong only to those who do the work of Satan."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Besides excommunication (of which the Corinthians themselves had the power), Paul delegates here to the Corinthian Church his own special power as an apostle, of inflicting corporeal disease or death in punishment for sin."
2. "Satan receives power at times to try the godly, as Job and Paul, much more the ungodly."
3. "The 'destruction of the flesh' answers to 'mortify the deeds of the body,' only that the latter is done by one's self, the former is effected by chastisement from God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There is some foundation for this opinion; and there can be no doubt that excommunication is here intended, and that, by excommunication, the offender was in some sense placed under the control of Satan."
2. "It may be observed here that though this was to be done by the concurrence of the church, as having a right to administer discipline, yet it was directed by apostolic authority; and there is no evidence that this was the usual form of excommunication, nor ought it now to be used."
3. "That his soul might be saved; that he might be corrected, humbled, and reformed by these sufferings, and recalled to the paths of piety and virtue. This expresses the true design of the discipline of the church, and it ought never to be inflicted but with a direct intention to benefit the offender, and to save the soul."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "It implies excommunication from the Church."
2. "That casting the offender out of the Church involved casting him back into the heathen world, which Paul habitually conceives as under the power of Satan."
3. "That Paul has in view the reformation of the offender: 'that the spirit may be saved,' etc. This reformation is to be through affliction, disease, pain, or loss, which also he is wont to conceive as Satan's work."

### John Calvin:
1. "To deliver over to Satan wicked and obstinate persons, and made use of him as a scourge to correct them..."
2. "Delivering over to Satan is an appropriate expression for denoting excommunication..."
3. "The destruction of the flesh is opposed to the salvation of the spirit, simply because the former is temporal and the latter is eternal."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul certainly means expulsion from the church... But we are not to infer that expulsion from the local church means the damnation of the offender."
2. "Both for physical suffering... and for conquest of the fleshly sins, remedial punishment."
3. "The ultimate purpose of the expulsion as discipline... The final salvation of the man in the day of Christ is the goal and this is to be attained not by condoning his sin."

### John Gill:
1. "To deliver such an one unto Satan... This was an act of his own, and peculiar to him as an apostle."
2. "That his body might be shook, buffeted, afflicted, and tortured in a terrible manner; that by this means he might be brought to a sense of his sin, to repentance for it, and make an humble acknowledgment of it."
3. "The phrase seems to be Jewish, and to express that extraordinary power the apostles had in those days, as well in giving up the bodies to Satan, for a temporal chastisement, as in delivering them from him."

### John Wesley:
1. "To deliver such an one — This was the highest degree of punishment in the Christian church; and we may observe, the passing this sentence was the act of the apostle, not of the Corinthians."
2. "Who was usually permitted, in such cases, to inflict pain or sickness on the offender."
3. "Though slowly and gradually.Of the flesh — Unless prevented by speedy repentance."
