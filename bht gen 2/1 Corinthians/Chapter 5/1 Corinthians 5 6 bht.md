# 1 Corinthians 5:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Your prideful boasting in your own accomplishments and the prosperity of your church is highly inappropriate, especially considering the presence of such a grave sin among you. Just as a little bit of leaven can permeate and affect the entire lump of dough, so too can a single sin indulged in or tolerated within the church corrupt the entire community. Do not underestimate the contagious nature of sin and its potential to spread and infect others, causing harm and leading to the downfall of many.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "How inconsistent with your harbouring such an one, appear your high-flown conceits of yourselves!" 
2. "Are you not aware that a little leaven imparts a character to the whole lump?" 
3. "One of them was a fornicator of a fearfully depraved kind, tolerated and harboured: by this fact, the character of the whole was tainted."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Your glorying in your own attainments and those of your favorite teachers, while all the while ye connive at such a scandal, is quite unseemly."
2. "A little leaven leaveth whole lump, namely, with present complicity in the guilt, and the danger of future contagion."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "If all individual Christians, and all Christian churches, and all people of every rank and condition, would look at things as they are, they would never find occasion for boasting."
3. "A single sin indulged in, or allowed in the church, would act like leaven - it would pervade and corrupt the whole church, unless it was removed."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Glorying [καυχημα]. Not the act, but the subject of boasting; namely, the condition of the Corinthian church."
2. "Lump [φυραμα]. A significant term, suggesting the oneness of the Church, and the consequent danger from evil-doers."

### John Calvin:

3. "For this proverb has in this passage the same meaning as... There needs but one diseased sheep to infect a whole flock."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lamp?" - 'Tis only one case, ye say; but are ye so ignorant as not to know that the communicative properties of good and evil are as leaven (Matthew 13:3; Matthew 5:13; 1 Corinthians 15:33), and that the leavening property of evil is greater than that of good?’
2. "One sinner destroyeth much good." - In a church gathered, like that of Corinth, out of a proverbially licentious city, and themselves before conversion no better than others (1 Corinthians 6:9-11), how dangerous the presence of such an offender, going out and in among them in full fellowship, must be obvious to everyone.

2. "Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?... It increases to more ungodliness; or to vice and immorality... will endanger the whole community."
3. "It may spread by example, and, under the connivance of the church, to the corrupting of good manners, and infecting of many."

### John Wesley:
1. "Your glorying — Either in your gifts or prosperity, at such a time as this, is not good."
