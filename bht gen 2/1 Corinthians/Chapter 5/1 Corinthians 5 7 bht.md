# 1 Corinthians 5:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Corinthians are urged to remove not only sinful individuals but also sin itself, purging out the old leaven. The goal is for them to be transformed into a new and holy community, unleavened and dedicated to the Lord. This transformation is made possible by the sacrificial death of Christ, our true Passover, who fulfilled the symbolism of the Jewish passover. The apostle skillfully transitions from addressing the specific issue of the incestuous person to the central message of the crucified Savior, emphasizing the propriety and delicacy of introducing such a profound subject in this context.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "The ordinances of the old law are to him not points on whose actual observance to ground spiritual lessons, but things passed away in their literal acceptance, and become spiritual verities in Christ."
3. "Let us keep the feast not in the old leaven (general our old unconverted state), nor in the leaven of vice and wickedness, but in the unleavenedness of sincerity and truth."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The apostle here takes occasion, from the mention of leaven, to exhort the Corinthians to put away vice and sin."
2. "The doctrine is, that Christians are by their profession holy, and that therefore they ought to give all diligence to remove everything that is impure."
3. "As the Jews, when their paschal lamb was slain, gave great diligence to put away all leaven from their dwellings, so we Christians, since our passover is slain, ought to give the like diligence to remove all that is impure and corrupting from our hearts."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Leaven. Not the sinful man, but evil of every kind, in accordance with the more general statement of the leavening power of evil in ver. 6."

3. "Our Passover also is (Gr. 'was,' or 'hath been') sacrificed, even Christ...we are 'redeemed with the precious blood of Christ,' the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world; their redemption was merely national and temporal, ours is world-wide and eternal."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

1. "Purge out therefore the old leaven — Both of sinners and of sin." 
2. "That ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened — That is, that being unleavened ye may be a new lump, holy unto the Lord."
3. "For our passover is slain for us — The Jewish passover, about the time of which this epistle was wrote, 1 Corinthians 5:11, was only a type of this. What exquisite skill both here and everywhere conducts the zeal of the inspired writer! How surprising a transition is here, and yet how perfectly natural! The apostle, speaking of the incestuous criminal, slides into his darling topic, - crucified Saviour. Who would have expected it on such an occasion. Yet, when it is thus brought in, who does not see and admire both the propriety of the subject, and the delicacy of its introduction?"
