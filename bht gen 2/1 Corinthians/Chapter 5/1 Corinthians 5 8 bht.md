2. "malice—the opposite of 'sincerity,' which allows no leaven of evil to be mixed up with good (Matthew 16:6)."
3. "wickedness—the opposite of 'truth,' which allows not evil to be mistaken for good."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "As the Jews when they celebrated the paschal supper, on the slaying and sacrifice of the paschal lamb, put away all leaven...so let us...put away all wickedness from our hearts as individuals, and from our societies and churches." 
2. "Not under the influence, or in the indulgence of the feelings of corrupt and unrenewed human nature...the leaven of malice...and wickedness."
3. "Let us be sincere, and true, and faithful...as the Jews partook of bread unleavened, which was emblematic of purity, so let us be sincere and true."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Let us keep the feast [εορταζωμεν]." 
2. "Sincerity [ειλικρινειας]."
3. "Truth...Sincerity takes care not to admit evil with the good; truth, not to admit evil instead of good."

### John Calvin:
1. "If, therefore, we would wish to feed on Christ’s flesh and blood, let us bring to this feast sincerity and truth... Away with all malice and wickedness, for it is unlawful to mix up leaven with the passover." 
2. "In the meantime we must carefully observe this passage, as showing that the ancient passover was not merely μνημοσυνον, a memorial of a past benefit, but also a sacrament, representing Christ who was to come, from whom we have this privilege, that we pass from death to life."
3. "For Paul does not teach that Christ is offered daily, but that the sacrifice having been offered up once for all, it remains that the spiritual feast be celebrated during our whole life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Therefore let us keep the feast 'keep festival' as the word signifies. As the Passover meal was designed to strengthen the Israelites for their wilderness journey, so is this for ours heavenward."
2. "What a sublime idea does this give of the Christian life, as a lifelong Paschal celebration of our 'eternal redemption' by the sacrificial death of the Lord Jesus!"
3. "But since the injunction to keep aloof from this offender might be misunderstood, as applying equally to all the unholy, the apostle now draws a sharp distinction between those within and those without the Church; instructing them, that while keeping no company at all with the former, they were not with the latter to decline the ordinary intercourses and courtesies of life."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Let us keep on keeping the feast, a perpetual feast, and keep the leaven out."

3. "...but with the unleavened bread of sincerity; as opposed to malice, of sincere love to God and Christ, and to his people: and of truth; of Gospel doctrine, discipline, and conversation."

### John Wesley:
1. "Let us feed on him by faith."
2. "Not with the old leaven - Of heathenism or Judaism."
3. "Sincerity and truth seem to be put here for the whole of true, inward religion."
