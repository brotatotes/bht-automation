# 1 Corinthians 5:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle Paul makes reference to a previous letter he had written to the Corinthians, addressing a specific matter. In this letter, he admonishes them not to engage in conversation or association with individuals involved in immoral behavior. The emphasis is on maintaining minimal interaction, limiting contact to only what is necessary. This instruction aligns with the principles observed by the Jewish community, who avoided close relationships with non-believers. By refraining from unnecessary association, believers protect their own spiritual well-being and avoid setting a detrimental example for others.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I wrote to you in my letter (not this present epistle, which might mean, see reff., for there is nothing in the preceding part of this Epistle which can by any possibility be so interpreted, certainly not either 1Co 5:2 or 1 Corinthians 5:6, which are commonly alleged by those who thus explain it and ·ºêŒΩ œÑ·øá ·ºêœÄŒπœÉœÑŒøŒª·øá would be a superfluous and irrelevant addition, if he meant the letter on which he was now engaged: but, a former epistle, which has not come down to us: cf. the similar expression, ref. 2 Cor. used with reference to this Epistle, and see note on 2 Corinthians 1:15-16."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Paul probably wrote a former brief reply to inquiries of the Corinthians: our first Epistle, as it enters more fully into the same subject, has superseded the former, which the Holy Spirit did not design for the guidance of the Church in general, and which therefore has not been preserved."
2. "...a former letter is referred to by the same phrase."
3. "His letters confirm this."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We have but fourteen of his remaining. Yet he labored many years; founded many churches; and had frequent occasion to write to them."
2. "It is altogether probable that Paul would write more letters than we have preserved."
3. "As an instance, Calvin says, 'The Epistle of which he here speaks, is not now extant. Nor is it to be doubted that many others have perished; but it is sufficient that these survive to us which the Lord saw to be needful.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The reference is probably to a former letter now lost."
2. "The translation company is inadequate, but cannot perhaps be bettered."
3. "It denotes, therefore, not only close, but habitual, intercourse."

### John Calvin:
1. "He reminds the Corinthians of what he had already enjoined upon them ‚Äî that they should refrain from intercourse with the wicked." 
2. "Let all that wish to be reckoned brethren, either live holily and becomingly, or be excommunicated from the society of the pious, and let all the good refrain from intercourse and familiarity with them."
3. "This exception, however, increases the criminality of remissness, inasmuch as they cherished in the bosom of the Church an openly wicked person; for it is more disgraceful to neglect those of your own household than to neglect strangers."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The only alternative is, that there is here a reference to some previously-written letter to that church not now preserved."
2. "Nor is this unworthy of Inspiration, as is evident from the Old Testament prophetic writings, which are very far from containing all that the prophets uttered by inspiration."
3. "Certain it is that the Corinthians sent written questions to the apostle on points of practical difficulty, and even on this very subject, and if one of these related to what intercourse, if any, they should keep up with their heathen friends and fellow-citizens, and a messenger was then going to Corinth who could take his answer, how naturally might he send a hasty reply by him, with the promise to write more fully thereafter!"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I wrote unto you in my epistle... one not preserved to us." 
2. "To have no company with fornicators... men and women who sell their bodies for lust."

### John Gill:
1. "He therefore in this distinguishes upon the former, and enlarges his sense of the latter; declaring that they were not so much as to eat with such persons; which shows, that this prohibition does not regard unclean copulation, or a joining with them in the sin of fornication..."
2. "but that it is to be understood of a civil society and familiar conversation with them; which might bring a reproach upon religion, be a stumbling to weak Christians, and be of dangerous consequence to themselves and others; who hereby might be allured and drawn by their example into the commission of the same sinful practices."
3. "The apostle seems to allude to the customs and usages of the Jews, who abstained from all civil commerce and familiar acquaintance with unbelievers."

### John Wesley:
1. "I wrote to you in a former epistle."
2. "Not to converse."
3. "More than is absolutely necessary."
