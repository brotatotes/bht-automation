# 1 Corinthians 6:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is cautioned against Christians daring to bring their disputes before unbelieving judges instead of fellow believers. This action is considered both imprudent and impudent, as it exposes the Christian faith to insulting treatment. Expecting justice from those who are unrighteous and do not fear God is futile. Instead, disputes among Christians should be resolved within the Christian community, where impartial judgment and truth can prevail without bringing shame to any party.

2. "Not without a special design is the contrast here so sharply drawn between Christians and heathens; for the Jews themselves made it a rule never to carry their disputes before heathen tribunals."
3. "What is here so sharply rebuked is, exposing before eyes that ought to see in Christians only that which is 'lovely and of good report,' what was the opposite of this, as if (by a cruel satire on our Lord’s words) to invite those heathens to ask, 'What do ye more than others?'"
