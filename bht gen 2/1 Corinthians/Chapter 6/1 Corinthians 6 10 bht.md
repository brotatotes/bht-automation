# 1 Corinthians 6:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible warns against those who are consumed by greed and resort to theft, fraud, and deceit to satisfy their insatiable desire for worldly gain. Alongside them, the passage condemns revilers who verbally abuse and slander others. It also cautions against extortioners, who unjustly take from others for personal benefit. These vices are seen as disqualifications from inheriting the kingdom. This scripture emphasizes the importance of living uprightly and avoiding sinful behaviors that are contrary to God's will.
