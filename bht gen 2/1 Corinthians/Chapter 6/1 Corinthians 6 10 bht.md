# 1 Corinthians 6:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is remarkable that the apostle always ranks the covetous with the most abandoned classes of people, such as thieves who take away another man's property by fraud or force. These covetous individuals are insatiable in their lust for worldly gain, bent upon increasing their substance at any rate and using deceit. They are greedy and do not use the things of this life as they should, for their own good and that of others. Furthermore, the apostle warns against revilers, those who engage in slanderous speech, and extortioners who exploit others for personal gain.
