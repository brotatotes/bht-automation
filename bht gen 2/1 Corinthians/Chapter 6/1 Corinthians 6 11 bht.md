# 1 Corinthians 6:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Corinthians were once in a state of debauchery, but now they have experienced a complete transformation. They have been cleansed from their sins through the blood of Christ, not just externally, but internally as well. This washing is not separate from their justification in Christ, as it is through His name that they are forgiven. This entire process is the work of the Spirit of God, who sanctifies them and makes them new.
