# 1 Corinthians 6:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Claiming the right to do anything may express a true Christian axiom, but it is important to recognize that not all actions are beneficial or expedient. While certain practices may be lawful, they may not be helpful or profitable, especially if they cause harm or offense to others. It is crucial to exercise discernment and consider the impact of our actions on the edification and well-being of others. Our freedom should not lead us into bondage or servitude to things that may hinder our spiritual growth and hinder our ability to serve God and others.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "œÄŒ¨ŒΩœÑŒ± ŒºŒøŒπ ·ºîŒæŒµœÉœÑŒπŒΩ are the bona fide words of the Apostle himself, [...] the sentiment is a true Christian axiom: œÄŒ¨ŒΩœÑŒ± being of course understood, as it evidently was even by the abusers of the doctrine, of things (supposed by them) ·ºÄŒ¥ŒπŒ¨œÜŒøœÅŒ±."
2. "The ŒºŒøŒπ is spoken in the person of Christians generally. 'S√¶pe Paulus prima persona singulari eloquitur qu√¶ vim habent gnomes: in hac pr√¶sertim epistola.'"
3. "I will not be deprived of my freedom by any practice; i.e. indulge in any practice which shall mar this liberty and render it no real freedom, making me to be one under ·ºêŒæŒøœÖœÉŒØŒ±, instead of one exercising it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "All things are in my power, but I will not be brought under the power of any of them."
2. "The 'power' ought to be in the hands of the believer, not in the things which he uses."
3. "Unlawful things ruin thousands; 'lawful' things (unlawfully used), ten thousands."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "All things are lawful unto me... God has formed all things for our use, and there can be no evil if we use them."
2. "Even should we admit that the practices under discussion are lawful, yet there are many things which are not expedient; that is, which do not profit... they are injurious and hurtful."
3. "I will not be the slave of habit... It requires a high order of virtue; and is the only way in which a man may be useful and active."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "All things are in my power, but I shall not be brought under the power of any."
2. "This kinship of the two words explains the play upon them."

### John Calvin:
1. "They abused liberty so much as to extend it even to fornication."
2. "He restricts the use of liberty ‚Äî that they must not abandon themselves to licentiousness, because respect must be had to edification."
3. "We are lords of all things; only we must not abuse that lordship in such a way as to drag out a most miserable bondage, being, through intemperance and inordinate lusts, under subjection to outward things, which ought to be under subjection to us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "All things are lawful for me, but not all things are expedient."
2. "In things indifferent... I can use my liberty without scruple; but there are some of tender conscience who are still afraid to meddle with such things."
3. "For their sake, therefore, I must consider whether that which in itself is perfectly lawful is at the same time expedient."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The 'all things' do not include such matters as those condemned in chapter 1 Corinthians 6:1; 1 Corinthians 6:1-11. Paul limits the proverb to things not immoral, things not wrong per se."
2. "Many things, harmless in themselves in the abstract, do harm to others in the concrete. We live in a world of social relations that circumscribe personal rights and liberties."
3. "Paul is determined not to be a slave to anything harmless in itself. He will maintain his self-control. He gives a wholesome hint to those who talk so much about personal liberty."

### John Gill:
1. "All things are lawful unto me,.... That is, which are of an indifferent nature; otherwise everything is not lawful to be done: but all things are not expedient." 
2. "when the doing of them destroys the peace, comfort, and edification of others; when it stumbles and grieves weak minds, and causes offence to them." 
3. "or whether to the use of meats forbidden under the law, or offered to idols; which though in themselves lawful to be eaten, every creature of God being good, and not to be refused and accounted common and unclean; yet it was not expedient to use this liberty, if a weak brother should be grieved, or a man himself become a slave to his appetite."

### John Wesley:
1. "All things are lawful for you, but all things are not always expedient ‚Äì particularly when anything would offend my weak brother."
2. "I will not be brought under the power of any ‚Äì so as to be uneasy when I abstain from it; for, if so, then I am under the power of it."
