# 1 Corinthians 6:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible teaches us that our bodies were not made for the practice of fornication, but to be devoted to the Lord's work. While foods, including those offered to idols, may be indifferent and have their temporary use, they will all perish in the future. However, the indulgence in sexual immorality is always considered evil and goes against the purpose for which our bodies were created. It is important to remember that our bodies belong to the Lord and should be used for His glory and service alone.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The belly is their appointed receptacle they, its appointed pabulum."
2. "The body was not made for the practice of fornication."
3. "…the body shall be subserving its real use that of being an instrument for the Lord’s work."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Meats doubtless are indifferent, since both they and the 'belly' for which they are created are to be 'destroyed' in the future state."
2. "But 'the body is not (created) for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body' (as its Redeemer, who hath Himself assumed the body): 'And God hath raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us' (that is our bodies): therefore the 'body' is not, like the 'belly,' after having served a temporary use, to be destroyed."
3. "Thus Paul gives here the germ of the three subjects handled in subsequent sections: (1) The relation between the sexes. (2) The question of meats offered to idols. (3) The resurrection of the body."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is unworthy the immortal mind to spend its time and thought in making provision for the body which is soon to perish."
2. "The pampering of the appetites is the great purpose for which they live, and the only purpose. It is folly."
3. "The body is not designed for licentiousness, but to be devoted to the Lord. We are, therefore, bound to devote our animal as well as our rational powers to the service of the Lord alone."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Paul is arguing against fornication. His argument is that there is a law of adaptation running through nature, illustrated by the mutual adaptation of food and the digestive organs..."
2. "The mutual physical adaptation is only temporary, as the body and its nourishment are alike perishable."

### John Calvin:
1. "We must use this world so as not to abuse it...When a dispute, therefore, arises respecting corruptible things, a pious mind will not anxiously dwell upon these things; for liberty is one thing — the use of it is another." 
2. "Our liberty ought not by any means to be extended to fornication...for there can be no doubt that this was done, because it was very generally looked upon as a lawful thing."
3. "It is impossible that Christ should be conjoined with fornication...God the Father has united us to his Son, what wickedness there would be in tearing away our body from that sacred connection, and giving it over to things unworthy of Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Meats, no doubt, are indifferent, but since both they and the mortal body to which they minister are destined to perish in their corruptibility, scorn to become enslaved to them."
2. "As the body was not made to be pampered by 'meats,' much less to be prostituted to vile uses, so the body of every believer is redeemed to be the Lord’s property, and the Lord belongs to it in return."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Both the belly and the foods God will bring to an end by death and change."
2. "The human body has a higher mission than the mere gratification of sensual appetite."
3. "Sex is of God for the propagation of the race, not for prostitution."

### John Gill:
1. "All sort of food is appointed and provided to satisfy the appetite and stomach, to fill the belly, and nourish the body." 
2. "The body was not originally made and appointed for fornication; this is quite besides the will of God, who has provided marriage as a remedy against it." 
3. "The Lord for the body; he was preordained in the council of God, and provided in the covenant of grace, and sent in the fulness of time to be a Redeemer and Saviour of the body, as well as the soul."

### John Wesley:
1. "I speak this chiefly with regard to meats...particularly with regard to those offered to idols, and those forbidden in the Mosaic law. These, I grant, are all indifferent, and have their use, though it is only for a time..."
2. "Then meats, and the organs which receive them, will together moulder into dust."
3. "But the case is quite otherwise with fornication. This is not indifferent, but at all times evil."
