# 1 Corinthians 6:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The resurrection of Jesus Christ by God the Father is a demonstration of His power and the divinity of Christ. It is by this same power that believers will also be raised, showing that their bodies are not meant for immorality but rather to be transformed into powerful, glorious, and incorruptible vessels. Therefore, it is unbecoming for believers to defile their bodies with sexual immorality when they are destined for a resurrection of purity and holiness.

### Henry Alford:
1. "So far from the case of the Lord and the body answering to the other, God raised up the Lord (Romans 8:11, al. fr.), and will raise up us too by His power."
2. "The future corresponds to καταργήσει, and is used with ἡμᾶς, contrary to the usual practice of Paul, who expected to be alive at the παρουσία, as the expression, in the first person, of the truth of the future resurrection, not destruction of the body."
3. "ἤγειρεν, viz. ἐκ νεκρῶν, Acts 3:15; Romans 4:24, and passim: ἐξεγερεῖ, viz. ἐκ νεκρῶν. So that there is no real difference between the two words."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Believers shall be raised up out of the rest of the dead; the first resurrection."
2. "In either event, the Lord's coming rather than death is the great object of the Christian's expectation."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We are united to Christ. God has raised him from the dead, and made his body glorified. Our bodies will be like his...it is wrong that it should be devoted to purposes of pollution and lust."
2. "It is unworthy of our connection with that pure Saviour who has been raised from the dead...and unworthy of the hope that our bodies shall be raised up to perfect and immortal purity in the heavens."

2. "The subject of a higher adaptation, with which fornication is incompatible."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is unseemly and unlawful, that our body, which is consecrated to Christ, should be profaned by fornication, inasmuch as Christ himself has been raised up from the dead, that he might enter on the possession of the heavenly glory."
 
2. "It is a base thing to prostitute our body to earthly pollutions, while it is destined to be a partaker along with Christ of a blessed immortality and of the heavenly glory."
3. "As, however, the resurrection is a thing almost incredible to the human mind, when the Scripture makes mention of it, it reminds us of the power of God, with the view of confirming our faith in it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And God both raised the Lord, and will raise up [1] us through his power." 
2. "As the body of Christ was endued at His resurrection with imperishable properties, and stamped with a spiritual and celestial character, so will it be with all that are His (chap. 1 Corinthians 15:42-44)."
3. "The addition of the word 'up' in the second verb is designed to mark the difference between the compound form of the verb here used and the simple form in the first clause."

2. "For the resurrection of the dead, whether of Christ, or of his people, is an act of power, of God's own power, even of his almighty power, and is what the power of a mere creature could never effect."
3. "Now as Christ, the head, is raised, so shall all his members by the same power; their bodies will be raised powerful, glorious, incorruptible; and spiritual; an argument that they were never made for fornication, nor to be defiled with such uncleanness."
