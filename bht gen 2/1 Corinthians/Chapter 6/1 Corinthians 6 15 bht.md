# 1 Corinthians 6:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our physical bodies are not separate from Christ, but are intimately connected to him as part of his redemptive work. Therefore, it is unthinkable and repulsive to take the members of Christ and unite them with an immoral partner. Such a union is completely contrary to the sacredness of our connection to Christ. God forbid such a horrific act that defiles the bodies that belong to the Lord. It is clear that the union of the saints with Christ should be respected and upheld as holy and pure.
