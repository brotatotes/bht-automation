# 1 Corinthians 6:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Genesis 2:24, the concept of becoming one flesh is originally applied to the intimate union of a man and his lawful wife. The apostle Paul extends this concept to highlight the gravity of sexual immorality, emphasizing that when a person engages in relations with a prostitute, they become one body, severing a member from the body of Christ. This comparison underscores the seriousness of sexual immorality in contrast to the sacredness of marital union.
