# 1 Corinthians 6:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Being joined to the Lord means being united with Him both in spirit and in purpose. The intimate bond between believers and Christ is even stronger than the union between a husband and wife. It is a sacred and inviolable connection, marked by the sharing of one spirit. Just as a believer becomes one spirit with Christ, they also partake in a life in common with Him, filled with spiritual blessings and eternal life. Therefore, let us cherish and maintain this union with the Lord, keeping ourselves pure and faithful, for it is a bond that surpasses all others.
