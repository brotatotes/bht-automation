# 1 Corinthians 6:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Flee from the sin of fornication with urgency and disgust, for it is harmful, scandalous, and unworthy of Christians. Avoid not only the act itself, but also any circumstances that may lead to it. Know that committing fornication is not only a sin against others, but also a sin against one's own body, polluting and degrading it to a level comparable to that of animals. Other sins may not directly defile the body, but fornication is unique in its immediate impact on the physical self.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "πᾶν ἁμάρτ ... is still ἐκτὸς τοῦ σώματος introduced from without, sinful not in their act, but in their effect, which effect it is each man’s duty to foresee and avoid."
2. "But fornication is the alienating that body which is the Lord’s, and making it a harlot’s body it is sin against a man’s own body, in its very nature, against the verity and nature of his body; not an effect on the body from participation of things without, but a contradiction of the truth of the body, wrought within itself."
3. "When man and wife are one in the Lord, united by His ordinance, no such alienation of the body takes place, and consequently no sin."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Flee—The only safety in such temptations is flight."
2. "Every sin—The Greek is forcible. 'Every sin whatsoever that a man doeth.'"
3. "But the fornicator alienates that body which is the Lord's, and makes it one with a harlot's body, and so 'sinneth against his own body,' that is, against the verity and nature of his body."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There is force and emphasis in the word 'flee'...Man should escape from it; he should not stay to reason about it; to debate the matter; or even to contend with his propensities, and to try the strength of his virtue."
2. "There is no way of avoiding the pollution but in the manner prescribed by Paul; there is no man safe who will not follow his direction."
3. "It wastes the bodily energies; produces feebleness, weakness, and disease; it impairs the strength, enervates the man, and shortens life."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Most gladly have I escaped that, and I feel as if I had escaped from a mad and furious master."
2. "Sin. See on Romans 3:25."
3. "But in fornication the body is the instrument of the sin, and 'inwardly as well as outwardly is made over to another.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "Having set before us honorable conduct, he now shows how much we ought to abhor fornication, setting before us the enormity of its wickedness and baseness."
2. "The body, it is true, is defiled also by theft, and murder, and drunkenness...but fornication leaves a stain impressed upon the body, such as is not impressed upon it from other sins."
3. "According to this comparison, or, in other words, in the sense of less and more, other sins are said to be without the body."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Flee fornication. Note the studiously curt and stringent language...not for nothing is 'flight' here urged."
2. "Every sin that a man doeth is without the body...but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body."
3. "Viewed in this light, that sin is like nothing else. It is a leprosy...stupefies all the intellectual and moral powers."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Fornication violates Christ's rights in our bodies and also ruins the body itself." 
2. "Perhaps the dominant idea of Paul is that fornication, as already shown, breaks the mystic bond between the body and Christ and hence the fornicator sins against his own body."
3. "The fornicator takes his body which belongs to Christ and unites it with a harlot."

### John Gill:
1. "Flee fornication,.... As that which is hurtful, scandalous, and unbecoming Christians; avoid it, and all the occasions of it, that may lead unto it, and be incentives of it"
2. "but he that committeth fornication, sinneth against his own body; not meaning his wife, which is as his own body; but his proper natural body, which is not only the instrument by which this sin is committed, but the object against which it is committed"

### John Wesley:
1. "Flee fornication — All unlawful commerce with women, with speed, with abhorrence, with all your might."
2. "Every sin that a man commits against his neighbour terminates upon an object out of himself, and does not so immediately pollute his body, though it does his soul."
3. "But he that committeth fornication, sinneth against his own body — Pollutes, dishonours, and degrades it to a level with brute beasts."
