# 1 Corinthians 6:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Your body is not your own, but a temple of the Holy Spirit who dwells within you. Just as God's presence filled the temple in Jerusalem, so the Holy Spirit fills you as a living temple. It is important to keep this temple holy and undefiled, as fornication is a defilement of the sacred space. We must remember that we belong to God, for we have been purchased and redeemed by the precious blood of Christ. Therefore, we are called to consecrate ourselves to God and live in obedience to His will, honoring the sanctity of our bodies.
