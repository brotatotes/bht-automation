# 1 Corinthians 6:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do you not realize that the saints, who will be assessed and judged by Christ, will also have the privilege and responsibility to participate in judging the world? This is not a matter of mere knowledge for the Corinthians, but one of living out their faith in action. Just as Christ will condemn the wicked, the saints will join Him as assessors in this judgment, not only in regards to men, but also angels. It is a high and honored position that the Corinthians should remember and strive to live up to.
