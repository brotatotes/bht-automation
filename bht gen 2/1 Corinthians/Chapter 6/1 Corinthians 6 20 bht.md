# 1 Corinthians 6:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Christians, we are not our own; we have been bought with a price, the precious blood of Christ. Therefore, it is fitting and necessary for us to honor God with our body and spirit, dedicating all that we are and all that we have to His glory. This means surrendering ourselves completely to Him, allowing Him to guide and direct our actions so that they align with His righteousness. In doing so, we express our gratitude for the redemption we have received through Christ and acknowledge His rightful ownership over every part of our being.

3. "But another thing, the counterpart of this, should not escape notice that although Christianity furnishes motives to holiness peculiar to itself, motives inappreciable save to its genuine disciples, it is so far from disdaining considerations favourable to virtue which are derived from natural ethics, that it readily avails itself of them all, and both kinds of motives are found so readily to fit into each other as to shew that they come from one Divine source."
