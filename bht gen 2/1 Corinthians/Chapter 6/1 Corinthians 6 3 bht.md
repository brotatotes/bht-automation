# 1 Corinthians 6:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do you not know that as Christians, we have been appointed to not only judge angels, but also to partake in the judgment and expulsion of them from the corrupt practices and beliefs of the Gentile world? If we have been entrusted with such authority in matters of spiritual significance, how much more competent are we to handle and make judgments about the ordinary affairs of this present life?

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "How much more, things that pertain to this life?" - The question expects the answer no and γε adds sharp point to Paul's surprised tone, "Need I so much as say?" It can be understood also as ellipsis, "let me not say" (μητιγε λεγω).
2. "βιωτικα occurs first in Aristotle, but is common afterwards." - βιωτικα is used of business matters. It is from βιος (manner of life in contrast to ζωη, life principle). 
3. "It can be understood also as ellipsis, 'let me not say' (μητιγε λεγω), not to say."

1. "Know ye not that we shall judge angels..."
