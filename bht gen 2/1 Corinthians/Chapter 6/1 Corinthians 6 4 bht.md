3. "Let it be noticed that he is passing to 1 Corinthians 6:7, where he insists on the impropriety of βιωτικὰ κριτ. between Christians at all, and is here depreciating them ironically."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "If ye have tribunals pertaining to this life" (condition of third class, εαν εχητε).
