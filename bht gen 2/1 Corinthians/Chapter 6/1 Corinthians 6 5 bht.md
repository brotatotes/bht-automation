# 1 Corinthians 6:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Is it not shameful that among all of you who boast of your wisdom, not one person is capable of judging and settling such trivial disputes? Instead, you brought them before pagan authorities, showing a lack of trust in your own community. Should there not be at least one wise individual among you who can discern and render a fair judgment in these matters? Your reliance on unbelievers to settle internal conflicts is a matter of reproach and an opportunity for you to examine the pride you place in your own wisdom.
