# 1 Corinthians 6:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is truly disgraceful and shameful that individuals who are part of the same family of believers would resort to legal disputes against each other. This lack of faith and trust in one another reflects not only their wickedness but also their irrationality, lack of conscience, justice, and fairness. Such behavior undermines the very foundation of their Christian identity and creates a poor witness before unbelievers.
