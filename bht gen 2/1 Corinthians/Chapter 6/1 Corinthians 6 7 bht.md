# 1 Corinthians 6:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
There is a flaw among you, my brethren, in your inclination to quarrel and go to law with one another. Instead, why not choose to endure wrong and be willing to suffer rather than engage in legal disputes? It is not all men who can understand or accept this teaching, for many believe in the principle of neither do wrong, nor suffer it, but as Christians, we are called to a higher standard of love and forgiveness.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Whatever may be the propriety or impropriety of going to law before Christian magistrates, yet the point which the apostle refers to was that of going to law before pagans."
2. "Rather than dishonor religion by a trial or suit of this kind, they ought to be willing to take wrong, and to suffer any personal and private injustice."

### John Calvin:
1. "Those are altogether in the wrong who go to law. Hence it will not be allowable in any one to maintain his rights by having recourse to a magistrate."
2. "Paul does not condemn law-suits on the ground of its being a wrong thing in itself to maintain a good cause by having recourse to a magistrate, but because it is almost invariably accompanied with corrupt dispositions; as, for example, violence, desire of revenge, enmities, obstinacy, and the like."
3. "If a Christian man wishes to prosecute his rights at law, so as not to offend God, he must, above all things, take heed that he does not bring into court any desire of revenge, any corrupt affection of the mind, or anger, or, in fine, any other poison. In this matter love will be the best regulator."
