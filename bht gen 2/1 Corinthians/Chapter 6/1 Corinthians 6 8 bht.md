# 1 Corinthians 6:8 Commentary Help Text

So far were they from following the command of their Lord to do good, that they openly did wrong and secretly defrauded. The corruption and depravity among them was profound, showing how the mystery of iniquity was already at work in their midst.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The account of this emphatic ὑμεῖς is to be found in an ellipsis after ἀποστερεῖσθε to the effect, ‘as our Lord commanded us His disciples,’ or ‘as it behoves the followers of Christ.’" 
2. "Then ὑμεῖς comes in contrast: YOU on the contrary ( ἀλλά , see above 1Co 6:6 ) do wrong, and defraud, and that (your) brethren."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Ye, whom your Lord commanded to return good for evil, on the contrary, 'do wrong (by taking away) and defraud'." 
2. "Not only do ye not bear, but ye inflict wrongs."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Instead of enduring wrong patiently and cheerfully, they were themselves guilty of injustice and fraud."
2. "The offence in such cases is aggravated, not because it is in itself any worse to injure a Christian than another man, but because it shows a deeper depravity, when a man overcomes all the ties of kindness and love, and injures those who are near to him."
3. "It is for this reason that parricide, infanticide, etc. are regarded everywhere as crimes of special atrocity, because a child or a parent must have severed all the tenderest cords of virtue before it could be done."

### John Calvin:
1. "There prevailed among them such a base desire of gain, that they did not even refrain from injuring one another."
2. "If it is wrong not to bear injuries patiently, how much worse is it to inflict them?"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "But (adversative αλλα, on the contrary) you (emphatic) do the wronging and the robbing" (active voices) "and that your brethren" (κα τουτο αδελφους). 
2. The very climax of wrong-doings, to stoop to do this with one's brethren in Christ.

### John Gill:
1. "So far were they from taking and acting up to the advice given, that instead of taking wrong, they did wrong; and instead of suffering themselves to be defrauded, they defrauded others."
2. "Neither party, not the plaintiff, nor the defendant, sought anything more or less than to wrong, trick, and defraud each other."
3. "Such a sad corruption and degeneracy prevailed among them; hence the apostle thought to deal plainly and closely with them, as in the following verses."

### John Wesley:
1. Nay, ye do wrong — Openly.And defraud — Privately. O how powerfully did the mystery of iniquity already work!
