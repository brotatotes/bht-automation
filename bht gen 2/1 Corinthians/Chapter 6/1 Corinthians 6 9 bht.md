# 1 Corinthians 6:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do not be deceived, for the unrighteousness of wrong-doing will not grant entry into the kingdom of God. Beware of being led astray by the indulgent ways and allurements of the world, particularly in places like Corinth, where immoderation and venereal vices are prevalent. Let us not forget that those who commit acts of immorality will fail to inherit the kingdom of God. Guard against the temptation to indulge in the smallest sins, for each transgression, no matter how insignificant it may seem, is a step on the path towards destruction.
