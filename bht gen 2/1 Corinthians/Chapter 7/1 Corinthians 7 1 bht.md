# 1 Corinthians 7:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is good for a man, who is master of himself, not to touch a woman - that is, not to marry. This does not mean that marriage is wrong, but rather that there are great advantages to a single life, especially for those who are able to exercise self-control and remain celibate.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is the best way, in the colloquial sense: so also throughout the chapter."
2. "Though of necessity by what follows, the man only is intended, yet ἀνθρώπῳ does not here or in reff. = ἀνδρί, but as Meyer remarks, regards the man not merely in his sexual but in his human capacity."
3. "This expression is obviously here used in the widest sense, without present regard to the difference between the lawful and unlawful use of the woman."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Marriage is HONORABLE IN ALL."
2. "Another reason why in some cases celibacy may be a matter of Christian expediency is stated in 1 Corinthians 7:34; 1 Corinthians 7:35, 'that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.' But these are exceptional cases, and in exceptional times, such as those of Paul."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is good - It is well. It is fit, convenient, or, it is suited to the present circumstances, or, the thing itself is well and expedient in certain circumstances."
2. "The apostle did not mean that marriage was unlawful, for he says Hebrews 13:4 that 'marriage is honorable in all.'"
3. "Not to touch a woman - Not to be connected with her by marriage."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "It is good [καλον] . See on John 10:11. Not merely expedient, but morally salutary."
2. "The statement, however, is made in the light of circumstances... in all which marriage is made the type of the union between Christ and His Church."
3. "May give yourselves [σχολασητε] . Lit., may have leisure... so to devote one's self to it."

### John Calvin:
1. "This contagion had perhaps spread itself among the Corinthians also; or at least there were idly-disposed spirits, who, by immoderately extolling celibacy, endeavored to alienate the minds of the pious from marriage."
2. "Nothing farther, therefore, can be elicited from Paul’s words than this — that it is indeed expedient and profitable for a man not to be bound to a wife, provided he can do otherwise."
3. "The sum is this, that we must remember to distinguish between the pure ordinance of God and the punishment of sin, which came in subsequently."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is good for a man not to touch a woman... Not as if he meant that marriage was wrong in itself, as the next verse and 1 Corinthians 7:28 sufficiently shew."
2. "Indeed, the 'present distress' (1 Corinthians 7:26) seems to have been his main reason for recommending the single state; and 'forbidding to marry' is given as one of the signs of 'the apostasy of the later times' (1 Timothy 4:3)."
3. "In Hebrews 13:4, also, marriage is declared to be 'honourable in all,' or 'to be had in honour of all;' and see Mark 10:6-9."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The first is whether a single life is wrong. Paul pointedly says that it is not wrong, but good."
2. "One will get a one-sided view of Paul's teaching on marriage unless he keeps a proper perspective."
3. "Paul is not here opposing marriage. He is only arguing that celibacy may be good in certain limitations."

### John Gill:
1. "It is good for a man not to touch a woman; which is to be understood, not of merely touching a woman, which can neither be criminal, nor in all cases inexpedient, or be attended with any ill, or dangerous consequences; nor of the matrimonial contract, which is lawful and honorable; but of the act of carnal copulation with a woman." 
2. "The apostle's meaning is not that it is unlawful to marry, or that it is sinful to lie with a woman in lawful wedlock; but that it is much better, and more expedient on several accounts, to abstain from the use of women, when persons have the gift of continency."

### John Wesley:
1. "It is good for a man — Who is master of himself." 
2. "Not to touch a woman — That is, not to marry." 
3. "So great and many are the advantages of a single life."
