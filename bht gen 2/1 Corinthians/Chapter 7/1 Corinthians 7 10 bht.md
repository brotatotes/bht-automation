# 1 Corinthians 7:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The text emphasizes the unbreakable bond of marriage, noting that the command for the wife not to separate from her husband comes directly from Jesus himself. This command is not a suggestion but a commandment given by the Lord, highlighting the sacredness and permanence of the marital union. The apostle appeals to this divine instruction to address customs prevalent in that time, where husbands and wives would separate for various reasons. It is important to understand that this command applies equally to both husbands and wives, reflecting the binding nature of the marriage covenant.
