# 1 Corinthians 7:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If a wife chooses to leave her husband against Christ's command, it does not invalidate the marriage. The marriage is only dissolved in the case of adultery. If the wife is at fault and causes the separation, she should seek forgiveness, reconcile with her husband, and live in peace with him. Likewise, if the husband is at fault, the wife should strive to peacefully address the issue, forgive any wrongdoing, and work towards a harmonious and fulfilling marriage.
