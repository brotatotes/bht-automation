# 1 Corinthians 7:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers should not seek divorce from unbelieving spouses unless the unbelievers initiate it. This is not a direct command from Jesus but Paul's understanding. Mixed marriages are considered valid, and believers should strive to maintain them. The Gospel does not dissolve marital obligations, even in cases of religious differences. The example of Jewish law does not apply to these marriages, as they were contracted before one party became a believer.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The meaning is plain, being those who are involved in mixed marriages with unbelievers."
2. "I, i.e. I Paul, in my apostolic office, under the authority of the Holy Spirit, not the Lord, i.e. not Christ by any direct command spoken by Him."
3. "But to the rest I say (I, not the Lord)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "to the rest‚Äîthe other classes (besides 'the married,' where both husband and wife are believers) about whom the Corinthians had inquired, namely, those involved in mixed marriages with unbelievers."
2. "not the Lord‚Äîby any direct command spoken by Him."
3. "she be pleased‚ÄîGreek, 'consents': implying his wish in the first instance, with which hers concurs."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The rest,‚Äù or remainder, here referred to, relates particularly to the cases in which one party was a Christian and the other not."
2. "The word 'rest' refers to these instances, and the questions which would arise under this inquiry."
3. "It is evident that if a man were at liberty to dissolve the marriage tie, or to discard his wife when his own opinions were changed on the subject of religion, that it would at once destroy all the sacredness of the marriage union, and render it a nullity."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "To the rest. He has been speaking to the unmarried (ver. 8) and to married parties, both of whom were Christians (ver. 10). By the rest he means married couples, one of which remained a heathen."
2. "I, not the Lord. These cases are not included in Christ 's declarations."
3. "Be pleased [œÉœÖŒΩŒµœÖŒ¥ŒøŒ∫ŒµŒπ] . Rev., be content. Better, consent. Both the other renderings fail to express the agreement indicated by sun together."

### John Calvin:
1. "The believing party ought not to withdraw from the unbelieving party, and ought not to seek divorce, unless she is put away."
2. "If an unbeliever put away his wife on account of religion, a brother or a sister is, by such rejection, freed from the bond of marriage."
3. "What connection can a pious woman any longer maintain with an unbelieving husband, after she has been driven away through hatred of God?"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul has no word about marriage from Jesus beyond the problem of divorce. This is no disclaimer of inspiration. He simply means that here he is not quoting a command of Jesus."
2. "Paul has to deal with mixed marriages as missionaries do today in heathen lands."
3. "She is content (œÉœÖŒΩŒµœÖŒ¥ŒøŒ∫Œµ). Late compound verb to be pleased together with, agree together. In the papyri."

### John Gill:
1. "He had spoken before to married persons in general, and had delivered not his own sentiments barely, but the commandment of the Lord."
2. "...he under divine inspiration gives his sense of it; as that such marriages were valid, and that such persons ought to live together, and not separate on account of difference in religion."
3. "The Gospel revelation does not dissolve the natural obligations men and women are in to one another."

### John Wesley:
1. "Let him not put her away ‚Äî The Jews, indeed, were obliged of old to put away their idolatrous wives, Ezra 10:3; but their case was quite different."
2. "They were absolutely forbid to marry idolatrous women; but the persons here spoken of were married while they were both in a state of heathenism."
