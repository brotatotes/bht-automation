# 1 Corinthians 7:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the case of mixed marriages where a believer is married to an unbeliever, the Apostle Paul advises against seeking divorce. Instead, the believer should continue to live with their spouse in a loving and faithful manner. Paul's fair and balanced approach acknowledges the challenges faced by both sides. It is essential for the believer to remember that their commitment to the marriage covenant remains unaffected by their spouse's faith. By demonstrating love and Christ-likeness, the believer can serve as a powerful testimony of God's grace and potentially influence their unbelieving spouse towards the Gospel.
