# 1 Corinthians 7:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The bond of marriage between a believer and an unbeliever is sacred and should not be feared as if it would bring spiritual contamination. The union itself is sanctified, allowing the couple to live together in the marriage relationship without compromising their own holiness. This sanctification does not pertain to moral transformation, but rather to the status of affiliation within the Christian community. It is this sanctified connection that allows for the children of the union to be considered holy, in the sense of having a place in the covenant community and the right to receive the sacrament of baptism.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "holiness, under the Gospel, answers to dedication to God under the law; (2) that the ·º°Œ≥ŒπŒ±œÉŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒøŒπ under the Gospel are the body of Christian men, dedicated to God, and thus become His in a peculiar manner"
2. "things belonging to, relatives inseparably connected with, the people of God are said to be hallowed by their ·ºÅŒ≥ŒπœåœÑŒ∑œÇ"
3. "Christian children being holy, the argument is built. This being so, they being hallowed, because the children of Christians, it follows that that union out of which they sprung, must as such have the same hallowed character"


### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Those inseparably connected with the people of God are hallowed thereby, so that the latter may retain the connection without impairing their own sanctity." 
2. "The fact of the husband being a 'brother,' that is, a Christian, though the wife is not so, sanctifies or hallows the union."
3. "The faith of one Christian parent gives to the children a near relationship to the Church, just as if both parents were Christians."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The connection produces a species of sanctification, or diffuses a kind of holiness over the unbelieving party by the believing party, so far as to render their children holy, and therefore it is improper to seek for a separation."
2. "And the sense may be, 'They are by the marriage tie one flesh. They are indissolubly united by the ordinance of God. As they are one by his appointment, as they have received his sanction to the marriage union, and as one of them is holy, so the other is to be regarded as sanctified, or made so holy by the divine sanction to the union, that it is proper for them to live together in the marriage relation.'"
3. "The marriage is quite lawful for Christians, otherwise your children could not be reckoned holy, in the sense of having a right to the seal of the covenant, that is, baptism."

### John Calvin:
1. "Marriage is, nevertheless, sacred and pure, and that we must not be apprehensive of contagion, as if the wife would contaminate the husband."
2. "Hence a believer may, with a pure conscience, live with an unbeliever, for in respect of the use and intercourse of the marriage bed, and of life generally, he is sanctified, so as not to infect the believing party with his impurity."
3. "The passage, then, is a remarkable one, and drawn from the depths of theology; for it teaches, that the children of the pious are set apart from others by a sort of exclusive privilege, so as to be reckoned holy in the Church."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Clearly he only means that the marriage relation is sanctified so that there is no need of a divorce."
2. "If either husband or wife is a believer and the other agrees to remain, the marriage is holy and need not be set aside."
3. "If the relations of the parents be holy, the child's birth must be holy also (not illegitimate)."

### John Gill:
1. "This is a reason given by the apostle why they should live together. This cannot be understood of internal sanctification, which is never the case; an unbeliever cannot be sanctified by a believer in this sense, for such a sanctification is only by the Spirit of God..." 
2. "Let it be further observed; that the preposition ŒµŒΩ, which is in most versions rendered 'by', should be rendered 'in' or 'to' or 'unto', as it is in the next verse, and in many other places..."
3. "The learned Dr. Lightfoot says, that the words 'unclean' and 'holy' denote not children unlawfully begotten, and lawfully begotten; but Heathenism and Christianism; and thinks the apostle alludes to the distinction often made by the Jews, of the children of proselytes being born in 'holiness', or out of it, that is, either before they became proselytes or after..."

### John Wesley:
1. "For the unbelieving husband hath, in many instances, been sanctified by the wife - Else your children would have been brought up heathens; whereas now they are Christians."
