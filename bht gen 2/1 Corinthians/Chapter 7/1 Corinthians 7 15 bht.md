# 1 Corinthians 7:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A Christian, whether husband or wife, is not obligated to remain in a marriage if the unbelieving spouse chooses to depart. The believer should seek reconciliation and peace, but if it becomes clear that the marriage cannot be restored, they are free to let go and not to be blamed. Being called by God to live in peace, the believer should do everything possible to foster peace in the relationship with an unbelieving spouse.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But if the wish for separation (implied by the present χωρίζεται, is for being separated...)"
2. "Let the unbeliever depart, rather than by attempting to retain the union, endanger that peace of household and peace of spirit, which is part of the calling of a Christian."

2. "In the former case, he is not bound not to separate, if the unbeliever separates or 'departs,' in the latter nothing but 'fornication' justifies separation."
3. "Our Christian calling is one that tends to 'peace,' not quarrelling; therefore the believer should not ordinarily depart from the unbelieving consort...on the one hand; and on the other, in the exceptional case of the unbeliever desiring to depart, the believer is not bound to force the other party to stay in a state of continual discord."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A brother or a sister is not under bondage ... - The sense of the expression “is not bound,” etc. is, that if they forcibly depart, the one that is left is not bound by the marriage tie to make provision for the one that departed; but is at liberty to live separate, and should regard it as proper so to do."
2. "God hath called us to peace - Religion is peaceful. If it cannot be obtained by living together, there should be a peaceful separation... God has called us to live in peace with all if we can. This is the general principle of religion on which we are always to act."
3. "Calvin supposes that if the unbelieving depart, he is to be suffered to do so peaceably rather than to have contention and strife, for God has called us to a life of peace."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A strong word, indicating that Christianity has not made marriage a state of slavery to believers."
2. "The meaning clearly is that willful desertion on the part of the unbelieving husband or wife sets the other party free."
3. "Enslavement in the marriage relation between the believer and the unbeliever is contrary to the spirit and intent of this calling."

### John Calvin:
1. "There is, therefore, in this case a special reason, inasmuch as the first and chief bond is not merely loosed, but even utterly broken through."
2. "Let us, so far as we can, cultivate peace with all, to which we have been called. We must not, therefore, rashly separate from unbelievers unless they first make a divorce."
3. "Believers ought to remain with unbelievers if they are pleased because a desire for divorce is at variance with our profession."

1. "If the unbelieving depart...they are not to be held, but let go; and the deserted person may sit down contented, being not to be blamed, the fault entirely lying upon the deserter." 
2. "A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases...they are free to marry another person, after all proper methods have been tried for a reconciliation, and that appears to be impracticable."
