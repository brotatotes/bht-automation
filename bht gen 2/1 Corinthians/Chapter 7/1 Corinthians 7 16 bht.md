# 1 Corinthians 7:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is uncertain whether one can save their unbelieving partner by staying with them or not. Oftentimes, the outcome is unpredictable, and there is no assurance. However, if there is hope and the possibility of doing good, it is worthwhile to try every means possible before considering separation. It is not impossible for a wife to be the means of saving her husband or for a husband to be the means of the salvation of his wife. Therefore, it is essential to consider the circumstances and be guided by the hope of bringing the unbelieving partner into the faith.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "(Let the unbeliever depart: hazard not for an uncertainty the peace in which you ought to be living as Christians): for what assurance hast thou, O wife, whether thou shalt be the means of thy husband’s conversion? Or what assurance hast thou, O husband, whether thou shalt be the means of thy wife’s conversion?"
2. "This interpretation is the only one compatible with the obvious sense of 1 Corinthians 7:15, and of the expression (not τί οἶδας εἰ μή, but) τί οἶδας εἰ σώσεις; and is also in exact harmony with the general tenor of the Apostle’s argument, which is not to urge a union, but to tolerate a separation."
3. "Stanley; the rest of whose note is deeply interesting as to the historical influence of the verse as commonly misunderstood."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "What knowest thou but that by staying with thy unbelieving partner thou mayest save him or her?" 
2. "Enforcing the precept to stay with the unbelieving consort... So Ruth the Moabitess became a convert to her husband's faith: and Joseph and Moses probably gained over their wives." 
3. "Or else, if thy unbelieving consort wishes to depart, let him go, so that thou mayest live 'in peace': for thou canst not be sure of converting him, so as to make it obligatory on thee at all costs to stay with him against his will."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The reason is, the possibility, or the probability, that the unbelieving party might be converted by the example and entreaties of the other."
2. "This object is of so much importance that the Christian should be willing to submit to much, to bear much, and to bear long, in order that it may be accomplished."
3. "It is not hopeless. Many a wife has thus been the means of saving a husband; many a husband has been the means of the salvation of the wife."

### John Calvin:
1. "An uncertain hope ought not to detain thee... it is a great and distinguished blessing if a wife gain her husband." 
2. "So long, therefore, as there remains any hope of doing good, and the pious wife knows not but that she may by her holy conversation bring back her husband into the way, she ought to try every means before leaving him; for so long as a man’s salvation is doubtful, it becomes us to be prepared rather to hope the best." 
3. "There is no absurdity in it. For as God acts efficaciously by his instruments which he makes use of, he does, in a manner, communicate his power to them, or, at least, he connects it with their service in such a manner, that what he does he speaks of as being done by them."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Is the idea in ε (if) hope of saving the other or fear of not saving and hence peril in continuing the slavery of such a bondage?"
2. "There is no problem at all unless the unbeliever makes it."
3. "If it is a hopeless case, acquiescence is the only wise solution. But surely the believer ought to be sure that there is no hope before he agrees to break the bond."

### John Gill:
1. "For what knowest thou, O wife?... Thou dost not know, thou canst not know, thou canst not be sure, whether thou shall save thy husband?"
2. "There is no likelihood of it, since he is such an implacable enemy to Christ, and so bitterly averse to the Gospel, and the ordinances of it; and therefore since he is determined to separate, even let him go."
3. "How knowest thou, O man, whether thou shall save thy wife? Persons in such a relation have often great influence upon one another, and are by divine Providence often great blessings to each other, in things spiritual as well as temporal."
