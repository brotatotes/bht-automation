# 1 Corinthians 7:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As God has distributed each person's own gift, both in nature and grace, and has called them to their specific station and circumstances in life, it is important for them to walk in obedience to their calling and discharge their duties in that sphere. The gospel does not seek to break or dissolve these relationships, but instead strengthens them, enabling believers to fulfill their responsibilities and do good to others. This is a matter of utmost importance, and one that should be approached with careful consideration.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But (q. d. only be careful not to make this a ground for yourselves causing the separation) as to each (ἑκάστ. ὡς = ὡς ἑκάστ., reff.) the Lord distributed (his lot), as (i.e. ᾖ κλήσει, 1Co 7:20) God has called each, so (in that state, without change) let him walk (reff.)."
2. "Τοῦτο εἶπεν, ἵνα τῷ ἔχειν καὶ ἄλλους κοινωνοὺς προθυμότεροι περὶ τὴν ὑπακοὴν διατεθῶσι."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Caution that believers should not make this direction a ground for separating 'of themselves'."
2. "Let him walk in the path allotted to him and wherein he was called. The heavenly calling does not set aside our earthly callings."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The object of Paul, therefore, is to preserve order, industry, faithfulness in the relations of life, and to show that Christianity does not design to break up the relations of social and domestic contact."
2. "The phrase 'as God hath distributed' refers to the condition in which people are placed in life, whether as rich or poor, in a state of freedom or servitude, of learning or ignorance, etc."
3. "This idea probably prevailed extensively among the Jews. Paul’s object is to show that the gospel, instead of dissolving those relations, only strengthened them, and enabled those who were converted the better to discharge the duties which grow out of them."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "There is to be no enslavement, only, to give no excuse for the reckless abuse of this general principle."
2. "The normal rule of Christian life is that each one should seek to abide in the position in which God has placed him."

### John Calvin:
1. "What, then, is to be done, unless (406) that every one walk according to the grace given to him, and according to his calling?"
2. "Let every one, therefore, labor for this, and use his endeavor, that he may do good to his neighbors, and, more especially, when he ought to be excited to it by the particular duty of his calling."
3. "He mentions two things — the calling, and the measure of grace. These he desires us to look to in deliberating as to this matter; as it ought to be no small stimulus to us to duty, that God condescends to make us ministers of his grace for the salvation of our brethren; while the calling, on the other hand, should hold us, as it were, under God’s yoke, even where an individual feels his situation to be an unpleasant one."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul gives a general principle as a limitation to what he has just said"
2. "He has said that there is to be no compulsory slavery between the believer and the disbeliever"
3. "Each has his lot from the Lord Jesus, has his call from God"

### John Gill:
1. "But as God hath distributed to every man his own proper gift, both as to nature and grace; his proper sphere of usefulness, and the station in which he would have him be, and the place he would have him fill up, and the business he must do in life; so let him act."
2. "As the Lord hath called everyone; which is to be understood of that particular station of life, and those circumstances of it, in which men are providentially placed by God, or are found in when he calls them by his grace."
3. "So let him walk; contented with his station and kind of life, agreeably to the profession he makes of the Gospel, doing all the good he can to those he is concerned with."
