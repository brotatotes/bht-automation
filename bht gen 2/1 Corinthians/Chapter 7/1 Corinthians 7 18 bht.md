# 1 Corinthians 7:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who were circumcised before embracing the faith of Christ need not be concerned about removing this mark, as it no longer holds any significance in terms of salvation. Similarly, Gentiles who are called by grace should not feel compelled to undergo circumcision, for Christ has abolished this practice. It is important to recognize that circumcision comes with a responsibility to uphold the entire law, while in Christ, we find freedom and grace.
