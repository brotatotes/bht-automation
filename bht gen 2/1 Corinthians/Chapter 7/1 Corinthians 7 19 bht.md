# 1 Corinthians 7:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the matter of our justification and acceptance before God, circumcision is of no value and cannot make us righteous or secure our salvation. But what truly matters is obedience to the commandments of God, which is demonstrated by our faith working through love. It is through faith and love that we find the reward of grace, peace of mind, and the presence of God. Obedience to God's commandments, rooted in the gospel, is a fruit of grace, an evidence of our faith and new life in Christ, and brings beauty and profit to our Christian profession.
