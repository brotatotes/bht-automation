# 1 Corinthians 7:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Marriage is recommended as a remedy against the sin of fornication, as it provides a lawful outlet for sexual desire. The institution of marriage ensures that individuals have a partner of their own, avoiding the need for illicit relationships. This instruction also upholds the Christian principle of monogamy, emphasizing that each man should have one wife. By adhering to these teachings, believers can maintain a pure and faithful relationship with their spouse.
