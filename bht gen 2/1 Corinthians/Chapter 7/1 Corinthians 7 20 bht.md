# 1 Corinthians 7:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let each person stay in the same situation in life in which they were called by God, without seeking to change it unless clearly directed by Providence. This teaches the importance of contentment and being satisfied in every condition and station of life. The Christian religion does not demand a change in one's external circumstances, but rather encourages us to find peace and fulfillment where we are.
