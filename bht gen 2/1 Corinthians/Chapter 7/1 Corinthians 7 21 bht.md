# 1 Corinthians 7:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
While it is natural to desire freedom, as a Christian servant, it is important to bear the yoke patiently, serve your master faithfully, and not anxiously seek liberation. Instead, if the occasion arises where you can obtain freedom in a lawful and honorable manner, it would be advisable to embrace the opportunity. However, we should not resort to fraudulent means or dishonesty to escape our circumstances. As followers of Christ, we are called to be content in our existing conditions, trusting that in our union with Him, disparities in worldly status are compensated.
