# 1 Corinthians 7:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the Lord calls a servant, He chooses them out of the ranks of servants and bestows upon them the grace of Christ. This calling results in a spiritual freedom from sin and the law. Even if someone is a slave externally, they are spiritually made free by the Lord. The service of Christ brings perfect freedom, as it is rooted in love. Even those who were previously free should not be proud, but recognize that true liberty comes in serving the Lord. Regardless of our external circumstances, the greatest blessing is to be free from sin through the grace of Christ.
