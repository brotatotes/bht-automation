# 1 Corinthians 7:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Remember that you have been bought with a price and belong to God. Therefore, do not allow yourself to be enslaved by the desires and expectations of others. Instead, strive to live in freedom and obedience to Christ, as He is your true Lord and Master. Be aware that succumbing to the authority of men may lead you down a path of temptation and compromise. Stay steadfast in your devotion to God, for He alone is worthy of your allegiance.
