# 1 Corinthians 7:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Remaining in a given position or condition and abiding with God means conducting oneself in a way that is pleasing to Him, regardless of the circumstances. Believers are urged to remember their shared brotherhood and sisterhood in Christ, as this unity transcends their diverse social status. Recognizing that it is God's will for them to be in a particular place, they should remain content and faithful, knowing that God sees and understands their actions and conduct of life. Abiding with God involves a holy indifference to outward things as believers approach every aspect of life in His immediate presence.
