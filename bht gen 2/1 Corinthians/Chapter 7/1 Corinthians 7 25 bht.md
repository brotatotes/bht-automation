# 1 Corinthians 7:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In regard to this matter, the apostle states that he has not received a direct command from the Lord like he has in other cases. However, it is important to note that the apostles only wrote what was divinely inspired. The apostles had different ways of receiving divine guidance, sometimes through special revelations and other times through the divine light that abided with them. Therefore, the advice given by the apostle is not his private opinion, but a divine rule that should be followed in faith and practice.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The emphasis is on ἐπιταγήν command of the Lord have I none, i.e. no expressed precept."
2. "πιστὸς εἶναι to be faithful, as a steward and dispenser of the hidden things of God."
3. "This sense, which has occurred in the estimate given of himself in this very Epistle, is better than the more general ones of true or believing."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I have no express revelation from the Lord commanding it, but I give my judgment (opinion)"
2. "The Lord inspires me in this case to give you only a recommendation, which you are free to adopt or reject"
3. "He attributes his apostleship and the gifts accompanying it (including inspiration) to God's grace alone"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Not concerning virgins - This commences the “third” subject on which the opinion of Paul seems to have been asked by the church at Corinth - whether it was proper that those who had unmarried daughters, or wards, should give them in marriage."
2. "It is known that that opinion had an early prevalence, and gave rise to the establishment of 'nunneries' in the papal church; an opinion that has everywhere been attended with licentiousness and corruption."
3. "The advice of 'such' a man - a devoted, faithful, self-denying, experienced Christian - is entitled to respectful deference, even where there is no claim to inspiration."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The use of the word 'virgins' for an unmarried man has no warrant in classical usage, and may have arisen from the misinterpretation of Revelation 14:4."
2. "In every other case in the New Testament, the meaning of 'virgins' is unquestionable."


### John Calvin:
1. "He always speaks... conditionally."
2. "He acknowledges that he has no express precept in the law, pointing out who ought to marry, and who not."
3. "Whatever things have been introduced into the Church by human authority, have nothing in common with this advice of Paul."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul did have a command from the Lord as we have in Matthew and Mark. It was quite possible for Paul to know this command of Jesus as he did other sayings of Jesus, even if he had as yet no access to a written gospel or had received no direct revelation on the subject from Jesus."
2. "But Paul had no specific word from Jesus on the subject of virgins. They call for special treatment, young unmarried women only Paul means."
3. "This language, so far from being a disclaimer of inspiration, is an express claim to help from the Lord in the forming of this duly considered judgment, which is in no sense a command, but an inspired opinion."

### John Gill:
1. "I have no commandment of the Lord...but I give my judgment, what will be most advisable, convenient, and prudent to be done." 
2. "The apostle does not make use of his power and authority, as such, to make decrees...only humbly and modestly gives his opinion."
3. "When a man is free and faithful, and openly and honestly tells his mind, it greatly recommends him, and commands attention and regard to what he says."

### John Wesley:
1. "I have no commandment from the Lord — By a particular revelation. Nor was it necessary he should; for the apostles wrote nothing which was not divinely inspired."
2. "but with this difference,-sometimes they had a particular revelation, and a special commandment; at other times they wrote from the divine light which abode with them, the standing treasure of the Spirit of God."
3. "And this, also, was not their private opinion, but a divine rule of faith and practice."
