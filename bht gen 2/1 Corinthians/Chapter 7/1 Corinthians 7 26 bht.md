# 1 Corinthians 7:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In light of the instant necessity and present distress, it is considered more beneficial and advisable for individuals to remain unmarried and lead a single life. This opinion is not a command, but rather advice given by Paul to navigate the trials and persecutions faced by the saints. It is believed that this urgency could be related to the awaited second coming of Jesus. Therefore, regardless of marital status, it is recommended to stay in one's current state, as remaining single is viewed as good and advantageous.
