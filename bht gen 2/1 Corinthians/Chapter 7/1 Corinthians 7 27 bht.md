# 1 Corinthians 7:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Marriage is a sacred and unbreakable bond, only to be dissolved by the death of one of the spouses. It is a mutual obligation that requires both partners to live faithfully and lovingly towards each other. Therefore, it is advised not to seek release from this bond or to actively pursue a new spouse. However, it is important to note that these guidelines are not meant to be universally applicable, but rather reflect the specific circumstances and choices of certain individuals.
