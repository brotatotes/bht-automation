# 1 Corinthians 7:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Marriage is honorable, but it may bring about outward troubles in one's life. However, it is important to note that entering into marriage is not a sin. If a virgin chooses to marry, she has not sinned either. It is important to remember that those who marry may experience various challenges and difficulties. These troubles may include persecution and tribulations faced by believers. In light of this, I aim to spare you from unnecessary hardships by providing this advice.

2. "But if also (καί, of the other alternative: see 1Co 7:21) thou shalt have married, thou didst not sin (viz. when thou marriedst); and if a virgin (if the art. is to stand, it is generic) shall have married, she sinned not; but such persons (viz. οἱ γήμαντες) shall have tribulation in the flesh (it is doubtful, as Meyer remarks, whether the dative belongs to the substantive, trouble for the flesh, or to the verb, shall have in the flesh trouble)."
3. "But I (emphatic my motive is) am sparing you (endeavouring to spare you this θλῖψιν τῇ σαρκί, by advising you to keep single)."
