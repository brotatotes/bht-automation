# 1 Corinthians 7:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The brevity of life is evident, and we must be ready for the Lord's return. We should not be overly attached to worldly relationships or possessions. Whether married or not, we should live with a sense of urgency, prioritizing our spiritual growth and dedicating ourselves to the service of God. Our focus should be on the eternal rather than the temporary.
