# 1 Corinthians 7:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Marriage is not a state of perfection, but a duty requiring mutual benevolence and the fulfillment of marital obligations. Husbands and wives are obligated to engage in conjugal relations, and refusal is only acceptable with a legitimate reason. It is important for couples to understand that their physical relationship is part of their commitment and that withholding or neglecting it can be seen as rebellion. The debt owed to one another should be honored, as it is a fundamental aspect of the marital relationship.
