# 1 Corinthians 7:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christians are called to have a moderate use of sorrow, allowing it to guide them towards piety and not hinder their relationship with God. Instead of finding joy in earthly gains, they should rejoice in the fact that their names are written in heaven and be thankful for what they have. They are reminded to hold their possessions loosely, recognizing that they are merely stewards and not owners. In doing so, they can experience the paradox of being sorrowful yet always rejoicing, tempering their joy with godly fear and knowing their true identity as stewards.

### Henry Alford:
1.  30.   ὡς μὴ κατέχοντες ]  as not POSSESSING (their gains). So in the line of Lucretius (iii. 984), “Vitaque mancupio nulli datur, omnibus usu.”

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Christ specifies as the condemning sin of the men of Sodom not merely their open profligacy, but that 'they bought, they sold,' c., as men whose all was in this world."

2. "But religion will calm the troubled spirit; pour oil on the agitated waves; light up a smile in the midst of tears; cause the beams of a calm and lovely morning to rise on the anxious heart; silence the commotions of the agitated soul, and produce joy even in the midst of sorrow."
3. "O how would this thought silence the voice of unseemly mirth; How would it produce calmness, serenity, heavenly joy, where is now often unhallowed riot; and true peace, where now there is only forced and boisterous revelry!"
