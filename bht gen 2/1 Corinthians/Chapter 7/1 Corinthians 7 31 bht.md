# 1 Corinthians 7:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who are blessed with wealth and abundance should exercise self-control and moderation in their use of worldly possessions, using them only to draw closer to God. We must acknowledge that the beauty and splendor we see in the world is transient, like a passing shadow. It is important to remember that the scenes of this world will soon fade away, giving way to the unchanging reality of eternity.
