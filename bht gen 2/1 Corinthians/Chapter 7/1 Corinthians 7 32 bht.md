# 1 Corinthians 7:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Now, in this brief moment, I want to address you and emphasize the importance of being unburdened. By being free from the weight of worldly concerns, you can fully devote your thoughts and energy to the things of the Lord and how you can bring Him pleasure. This applies especially to those who are unmarried, who have the unique opportunity to focus solely on the Lord's desires. In doing so, they can live a life that is pleasing to Him.
