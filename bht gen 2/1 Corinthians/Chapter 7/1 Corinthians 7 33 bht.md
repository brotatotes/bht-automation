# 1 Corinthians 7:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle warns that being overly concerned with pleasing one's spouse can distract from one's religious obligations. Married individuals must strike a balance between fulfilling their marital duties and their commitment to God. The passage suggests that being too absorbed in worldly concerns can hinder spiritual growth. While the apostle's words do not apply to every married person, it highlights the potential challenges faced when trying to navigate both marital and spiritual responsibilities. This cautionary message indicates that the single life may be more conducive to wholeheartedly serving God without the added concerns of marriage.
