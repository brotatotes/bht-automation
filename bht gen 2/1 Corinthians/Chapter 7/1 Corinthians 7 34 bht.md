# 1 Corinthians 7:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The difference between the married woman and the unmarried woman is similar to the difference between the married man and the unmarried man. The unmarried woman has more advantages for attending to the things of the Lord, while the married woman cares for the things of the world in order to please her husband. The unmarried woman has the opportunity to devote herself to the Lord and strive for holiness in both body and spirit. However, it is important to note that not all unmarried women make proper use of this advantage.
