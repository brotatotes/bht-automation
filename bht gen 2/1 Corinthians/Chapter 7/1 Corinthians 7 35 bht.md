# 1 Corinthians 7:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In advising against mistaking his words as a command, the intention was to suggest what was in their best interest. The aim was not to impose a necessity, but to promote their advantage. He did not wish to cast a snare or obligation upon them, but for their own good. This advice was given so that they could serve the Lord without distraction and with undivided attention. The purpose was to encourage them to wait upon the Lord resolutely and perseveringly, just as Mary sat at the feet of Jesus, attentively listening.
