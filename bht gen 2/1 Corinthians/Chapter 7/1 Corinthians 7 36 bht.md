# 1 Corinthians 7:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If a parent thinks it would be inappropriate to keep his daughter unmarried beyond the appropriate age, he should consider that this would bring shame and disgrace upon her. If the daughter is of marriageable age and desires to marry, there is no reason why the parent should not allow her to do so. In fact, it is better for her to marry than to be left unmarried and face the temptation to sin. It is important for parents to act in a way that is fitting and appropriate for their children's well-being and happiness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Behaveth...uncomely" - not treating his daughter well in leaving her unmarried beyond the flower of her age.
2. "Need so require" - if the exigencies of the case require it; namely, regard to the feelings and welfare of his daughter.
3. "Let them marry" - the daughter and her suitor.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If she pass the flower of her age - If she pass the marriageable age and remains unmarried. It is well known that in the east it was regarded as especially dishonorable to remain unmarried; and the authority of a father, therefore, might be the means of involving his daughter in shame and disgrace."
2. "And need so require - And she ought to be allowed to marry. If it will promote her happiness, and if she would be unhappy, and regarded as dishonored, if she remained in a state of celibacy."
3. "He sinneth not - He errs not; he will do nothing positively wrong in the case. Marriage is lawful, and in this case it is advisable, and he may consent to it, for the reasons above stated, without error or impropriety."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Behaveth himself uncomely [ασχημονειν] . Acts unbecomingly, either by throwing temptation in the daughter's way by constraining her to remain unmarried, or by exposing her to the disgrace which was supposed to attach to the unmarried state." 
2. "Pass the flower of her age [η υπερακμος] . Rev., correctly, be past. Beyond the bloom of life. Plato fixes the point at twenty years ('Republic,' 460). Diogenes Laertius says: 'An undowered maiden is a heavy burden to a father after she has outrun the flower of her age' ('Lycon, ' 5, 65)." 
3. "Let them marry. Evidently there was assumed to be another in the case beside the father and the virgin."

### John Calvin:
1. "Now he still keeps up the distinction, which he has made use of all along, so as to commend celibacy, but, at the same time, to leave marriage as a matter of choice; and not simply a matter of choice, but a needful remedy for incontinency, which ought not to be denied to any one."
2. "Every one therefore should consider what is the part that nature has assigned to him."
3. "Paul reckoned it enough to exempt fathers from blame, that they might not reckon it a cruel thing to subject their daughters to the vexations connected with marriage."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Infinitive in indirect discourse after νομιζε (thinks) with ε (condition of first class, assumed as true)."
2. "Apparently the Corinthians had asked Paul about the duty of a father towards his daughter old enough to marry."
3. "Roman and Greek fathers had the control of the marriage of their daughters."

### John Gill:
1. "if such an one is of opinion,that he behaveth himself uncomely towards his virgin: by exposing her to contempt and reproach, in retaining her at home, and not giving her in marriage when at proper age for such a state."
2. "let parents marry their children when this is the case; let the young men and young women marry who are so disposed; there is no reason why they should not; there is nothing contrary to it in the word of God, nor in the advice of the apostle; nay, according to him, it was much better to marry than to burn, or to be exposed to any snare and temptation."

### John Wesley:
1. "But if any parent think he should otherwise act indecently - Unbecoming his character."
2. "Toward his virgin daughter, if she be above age, (or of full age,) and need so require, 1 Corinthians 7:9, let them marry - Her suitor and she."
