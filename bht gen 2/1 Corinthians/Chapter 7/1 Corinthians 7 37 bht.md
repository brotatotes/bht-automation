A father who stands firm in his purpose, unwavering and determined, has the freedom to make choices concerning his own will and the will of his daughter. He has the ability to decide whether to keep his daughter in an unmarried state, ensuring her spiritual and temporal well-being. This power is given to those who have carefully considered and weighed the matter, without any hesitation or doubts. In such cases, the father is commended for acting in the best interest of his daughter's life.
