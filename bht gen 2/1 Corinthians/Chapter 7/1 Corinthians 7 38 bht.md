# 1 Corinthians 7:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Marriage is seen as a commendable act, as it preserves the virtue and reputation of the daughter and serves the greater good by preventing immorality. However, given the present circumstances and the urgency of the times, staying single is deemed to be more advantageous. This is because it allows individuals to better navigate persecution, be freer from worldly concerns, and dedicate themselves to serving the Lord. Ultimately, whether one chooses to marry or remain single is left as an open question, to be decided based on individual circumstances and discernment.
