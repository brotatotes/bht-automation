# 1 Corinthians 7:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When a woman is married, she is bound to her husband as long as he is alive, that is the law of marriage. However, if her husband passes away, she is free to marry again, but the Apostle Paul emphasizes that this should only be done with someone who shares her faith. This instruction serves as a reminder that believers should seek to marry within the Lord, ensuring that their union is grounded in shared values and a mutual commitment to their faith.
