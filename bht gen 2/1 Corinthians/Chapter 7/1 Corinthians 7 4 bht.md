# 1 Corinthians 7:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In marriage, the husband and wife are united as one body, and their ownership of each other's bodies is transferred through the marriage covenant. In this union, the wife and husband have equal rights and responsibility for one another. They are not to have power over each other's bodies to allow for relations with anyone other than their spouse. It is important to remember the equal nature of this partnership and not use purity or any other pretext to undermine the equality that marriage affirms.

### Henry Alford:
1. "The ground of this being another's while they remain their own, is to be found in the oneness of body, in which the marriage state places them."

### John Gill:
1. "The wife hath not power of her own body...but the husband; he has the sole power over it."
2. "The husband...has not power over his own body...but the wife; she only has a power over it, a right to it, and may claim the use of it."
3. "This power over each other's bodies is not such, as that they may, by consent, either the husband allow the wife, or the wife the husband, to lie with another."

### John Wesley:
1. The wife-the husband — Let no one forget this, on pretence of greater purity.
