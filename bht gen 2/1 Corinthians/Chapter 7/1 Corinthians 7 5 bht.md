# 1 Corinthians 7:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, the advice is given to not deprive one another of the love and intimacy that is due in marriage. This withholding is seen as injustice and a form of defrauding. However, there may be times when temporary separation is necessary for focused prayer and devotion. It is important to be aware that during these times of separation, Satan may attempt to tempt with impure thoughts and actions. Therefore, it is crucial to earnestly devote oneself to prayer and not prolong the separation, to prevent giving opportunity to the enemy.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The pres. σχολάζητε of the rec. would refer to the general habit, and would thus make τῇ προς ., 'your ordinary prayers,' being thus inconsistent with the direction given πρὸς καιρόν: the aorist expresses this temporary purpose, and shews that the prayer meant is not ordinary but extraordinary, seasons of urgent supplication."
2. "The subjunc. still depends on ἵνα the aim of the temporary separation is not that you may keep apart, but for a certain end, and then that you may be united again."
3. "Purpose of the re-union stated, by that which might happen did it not take place. πειράζῃ now is present, not aor., as betokening the danger of a state of abstinence if continued."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Defraud...not—namely, of the conjugal duty 'due'...except it be 'unless perchance.'"
2. "Give yourselves to...be at leisure for...on some special 'season.'"
3. "Satan...often thrusts in his temptations to unholy thoughts amidst the holiest exercises."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Withdraw not from the society of each other." 
2. "The apostle would not have this separation to be perpetual, since it would expose them to many of the evils which the marriage relation was designed to avoid."
3. "That Satan take not advantage of you, and throw you into temptation, and fill you with thoughts and passions which the marriage compact was designed to remedy."

### John Calvin:
1. "If, however, we consider the reasons that influenced him, we shall find that he was under the necessity of speaking of these things."
2. "Let each then be helpful to each other’s necessity, and neither of them act as if at his or her own disposal."
3. "Those, therefore, act a rash part, who give up the use of the marriage bed. It is as if they had made an agreement with God as to perpetual strength."

### Philip Schaff:
1. 1 Corinthians 7:5.  That ye may give yourselves unto prayer. [1]

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "If αν is genuine, it can either be regarded as like εαν though without a verb or as loosely added after ε μητ and construed with it."

### John Gill:
1. "By withholding due benevolence, denying the use of the marriage bed, refusing to pay the conjugal debt... it is a piece of injustice, it is properly a defrauding."

3. "Satan, who knows the temperament and disposition of men and women, may tempt them... a very good reason why, though abstinence from the marriage bed for a short time... ought not to be continued; since Satan may hereby get an advantage over them."

### John Wesley:
