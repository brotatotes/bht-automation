# 1 Corinthians 7:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle provides advice, not a command, regarding the possibility of separating for a time and coming together again. This could be in reference to the earlier mention of abstaining from sexual relations in 1 Corinthians 7:2. He leaves it open for individuals to choose whether to separate or not, based on their own circumstances.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This recommendation all depended on the possibility of their being tempted by incontinence: he gives it not then as a command in all cases, but as an allowance for those to whom he was writing, whom he knew, and assumes, to be thus tempted."
2. "The meaning ‘by permission,’ E. V., is ambiguous, appearing as if it meant by permission of the Lord (to say it)."
3. "That given by Hammond, al., κατὰ τὴν ἐμὴν γνώμην, is philologically inadmissible."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 6. by permission . . . not of
	commandment—not by God's permission to me to say it:
	but, "by way of permission to you, not as a commandment."
	"This" refers to the directions,  :-.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I am 'allowed' to say this; I have no express command on the subject; I give it as my opinion; I do not speak it directly under the influence of divine inspiration."
2. "Paul here does not claim to be under inspiration in these directions which he specifies. But this is no argument against his inspiration in general, but rather the contrary."
3. "I do not claim in this to be under the influence of inspiration; and my counsel here may be regarded, or not, as you may be able to receive it."

### John Calvin:
1. "He adds a limitation — that he had written these things on account of their infirmity — that they may bear in mind that marriage is a remedy for unchastity, lest they should inordinately abuse the advantage of it, so as to gratify their desire by every means; nay more, without measure or modesty."
2. "He has it also in view to meet the cavils of the wicked, that no one might have it in his power to object in this way: 'What! are you afraid that husbands and wives will not of their own accord be sufficiently inclined to carnal delight that you prompt them to it?'"
3. "For even the Papists, those little saints, (381) are offended with this doctrine, and would gladly have a contest with Paul, on the ground of his keeping married persons in mutual cohabitation, and not allowing them to turn aside to a life of celibacy."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But this I say by permission, not of commandment as permissible in the married state..." 
2. "Giving no commandment, for what is suitable in one case may be the reverse in another."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "By way of permission (κατα συνγνωμην). Old word for pardon, concession, indulgence." 
2. "The word means 'knowing together,' understanding, agreement, and so concession." 
3. "Paul has not commanded people to marry. He has left it an open question."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle said this, not of commandment; but, consulting their good, gives this advice, lest Satan should be busy with them, and draw them into sin."
2. "But if they had the gift of continence, they might continue apart longer; there was no precise time fixed by God, nor did the apostle pretend to fix any."
3. "The apostle puts it as a matter of choice, and not of obligation."

### John Wesley:
1. But I say this — Concerning your separating for a time and coming together again. Perhaps he refers also to1Corinthians7:2.
