# 1 Corinthians 7:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For I wish that all people could have the self-control and abstinence as I do. I desire that all believers who are unmarried would be able to remain celibate like me, for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Just as Paul has experienced the sweetness of this liberty, he desires others to experience it too. However, it is important to remember that every individual has their own unique gift from God. As our Lord said, not everyone can receive this gift of celibacy, except those to whom it has been given.
