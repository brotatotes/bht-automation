# 1 Corinthians 7:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Stating that it is good for them to remain unmarried, St. Paul proposes himself as an example, having known both the married and single state. Being unmarried allows for fewer burdens and more time to serve the Lord. In fact, it seems clear that he himself was single, and it is unlikely that this declaration relates to a state of persecution. However, it should be noted that remaining unmarried is a personal decision that should consider individual circumstances and discernment.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The stress is on λέγω, not on τοῖς ἀγάμοις κ. ταῖς χήραις, which would in that case be placed first, as τοῖς γεγαμηκόσιν below." 
2. "τοῖς ἀγάμοις, the unmarried, of both sexes: not as usually interpreted, widowers, or unmarried males alone: this is shown by the contrasted term γεγαμηκόσιν, which embraces both sexes."
3. "ὡς κἀγώ, i.e. ἄγαμος. This brings the Apostle’s own circumstances more clearly before us than 1 Corinthians 7:7, which might be misunderstood: and there can be little doubt from this, that he never was married."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

	1 Corinthians 7:11). 
	and widows—in
	particular. 
	even as I—unmarried
	(1 Corinthians 9:5).

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It may be advisable, in the present circumstances of persecution and distress, not to be encumbered with the cares and anxieties of a family."
2. "The reason of this distinction seems to be, that he considers more particularly the case of those females who had never been married."

### John Calvin:

2. "Hence those who make a vow of continency, act precisely as if any unlearned and illiterate person were to set himself off as a prophet, or teacher, or interpreter of languages."
3. "Let us, then, imitate his example, so that if we excel in any particular gift, we do not rigorously insist upon it on the part of others, who have not as yet reached that height."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

### John Gill:
1. "It is good for them if they abide; unmarried, and do not change their condition any more... they would be more free from the cares of life, have less trouble, and be more at leisure to serve the Lord."
2. "even as I; that is, as he was then; for at that time it seems certain that he had no wife... the former seems most agreeable, since he proposes himself as an example to widowers and widows; and having known what a married and single state both were, was better able to give his judgment of both, and proper advice to such persons which must come with more force and strength, and a better grace, from such an one."

### John Wesley:
1. "It is good for them if they remain even as I." 
2. "St. Paul was then single is certain and from Acts 7:58, compared with the following parts of the history, it seems probable that he always was so."
