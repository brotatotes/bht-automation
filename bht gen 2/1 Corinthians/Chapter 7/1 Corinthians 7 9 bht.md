# 1 Corinthians 7:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If believers lack self-control and struggle to abstain from sexual desires, it is advised that they enter into marriage rather than be consumed by burning passions. This command to marry is not mere advice, but a necessary remedy to prevent falling into sin. By entering into the marriage covenant, individuals find relief from the turmoil caused by unfulfilled desires and bring honor to God by directing their passions within the boundaries of a committed relationship. Though marriage may come with challenges, it is a far better choice than succumbing to the destructive consequences of indulging in lustful temptations.
