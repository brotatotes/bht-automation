# 1 Corinthians 8:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Knowledge is not enough on its own; it needs to be accompanied by love. Mere knowledge without love can lead to pride and self-reliance, while love builds up and edifies. It is important to respect and consider the feelings of others who may not have the same understanding or knowledge. True knowledge is not about exerting superiority or showing off, but rather about seeking the welfare of others and being considerate in our actions. Love is the guiding principle that helps us make the right choices and edify those around us.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Christians were thus in continual danger of meeting with such remnants. Partaking of them was an abomination among the Jews."
2. "But it also shows how little such decisions were at that time regarded as lastingly binding on the whole church: and how fully competent it was, even during the lifetime of the Apostles, to Christians to open and question, on its own merits, a matter which they had, for a special purpose, once already decided."
3. "From ἡ γν . to the end of 1 Corinthians 8:3 (see above) is a logical parenthesis."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Though to those knowing that an idol has no existence, the question of eating meats offered to idols might seem unimportant, it is not so with some, and the infirmities of such should be respected."
2. "Knowledge puffeth up—when without 'love.'"
3. "Edifying is to please one's neighbor. Knowledge only says, All things are lawful for me; Love adds, But all things do not edify."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Mere knowledge, or science, when the heart is not right, fills with pride; swells a man with vain self-confidence and reliance in his own powers, and very often leads him entirely astray."
2. "Knowledge combined with right feelings, with pure principles, with a heart filled with love to God and human beings, may be trusted: but not mere intellectual attainments; mere abstract science; the mere cultivation of the intellect."
3. "The doctrine is, that love to God and to each other is a better guide in determining what to do than mere knowledge. And it is so. It will prompt us to seek the welfare of others, and to avoid what would injure them. It will make us tender, affectionate, and kind; and will better tell us what to do, and how to do it in the best way, than all the abstract knowledge that is conceivable."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The contrast is striking between puffing up and building up - a bubble and a building."
2. "We know, to use your own words, that we all have knowledge."
3. "The arrangement of the text is in question... It seems best to begin this parenthesis with knowledge puffeth up, and to end it with known of him."

### John Calvin:
1. "This passage, which otherwise is somewhat obscure, in consequence of its brevity, may easily be understood in this way — 'Whatever is devoid of love is of no account in the sight of God; nay more, it is displeasing to him, and much more so what is openly at variance with love.' "
2. "Paul... simply meant to show what effect knowledge has in an individual, that has not the fear of God, and love of the brethren; for the wicked abuse all the gifts of God, so as to exalt themselves... as love is its true seasoning, where that is wanting it is tasteless."
3. "At the same time, knowledge is not by any means to be blamed for this, any more than a sword, if it falls into the hands of a madman."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Ye plead your knowledge; we are at one with you there; but this is a question, not of knowledge, but of love."
2. "Knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth."
3. "The knowing are apt to put on an air of superiority to their less knowing brethren, whereas love identifying itself by sympathy with all akin to itself, whether more or less enlightened, cements them like stones in one building."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "By ειδωλοθυτα was meant the portion of the flesh left over after the heathen sacrifices."
2. "There was evidently difference of opinion on the subject among the Corinthian Christians. Aspects of the matter come forward not touched on in the Jerusalem Conference to which Paul does not here allude, though he does treat it in Galatians 2:1-10."
3. "Paul admits that all Christians have this knowledge (personal experience, γνωσις), but this problem cannot be solved by knowledge."

### John Gill:
1. "We know that we all have knowledge;...the apostles and other Christians knew, and were conscious to themselves of their light and knowledge, and were assured, and might affirm with confidence, that they all... had the same knowledge of Christian liberty as they had..."
2. "Knowledge puffeth up; not true knowledge...but a mere show of knowledge, knowledge in conceit, mere notional and speculative knowledge, that which is destitute of charity or love."
3. "But charity edifieth; that is, a man that has knowledge, joined with love to God, and his fellow Christians, will seek for that which makes for the edification of others; and without this all his knowledge will be of no avail, and he himself be nothing."

### John Wesley:
1. "Knowledge without love always puffeth up."
2. "Love alone edifies - Builds us up in holiness."
