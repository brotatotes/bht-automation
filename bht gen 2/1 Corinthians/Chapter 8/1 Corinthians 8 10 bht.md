# 1 Corinthians 8:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If someone sees you, who is knowledgeable, eating in the idol's temple, they may interpret it as a sign that there is no issue with consuming meat offered to idols. This could embolden them to go against their own conscience and consume such meat, even though they consider it wrong.

3. "οἰκοδομηθήσεται is not a vox media, but as Meyer and De Wette, ædificabitur, not without a certain irony, seeing it is accompanied by ἀσθενοῦς ὄντος, for thus the building up would be without solid foundation a ruinosa ædificatio, as Calv."
