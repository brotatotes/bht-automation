# 1 Corinthians 8:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through our knowledge, we must not let our actions cause harm to our weaker brothers, even causing them to suffer spiritually and possibly perish. This should serve as a reminder that even the smallest actions can have significant consequences. We must be cautious not to use our knowledge in a way that causes harm or leads others astray. It is vital that we remember the immense value of our brothers, for whom Christ died, and strive to act in a way that honors His sacrifice.
