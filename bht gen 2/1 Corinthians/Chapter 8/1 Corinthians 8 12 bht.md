# 1 Corinthians 8:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through their actions, they not only violate the new commandment of love but also sin against Christ Himself, since their fellow believers are members of His body. By neglecting to show love and consideration towards their brethren, they fail to recognize the close bond that exists between Christ and His followers. Thus, their sin carries a weighty significance, as it directly harms the very body that Christ sacrificed Himself for.
