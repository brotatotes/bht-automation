# 1 Corinthians 8:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If anyone arrogantly believes that they possess knowledge, they fail to realize their own ignorance and lack of understanding. True knowledge is not just about acquiring facts, but about the humility to recognize our own limitations and to approach learning with a heart of love and compassion. Without love, knowledge becomes empty and devoid of true meaning. It is through divine love that we are able to truly grasp the depth of knowledge, and it is only when we approach knowledge with love that we are able to use it for the betterment of others and the world around us.
