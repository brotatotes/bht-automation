# 1 Corinthians 8:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The one who loves God is not only known by Him, signifying approval and affection, but is also the recipient of divine knowledge and increased spiritual understanding. This love for God is not merely shown in the affectionate regard for others, but also in the use of knowledge for edification rather than destruction. In this way, the believer is highly esteemed and beloved by God, who manifests His love and will ultimately vindicate and acknowledge them in the future, while those who are proud and unloving will face rejection.
