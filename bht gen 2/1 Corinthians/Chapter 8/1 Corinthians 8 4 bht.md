# 1 Corinthians 8:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We Christians understand that an idol is simply a name or representation, lacking true divinity, virtue, or power. It holds no weight or significance in the world.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We know that there is no idol in the world, i.e. that the εἴδωλα of the heathen (meaning not strictly the images, but the persons represented by them) have no existence in the world."
2. "That they who worship idols, worship devils, the Apostle himself asserts ch. 1 Corinthians 10:20; but that is no contradiction to the present sentence, which asserts that the deities imagined by them, Jupiter, Apollo, &c., have absolutely no existence."
3. "And that there is no god, but One: the insertion of ἕτερος has probably been occasioned by the first commandment, οὐκ ἔσονταί σοι θεοὶ ἕτεροι πλὴν ἐμοῦ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "idol is nothing—has no true being at all, the god it represents is not a living reality."
2. "This does not contradict 1 Corinthians 8:1- :, which states that they who worship idols, worship devils for here it is the GODS"
3. "none other God—The oldest manuscripts omit the word 'other'; which gives a clearer sense."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We fully admit, and know, that the whole thing is delusive; and there can be no danger that, by partaking of the food offered in sacrifice to them, we should ever be brought to a belief of the stupendous falsehood that they are true objects of worship, or to deny the true God."
2. "There may have been a reference here to the name of an idol among the Hebrews. They called idols אלילים 'ĕlı̂yliym (Elilim), or in the singular אליל 'ĕlı̂yl (Elil}, vain, null, nothingworth, nothingness, vanity, weakness, etc.; indicating their vanity and powerlessness."
3. "And that there is none other God but one - This was a great cardinal truth of religion; see the note at Mark 12:29; compare Deuteronomy 6:4-5. To keep this great truth in mind was the grand object of the Jewish economy." (82 words)

### John Calvin:
1. "He condemns, in general, that contemptuous knowledge which is not seasoned with love."
2. "For the reason why an idol is nothing is, that it must be estimated according to the thing that it represents."
3. "Hence οὐδεν (nothing) refers not to essence, but to quality — for an idol is made of some substance — either silver, or wood, or stone; but as God does not choose to be represented in this way, it is vanity and nothing as to meaning and use."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "No idol is anything in the world... If the god has no existence, the idol is a non-entity." 
2. "This Christians held as firmly as Jews. The worship of Jesus as God's Son and the Holy Spirit does not recognize three Gods, but one God in three Persons." 
3. "The cosmos, the ordered universe, can only be ruled by one God."

### John Gill:
1. "We Christians are not bound by these decrees; we know that an idol is nothing in the world; among the things created by God in the world; for though the matter of it may be of God, the form is of men."
2. "Though it may have an existence, as the sun, moon, and stars, yet not divinity; and in that sense nothing."
3. "Believers know, both from reason and revelation, from the books of the Old and New Testament, that there is but one God, and consequently that idols are nothing, and that they cannot defile them, nor anything that is offered to them."

### John Wesley:
1. We know that an idol is nothing — A mere nominal god, having no divinity, virtue, or power.
