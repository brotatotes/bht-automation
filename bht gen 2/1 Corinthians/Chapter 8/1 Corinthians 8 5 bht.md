# 1 Corinthians 8:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
There are many beings that are called gods, whether celestial, terrestrial, or infernal deities. This includes angels and magistrates, as well as idols that were worshipped by different cultures. However, it is important to recognize that these so-called gods are not truly divine and should not be worshiped or given divine honors.

1. "The emphasis should be placed on the word 'many;' and the design of the parenthesis is, to show that the number of these that were worshipped was not a few, but was immense; and that they were in fact worshipped as gods, and allowed to have the influence over their minds and lives which they would have if they were real."
