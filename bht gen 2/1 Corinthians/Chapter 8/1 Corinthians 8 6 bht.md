# 1 Corinthians 8:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To us, Christians, there is one God, and this is a belief shared by Jews and philosophers alike. This one God, who possesses countless perfections, is the source and goal of everything in the universe. He is the Father of spirits and the creator of all beings. In addition, we acknowledge one Lord, Jesus Christ, who is both the object of our worship and the mediator through whom we have access to the Father. Through Christ, we receive all spiritual blessings and are united with the one true God.
