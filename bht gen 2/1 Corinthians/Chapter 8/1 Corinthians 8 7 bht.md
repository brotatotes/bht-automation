# 1 Corinthians 8:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Though it is true that having knowledge allows us to understand that all meats are neutral, not everyone possesses this understanding. Some Christians, particularly those who were once idol-worshippers, still believe in the existence of idols and feel that eating meat offered to idols is sinful. It is important for those who have knowledge to consider their weaker brethren, who lack understanding and are still influenced by their past beliefs. By being mindful of the conscience of others, we can avoid leading them into any actions that may go against their beliefs and defile their conscience.

### Henry Alford:
1. "But not in all is the knowledge, but some through their consciousness to this day, of the idol, eat it as offered to an idol, and their conscience, in that it is weak, is defiled."

3. "Had they been Jewish converts, it would not have been συνείδησις τοῦ εἰδώλου which would have troubled them, but apparent violation of the Mosaic law."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Though to us who 'have knowledge' all meats are indifferent, yet 'this knowledge is not in all' in the same degree as we have it."
2. "Some Gentile Christians, whether from old association of ideas or misdirected conscience, when they ate such meats, ate them with some feeling as if the idol were something real and had changed the meats by the fact of the consecration into something either holy or else polluted."
3. "If they ate it unconscious at the time that it had been offered to idols, there would be no defilement of conscience. But conscious of what it was, and not having such knowledge as other Corinthians boasted of...they by eating them sin against conscience."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Though this might be generally true, yet it was not universally; for that some were ignorant on this subject, and supposed that an idol had a real existence, and that to partake of that meat would be to confirm them in their superstition." 
2. "We are to bear in mind that the pagan were exceedingly ignorant; and that their former notions and superstitious feelings about the gods whom their fathers worshipped, and whom they had adored, would not soon leave them even on their conversion to Christianity."

### John Calvin:
1. "You have, it is true, a correct judgment in the sight of God, and if you were alone in the world, it would be as lawful for you to eat of things offered to idols, as of any other kinds of food. But consider your brethren, to whom you are debtors. You have knowledge; they are ignorant, Your actions ought to be regulated not merely according to your knowledge, but also according to their ignorance."
2. "This is the kind of offense that Paul reproves in the Corinthians — when we induce weak brethren, by our example, to venture upon anything against their conscience."
3. "For as the excellence of actions depends on the fear of God and integrity of conscience, so, on the other hand, there is no action, that is so good in appearance, as not to be polluted by a corrupt affection of the mind."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The 'weak' here are Gentile converts who, being steeped in idolatry up to the time of their conversion, were unable as yet to shake off the impression that the idol, which by them had so long been regarded as a god, had after all something divine in it."
2. "In this view, the argument is, that when such weak brethren saw their stronger-minded brethren openly partaking of meat known to have been sacrificed to an idol, they would be emboldened by their example to do the same, while still regarding the act as idolatrous, and so would defile their conscience."
3. "The received text here reads, 'from conscience of the idol;' and Meyer and Alford think this right. But the above reading is decidedly better supported, and it is the text of Griesbach. Lachmann, Tregelles, and Tischendorf."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Knowledge has to overcome inheritance and environment, prejudice, fear, and many other hindrances."
2. "They eat it 'as an idol sacrifice,' though they no longer believe in idols. The idol-taint clings in their minds to this meat."
3. "Even if unenlightened, one must act according to his conscience, a sensitive gauge to one's spiritual condition."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle is not speaking of Heathens, in whom there was no knowledge of the one true God, the author of all things, and of the one Lord Jesus, the only saviour and Redeemer; but of Christians, in whom there was the knowledge of these things, but not in all of them." 
2. "It became those who had more knowledge to be careful how they laid stumblingblocks in the way of such, to the prejudice of their consciences."
3. "Because such act against the dictates of their own conscience; which, though weak, is binding, and sinned against, defiles."

### John Wesley:
1. "Some eat, with consciousness of the idol — That is, fancying it is something, and that it makes the meat unlawful to be eaten."
2. "And their conscience, being weak — Not rightly informed."
3. "Is defiled — contracts guilt by doing it."
