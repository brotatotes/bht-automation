# 1 Corinthians 8:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Meat, whether eaten or not, does not commend us to God. It is not a matter that carries spiritual weight or influences our standing before Him. The actions of eating or abstaining from meat are purely indifferent and have no bearing on our relationship with God. Our love for one another and obedience to His commands are what truly matter in our faith.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Reason why we should accommodate ourselves to the prejudices of the weak in this matter: because it is not one in which any spiritual advantage is to be gained, but one perfectly indifferent."
2. "The δέ carries on the argument."
3. "Bengel remarks... that παραστήσει is a verbum μέσον, after which may follow a good or a bad predicate: will not affect our (future) standing before God; and to this indifferent meaning of παραστήσει answers the antithetic alternative which follows."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Neither if we do not eat, are we the better: neither if we eat are we the worse": the language of the eaters who justified their eating thus.</br>
2. "In English Version Paul admits that 'meat neither presents [so the Greek for 'commendeth'] us as commended nor as disapproved before God': it does not affect our standing before God (Romans 14:6)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Religion is of a deeper and more spiritual nature than a mere regard to circumstances like these."
2. "The mere circumstance of eating ‘meat,’ or abstaining from it, cannot make a man better or worse in the sight of a holy God."
3. "God does not regard this as a matter of importance. He does not make his favor depend on unimportant circumstances like this."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Commendeth - not [ου παραστησει] . Lit., present. Rev., more correctly, will not commend. See on shewed himself, Acts 1:3.

### John Calvin:
1. "In the use of them [foods], a regard to the claims of love is included."
2. "It is, therefore, certain, that meat recommendeth us not to God; and Paul acknowledges this, but he states this exception, that love is recommended to us by God, which it were criminal to overlook."
3. "The kingdom of God, which is spiritual, does not consist in these outward observances, and therefore, that things indifferent are in themselves of no importance in the sight of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But meat will not commend us to God: neither, if we eat, are we the better; nor if we eat not, are we the worse."
2. "The order of these clauses is reversed in some texts; but as the evidence is pretty equally balanced, the sense precisely the same, and the matter of no importance either way, the natural English order may be adhered to."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Food will not give us an entree to God for commendation or condemnation." 
2. "Are we left behind, do we fall short." 
3. "Paul here disposes of the pride of knowledge and the pride of prejudice."

### John Gill:
1. "Eating of meat, any sort of meat, and so that which is offered to idols, or abstinence from it, neither one nor the other recommends any to the love and favour of God."
2. "Does not ingratiate any into his affectionate regards, or make them acceptable unto him."
3. "True grace and piety are not a whit the less; nor are such persons less in the love and favour of God, which is not to be known and judged of by any such action, or the omission of it."

### John Wesley:
1. But meat commendeth us not to God — Neither by eating, nor by refraining from it. Eating and not eating are in themselves things merely indifferent.
