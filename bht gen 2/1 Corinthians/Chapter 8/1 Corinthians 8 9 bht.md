# 1 Corinthians 8:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Beware of letting your freedom in matters of personal choice become an obstacle to those who are weaker in faith. It is important to exercise caution so as not to offend or cause others to stumble. This does not mean that you cannot enjoy your liberty, but rather that you should be mindful of how it may be misused or abused.
