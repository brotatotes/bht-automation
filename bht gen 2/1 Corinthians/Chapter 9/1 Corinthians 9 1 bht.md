# 1 Corinthians 9:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? These questions emphasize the apostle's independence and unique authority as a witness of the Lord Jesus. The Corinthians should recognize that his apostleship is not inferior to any other, as the requirement for apostleship was to have seen Jesus Christ personally. In fact, the Corinthians themselves are proof of his apostleship, as they have been converted through his work in the Lord. Despite having the right to receive support from the churches, he voluntarily foregoes this privilege, showing his selflessness and dedication to the Gospel.

3. "He makes mention, also, afterwards of this vision, (1 Corinthians 15:8,) and mention is made of it twice in the Acts, (Acts 9:3, and Acts 22:6.)
