# 1 Corinthians 9:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who engage in the work of God's kingdom ought to do so with hope, just as the plowman hopes for a bountiful harvest. Similarly, the one who threshes the grain should expect to partake in the fruits of their labor. This principle, seen in the commandment about not muzzling the ox, applies not only to physical labor but also to those who labor in God's spiritual field. Just as the ox should not be deprived of the opportunity to eat while working, those who serve the Lord should not be denied their rightful support and sustenance.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The command (not to muzzle, &c.) was written on account of us (Christian teachers) because we ploughers (in the γεώργιον θεοῦ, ch. 1Co 3:9) ought to plough in hope, and we threshers (answering to the βοῦς ἀλοῶν) ought to work in hope of (as the ox) having a share." 
2. "The words used in this sentence are evidently spiritual, and not literal. They are inseparably connected with διʼ ἡμᾶς which precedes them: and according to the common explanation of them as referring to a mere maxim of agricultural life, would have no force whatever."
3. "The plougher (not literal but spiritual) ought to plough in hope, and the thresher (to thresh, see var. readd.) in hope of partaking (of the crop)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Does he (the divine lawgiver) by all means say it for our sakes?"
2. "The obligation rests with the people not to let their minister labor without remuneration."
3. "He that thresheth (should or ought to thresh) in the hope of partaking" (namely, of the fruit of his threshing)."

3. "He that thresheth 'ought' to partake of his hope; that is, of the fruits of his hope, or of the result of his labor. It is fair and right that he should enjoy the fruits of his toil."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Altogether [παντως] . Better, as Rev., in margin, as He doubtless doth, or, as American Rev., assuredly."
2. "Resting on hope. Compare Aeschylus: 'When hope has raised me up on strength [επ αλκας]; i.e. elated me with confidence' ("Choephoroe," 407)."

### John Calvin:

2. "The point is that all the workers (beast or man) share in the fruit of the toil."

### John Gill:
1. "God says this, or delivers out this law, forbidding the muzzling the ox, while it treads out the corn; not merely for the sake of the ox, but chiefly for the sake of men."
2. "The intention of the command is [...] 'but for the sake of men', he (God) says this, whom he would accustom to meekness and compassion."
3. "This law is elsewhere produced by the apostle, and urged in favour of the maintenance of ministers, as here, and therefore for our sakes no doubt it is written."

### John Wesley:
1. "He who ploweth ought to plow in hope — Of reaping."
