# 1 Corinthians 9:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Is it a great matter if we, who have sown the invaluable treasures of the Spirit, receive from you the things necessary for our sustenance? The response to the Gospel message varies just like the ground's response to sowing, with some receiving and bearing fruit. The ministry of the word requires skill and art, despite the challenges faced. The Gospel message itself is spiritual and concerns the eternal welfare of souls. Do you offer us things of greater value than what we have imparted to you?

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The ἡμεῖς ἡμεῖς, being identical, stand out in so much the stronger relief against the triple antithesis, ὑμῖν, πνευματικά, ἐσπείραμεν, and ὑμων, σαρκικά, θερίσωμεν." 
2. "The first [referring to πνευμ.] are so called as belonging to the spirit of man (De W. and Meyer, as coming from the Spirit of God; but it is better to keep the antithesis exact and perspicuous), the second [referring to σαρκ.] as serving for the nourishment of the flesh."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "WE, the same persons who have sown to you the infinitely more precious treasures of the Spirit."
2. "We may at least claim in return what is the only thing you have to give, namely, the goods that nourish the flesh."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We impart blessings of more value than we receive... And can it be made a matter of question whether all these high and exalted hopes are of as much value to dying man as the small amount which shall be needful to minister to the needs of those who are the means of imparting these blessings?" 
2. "No physician, no farmer, no mechanic, could accomplish much, if his attention was constantly turned off from his appropriate business to engage in something else. And how can the minister of the gospel, if his time is nearly all taken up in laboring to provide for the needs of his family?"
3. "The promotion of order, peace, sobriety, industry, education, and regularity in business, and honesty in contracting and in paying debts, saves much more to the community at large than the cost of the support of the gospel."

### John Calvin:
1. "Though food and clothing are not of the same nature with a minister’s labors, what injury do you sustain, if you recompense what is inestimable with a thing that is small and contemptible?"
2. "For in proportion to the superiority of the soul above the body, does the word of the Lord excel outward sustenance, inasmuch as it is the food of the soul."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Is it a great matter?"
2. "Note two conditions of first class with ε, both assumed to be true."
3. "On πνευματικα and σαρκικα see on 1 Corinthians 2:14; 1 Corinthians 3:3."

### John Gill:
1. "The ground they sow upon is, very various... others are like the good ground, who are made good by the grace of God, understand the word, receive it, hold it fast, and in whom it is fruitful." 
2. "Sowing requires skill and art, and so preaching the Gospel does... and so the ministry of the word, notwithstanding all reproaches, persecutions, and afflictions."
3. "The matter of the Gospel is spiritual... and are what concern the souls and spirits of men, and their spiritual and eternal welfare."

### John Wesley:
1. "Is it a great matter if we shall reap as much of your carnal things — As is needful for our sustenance?"
2. "Do you give us things of greater value than those you receive from us?"
