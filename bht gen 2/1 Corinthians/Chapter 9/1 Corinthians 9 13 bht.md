# 1 Corinthians 9:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Gospel ministers should be provided for with a suitable maintenance, just as those who ministered about holy things in the temple were supported by the offerings and resources of the temple. Like the priests and Levites who continually carried out their various duties, it is fitting that ministers today should be supported in their work. It is both just and equitable for those engaged in the service of God to receive a livelihood from the work they do in the ministry of the Gospel.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "minister about holy things—the Jewish priests and Levites."
2. "partakers with the altar—a part of the victims going to the service of the altar, and the rest being shared by the priests."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The argument of the apostle here is this: 'As the ministers of religion under the Jewish dispensation were entitled to support by the authority and the law of God, that fact settles a general principle which is applicable also to the gospel, that he intends that the ministers of religion should derive their support in their work.'"
2. "If it was reasonable then, it is reasonable now. If God commanded it then, it is to be presumed that he intends to require it now."
3. "From these offerings the priest derived their maintenance."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Minister [εργαζομενοι]. Lit, work or perform. Never in classical Greek of being engaged in sacred rites."
2. "Wait [παρεδρευοντες]. Etymologically akin to paredrov sitting beside. See on ch. 1 Corinthians 7:35."
3. "Altar [θυσιαστηριω]. See on Acts 17:23."

### John Calvin:
1. "For if Paul had not of his own accord refrained from using his liberty, there was a risk of the progress of the gospel being obstructed."
2. "The Levitical priests were ministers of the Israelitish Church; the Lord appointed them sustenance from their ministry; hence in ministers of the Christian Church the same equity must be observed at the present day."
3. "Hence a distinction must be made between the ancient priesthood and that of the present day. Priests under the law were set apart to preside over the sacrifices, to serve the altar, and to take care of the tabernacle and temple. Those at the present day are set apart to preach the word and to dispense the sacraments."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Know ye not that they which minister about sacred things eat of the things of the temple?" 
2. "The Gentile converts are supposed to be aware of this, mixing constantly with their Jewish fellow-converts, not to speak of their presumed acquaintance to that extent with the Old Testament; and the practice in their own pagan worship was analogous."
3. "And they which wait upon the altar have their portion with the altar? certain parts of the victim expressly reserved for their use."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Sacred things. Of the temple. Play on the same word sacred." 
2. "This is a very pertinent illustration." 
3. "They which wait upon the altar. Old word, to sit beside, and so constant attendance."

### John Gill:
1. "Do ye not know, that they which minister about holy things...live of the things of the temple..." 
2. "...the priests and Levites always stood in their ministry, some doing one thing, and some another..." 
3. "...as it was but just and equitable that persons so employed should be maintained out of the revenues of the temple and altar, it is but right that Gospel ministers should be provided for with a suitable maintenance."
