# 1 Corinthians 9:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As the Lord Jesus instructed his disciples, those who faithfully bring the good news of salvation to sinners are ordained by Christ to be provided with a comfortable living. Although the manner of provision may differ from the priests and Levites of the Old Testament, it is just and right that those who preach the Gospel receive their sustenance from it. The work of proclaiming the Gospel merits a sufficient supply of the necessities of life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "So also did the Lord command to those who are preaching the gospel, to live of the gospel."
2. "Here the Apostle is establishing an analogy between the rights of the sacrificing priests of the law, and of the preachers of the gospel."
3. "As all such allusion is omitted, we may fairly infer that no such character of the Christian minister was then known."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The only inference to be drawn from this passage is, not that the Christian ministry is of a sacrificial character as the Jewish priesthood, but simply, that as the latter was supported by the contributions of the people, so should the former."
2. "The stipends of the clergy were at first from voluntary offerings at the Lord's Supper."
3. "The duty of the Christian minister is plainly marked as preaching the gospel, in contrast to the ministering about sacrifices and waiting at the altar of the Jewish priesthood and Levites."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Hath the Lord ordained - Hath the Lord appointed, commanded, 'arranged' that it should be so (διέταξε dietaxe). The word here means that he has made this a law, or has required it."
2. "The man may be said to 'live in the gospel' who is supported while he preaches it, or who derives his maintenance in that work."
3. "And if this is a command, then the minister is entitled to a support; and then also a people are not at liberty to withhold it. Further, there are as strong reasons why they should support him, as there are why they should pay a schoolmaster, a lawyer, a physician, or a day-laborer."

### John Gill:
1. "It is the ordination of Christ, that such who faithfully bring the news and glad tidings of salvation to sinners, should, as a reward for such good news, be provided for with a comfortable maintenance, on which they should live."
2. "He has not indeed fixed it in the same way as the priests and Levites had theirs under the law; but as the one was just and right, that they should be maintained out of the things belonging to the temple and altar, and live on them, so it is his will and pleasure, that they which preach the Gospel should live of the Gospel."
3. "In consideration and because of their preaching the Gospel, they should be supplied with the proper necessaries of life."
