# 1 Corinthians 9:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is evident that Paul, in his strong language, is passionately expressing that he would rather die than give his opponents any grounds to accuse him. He firmly asserts that his refusal to accept support from the Corinthians is not for his own benefit, but to establish his integrity and to refute any insinuations made against his character. The sincerity of his motive is such that he considers it a matter of life and death, prioritizing the purity of his ministry above his own well-being.
