# 1 Corinthians 9:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If I do this willingly, without seeking any reward or temporal benefits for preaching, I can rejoice in serving selflessly and vindicate the purity of my motives. However, if I don't do it willingly, I am still entrusted with the stewardship of preaching the Gospel, even if I may dislike it. The Gospel was committed to me as a responsibility, not of my own choosing but by the command of the Lord. Therefore, I cannot refrain from fulfilling this dispensation that has been entrusted to me.
