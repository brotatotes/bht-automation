# 1 Corinthians 9:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
What then is my reward? It is the unique aspect of my conduct, for which I anticipate a special reward from my Lord. That aspect is that I do not abuse my power in preaching the gospel, but rather make the gospel of Christ without charge, so that I do not take advantage of my authority unnecessarily.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "His making the gospel to be without cost, was not his μισθός, but his καύχημα only: and these two are not identical."
2. "The καύχημα was present: the μισθός, future."
3. "What then is my reward (in prospect) that I [in order not to use] my power in the gospel, while preaching, render the gospel without cost?"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "What is my reward?... that by making the Gospel without charge, where I might have rightfully claimed maintenance, I might 'win the more'." 
2. "That I use not to the full my power." This is his matter for "glorying"; the "reward" ultimately aimed at is the gaining of the more. 
3. "The 'reward' is that which is the ultimate aim of his preaching without charge, namely, that he may gain the more; it was for this end, not to have matter of glorying, that he did so."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "What is there that will demonstrate that my heart is in the work of the ministry...that I am not urged by mere necessity?"
2. "I will support myself by my own labor, and will thus show that I am not urged to preaching by mere 'necessity,' but that I love it."
3. "All that this case proves is, that it would be proper only where a 'necessity' was laid on a man, as it was on Paul; when he could not otherwise show that his heart was in the work, and that he was voluntary and loved it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Abuse [καταχρησασθαι] . See on ch. 1 Corinthians 7:31. Rev., correctly, use to the full.

### John Calvin:
1. "But it is not enough to preach, unless I do it willingly; for he who fulfills the commandment of God unwillingly, does not act, as becomes him, suitably to his office."
2. "For I ask: 'Is it not the part of a good pastor to remove occasions of offense, so far as it is in his power to do so?' I ask again, 'Did Paul do anything else than this?'"
3. "From this it appears, that such a use of our liberty as gives occasion of offense, is an uncontrolled liberty and abuse. We must keep, therefore, within bounds, that we may not give occasion of offense."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I may make the Gospel of Christ without charge, that for the good of others I forego an undoubted right."
2. "To them that are under the law, as under the law, not being myself under the law, that I might, etc."
3. "The whole of this very important clause is wanting in the received text; but it is found in the five oldest MSS., in most of the Cursives; and in all the oldest and best versions (the Peshito and Memphitic excepted). Beyond doubt, the apostle added it to prevent any misapprehension of his previous statement."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "So as not to use to the full."
2. "εις το for purpose with articular infinitive and perfective use of κατα"
3. "with χρησασθα (first aorist middle infinitive)."

### John Gill:
1. "I am a servant intrusted by my Lord with the Gospel, and an unprofitable one I am; I do, at most and best, but what is my duty, and for that I can claim no reward."
2. "All the reward that remains is only this, that when I preach the Gospel, which I am obliged to do, I may make the Gospel of Christ without charge; to them that hear it, as he did to the Corinthians, which was his glorying."
3. "His reason for it is, that I abuse not my power in the Gospel; his right of having a maintenance, whilst he was preaching the Gospel; to have made use of which would have been an abuse of it."

### John Wesley:
1. "What then is my reward — That circumstance in my conduct for which I expect a peculiar reward from my great Master?"
2. "That I abuse not - Make not an unseasonable use of my power which I have in preaching the gospel."
