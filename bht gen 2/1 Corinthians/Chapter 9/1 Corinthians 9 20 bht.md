# 1 Corinthians 9:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When it comes to interacting with the Jews, the Apostle Paul flexed his approach, not compromising on essential matters, but adapting in customs where it was not compromising his principles. He sought to gain their confidence and affection, not offending them unnecessarily or provoking anger. By conforming to their ways, he aimed to have influence over them and bring them to the Christian faith. While he did not affirm the necessity of observing the Mosaic law, he observed it himself when among them without declaring it necessary or refusing to engage with those who didn't adhere to it.
