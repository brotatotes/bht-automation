# 1 Corinthians 9:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul, in his ministry, understood the importance of adapting his message to different audiences. He skillfully engaged with the Gentiles by adopting their customs and even citing their own poets to connect with them. However, it is crucial to note that although Paul made these cultural accommodations, he never disregarded the moral law of God. He emphasized that he was under the law to Christ, showing that believers are still bound by the principles of God's law. The purpose behind Paul's approach was to effectively reach and influence those who were unfamiliar with the law.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Paul became as a Heathen to the Heathen, e.g., when he discoursed at Athens (Acts 17:0) in their own manner, and with arguments drawn from their own poets."
2. "Not being (being conscious of not being, remembering well in the midst of my ἀνομία that I was not. This is implied by μή, which is subjective, giving the conviction of the subject, not merely the objective fact, as οὐκ ὤν would do) an outlaw from God but a subject-of-the-law of Christ."
3. "That I might gain those who had no law."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Christian's true position in relation to the world, to himself, and to God. Everything develops itself according to its proper law."
2. "He does not in the Greek say 'under the law to Christ' but uses the milder term, 'in . . . law,' responsible to law."
3. "Christians serve Christ in newness of spirit, no longer in oldness of the letter (that is, the old external law as such)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I neglected the ceremonial precepts of the Mosaic law...because I knew that the binding obligation of these ceremonial precepts had ceased."
2. "In all things of conscience and truth a man should be firm, and should lose his life rather than abandon either; in all things of indifference, of mere custom, of prejudice, he should yield, and accommodate himself to the modes of thinking."
3. "Whatever privileges the gospel has introduced, it has not set us free from the restraints and obligations of law. That is binding still; and no man is at liberty to disregard the moral law of God. Christ came to magnify, strengthen, and to honor the law, not to destroy it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Without law [ανομος] . As one of the Gentiles. By intercourse with them, relinquishment of Jewish observances, and adapting his teaching to their modes of thought."
2. "Under law [εννομος] . The expression differs from that in ver. 20, uJpo nomon under law, though with only a shade of difference in meaning. Ennomov means subject to the law, but in the sense of keeping within [εν] the law."

### John Calvin:
1. "He had always kept in view one law — that of subjection to Christ."
2. "By this too he hints that odium was excited against him groundlessly and unreasonably, as if he called men to an unbridled licentiousness."
3. "He means, that in the doctrine of Christ nothing is omitted, that might serve to give us a perfect rule of upright living."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To have said nakedly, 'I am under the law to God,' might seem in the teeth of his whole teaching, to the effect that he had through Christ become 'delivered from' and 'dead to the law.'"
2. "He says, therefore, 'I am under the law to Christ.' 'O then (might it be said), you are under the law after all?' 'Granted: I am indeed 'not without law to God;' I am no antinomian, lawless man God forbid: but my subjection to law in the Person of Christ, whose yoke is easy and whose burden is light, transmutes its character out of law that killeth into love which is life.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "To them that are without law (τοις ανομοις). The heathen, those outside the Mosaic law (Romans 2:14), not lawless (Luke 22:37; Acts 2:23; 1 Timothy 1:9)."
2. "See how Paul bore himself with the pagans (Acts 14:15; Acts 17:23; Acts 24:25), and how he quoted heathen poets."
3. "Not being an outlaw of God, but an inlaw of Christ" (Evans, Estius has it exlex, inlex, μη ων ανομος θεου, αλλ' εννομος Χριστου). The genitive case of θεου and Χριστου (specifying case) comes out better thus, for it seems unusual with ανομος and εννομος, both old and regular adjectives."

### John Gill:
1. "To them that are without law, as without law...." 
2. "And to these the apostle accommodated himself, as if he was without the law."
3. "being not without law to God"
4. "but" as one that was under the law to Christ.
5. "that I might gain them that were without law

### John Wesley:
1. "To them that are without the law — The heathens."
2. "Being not without the law to God — But as much as ever under its moral precepts."
3. "Under the law to Christ — And in this sense all Christians will be under the law for ever."
