# 1 Corinthians 9:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To gain the weak Christians, I accommodated myself to their needs, becoming as weak as they were in faith and discernment. I became all things to all men, adapting myself to each person's situation and prejudices, seeking to save some through whatever means necessary. In extreme humility, I denied and submitted myself, recognizing the immense importance of the reward for which I denied myself. By not lacerating their feelings or running counter to their prejudices, I showed them the condescending love of stronger brethren and won them over to the Gospel.
