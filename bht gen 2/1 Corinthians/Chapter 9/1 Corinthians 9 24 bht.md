# 1 Corinthians 9:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do you not know that in the well-known Isthmian games, the foot race is a prominent event? All runners participate, but only one is awarded the prize. Let this analogy motivate you in your Christian journey. Run with determination and perseverance, striving towards the goal, knowing that the prize at stake is not an earthly crown, but an incorruptible crown of eternal life, the reward of your heavenly calling.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The allusion is primarily no doubt to the Isthmian games [...] the foot-race was far too common an element in athletic contests, for any accurate knowledge of its predominance in some and its insignificance in others of the Grecian games to be here supposed."
2. "οὕτως τρ. Thus (after this manner viz. as they who run all, each endeavouring to be the one who shall receive the prize: not, as the one who receives it) run"
3. "in order that ye may fully obtain (the prize of your calling, see Philippians 3:14)"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Know ye not—The Isthmian games, in which the foot race was a leading one, were of course well known, and a subject of patriotic pride to the Corinthians, who lived in the immediate neighborhood. These periodical games were to the Greeks rather a passion than a mere amusement: hence their suitableness as an image of Christian earnestness."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If they had done it, for objects so comparatively unimportant as the attainment of an 'earthly' garland, assuredly it was proper for him to do it to obtain a crown which should never fade away."
2. "This is one of the most beautiful, appropriate, vigorous, and bold illustrations that can anywhere be found; and is a striking instance of the force with which the most vigorous and self-denying efforts of Christians can be vindicated, and can be urged by a reference to the conduct of people in the affairs of this life."
3. "So run in the Christian race, that you may obtain the prize of glory, the crown incorruptible. So live; so deny yourselves; so make constant exertion, that you may not fail of that prize, the crown of glory, which awaits the righteous in heaven."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In all other New - Testament passages it is used of a measure of length, and is rendered furlong, representing 606.75 English feet."
2. "The position chosen for the stadium was usually on the side of a hill, which would furnish a natural slope for seats; a corresponding elevation on the opposite side, being formed by a mound of earth, and the seats being supported upon arches."
3. "At the period of Paul 's epistles the games were still celebrated, and the apostle himself may very probably have been present."

### John Calvin:
1. "what they had hitherto attained was nothing, unless they steadfastly persevered"
2. "it is not enough to have once entered on the Lord’s way, if they do not strive until they reach the goal"
3. "it is not enough to have set out, if we do not continue to run during our whole life"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Know ye not that they which run in a race... run all, but one... receiveth the prize? So run that is, 'run as if ye could win the prize only by outstripping all your competitors in the race.'" 
2. "The aptitude and point of this and the following illustrations will be seen in the fact, that not only were the Grecian games of universal interest and familiar to all his readers, but that the most popular of them all the Isthmian games were celebrated in the immediate neighbourhood of Corinth."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

### John Wesley:
