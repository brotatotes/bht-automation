# 1 Corinthians 9:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Every athlete who competes in the arena or on the stage follows a strict course of discipline, practicing self-control in all things. They deny themselves indulgences and dedicate themselves to rigorous training, be it in diet, sleep, or other sensual pleasures. They strive for a reward that is far more valuable than a temporary garland of leaves that will soon wither. It is intriguing to see how the mentality has shifted, as modern individuals are now willing to go to great lengths to obtain an eternal crown, exceeding the efforts made for a perishable one.
