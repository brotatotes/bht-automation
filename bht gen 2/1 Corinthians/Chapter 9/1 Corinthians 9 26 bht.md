# 1 Corinthians 9:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A Christian's journey is not aimless, but purposeful. Like a runner with a clear goal in sight, they press on with determination, not wasting efforts on empty pursuits. They run with a fixed gaze on Christ, casting aside any distractions or doubts. In the fight against spiritual enemies, they strike with precision, not wasting their energy on futile blows. With faith and assurance, they move forward, knowing the prize that awaits them at the finish line.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "τοίνυν, as distinguished from other particles which imply restriction of what has been generally said to some particular object, indicates the dropping of minute or collateral points, and returning to the great necessary features of the subject, and this, as introducing some short and pithy determination or conclusion."
2. "so run as not uncertainly, i.e. without any sure grounds of contending or any fixed object for which to contend; both these are included."
3. "so fight I, as not striking the air (and not my adversary). The allusion is not to a σκιαμαχία or rehearsal of a fight with an imaginary adversary, but to a fight with a real adversary (viz. here, the body) in which the boxer vainly hits into the air, instead of striking his antagonist."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I, for my part, in all my acts, whether in my becoming 'all things to all men,' or in receiving no sustenance from my converts, have a definite end in view, namely, to 'gain the more.'"
2. "He who runs with a clear aim, looks straightforward to the goal, makes it his sole aim, casts away every encumbrance, is indifferent to what the by-standers say, and sometimes even a fall only serves to rouse him the more."
3. "Alluding to the sciamachia or sparring in the school in sham-fight, wherein they struck out into the air as if at an imaginary adversary. The real adversary is Satan acting on us through the flesh."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I do not run haphazardly; I do not exert myself for nothing; I know at what I aim, and I keep my eye fixed on the object; I have the goal and the crown in view."
2. "How much doubt, and hesitancy, and despondency would it remove from many a Christian’s mind!"
3. "Every blow that he struck told; and he did not waste his energies on that which would produce no result."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He runs with a clear perception of his object, and of the true manner and result of his striving."
2. "A boxer might be said to beat the air when practicing without an adversary. This was called skiamacia shadow-fighting."
3. "He strikes straight and does not spare."

### John Calvin:
1. "I do not run in vain, nor do I run the risk of losing my labor, for I have the Lord’s promise, which never deceives."
2. "The Lord exercises us here in the way of running and wrestling, but he sets before us the object at which we ought to aim, and prescribes a sure rule for our wrestling, that we may not weary ourselves in vain."
3. "Those things ought to kindle up and confirm the Christian breast, so as to devote itself with greater alacrity to all the duties of piety; for it is a great matter not to wander in ignorance through uncertain windings."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I therefore (for my part) so run, not as uncertainly without definite aim, regardless of what is at stake, and what is required in order to win."
2. "Here the figure changes from running to wrestling, from the speed of the racer to the aggressions of the pugilist as not beating the air who, taking an uncertain or inaccurate aim, misses his antagonist, and strikes only the air: not so do I fight; I put skill as well as energy into this 'good fight of faith.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "His objective is clear, with Christ as the goal." 
2. "He kept his eye on Christ as Christ watched him." 
3. "A boxer did this when practising without an adversary... He smote something more solid than air."

### John Gill:
1. "He ran with cheerfulness and swiftness in the way marked out for him, looking to Jesus; continuing steadfast in the profession of his faith..." 
2. "The allusion is to the white line which was drawn from the place the runners set out at to the goal; so that they did not run uncertainly, nor could they be at a loss to steer their course."
3. "He knew what he ran for, for the incorruptible crown of glory...he had no doubt at all about it; and with this certain knowledge both of the way and prize, and full assurance of faith and hope, he ran."

### John Wesley:
1. "I so run, not as uncertainly — I look straight to the goal; I run straight toward it."
2. "I cast away every weight, regard not any that stand by."
3. "I fight not as one that beateth the air — This is a proverbial expression for a man's missing his blow, and spending his strength, not on his enemy, but on empty air."
