# 1 Corinthians 9:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Self-discipline and denying oneself are important aspects of the Christian life, as emphasized in these insightful writings. The apostle Paul shares his resolve to control his physical desires, not through extreme measures, but by keeping the body of sin in check. This highlights the need for believers to exercise self-control and submit their desires to the will of God. Additionally, this passage touches on the concepts of election and reprobation, suggesting that believers are chosen for the privileges of the Christian life but must remain vigilant to avoid being rejected or disapproved of.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The abuse of this expression to favour the absurd practice of the Flagellants, or to support ascetic views at all, need hardly be pointed out to the rational, much less to the Christian student."
2. "It is not even of fasting or prayer that he is here speaking, but as the context... shew, of breaking down the pride and obstinacy and self-seeking of the natural man by laying himself entirely out for his great work the salvation of the greatest number."
3. "And this he says with a view to shew them the necessity of more self-denial, and less going to the extreme limit of their Christian liberty."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is not ascetic fasts or macerations of the body which are here recommended, but the keeping under of our natural self-seeking, so as, like Paul, to lay ourselves out entirely for the great work."
2. "Unless the soul keep the body under, the body will get above the soul. The body may be made a good servant, but is a bad master."
3. "A castaway‚Äîfailing shamefully of the prize myself, after I have called others to the contest. Rejected by God, the Judge of the Christian race, notwithstanding my having, by my preaching, led others to be accepted."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We see the great anxiety which Paul had to save souls. This was his grand purpose; and for this he was willing to deny himself and to bear any trial."
2. "Ministers, like others, are in danger of losing their souls. If Paul felt this danger, who is there among the ministers of the cross who should not feel it?"
3. "The fact that a man has been very successful in the ministry is no certain evidence that he will be saved. God converts people; and he may sometimes do it by the instrumentality of those who themselves are deceived, or are deceivers."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The blow of the trained boxer was the more formidable from the use of the cestus, consisting of ox-hide bands covered with knots and nails, and loaded with lead and iron."
2. "A most interesting account is given by Rodolfo Lanziani [...] of the exhuming at the foundation of the Temple of the Sun, erected by Aurelian, of a sitting bronze statue of a boxer."
3. "Metaphor of captives after battle. Not of leading the vanquished round the arena (so Godet), a custom of which there is no trace, and which, in most cases, the condition of the vanquished would render impossible."

### John Calvin:
1. "For he declares that he does not indulge self, but restrains his inclinations."
2. "Let us, however, treat the body so as to make a slave of it, that it may not, by its wantonness, keep us back from the duties of piety."
3. "My life ought to be a kind of rule to others. Accordingly, I strive to conduct myself in such a manner, that my character and conduct may not be inconsistent with my doctrine."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I buffet my body, and bring it into bondage as a slave into submission to his master."
2. "Here is a man who elsewhere expresses a confident and joyous assurance of his final salvation, while in this verse he holds forth his final perdition as equally certain, should certain indispensable preventives be neglected."
3. "Is the estimate of living Christianity here given as inseparable from universal and continuous self-sacrifice, in supreme consecration to the one end for which we were 'bought with a price' realized and acted on by those who have experienced its saving power?"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul does not, like the Gnostics, consider his œÉŒ±œÅŒæ or his œÉœâŒºŒ± sinful and evil. But 'it is like the horses in a chariot race, which must be kept well in hand by whip and rein if the prize is to be secured' (Robertson and Plummer)."
2. "The boxers often used boxing gloves (œáŒµœÉœÑœÖœÇ, of ox-hide bands) which gave telling blows. Paul was not willing for his body to be his master. He found good as the outcome of this self-discipline."
3. "So Paul is not merely a herald, but a competitor also. I myself should become rejected... He will fail to win if he breaks the rules of the game. What is the prize before Paul? Is it that reward of which he spoke in verse 1 Corinthians 9:18, his glorying of preaching a free gospel?"

### John Gill:
1. "But I keep under my body,.... This is not to be understood by the apostle of his natural body, and of his keeping it under by immoderate watchings, fastings, and labours, or by whipping and scourging, and lying upon the bare ground, and other such practices; but of the body of sin, the corruption of nature, and of that being laid under some restraints." 
2. "And bring it into subjection; so as not to serve and obey it in the lusts thereof; but to have the ascendant of it, and government over it, that it does not, and cannot reign as it formerly did." 
3. "Lest that by any means when I have preached to others... I myself should be a castaway, or rejected, or disapproved of; that is, by men."

### John Wesley:
1. "But I keep under my body ‚Äî By all kinds of self denial.And bring it into subjection ‚Äî To my spirit and to God."
2. "This single text may give us a just notion of the scriptural doctrine of election and reprobation."
3. "believers in general are elected to enjoy the Christian privileges on earth; which if they abuse, those very elect persons will become reprobate."
