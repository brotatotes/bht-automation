# 1 Corinthians 9:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is evident that Paul is referring to his right to receive support and sustenance as an apostle. This is not a common power given to all, but a specific privilege granted to him and his fellow laborers. The phrase 'to eat and to drink' signifies the provision of a livelihood and sustenance at the expense of the churches and communities they serve. In stating this, Paul emphasizes the responsibility of the churches to support those who labor diligently in the work of the Gospel.
