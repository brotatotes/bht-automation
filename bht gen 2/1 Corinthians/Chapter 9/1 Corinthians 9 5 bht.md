# 1 Corinthians 9:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are granted the freedom to marry and have their spouses supported by the church, according to some interpretations. The term a sister, a wife refers to a fellow believer who is part of the church community. This challenges the Catholic notion of priestly celibacy and suggests that it is acceptable for ministers to enter into marriage. It is also worth noting that other apostles, such as Peter, were married, indicating that their rights and privileges were in line with those of their fellow apostles.

### Henry Alford:
1. "Ostendit sibi licere quod ceteris Apostolis, id est ut non operetur manibus suis, sed ex Evangelio vivat: …. ad hoc enim et fideles mulieres habentes terrenam substantiam ibant cum eis, et ministrabant eis de substantia sua." 
(Augustine, De Opere Monachorum, 4(5), vol. vi. p. 552)
2. "They were also called ἀδελφαί: and were forbidden under the name of συνείσακτοι by the 3rd Canon of the 1st Council of Nicæa." 
(so likewise Tertull., Theodoret, Œcum., Isid Pelus., Theophylact, Ambrose, and Sedul. See Estius, and Suicer, γυνή, II)
3. "Peter was married." 
(see Matthew 8:14)

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "a sister by faith, which makes all believers brethren and sisters in the one family of God"
2. "Paul implies he did not exercise his undoubted right to marry and 'lead about' a believer, for the sake of Christian expediency"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To lead about - To have in attendance with us; to conduct from place to place; and to have them maintained at the expense of the churches amongst which we labor."
2. "It is evident from this that the apostles generally were married. The phrase used here is οἱ λοιποὶ ἀπόστολοι hoi loipoi apostoloi ('the remaining apostles,' or the other apostles). And if they were married, it is right and proper for ministers to marry now, whatever the papist may say to the contrary. It is safer to follow the example of the apostles than the opinions of the papal church."
3. "Yet there are people, like Paul, who can do more good without being married. There are circumstances, like his, where it is not advisable that they should marry, and there can be no doubt that Paul regarded the unmarried state for a missionary as preferable and advisable."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A sister, a wife. Wrong Sister means a christian woman, a fellow - member of the Church, as Romans 16:1; 1 Corinthians 7:15; James 2:15."
2. "It is in apposition with wife : A wife that is a sister on believer."
3. "Such an one has also the right, like her husband, to be maintained by the Church."

### John Calvin:
1. "In addition to the Lord’s permission, he mentions the common practice of others."
2. "That preeminence, however, was not lordship — nay more, it had nothing resembling lordship."
3. "The Apostles had no horror of marriage, which the Papal clergy so much abominate, as unbecoming the sanctity of their order."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "An absurd interpretation of these words, which found support even among the best of the fathers, when once the ascetic principle had taken possession of the Church, led Christians to regard celibacy as a holier state than marriage..."
2. "For to translate it ‘a woman’ here is absurd. But absurd as it is, modern Romanists even Cornelius à Lapide and Estius are obliged to take refuge in it."
3. "Though named hereafter 'the apostles,' it would not necessarily follow that none of these were themselves apostles, for 'Cephas,' one of the apostles, is named immediately after them."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Have we no right? Same idiom." 
2. "This is a plea for the support of the preacher's wife and children." 
3. "All the other apostles were either married or had the right to be."

### John Gill:
1. "The sense the Papists put on these words, to secure them from being a proof of the lawfulness of the marriage of the ministers of the Gospel, can by no means be the true one."
2. "The act of 'leading', or carrying 'about', is expressive of such a power over them, as cannot be thought to agree with persons of such substance."
3. "The apostle and others, supposing them to have wives...they had a right to take these with them wherever they went, and insist upon the maintenance of them, as well as of their own, at the public expense."

### John Wesley:
1. "Have we not power to lead about with us a sister, a wife — And to demand sustenance for her also?" 
2. "As well as the other apostles - Who therefore, it is plain, did this."
3. "And Peter — Hence we learn, 1. That St. Peter continued to live with his wife after he became an apostle: 2. That he had no rights as an apostle which were not common to St. Paul."
