# 1 Corinthians 9:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Ministers of the Gospel are likened to soldiers, vinedressers, and shepherds, engaged in a spiritual warfare, tending to the work of the church. It is only fair that these pastors, who devote themselves to the benefit of others, should receive adequate support. Just as soldiers are provided for, and vineyard workers enjoy the fruit, it is reasonable that those who labor in the spiritual field should also be compensated for their toil. This is not an unjust demand, but rather a matter of natural equity.
