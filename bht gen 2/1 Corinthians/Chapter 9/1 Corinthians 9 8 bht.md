# 1 Corinthians 9:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do I speak as a man, merely relying on human reason? Or does God Himself confirm the same principles in His Word? Take, for example, the practice of using oxen to tread out the corn. This has been a common custom in Judea and many eastern nations, and is still followed in some parts of Germany. Therefore, it is evident not only from human observation, but also from divine authority, that just compensation should be given for labor.
