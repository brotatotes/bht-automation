# 1 Corinthians 9:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This command from the Mosaic law highlights the compassionate nature of God's instructions. It demonstrates God's concern for both the physical comfort of animals and the well-being of humans. The command to not muzzle the ox while it treads out the corn serves as a reminder that God's laws are rooted in a deep understanding of the interconnectedness and welfare of all creatures. Just as God extends care and justice to animals, we are encouraged to show kindness and equity in our treatment of others.

3. "He uses this passage, therefore, not as originally having reference to people, or to ministers of the gospel, which cannot be; but as establishing a general 'principle' in regard to the equity and humanity of the divine laws; and as thus showing that the spirit of the law of God would lead to the conclusion that God intended that the laborer everywhere should have a competent support."

### Marvin Vincent:

"The manner of threshing...by these not only treading upon it to and fro, but drawing a wooden instrument after them, the bottom of which was stuck with iron teeth, and the top of it filled with stones, to press it down close by the weight thereof; the sheaves put in proper form, the oxen were led to and fro upon them, drawing this threshing instrument after them, by which means the grain was separated from the husk and ear."
2. "They give many rules relating to this law, and particularly observe, that it is to be extended to all sorts of creatures, as well as the ox, and to all sorts of business."
3. "Does God take care for oxen? Yes, he does, and for creatures of less importance than they, even the fowls of the air, and the most worthless of them, sparrows."
