# 1 John 1:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The writer assures the readers that they are sharing firsthand accounts of the Word of life, Jesus Christ. They have seen, heard, and even touched him, providing tangible evidence of his existence. The phrase from the beginning implies not just the start of Jesus' earthly ministry, but his eternal nature as the Word. These personal encounters include witnessing miracles, hearing teachings, and observing actions, affirming Jesus' divinity. This declaration is not based on hearsay, but on direct experiences that serve as undeniable proof of Jesus as the Son of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "To wish joy to the reader was the ancient customary address."
2. "Seeing is a more convincing proof than hearing of; handling, than even seeing."
3. "Contrast the wisest of the heathen feeling after (the same Greek as here; groping after WITH THE HANDS") if haply they might find God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Whatever there was respecting the Word of life, or him who is the living Word, the incarnate Son of God, from the very beginning, from the time when he was first manifested in the flesh; whatever there was respecting his exalted nature, his dignity, his character, that could be subjected to the testimony of the senses, to be the object of sight, or hearing, or touch, that I was permitted to see, and that I declare to you respecting him."
2. "John professes here to have seen enough in this respect to furnish evidence that he was the Son of God. It is not hearsay on which he relies, but he had the testimony of his own eyes in the case."
3. "The evidences of the incarnation of the Son of God had been subjected to such an intense and earnest gaze."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "We declare unto you that which was from the beginning, that which we have seen with our eyes, that which we beheld, and our hands handled concerning the Word of Life."
2. "The phrase 'in the beginning' characterizes the absolute divine Word as He was before the foundation of the world and at the foundation of the world. 'From the beginning' characterizes His development in time."
3. "In the same sense, the phrase 'the Word of the Life' proclaims that which it includes; it has, announces, gives life. In Christ, life as the subject, and life as the character of the revelation, were absolutely united."

### John Calvin:
1. "He shows, first, that life has been exhibited to us in Christ; which, as it is an incomparable good, ought to rouse and inflame all our powers with a marvelous desire for it, and with the love of it."
2. "For these words, What we have seen, what we have heard, what we have looked on, serve to strengthen our faith in the gospel."
3. "The same thing is said here as in John 1:14 the Gospel of John, 'We have seen his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father;' for he was not known as the Son of God by the external form of his body, but because he gave illustrious proofs of his Divine power, so that in him shone forth the majesty of the Father, as in a living and distinct image."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The phrase 'concerning the Word of life' reminds one at once of the Word in John 1:1; John 1:14; Revelation 19:14, an incidental argument for identity of authorship for all these books."
2. "The reference goes beyond the Christian dispensation, beyond the Incarnation, to the eternal purpose of God in Christ, 'coeval in some sense with creation'."
3. "He could be heard and seen. Three senses are here appealed to (hearing, sight, touch) as combining to show the reality of Christ's humanity against the Docetic Gnostics."

### John Gill:
1. "Jesus Christ is here intended, who in his divine nature was, really existed as a divine person, as the everlasting Jehovah, the eternal I AM, which is, and was, and is to come, and existed 'from the beginning'." 
2. "When the Word was made flesh and dwelt among men, the apostles heard, and saw, and handled him; they not only heard a voice from heaven, declaring him to be the Son of God, but they often heard him speak himself, both in private conversation with them, and in his public ministry."
3. "They saw him in human nature, and the common actions of life he did, as eating, drinking, walking, and his many miracles they saw him raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, restore sight to the blind, cause the lame to walk, the dumb to speak, and the deaf to hear."
