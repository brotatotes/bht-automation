# 1 John 1:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentator emphasizes that the Word being referred to is Jesus Christ himself, who has existed from eternity as the divine I AM. The apostles, including John, had not only heard Jesus' teachings but had also seen him with their own eyes, beholding his transfiguration, his resurrection, and the common actions of his human life. Jesus is described as the Word and the Life, as he is the living Word of God and the source of spiritual and eternal life.
