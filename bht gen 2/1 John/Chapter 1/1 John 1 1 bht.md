# 1 John 1:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus Christ, the eternal I AM, is the one who has been revealed to us. The apostles declare that they have not only heard about Him, but have also seen Him with their own eyes and attentively considered Him. As the Word made flesh, He is the incomparable good, igniting our desire for life and kindling our love for Him. This truth is shared to lift our thoughts above earthly concerns, strengthen our faith in the Gospel, and emphasize His divine nature and eternal existence from the beginning. This is foundational to our understanding of who He is.
