# 1 John 1:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If we deny that we have sinned, refusing to acknowledge our past sins, we are essentially contradicting God's word and calling Him a liar. It is important for us to recognize and remember our past sins, even as we strive to live in obedience to Him. By rejecting the truth that all have sinned, we are rejecting God's testimony about the condition of all humanity. We must be humble and open to God's word, allowing it to take root in our hearts and guide our lives.
