# 1 John 1:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If we deny the reality of our sins and claim that we have not sinned, we not only deny the truth of God's word but also accuse Him of falsehood, contradicting His revelation that all men are sinners. By rejecting the truth of our sinfulness, we reject the entirety of God's word and His will revealed in the law and Gospel. In doing so, we also reject the peace of mind that comes from confession and repentance, which can only be found by acknowledging the truth of our sins and seeking His forgiveness.

"Supposing his later testimony concerning the destruction of sin as a principle, and the absence of sin from the regenerate, to be taken in its highest and deepest, that is, in its most natural sense, still all the sanctified avow themselves sinners who need the atonement until probation ends; they never separate between their new selves and their old in their humble confession."
