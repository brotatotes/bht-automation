# 1 John 1:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Word of life, Jesus, was revealed to us in the flesh, making known the living Word to our senses.

1. "By the parenthesis John heaps reassurance upon his previous statement of the reality of the Incarnation by the use of εωρακαμεν (as in verse 1 John 1:1) with the assertion of the validity of his 'witness' (μαρτυρουμεν) and 'message' (απαγγελλομεν), both present active indicatives..."
