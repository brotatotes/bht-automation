# 1 John 1:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Word of life, who is life itself, was made known to people through the incarnation. He appeared among humanity so that they could see and hear him, testifying and declaring the eternal life that is found in him. This eternal life, which always was and was later revealed to us, is something that we can experience and enjoy for ourselves, even though we have not physically seen it. The preaching and writing about this life serve to lay its foundation and build upon it, ultimately leading us to the knowledge and lasting vision of him.
