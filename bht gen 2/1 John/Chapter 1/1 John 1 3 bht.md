# 1 John 1:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We bear witness to what we have seen and heard from Him, sharing it with you so that you may partake in the same fellowship that we have. This fellowship extends not only to us, but to the Father and the Son, a divine connection that allows Him to be in us and us to be in Him. Through the grace of God and the Gospel, we are called into this remarkable fellowship.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son." Faith realizes what we have not seen as spiritually visible; not till by faith we too have seen, do we know all the excellency of the true Solomon.
2. We are "partakers of the divine nature." We know God only by having fellowship with Him; He may thus be known, but not comprehended.
3. It is by the Holy Ghost or Spirit of the Father and Son in us, that we are enabled to have fellowship with the Father and Son. Believers enjoy the fellowship of, but not with, the Holy Ghost. "Through Christ God closes up the chasm that separated Him from the human race, and imparts Himself to them in the communion of the divine life."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "The fellowship with both [the Father and the Son] contemplates both as united in the Godhead."
3. "He [Thomas] touched the man, and confessed the God. And the Lord, consoling us who, now that He is seated in heaven, cannot handle Him with the hand, but touch Him by faith, says, 'Because thou hast seen thou hast believed; blessed are they who have not seen and believe.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "He also testifies of the feeling of their heart, for he says that he was moved by no other reason to write except to invite those to whom he was writing to the participation of an inestimable good."
2. "He also sets forth the fruit received from the Gospel, even that we are united thereby to God, and to his Son Christ in whom is found the chief good."
