# 1 John 1:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As believers, we write to you about the manifestation of Christ in the flesh, and the joy that comes from this truth. Through fellowship with Jesus and one another, we experience true happiness. Our joy, which is rooted in the Savior, is what brings us complete fulfillment. It is in His presence that we find our truest joy, and this joy is not given to the ungodly, but to those who love God for His sake alone. Let us treasure our communion with Him and find our happiness in the Gospel.
