# 1 John 1:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The message emphasizes that God is light - the source of both material and spiritual light. He embodies wisdom, purity, holiness, and glory. Just as all material life depends on light, all spiritual life and growth are reliant on God. There is no darkness in Him, no ignorance, error, untruthfulness, sin, or death. God is purely and wholly light, detesting anything associated with darkness. To experience fellowship with Him and to enjoy His blessings, we must strive to conform ourselves to His righteousness and holiness. This implies rejecting sin and embracing His light in our lives.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "The application to God of such a predicative requires no transference. He is Light, and the Fountain of light material and light ethical."
3. "There is not in Him any darkness at all."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "What light is in the natural world, that God, the source of even material light, is in the spiritual, the fountain of wisdom, purity, beauty, joy, and glory."
2. "As all material life and growth depends on light, so all spiritual life and growth depends on GOD."
3. "No, not even one speck of darkness; no ignorance, error, untruthfulness, sin, or death."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The message here refers to what he communicated as the sum of the revelation which he made to man."
2. "He came as the messenger of Him who is light; he came to inculcate and defend the truths which flow from that central doctrine."
3. "The language is probably designed to guard the mind from an error to which it is prone, that of charging God with being the Author of the sin and misery which exist on the earth."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "This then is [ÎºÎ±Î¹ Î±Ï…Ï„Î· ÎµÏƒÏ„Î¹Î½], correctly and literally, and this. According to the proper reading the verb stands first in order [ÎµÏƒÏ„Î¹Î½ Î±Ï…Ï„Î·], with emphasis, not merely as a copula, but in the sense 'there exists this as the message.'"
2. "God is Light [Î¸ÎµÎ¿Ï‚ Ï†Ï‰Ï‚ ÎµÏƒÏ„Î¹Î½]. A statement of the absolute nature of God. Not a light, nor the light, with reference to created beings, as the light of men, the light of the world, but simply and absolutely God is light, in His very nature."
3. "In Him is no darkness at all [ÎºÎ±Î¹ ÏƒÎºÎ¿Ï„Î¹Î± Î¿Ï…Îº ÎµÏƒÏ„Î¹Î½ ÎµÎ½ Î±Ï…Ï„Ï‰ Î¿Ï…Î´ÎµÎ¼Î¹Î±]. It is characteristic of John to express the same idea positively and negatively. According to the Greek order, the rendering is: 'And darkness there is not in Him, no, not in any way.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "For his object here was not to include the whole doctrine of the Gospel, but to show that if we desire to enjoy Christ and his blessings, it is required of us to be conformed to God in righteousness and holiness."
2. "Then the sum of what is said is, that since there is no union between light and darkness, there is a separation between us and God as long as we walk in darkness; and that the fellowship which he mentions cannot exist except we also become pure and holy."
3. "It hence follows that he hates an evil conscience, pollution, and wickedness, and everything that pertains to darkness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "As the apostle condenses the whole of the revelation of Christâ€™s Person into one word 'was manifested,' so he condenses the sum of His teaching into one word 'message.'"
2. "The subject is fellowship with God; that is, the possession of something common to God and to us. This is hereafter love, 'God is love;' here it is light, or unmingled and diffusive holiness."
3. "Holiness in God repels evil, and that to the sinner is its first aspect: 'in Him is no darkness' of sin that can be common to Him and us. But holiness in Him is diffusive, as the light is, or it could not become common to Him and to His saints."

### John Gill:
1. "This then is the message,... Of God by his Son the Word, or from Christ by his apostles."
2. "Moreover, they might hear and learn this of Christ, by his telling them that he himself was light, who is the image of the invisible God, insomuch, that he that has seen the Son, has seen the Father also."
3. "God is light; that is, as light is opposed to the darkness of sin; he is pure and holy in his nature and works, and of such pure eyes as not to behold iniquity; and so perfectly holy, that angels cover their times before him, when they speak of his holiness."

### John Wesley:
1. "That God is light â€” The light of wisdom, love, holiness, glory."
2. "What light is to the natural eye, that God is to the spiritual eye."
3. "And in him is no darkness at all â€” No contrary principle. He is pure, unmixed light."
