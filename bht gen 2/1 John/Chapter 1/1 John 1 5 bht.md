# 1 John 1:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God is the epitome of light. He is the source of wisdom, love, holiness, and glory. Just as light is to the natural eye, God is to the spiritual eye. He is pure and unmixed light, completely devoid of any darkness or impurity. His nature is perfectly holy and pure, to the extent that even angels cover their faces before Him when they speak of His holiness.
