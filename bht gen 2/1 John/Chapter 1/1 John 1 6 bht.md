# 1 John 1:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Claiming to be in communion with God means that our lives should reflect holiness and the light of God. However, if we claim this fellowship while walking in darkness, engaging in sin, we are being dishonest and contradicting ourselves. Our actions speak louder than our words, and if we are not living according to the truth, then it is evident that the truth is not within us.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Walk in the darkness. The phrase occurs only in John's Gospel and First Epistle. Darkness here is skotov, instead of skotia (ver. 5). See on John 1:5." 
2. "We lie and do not the truth. Again the combination of the positive and negative statements. See on ver. 5. The phrase to do the truth occurs only in John's Gospel and First Epistle. See on John 3:21."
3. "All walking in darkness is a not doing of the truth. 'Right action is true thought realized. Every fragment of right done is so much truth made visible' (Westcott)."

### John Calvin:
1. "For it is not a naked precept that he gives, which requires that our life should be holy; but he rather shews that the grace of Christ serves for this end to dissipate darkness, and to kindle in us the light of God."
2. "What God communicates to us is not a vain fiction; for it is necessary that the power and effect of this fellowship should shine forth in our life; otherwise the possession of the gospel is fallacious."
3. "We do not act truthfully. We do not regard what is true and right."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Claiming fellowship with God involves walking in the light with God and not in the darkness."
2. "We lie."
3. "Not doing the truth."

### John Gill:
1. "If any profess to be partakers of the divine nature, to be like unto God, and to have communion with him, to have the light of his countenance, and the discoveries of his love"  
2. "If such persons pretend to fellowship with God, they are liars:we lie; it cannot be, it is a contradiction, the thing is impossible and impracticable; what communion hath light with darkness?"  
3. "They do not say the truth, nor act according to it; they do not act uprightly or sincerely, but are hypocrites, and pretend to that which they have not"

### John Wesley:
1. "If we say — Either with our tongue, or in our heart, if we endeavour to persuade either ourselves or others."
