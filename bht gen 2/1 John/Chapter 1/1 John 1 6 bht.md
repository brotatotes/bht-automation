# 1 John 1:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If we claim to have communion with God, to experience His light and love, yet continue in sin, we deceive ourselves and others. The darkness of our actions reveals the absence of truth in our lives, for true fellowship with God cannot coexist with a life characterized by sin. Our actions speak louder than words, showing whether we truly walk in the light or remain in the darkness of sin.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Communion with God is the very innermost essence of all true Christian life."
2. "All such walking in darkness is a not-doing of the truth."
3. "Christ is 'the Truth:' and all doing the Truth is of Him, and of those who are in union with Him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The essence of the Christian life."
2. "In darkness... opposed to 'the light'."
3. "Lie... do not... the truth."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If we live in sin, it is a proof that our profession of religion is false."
2. "Desirable as it is to have the comforts of religion, yet it is not always true that they who do not are not true Christians."
3. "Religion is light; religion is peace, purity, joy; and though there are cases where for a time a true Christian may be left to darkness, and have no spiritual joy, and be in doubt about his salvation, yet still it is a great truth, that unless we know by personal experience what it is to walk habitually in the light, to have the comforts of religion, and to experience in our own souls the influences which make the heart pure, and which bring us into conformity to the God who is light, we can have no true religion."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Darkness here is skotov, instead of skotia (ver. 5). See on John 1:5." 
2. "Walk [περιπατωμεν], is, literally, walk about; indicating the habitual course of the life, outward and inward."
3. "All walking in darkness is a not doing of the truth. 'Right action is true thought realized. Every fragment of right done is so much truth made visible' (Westcott)."

### John Calvin:
1. "This doctrine, however, depends on a higher principle, that God sanctifies all who are his."
2. "He rather shows that the grace of Christ serves for this end to dissipate darkness and to kindle in us the light of God."
3. "What he adds, and do not the truth, is the same as if he had said, 'We do not act truthfully. We do not regard what is true and right.'"

### John Gill:
1. "If any profess to be partakers of the divine nature, to be like unto God, and to have communion with him, to have the light of his countenance, and the discoveries of his love..."
2. "What communion hath light with darkness? or what fellowship can the throne of iniquity, or those in whom sin reigns, have with God?"
3. "They do not say the truth, nor act according to it; they do not act uprightly or sincerely, but are hypocrites, and pretend to that which they have not."

### John Wesley:
1. "If we say — Either with our tongue, or in our heart, if we endeavour to persuade either ourselves or others."
2. "We have fellowship with him, while we walk, either inwardly or outwardly, in darkness - In sin of any kind."
3. "We do not the truth — Our actions prove, that the truth is not in us."
