# 1 John 1:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Walking in the light involves embracing the truth, having clear spiritual views, and being ruled by the fear of God. It is through this walk in the light that we can have fellowship with God and other believers. This fellowship is exhibited through our imitation of God and our commitment to promoting His glory. The blood of Jesus further cleanses us from all sin, both removing the guilt and power of sin in our lives. In the light, we find true communion with God and with one another.
