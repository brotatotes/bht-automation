# 1 John 1:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To deny our sinfulness is to deceive ourselves, for it is inherent in the nature of mankind. Even believers, though cleansed by the blood of Christ, still experience the presence of sin. While we may be forgiven and redeemed from our sins, we cannot claim to be entirely without sin, as the seeds of sin reside in us. Therefore, it is vital to acknowledge our need for continual forgiveness and cleansing, rather than falsely proclaim our innocence. Failure to do so means that the truth of our condition is not in us, both in our words and in our hearts.

1. "If we say that we have not sin...we are deceiving ourselves...and the truth is not in us."

2. "In any and every way, if we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves."
3. "The very nature of the Christian religion supposes that we feel ourselves to be sinners, and that we should be ever ready to acknowledge it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Sin [αμαρτιαν] is not to be understood of original sin, or of sin before conversion, but generally."
2. "The fundamental idea of aJmartia (sin) among the Greeks is physical; the missing of a mark... from which it develops into a metaphysical meaning, to wander in the understanding... sin, therefore, is, primarily, ignorance."
3. "He [Plato] traces most sins to the influence of the body on the soul... we make the nearest approach to knowledge when we have the least possible communion or fellowship with the body."

### John Calvin:
1. "He intimates that we are all lost and undone, except the Lord comes to our aid with the remedy of pardon."
2. "The reason why he so much dwells on the fact, that no one is innocent, is, that all may now fully know that they stand in need of mercy, to deliver them from punishment, and that they may thus be more roused to seek the necessary blessing."
3. "When he adds, and the truth is not in us, he confirms, according to his usual manner, the former sentence by repeating it in other words; though it is not a simple repetition, (as elsewhere,) but he says that they are deceived who glory in falsehood."

3. "Though a believer may say that he has not this or that particular sin, or is not guilty of this or that sin, for he has the seeds of all sin in him, yet he cannot say he has no sin."
