# 1 John 1:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If we say that we have no sin and deny our need for cleansing, the truth is not within us. We must recognize that we are all sinners, in need of God's forgiveness and redemption. Claiming to be without sin or deceiving ourselves in thinking so, only reveals our lack of understanding and self-awareness. It is only through the grace of God and the blood of Jesus Christ that we can be cleansed from the guilt and power of sin in our lives. Let us humbly acknowledge our sins, confess them, and seek God's cleansing and forgiveness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "If we say that we have not sin, we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us."
2. "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If thou shalt confess thyself a sinner, the truth is in thee; for the truth is itself light. Not yet has thy life become perfectly light, as sins are still in thee, but yet thou hast already begun to be illuminated, because there is in thee confession of sins" - Augustine
2. "To confess our need of cleansing from present sin is essential to 'walking in the light'; so far is the presence of some sin incompatible with our in the main 'walking in light.' But the believer hates, confesses, and longs to be delivered from all sin, which is darkness." 
3. "We cannot deceive God; we only make ourselves to err from the right path."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The object of the apostle is to show that it is implied in the very nature of the gospel that we are sinners, and that if, on any pretence, we denied that fact, we utterly deceived ourselves."
2. "We are at all times, and in all circumstances, to admit the painful and humiliating truth that we are transgressors of the law of God, and that we need, even in our best services, the cleansing of the blood of Jesus Christ."
3. "Who, after all his reasoning on the subject, would dare to go out under the open heaven, at midnight, and lift up his hands and his eyes toward the stars, and say that he had no sin to confess - that he was as pure as the God that made those stars?"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Sin is not to be understood of original sin, or of sin before conversion, but generally."
2. "The fundamental idea of sin among the Greeks is physical; the missing of a mark."
3. "Plato represents sin as the dominance of the lower impulses of the soul, which is opposed to nature and to God."

### John Calvin:
1. "He now commends grace from its necessity; for as no one is free from sin, he intimates that we are all lost and undone, except the Lord comes to our aid with the remedy of pardon."
2. "The reason why he so much dwells on the fact, that no one is innocent, is, that all may now fully know that they stand in need of mercy, to deliver them from punishment, and that they may thus be more roused to seek the necessary blessing."
3. "By the word sin, is meant here not only corrupt and vicious inclination, but the fault or sinful act which really renders us guilty before God."

### John Gill:
1. "Though their sins are all pardoned, and they are justified from all things by the righteousness of Christ, yet they are not without sin."
2. "Pardon of sin, and justification from it, though they take away the guilt of sin, and free from obligation to punishment, yet they do not take out the being of sin."
3. "If any of us who profess to be cleansed from sin by the blood of Christ should affirm this, we deceive ourselves; such persons must be ignorant of themselves, and put a cheat upon themselves."

### John Wesley:
1. "If we say that we have no sin - To be cleansed from, instead of confessing our sins, 1 John 1:9, the truth is not in us - Neither in our mouth nor in our heart."
2. "Any child of man, before his blood has cleansed us."
3. "We have no sin."
