# 1 John 1:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When we confess our sins with sincere remorse and genuine faith, we can confidently rely on God's faithfulness. His promise of forgiveness extends to all who acknowledge their wrongdoing. It may seem paradoxical that a just God would pardon us, but through the sacrifice of Christ, He can both fulfill the demands of justice and extend His grace to us. In His mercy, God not only forgives our sins but also cleanses us from all traces of unrighteousness, offering complete purification for our souls.

2. "His forgiving us our sins and cleansing us, is in furtherance of the ends of His eternal faithfulness and justice."

3. "...since he has promised to pardon sinners, he will be found faithfully to adhere to those engagements; or perhaps, that he will be just to his Son in the covenant of redemption...it would be an act of injustice to him if he did not pardon those who believe on him."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is of great moment to be fully persuaded, that when we have sinned, there is a reconciliation with God ready and prepared for us: we shall otherwise carry always a hell within us."
