# 1 John 1:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If we confess our sins with a penitent and believing heart, God is faithful to His promise of forgiveness. This forgiveness is not an act of justice, but a display of His mercy and the redemption He has provided. Confession is essential as it acknowledges our wrongdoing and allows for reconciliation with God. Through this confession, God not only pardons our sins, but also cleanses us from all unrighteousness, removing the guilt through the application of Christ's blood. With full assurance, we can receive this promise and know that God is ready to reconcile with us.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Not merely the mercy, but the justice or righteousness of God is set forth in the redemption of the penitent believer in Christ."
2. "His forgiving us our sins and cleansing us, c., is in furtherance of the ends of His eternal faithfulness and justice."
3. "Unrighteousness-offensive to Him who 'is just' or righteous; called 'sin' because 'sin is the transgression of the law,' and the law is the expression of God's righteousness, so that sin is unrighteousness."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Pardon in the Scriptures, always supposes that there is confession, and there is no promise that it will be imparted unless a full acknowledgment has been made."
2. "The word 'just' here cannot be used in a strict and proper sense, since the forgiveness of sins is never an act of justice, but is an act of mercy."
3. "Viewed in either aspect, we may have the fullest assurance that God is ready to pardon us if we exercise true repentance and faith."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is of great moment to be fully persuaded, that when we have sinned, there is a reconciliation with God ready and prepared for us: we shall otherwise carry always a hell within us."
2. "The more, then, it becomes us to receive with the whole heart this promise which offers free pardon to all who confess their sins."
3. "But what he has once begun, he goes on daily to do, until he at length completes it."

### John Gill:
1. "Confession of sin is to be made to God, against whom it is committed, and who only can pardon."
2. "Forgiveness of sin here intends...an application of pardoning grace to a poor sensible sinner, humbled under a sense of sin, and confessing it before the Lord."
3. "The following clause, 'and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness,' is but the same thing expressed in different words...to cleanse from sin is to remove the guilt of it, by an application of the blood of Christ for pardon."

### John Wesley:
1. "But if with a penitent and believing heart, we confess our sins, he is faithful - Because he had promised this blessing, by the unanimous voice of all his prophets."
2. "Surely then he will punish: no; for this very reason he will pardon. This may seem strange; but upon the evangelical principle of atonement and redemption, it is undoubtedly true; because, when the debt is paid, or the purchase made, it is the part of equity to cancel the bond, and consign over the purchased possession."
3. "To forgive us our sins â€” To take away all the guilt of them. And to cleanse us from all unrighteousness â€” To purify our souls from every kind and every degree of it."
