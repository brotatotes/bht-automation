# 1 John 2:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He that loveth his brother abideth in the light because true religion is found in the love of God and neighbor. Such a person is in the light of grace and continues in it, experiencing great peace, tranquility, and happiness. While it doesn't mean they never give offense to others, there is no stumbling in their own way. On the other hand, those who hate their brother stumble against themselves and everything around them. The path of love is one of freedom and harmony, where one's journey is unimpeded by offenses or stumbling blocks.
