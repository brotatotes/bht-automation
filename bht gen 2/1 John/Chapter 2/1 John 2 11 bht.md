# 1 John 2:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The one who hates his brother is characterized as being in a continual state of darkness, both inwardly and outwardly. This darkness is not a recent development but has blinded him for some time. Love for others, especially fellow believers, is an essential virtue that shapes a person's entire life. Without love, even the most outwardly impressive actions hold no true value. The absence of love blinds and confuses, causing one to mistake darkness for light and to unknowingly traverse the path that leads to destruction.

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "The first part of the verse repeats verse 1 John 2:9, but adds this vivid touch of the blinding power of darkness."
