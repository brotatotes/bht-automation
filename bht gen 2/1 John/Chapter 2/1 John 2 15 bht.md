# 1 John 2:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do not love the world, for you have already overcome it through faith. Instead, continue to conquer it by not having an affectionate attachment to it. The world here refers to fallen mankind and all worldly possessions. If one loves the world as their ultimate desire and purpose, it indicates a lack of true religion. Therefore, relinquish your love for the world and fix your affections on God, for it is impossible to have both the love of the world and the love of God dwelling within you. By abstaining from earthly desires, you demonstrate that you are of God.
