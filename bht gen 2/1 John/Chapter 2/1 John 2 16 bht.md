# 1 John 2:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The desires and pursuits of those who live for the world can be summarized through three examples. The lust of the flesh involves the satisfaction of physical desires and seeking personal advantage. The desire of the eyes encompasses the enjoyment of contemplating pleasing things and worldly possessions. The pride of life involves the ostentatious display of material wealth and grandeur, gratifying pride and vanity. These pursuits are rooted in the world and not aligned with the desires of the Father. As believers, we must navigate our place in the world without being consumed by its values and temptations.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Loving the things of the world, he becomes conformed to the world, and following the lusts and pride which are in the world, he himself becomes one of the things in the world."
2. "The lust of the flesh is not only impure desire, but far more. It is that inward subjectivity that springs out of the unrenewed human nature."
3. "The vainglory of life is that vainglorious pride, which is so common in the rich and fashionable, and arises from one's means of living and fashion of living."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "lust of the flesh—that is, the lust which has its seat and source in our lower animal nature."
2. "lust of the eyes—the avenue through which outward things of the world, riches, pomp, and beauty, inflame us."
3. "pride of life—literally, 'arrogant assumption': vainglorious display."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The lust of the flesh - The word 'lust' is used here in the general sense of desire, or that which is the object of desire - not in the narrow sense in which it is now commonly used to denote libidinous passion."
2. "And the lust of the eyes - That which is designed merely to gratify the sight. This would include, of course, costly clothes, jewels, gorgeous furniture, splendid palaces, pleasure-grounds, etc."
3. "And the pride of life - The word here used means, properly, ostentation or boasting, and then arrogance or pride. It refers to whatever there is that tends to promote pride, or that is an index of pride, such as the ostentatious display of dress, equipage, furniture, etc."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The lust of the flesh involves the appropriation of the desired object."
2. "The desire of the eyes does not involve appropriation. It is satisfied with contemplating."
3. "The vainglory of life is the vainglory which belongs to the present life."

### John Calvin:
1. "John, by way of explanation, inserted these three particulars as examples, that he might briefly show what are the pursuits and thoughts of men who live for the world."
 
2. "The lust of the flesh, but when worldly men, seeking to live softly and delicately, are intent only on their own advantages."
3. "He includes, as I think, libidinous looks as well as the vanity which delights in pomps and empty splendor."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The lust of the flesh" (η επιθυμια της σαρκος, subjective genitive, lust felt by the flesh) may be illustrated by Mark 4:19; Galatians 5:17. So the genitive with η επιθυμια των οφθαλμων (the lust of the eyes) is subjective, lust with the eyes as organs as shown by Jesus in Matthew 5:28. 

2. For αλαζονεια see on James 4:16, the only other N.T. example. Αλαζων (a boaster) occurs in Romans 1:30; 2 Timothy 3:2.
3. David Smith thinks that, as in the case of Eve (Genesis 3:1-6) and the temptations of Jesus (Matthew 4:1-11), these three sins include all possible sins. But they are all "of the world" (εκ του κοσμου) in origin, in no sense "of the Father" (εκ του πατρος). The problem for the believer is always how to be in the world and yet not of it (John 17:11; John 17:14).

### John Gill:
1. "This is the sum of the evil things in the world; or these following are the objects of sin in the world."
2. "The lust of the flesh...either the lust of uncleanness...or else intemperance in eating and drinking, gluttony and drunkenness, excess of wine, surfeitings, rioting, and revellings."
3. "The lust of the eyes...rather the sin of covetousness is here designed, the objects of which are visible things...which sin is drawn forth and cherished by the eyes."
4. "The pride of life...ambition of honour...of grand living, living in a sumptuous, gay, luxurious, and pompous manner."
5. "Neither of these is of the Father; the things which are desired and lusted after are of God, but not the lust itself."
6. "Is of the world; of the men of it, and agreeable to their carnal minds."

### John Wesley:
1. "The desire of the flesh — Of the pleasure of the outward senses, whether of the taste, smell, or touch."
2. "The desire of the eye — Of the pleasures of imagination, to which the eye chiefly is subservient; of that internal sense whereby we relish whatever is grand, new, or beautiful."
3. "The pride of life — All that pomp in clothes, houses, furniture, equipage, manner of living, which generally procure honour from the bulk of mankind, and so gratify pride and vanity."
