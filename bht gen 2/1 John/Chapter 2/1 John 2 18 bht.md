# 1 John 2:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Beloved, we are currently living in the final period of the world, a time of struggle and opposition. The signs of the antichristian principle are evident, but we do not know how long this era will last. The antichrist is not a single person, but rather a spirit embodied in false teachings and adversaries. However, we can find hope in the knowledge that Christ's victory is assured. Let us remain steadfast in our faith and vigilant, for Christ will come and conquer all opposition, bringing an end to the antichristian forces that have persisted throughout history.

2. "A ‚Äúvice-functionary,‚Äù or an ‚Äúopposing functionary,‚Äù would be the idea which the word would naturally suggest."

### John Calvin:
