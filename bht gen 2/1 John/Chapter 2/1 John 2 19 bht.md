# 1 John 2:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When individuals left the church, it became evident that they were not truly part of the unified body of believers. Their departure displayed that their hearts had already turned away from the true faith. If they had truly belonged to the Lord, they would have remained steadfast in their fellowship with us. Their departure served as a manifestation of their lack of genuine faith and allegiance to God.
