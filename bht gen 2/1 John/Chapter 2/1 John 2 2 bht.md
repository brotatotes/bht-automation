# 1 John 2:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus Christ is the ultimate propitiation for our sins, serving as both priest and sacrifice. His sacrifice extends to all who believe, not just for current believers, but also for past and future believers, as well as the Gentiles. The term world in Scripture is used in opposition to the belief that there is no propitiation for the Gentiles, indicating that God's propitiation is not limited to a select few. It encompasses all of humanity, offering salvation and reconciliation to anyone who chooses to embrace it.
