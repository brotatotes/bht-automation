# 1 John 2:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are anointed by the Holy Spirit, enabling them to understand true religion and resist the influence of Antichrists. This anointing grants them a new perception of truth, illuminating its beauty and relevance to their lives. Through this divine teaching, believers gain knowledge and wisdom that cannot be explained by human means. The Apostle John reminds them of this anointing to affirm their understanding and encourage them to stand firm in the truth. This anointing is not a limited privilege but is available to all Christians, empowering them to discern between truth and falsehood and to persist in their faith.
