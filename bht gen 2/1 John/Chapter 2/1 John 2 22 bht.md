# 1 John 2:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To deny that Jesus is the Christ, or that He is the Son of God, is to deny the whole truth. The liar who denies this truth is the epitome of falsehood. This denial extends beyond mere words; it requires a recognition of Jesus as the Christ that the Father presents to us in the gospel. It is impossible to have a proper understanding of God the Father without acknowledging the Son. Rejecting the Son is to reject the logic of the Son of God. Such denial makes one the greatest of liars, surpassing even the devil himself.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Who is the liar...the utterer of the œàŒµ·ø¶Œ¥ŒøœÇ of which he has just spoken." 
2. "There can be little doubt that the ·ΩÅ refers as above to the preceding œàŒµ·ø¶Œ¥ŒøœÇ." 
3. "It is implied then, that denying Jesus to be the Christ is equivalent to denying the Father and the Son."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Who is the liar?" namely, guilty of the lie just mentioned (1 John 2:21).
2. "He is Antichrist...the ideal of Antichrist is 'he that denieth the Father and the Son.'"
3. "Again, the truth as to the Son must be held in its integrity; to deny that Jesus is the Christ, or that He is the Son of God, or that He came in the flesh, invalidates the whole."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Their own knowledge of the nature of religion must convince them at once that this opinion was false."
2. "He has all the characteristics and attributes of antichrist; or, a doctrine which practically involves the denial of both the Father and the Son, must be that of antichrist."
3. "No man can have just views of God the Father who has not right apprehensions of the Son."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The liar, the lie is set forth in its concrete personality: the one who impersonates all that is false."
2. "[Cerinthus] denied the miraculous conception of Jesus, and taught that, after His baptism, the Christ descended upon Him in the form of a dove."
3. "The Father occurs always in its simple form in the Epistle. Never his or our Father, or the Father in heaven."

2. "The denial of Christ extends much wider; for it is not enough in words to confess that Jesus is the Christ, except he is acknowledged to be such as the Father offers him to us in the gospel." 
3. "We now see that Christ is denied, whenever those things which peculiarly belong to him, are taken away from him."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The liar (with the article) par excellence."
2. "The one just mentioned, Cerinthus himself in particular."
3. "This is the inevitable logic of such a rejection of the Son of God."

### John Gill:
1. "he that denies that Jesus of Nazareth is the Messiah of the prophets, is not indeed the only liar in the world, but he is the greatest of liars"
