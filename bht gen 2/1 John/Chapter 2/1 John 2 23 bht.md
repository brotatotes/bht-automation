# 1 John 2:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Denying the Son means rejecting the essence and nature of the Father. Those who deny the Son deny the Father as well. Denying the Son leads to a loss of truth and knowledge, resulting in a loss of the life that comes from that knowledge. On the other hand, acknowledging the Son means having communion with the Father, for they are closely interconnected. Only through the Son can we have true acquaintance with God, as he reveals the Father and sets forth all that is necessary to be known of him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "he who rejects this in its fulness rejects all that can be known of the real essence and nature of the Father Himself"
2. "The antichrists denied that Jesus, the definite Person whom the Apostles had seen, heard, and handled, is the Christ...And in the denial of the Son is involved necessarily the denial of the Father"
3. "Together with the denial is necessarily given the not-having; together with the loss of the truth of the knowledge, the loss of the life which consists in that knowledge"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "inasmuch as God hath given Himself to us wholly to be enjoyed in Christ" (CALVIN).
2. "he—that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also."
3. "hath—namely, in his abiding possession as his 'portion'; by living personal 'fellowship'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father - That is, has no just views of the Father, and has no evidence of his friendship."
2. "...it is only through him that we can become reconciled to God, and obtain evidence of His favor."
3. "The great truth can never be too clearly stated, or too often inculcated, that it is only by a knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ that we can have any true acquaintance with God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Hath not the Father [ουδε τον πατερα εχει] . Properly, "hath not even the Father," though he professes to reverence the Father while rejecting the Son. Compare John 8:42.

### John Calvin:
1. "When we have confessed that there is one true God, this second article ought necessarily to be added, that he is no other but he who is made known in Christ."
2. "The Father, who is invisible, has revealed himself only in his Son. Hence he is called the image of the Father because he sets forth and exhibits to us all that is necessary to be known of the Father."
3. "As in Christ dwells all the fullness of the Deity, there is no God apart from him. It hence follows, that Turks, Jews, and such as are like them, have a mere idol and not the true God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Hath not the Father (ουδε τον πατερα εχε). 'Not even does he have the Father' or God (2 John 1:9)."
2. "He that confesseth the Son (ο ομολογων τον υιον). Because the Son reveals the Father (John 1:18; John 14:9)."
3. "Our only approach to the Father is by the Son (John 14:6). Confession of Christ before men is a prerequisite for confession by Christ before the Father (Matthew 10:32; Luke 12:8)."

### John Gill:
1. "Whatever reflects dishonour on the Son, reflects dishonour on the Father."
2. "If Christ is not truly and properly the Son of God, the Father is not truly and properly the Father of Christ."
3. "He that owns the sonship of Christ, the second Person, maintains the paternity of the first; for these two are correlates, and mutually put, or take away each other."

### John Wesley:
1. Whosoever denieth the eternal Son of God, he hath not communion with the Father; but he that truly and believingly acknowledgeth the Son, hath communion with the Father also.
