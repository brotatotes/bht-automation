# 1 John 2:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The anointing within us, which is the grace of the Spirit, teaches us and keeps us from error. We are self-sufficient by being taught directly by God Himself, and we have no need to learn from others. This anointing brings us truth and a genuine and sincere faith. We abide in Christ, and through His Spirit, we are continually reminded of His teachings. This message is especially relevant for those who are like little children in their faith.
