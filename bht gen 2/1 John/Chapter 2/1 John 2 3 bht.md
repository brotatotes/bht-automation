# 1 John 2:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By keeping his commandments, we demonstrate that we truly and intimately know God. This is not a mere intellectual knowledge, but a knowledge that is accompanied by sincere love for him and joyful obedience to his will. It is through our obedience to God's commands that our knowledge of him becomes evident. Our obedience is not the cause of our knowledge, but rather a response to the transforming work of the Spirit within us. As we faithfully follow God's commands, we reveal the reality of our relationship with him and experience the blessings of walking in his ways.
