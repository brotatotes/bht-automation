# 1 John 2:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He that claims to know God, but does not obey His commandments, is simply deceiving himself and others. Such a person is nothing but a liar, who in his works denies God and reveals his ignorance of Him. The truth is that there is no genuine knowledge of God and Christ in him.
