# 1 John 2:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The call to abide in Him signifies a lasting and uninterrupted connection with God. It urges believers to remain steadfast in their belief in His teachings and in the practice of their faith. If one claims to abide in Him, they should demonstrate consistency between their words and their actions. This entails imitating Christ's life of holiness, purity, and love, rather than replicating specific acts He performed. Following His example should motivate believers to walk in love and exhibit Christ-like behavior in all aspects of life.
