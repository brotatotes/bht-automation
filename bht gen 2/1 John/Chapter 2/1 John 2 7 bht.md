Beloved, let us not forget the timeless commandment of love. It is not a new doctrine, but an ancient one that we have heard from the beginning. This commandment of love is not limited to our neighbors, but extends even to our enemies, as both the Mosaic law and Christ have taught. It is a foundational principle that encompasses our love for God, Christ, and one another. Let us cherish and embrace this ancient law of love, for it shapes our faith and guides our actions in a profound way.
