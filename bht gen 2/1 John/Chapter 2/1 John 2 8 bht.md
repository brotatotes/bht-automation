# 1 John 2:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The commandment of love is both old and new, given from the beginning and renewed by God daily. Walking in love as Christ did makes the commandment ever new and fresh. This love is an excellent one, implanted in believers through regeneration and sustained by faith. It is exemplified in Christ and fulfilled in believers in a way that was not possible before. By embracing this newness, the darkness of the old dispensation is replaced by the shining light of Christ in our hearts.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The commandment is not new but old, and then has, notwithstanding, asserted its newness."
2. "The commandment finds its fulfillment in the walk of Christians in union with Christ."
3. "The readers have known it from the beginning as an essential commandment, they have had it as long as they have been Christians: on the other hand, if I look backward on the life of the readers before that beginning, whether they were before that Jews or Gentiles, this same commandment of necessity appears as a new one."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Christianity first put love to brethren on the new and highest MOTIVE, instinctive love to Him who first loved us, constraining us to love all, even enemies, thereby walking in the steps of Him who loved us when enemies."
2. "The new commandment finds its truth in its practical realization in the walk of Christians in union with Christ."
3. "The darkness is passing away...the light is now shining already, though but partially until the day bursts forth."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "And yet, that which I write to you, and particularly enjoin on you, deserves in another sense to be called a new commandment, though it has been also inculcated from the beginning, for it was called new by the Saviour himself."
2. "There can be no doubt here that John refers to the commandment to 'love one another,' and that it is here called new, not in the sense that John inculcated it as a novel doctrine, but in the sense that the Saviour called it such."
3. "The ancient systems of error, under which people hated each other, have passed away, and you are brought into the light of the true religion. Once you were in darkness, like others; now the light of the pure gospel shines around you, and that requires, as its distinguishing characteristic, love."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The commandment of love is both old and new. Old, because John's readers have had it from the beginning of their Christian experience. New, because, in the unfolding of Christian experience, it has developed new power, meaning, and obligation."
2. "The fact that the old commandment is new is true in Him (Christ), since He gave it as a new commandment, and illustrated it by His word and example. It is true in you, since you did not receive it until Christ gave it, and since the person and life of Christ are appealing to you in new lights and with fresh power as your Christian life develops."
3. "The true light is the revelation of God in Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "He says new, because God, as it were, renews it by daily suggesting it, so that the faithful may practice it through their whole life, for nothing more excellent can be sought for by them."
2. "John denies that the doctrine respecting brotherly love is of this kind, is one which grows old with time, but that it is perpetually in force, so that it is no less the highest perfection than the very beginning."
3. "The knowledge of Christ alone is sufficient to dissipate darkness. Hence, daily progress is necessary; and the faith of every one has its dawn before it reaches the noonday."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "To walk as Christ walked is to put into practice the old commandment and so make it new (ever new and fresh), as love is as old as man and fresh in every new experience."
2. "This newness is shown supremely in Christ and in disciples when they walk as Jesus did."
3. "Dawn is here. Is John thinking of the second coming of Christ or of the victory of truth over error, of light over darkness, the slow but sure victory of Christ over Satan as shown in the Apocalypse?"

### John Gill:
1. "The command of brotherly love is a new one; that is, it is an excellent one, as a new name is an excellent name, and a new song is an excellent one."
2. "The love which this new commandment requires is really and truly in the saints, implanted in them in regeneration, is a fruit of the Spirit, and which faith works by, and will always continue in them."
3. "The true light now shineth; either the Gospel, which is a light, and a true and substantial one, in distinction from the dim light of nature, or Jesus Christ, who is so called, in distinction from all false lights."

### John Wesley:
1. "A commandment which, though it also was given long ago, yet is truly new in him and in you."
2. "It was exemplified in him, and is now fulfilled by you, in such a manner as it never was before."
3. "For there is no comparison between the state of the Old Testament believers, and that which ye now enjoy: the darkness of that dispensation is passed away; and Christ the true light now shineth in your hearts."
