# 1 John 2:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Walking in the light requires having fellowship with God and a true knowledge of the Gospel, illuminated by the Spirit. If one claims to be in the light but lacks love for their brother, they are still in darkness and ignorance, remaining in a state of unregeneracy. It is essential to show love to one another, especially within the community of believers. Those who reject this love are void of Christ and devoid of true light.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Wherever spiritual life is, however weak, there darkness and death no longer reign, and love supplants hatred." 
2. "Where love is not, there hatred is; for the heart cannot remain a void." 
3. "The very title 'brother' is a reason why love should be exercised."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He that saith he is in the light... And hateth his brother... Is in darkness even until now." 
2. "The command to love one another was one of the most solemn and earnest which Christ ever enjoined."
3. "It is impossible to have any true religion without love to those who are sincerely and truly his followers."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The sharp issue is maintained here as in Christ's words, 'He that is not with me is against me' (Luke 11:23). Men fall into two classes, those who are in fellowship with God, and therefore walk in light and love, and those who are not in fellowship with God, and therefore walk in darkness and hatred."
2. "The word hate is opposed both to the love of natural affection and to the more discriminating sentiment - love founded on a just estimate. In the former case, hatred, which may become a moral duty, involves the subjection of an instinct. In the latter case it expresses a general determination of character."
3. "Though the light has been increasing, and though he may claim that he has been in the light from the first."

### John Calvin:
1. "Love is the only true rule according to which our life is to be formed; it is the meridian light, which ought to be continually looked on."
2. "All are blind and walk in darkness who are strangers to love."
3. "The love of God and the love of the brethren are so connected together that they cannot be separated."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The only way to walk in the light is to have fellowship with God who is light."
2. "So the claim to be in the light is nullified by hating a brother."
3. "In spite of the increasing light and his own boast he is in the dark."

### John Gill:
1. "He that saith he is in the light is in Christ the light, or has the true knowledge of the light of the Gospel, or is illuminated by the Spirit of God."
2. "If love to his brother is wanting, he is in darkness even until now; he is in a state of nature and unregeneracy, which is a state of darkness and ignorance."
3. "This seems to be very much levelled against the Jews, who make hatred of the brother in some cases lawful."

### John Wesley:
1. "He that saith he is in the light... is in darkness until now." 
2. "The very name shows the love due to him."
3. "Void of Christ, and of all true light."
