# 1 John 3:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Behold the wonderful love that God has bestowed upon us, that we should be called the children of God. The world may not understand us, for they do not recognize the reality of our sonship. They see us as fools, abandoning worldly pleasures for uncertain hopes, but they do not comprehend the immense privilege and honor we have in being adopted into God's family. Let us not be discouraged by their lack of understanding, but instead let the love and purity that comes with being children of God be evident in our lives.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "What manner of love is ἀγάπην here, joined as it is with the verb δέδωκεν, literally love itself, or does it import some gift, bestowal, or fruit of love?"
2. "The effect of the love, that at which it is aimed in its immediate bestowal (its Ziel), is, that we should be called children of God: its ultimate purpose (its Zweck) is another thing."
3. "The reality of a believer’s sonship of God, and his non-recognition by the world, are thus necessarily connected together."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Behold—calling attention, as to some wonderful exhibition, little as the world sees to admire."
2. "All our doing of righteousness is a mere sign that God, of His matchless love, has adopted us as children; it does not save us, but is a proof that we are saved of His grace."
3. "The immediate effect aimed at in the bestowal of this love is, 'that we should be called children of God.' Should have received the privilege of such a glorious title (though seeming so imaginary to the world), along with the glorious reality."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Even God could bestow upon us no more valuable token of affection than that we should be adopted into His family, and permitted to regard Him as our Father."
2. "A prince could manifest no higher love for a wandering, ragged, vicious orphan boy, found in the streets, than by adopting him into his own family, and admitting him to the same privileges and honors as his own sons; and yet this would be a trifle compared with the honor which God has bestowed on us."
3. "The people of the world regard us as fanatics or enthusiasts; as foolish in abandoning the pleasures and pursuits which they engage in; as renouncing certain happiness for that which is uncertain; as cherishing false and delusive hopes in regard to the future, and as practicing needless austerities, with nothing to compensate for the pleasures which are abandoned."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The plural is peculiar. The usual form is the singular ide or ijdou."
2. "Originally it means from what country or race; then, of what sort or quality. It is used of the quality of both persons and things."
3. "A parenthetical, reflective comment, characteristic of John."

### John Calvin:
1. "This being so great a favor, the desire for purity ought to be kindled in us, so as to be conformed to his image; nor, indeed, can it be otherwise, but that he who acknowledges himself to be one of God’s children should purify himself."
2. "He, in short, means that the more abundantly God’s goodness has been manifested towards us, the greater are our obligations to him."
3. "It behooves us especially to understand this doctrine; for since the only cause of our salvation is adoption, and since the Apostle testifies that this flows from the mere love of God alone, there is nothing left to our worthiness or to the merits of works."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Behold! as an exclamation, and thus standing alone, occurs only here. It is the tranquil expression of adoring wonder."
2. "The gift of love, nowhere else said to be given, should not be limited in meaning to demonstration or proof or token: it is love itself which is made ours; and as this gift is hereafter bound up with the mission of the Son, being indeed jealously restrained to the atonement as its channel, we must needs think here of that, though unexpressed. ‘Herein is love.’"
3. "Still, the design is uppermost; and the apostle would have chosen another form of expression if he had meant only the great love shown in our being called sons."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "What manner of love (ποταπην αγαπην). Qualitative interrogative as in 2 Peter 3:11; Matthew 8:27. Only here in John's writings." 
2. "Hath bestowed (δεδωκεν). Perfect active indicative of διδωμ, state of completion, 'the endowment of the receiver' (Vincent)." 
3. "That we should be called (ινα κληθωμεν). Sub-final use of ινα with the first aorist passive subjunctive of καλεω, to call or name, as in Matthew 2:23."

### John Gill:
1. "Behold what manner of love,.... See, take notice, consider, look by faith, with wonder and astonishment, and observe how great a favour, what an instance of matchless love, what a wonderful blessing of grace, the Father hath bestowed upon us..."
2. "The Alexandrian copy, and some others, and the Vulgate Latin version, add, 'and we are', or 'be'; and the Ethiopic version, 'and have been'; for it is not a mere name that is bestowed, but the thing itself in reality..."
3. "this blessing comes not by nature, nor by merit, but by grace, the grace of adoption; which is of persons unto an inheritance they have no legal right unto; the spring of it is the everlasting and unchangeable love of God..."

### John Wesley:
1. That we should be called — That is, should be, the children of God. Therefore the world knoweth us not - They know not what to make of us. We are a mystery to them.
