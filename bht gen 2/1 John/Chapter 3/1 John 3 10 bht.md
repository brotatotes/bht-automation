# 1 John 3:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He that does not love his brother is not of God. The specific focus on brotherly love is significant as it serves as evidence of being born again and belonging to God. It is through loving God, Christ, and fellow believers that one demonstrates being transformed from death to life. The absence of this love reveals one's true nature and highlights the importance of genuine love among believers for it signifies being a child of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In this (fact, circumstance: in better than by, which gives the idea that this is the only sign) are manifest the children of God and the children of the devil."
2. "The sin of hate is one which is plainly open to men’s eyes, at least in its ordinary manifestations."
3. "Every one that doeth not righteousness is not of God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "There is no middle class between the children of God and the children of the devil."
2. "He that loveth not his brother – a particular instance of that love which is the sum and fulfillment of all righteousness, and the token that distinguishes God's children from the devil's."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The general idea is, that if a person is not truly a righteous person, and does not love the brethren, he cannot be a child of God."
2. "The general idea is the same, that no one can be a true Christian who is not in fact a righteous man."
3. "The general sense is, that brotherly love is essential to the Christian character, and that he who does not possess it cannot be a Christian."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Righteousness is regarded, not in its completeness, but as bearing a particular character."
2. "It will be interesting to follow out the same distinction between the following words with and without the article: ajmartia sin; ajgaph love; zwh life; ajlhqeia truth."

### John Calvin:
1. "Those in vain claim a place and a name among the children of God, who do not prove themselves to be such by a pious and holy life."
2. "By this evidence they show that they differ from the children of the devil."
3. "The fruit and adoption always appear in the life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The ‘doing sin’ and the ‘doing righteousness’ are the works of the ‘children of God’ by regeneration, and ‘the children of the devil’ by imitation. St. John knows no third class; and the fact that he speaks of the broad characters that stamp the two must throw its influence back upon the interpretation of all that precedes."
2. "He makes it plain that his chief polemic is against the spurious Christians who strove to reconcile knowledge of Christ with relaxed morality."

1. "A life of sin is proof that one is a child of the devil and not of God."
2. "This is not a popular note with an age that wishes to remove all distinctions between Christians and the world."
3. "The addition here of this one item about not loving one's brother is like Paul's summary in Romans 13:9, a striking illustration of the general principle just laid down."

### John Gill:
1. "Regeneration and faith do not make men the children of God, but manifest them to be so."
2. "Adoption makes them the children of God, and entitles them to the inheritance; regeneration gives them the nature of the children of God, and makes them meet for it, and manifests their right unto it."
3. "He that loves God, Christ, and the brethren appears manifestly to be born again, and to have passed from death to life."

### John Wesley:
1. Neither he that loveth not his brother — Here is the transition from the general proposition to one particular.
