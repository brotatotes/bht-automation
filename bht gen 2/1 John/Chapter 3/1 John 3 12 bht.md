# 1 John 3:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the case of Cain, we see a clear illustration of the opposite of brotherly love. He hated his brother and committed the detestable act of fratricide, offering a very detestable example. Cain's actions serve as a warning against engaging in such vile practices. His envy stemmed from perceiving his brother's righteousness, which fueled his murderous intent. This serves as a reminder that unbelievers may hate and persecute the righteous because they reject the idea that works can justify and save them.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Cain erat filius non Dei sed diaboli, non generatione, sed imitatione et suggestione." (Corn.-a-lap.) 
2. "Cain murdered his brother: therefore he hated him: and hate belongs to the children of the evil one, classes him at once among those whose works are evil, and who hate those who, like Abel, are testified to (Heb 11:4) that they are of the children of God who work righteousness." 
3. "Whatever might be the exciting occasion of the murder, this lay at the root the hatred which the children of the devil ever bear to the children of God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous—through envy and hatred of his brother's piety, owing to which God accepted Abel's, but rejected Cain's offering."
2. "Enmity from the first existed between the seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Not as Cain - Not manifesting the spirit which Cain did... His was a most remarkable and striking instance of a want of love to a brother."
2. "Who was of that wicked one - Of the devil; that is, he was under his influence, and acted from his instigation."
3. "And wherefore slew he him? - Because his own works were evil, and his brother’s righteous... The apostle seems desirous to guard those to whom he wrote against the indulgence of any feelings that were the opposite of love."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Cain who was [καιν ην] . Who is not in the Greek. The construction is irregular. Lit., as Rev., not as Cain was of the evil one."
2. "Slew [εσφαξεν] . The verb occurs only in John, and only here outside of Revelation. Originally, to slay by cutting the throat; so in Homer, of cattle."
3. "Wherefore [χαριν τινος] . Lit., on account of what. Carin for the sake of, on account of, is elsewhere placed after the genitive."

### John Calvin:
1. "This explanation ought to be carefully noticed, for men ever blunder as to the way of living, because they make holiness to consist of fictitious works, and while they torment themselves with trifles, they think themselves doubly acceptable to God."
2. "But the Apostle testifies that this righteousness alone is approved by God, that is, if we love one another; and further, that the devil reigns where hatred, dissimulation, envy, and enmity prevail."

1. "Of the evil one...the reference is to the devil." 
2. "Slew...to slay, to butcher, to cut the throat."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle illustrates brotherly love by its contrary, in the instance of Cain, who was the first instance and example of hatred of the brethren, and of fratricide, and a very detestable one, by which he would dissuade from so vile and abominable a practice."
2. "Cain perceiving, was filled with envy, and this put him upon killing him."
3. "As then Cain hated his brother upon this account, so now carnal men hate and persecute the saints, because they will not allow their works to be the cause of justification and salvation."

### John Wesley:
1. "Who was of the wicked one - Who showed he was a child of the devil by killing his brother."
2. "And wherefore slew he him - For any fault? No, but just the reverse; for his goodness."
