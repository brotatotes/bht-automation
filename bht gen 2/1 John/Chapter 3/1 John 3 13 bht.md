# 1 John 3:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The world, referring to the wicked part of humanity, hates the righteous without any just cause, simply because they have been chosen and called out of the world. This hatred towards the righteous has always been characteristic of the world, starting from the beginning when there were two distinct groups of people: the righteous and the wicked. Therefore, it should not be seen as strange or unusual when the world hates the righteous, as they are merely experiencing the same treatment as Cain received.

2. "This is the common lot of all the saints, of all that will live godly in Christ Jesus; and therefore it should not be reckoned a strange and unusual thing; it always was so, even from the beginning, as soon as ever there were two sorts of persons, good and bad, righteous and wicked."
