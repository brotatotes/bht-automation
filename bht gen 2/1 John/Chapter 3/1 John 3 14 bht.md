# 1 John 3:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We know what the world does not, as we have passed from death to life. This passing is not of our own doing, but a result of being born again through God's grace. Love for our brothers and sisters in Christ is evidence of our regeneration, not the cause of it. Those who do not love their brethren abide in spiritual death. Love for one another is a fruit that is produced in those who are born of God.
