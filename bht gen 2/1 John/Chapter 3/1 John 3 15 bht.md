# 1 John 3:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who harbor hate in their hearts towards their brothers are like murderers, for hatred is a potent force that brings destruction. To hate is to wish harm upon another, condemned by God. It is a frightening realization that many may carry the hidden seeds of murder in their hearts, if not for the restraining grace of God. Such is the folly of humanity, to abhor the name of murder and yet take no account of the crime itself. Only those who possess the transformative power of love can truly have eternal life dwelling within them.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In the ethical depth of the Apostle's view, love and hate, like light and darkness, life and death, necessarily replace, as well as necessarily exclude, one another."
2. "He who hates his brother is stated to be an ἀνθρωποκτόνος. If a hater be not a murderer, the reason does not lie in his hate, but in his lack of hate."
3. "Eternal life, which abides in God’s children, which is the living growth of the seed of God in them, is evidenced by love: if the very crown and issue of hate, homicide, be present, it is utterly impossible that this germ of life can be coexistent with it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Love and hatred, like light and darkness, life and death, necessarily replace, as well as necessarily exclude, one another."
2. "God regards the inward disposition as tantamount to the outward act which would flow from it. Whomsoever one hates, one wishes to be dead."
3. "He who hates (that is, loveth not) his brother cannot in this his present state have eternal life abiding in him."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The private malice, the secret grudge, the envy which is cherished in the heart, is murderous in its tendency, and were it not for the outward restraints of human laws, and the dread of punishment, it would often lead to the act of murder."
2. "What a fearful declaration, then, is this! How many real murderers there are on the earth besides those who are detected and punished, and besides those open violators of the laws of God and man who go at large!"
3. "Any man may well shudder at the remembrance of the secret sins of his own heart, and at the thought of what he would have been but for the restraining grace of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The contrast is suggestive between the sentiment embodied in this statement and that of Pagan antiquity respecting murder"
2. "Among the Greeks, to have killed a man was considered in the light of misfortune"
3. "The religion of the age takes no notice of the act whatever"

### John Calvin:
1. "To stimulate us still more to love, he shews how detestable before God is hatred."
2. "It does not matter if a man keeps his hands from mischief; for the very desire to do harm, as well as the attempt, is condemned before God: nay, when we do not ourselves seek to do an injury, yet if we wish an evil to happen to our brother from some one else, we are murderers."
3. "Hence is proved the folly of men, that though they abominate the name, they yet make no account of the crime itself."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A murderer (ανθρωποκτονος). Old compound (Euripides) from ανθρωπος (man) and κτεινω (to kill), a man-killer, in N.T. only here and John 8:44 (of Satan)." 
2. "No (πασ--ου). According to current Hebraistic idiom= ουδεις as in 1 John 2:19; 1 John 2:21." 
3. "Abiding (μενουσαν). Present active feminine accusative predicate participle of μενω, 'a continuous power and a communicated gift' (Westcott)."

### John Gill:
1. "A soul murderer, as the Ethiopic version renders it; not only of himself, for every sinner, by sinning, wrongs and destroys his own soul; but of his brother whom he hates: he is a murderer of him in his heart."
2. "it is not only taking away life, but also causeless anger, malice, and hatred, that is a breach of the sixth command."
3. "no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him; he has not the grace of life, or the beginning of eternal life in him; he has no meetness for it, being unregenerate; and no right unto it, being unrighteous; nor has he the earnest and pledge of it, being destitute of the Spirit of God."

### John Wesley:
1. "He, I say, abideth in spiritual death, is void of the life of God."
2. "For whosoever hateth his brother...is, in God's account, a murderer: every degree of hatred being a degree of the same temper which moved Cain to murder his brother."
3. "And no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him — But every loving believer hath. For love is the beginning of eternal life. It is the same, in substance, with glory."
