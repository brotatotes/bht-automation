# 1 John 3:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, the significance of the silence, without even mentioning God, speaks volumes about the subject at hand. It highlights the all-encompassing nature of the subject and the absolute focus that should be given to Him. The act of laying down His life, not just for sinners in general but specifically for us, demonstrates the depth of His love. It is from this profound love that our own love for our brothers and sisters is born, serving as a genuine reflection of our faith in Him.
