# 1 John 3:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When we see others in need and yet withhold our resources, we are not exemplifying the love of God. The deliberate contemplation and awareness of their distress should move our hearts to act. Our willingness to relieve their sufferings, even at the expense of our own comfort, is a true reflection of our love for the brethren. Without such acts, we cannot claim to possess the love of God within us. It is not enough to acknowledge the distress of others; we must be driven by compassion and meet their needs with genuine affection.

### Albert Barnes:

2. "If we are unwilling to do this, we can have no evidence that the love of God dwells in us."
