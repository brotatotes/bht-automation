# 1 John 3:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers, as sons of God, currently hold a position of dignity and responsibility. However, the full extent of what we will become has not yet been revealed to us. What we do know is that when Christ, the Son of God, appears, we will be transformed to be like Him. This transformation will be so profound that we will see Him as He truly is, and this sight will shape us into His image. The exact nature of this likeness is still a mystery, but it will be a glorious reflection of God Himself.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We are really sons of God, even now: and we look for an inheritance in virtue of that sonship: it has not been yet manifested of what sort that inheritance shall be: thus much we know &c."
2. "There is not even a correction of the preceding as Düsterd.: the connexion is simply, 'This future condition of ours hath never yet appeared: thus much we know of it.'"
3. "Because we shall see Him as He is, which is taken for granted as a Christian axiom, it of necessity follows that we shall be entirely like Him: ethically like Him: we shall behold, as Œc., δίκαιον δίκαιοι, ἀγνὸν ἁγνοί."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Believers have some degree of the manifestation already, though the world has not."
2. "We shall be like Him, Christ; all sons have a substantial resemblance to their father, and Christ, whom we shall be like, is 'the express image of the Father's person,' so that in resembling Christ, we shall resemble the Father."
3. "Transition from God the Father to 'He,' 'Him,' referring to Christ, implies the entire unity of the Father and the Son."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Beloved, now are we the sons of God - We now in fact sustain this rank and dignity, and on that we may reflect with pleasure and gratitude."
2. "And it doth not yet appear what we shall be - It is not fully revealed what we shall be hereafter; what will be the full result of being regarded as the children of God."
3. "But we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him - It is revealed to us that we shall be made like Christ; that is, in the bodies with which we shall be raised up, in character, in happiness, in glory."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Christian condition, now and eternally, centers in the fact of being children of God. In that fact lies the germ of all the possibilities of eternal life."
2. "The condition of realizing the fact is the manifestation of that glorified state, the revealing of what we shall be; for that manifestation will bring with it the open vision of the Lord."
3. "He [Christ] is pure, marking moral and spiritual purity, and that of a very high grade, since it is applied to Christ here, yet it admits the thought of possible temptation or pollution."

### John Calvin:
1. "The more necessary it is that all our thoughts should be withdrawn from the present view of things, lest the miseries by which we are on every side surrounded and almost overwhelmed, should shake our faith in that felicity which as yet lies hid."
2. "For our faith cannot stand otherwise than by looking to the coming of Christ. The reason why God defers the manifestation of our glory is this, because Christ is not manifested in the power of his kingdom."
3. "We shall be like him, because he will make our vile body conformable to his glorious body."
