# 1 John 3:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When our own conscience condemns us, we can find assurance before God who is greater than our heart. Our conscience serves as an accuser and a judge, but it is God who knows all things and has the power over our hearts. He sees beyond what our conscience sees and knows even the thoughts that we may have forgotten. His love and compassion surpass our understanding, and he desires peace for us. Let us therefore trust in his infinite wisdom and seek his forgiveness and guidance.
