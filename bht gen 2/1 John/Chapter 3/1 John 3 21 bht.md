# 1 John 3:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Beloved, if we live in a way that our heart does not condemn us, we can have confidence in approaching God. This confidence is not based on our own merit, but on the assurance that God graciously accepts us as pardoned sinners. As Christians, we know Christ's precepts and examine ourselves by them. Our confidence toward God is grounded in the understanding that we desire to fear Him and submit to His righteousness. Therefore, we can draw near to God with a holy and humble boldness, assured that He will answer our prayers.
