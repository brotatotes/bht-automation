# 1 John 3:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When we seek God's answers to our prayers, we must approach Him through Christ, relying on Him as the Mediator. Though our requests may not always be fulfilled as we expect, God will respond in a way that is ultimately better for us. To receive regular answers from God, we must not only keep His commandments but also ensure that our prayers align with His will. This requires asking in faith, trusting in His covenant and promises. God is pleased when we obey His commandments out of love and with the intention of bringing Him glory.

"Not as though our merits earned a hearing for our prayers, but when we are believers in Christ, all our works of faith being the fruit of His Spirit in us, are 'pleasing in God's sight'; and our prayers being the voice of the same Spirit of God in us, naturally and necessarily are answered by Him."
