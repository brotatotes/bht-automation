# 1 John 3:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The commandment of God can be summed up in one word: faith and love. Our faith and love should be in accordance with His command, for faith works by love. It is through belief in Him that we can go forth in acts of looking at Him, coming to Him, and trusting Him for life and salvation. This is the one commandment that encompasses all others, and if we uphold it, keeping all other commandments becomes easier.
