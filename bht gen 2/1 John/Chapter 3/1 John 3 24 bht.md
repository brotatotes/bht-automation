# 1 John 3:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are called to abide in God and for God to abide in them through the Holy Spirit. This indwelling Spirit is the source of their spiritual life and the sure sign of their union with God in Christ. The Spirit enlightens minds, sustains in trials, and empowers believers to live in righteousness. The presence of the Spirit is evidenced by the fruits of righteousness and love and by the relief of others in need. It is through the Spirit's indwelling presence that believers have the assurance of their union with Christ and of God abiding in them.
