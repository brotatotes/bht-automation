# 1 John 3:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers find their hope grounded in God's promises, which is where they place their trust. This hope is rooted in the desire to be like Christ, as reflected in 1 John 3:11 and 1 John 3:23. As believers purify themselves by the work of the Spirit in them, it is important to recognize that their justification through faith precedes this purification. The aim is to become unsullied and pure like Christ. Through hope, believers are motivated to strive for holiness and be conformed to the likeness of Christ, ultimately leading to the eternal realization of their calling.
