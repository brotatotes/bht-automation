# 1 John 3:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Sin is the violation of God's law, a transgression that misses the mark of His will. In the truest sense, every sin, regardless of its nature or magnitude, is a wrongful act against God Himself. The purpose of Jesus' manifestation was to take away the sins of humanity, to cleanse us from the indwelling of sin and bring us into conformity with righteousness. Therefore, we are called to abstain from sin, to resist the allure of lawlessness, and to pursue a life of holiness in accordance with God's commandments.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Every sin whatever then is a transgression of God’s law: as indeed its very name implies: ἁμαρτάνειν being to miss a mark, and the mark being that will of God which is the νόμος and σκοπός to him who ποιεῖ τὸ θέλημα τοῦ θεοῦ." 
2. "The assertions are all perfectly general, and regard, in the true root and ideal, every sin whatever."
3. "No appropriation must be made, in this verse and throughout this passage, of ἁμαρτία to one kind of sin, whether it be mortal sin as distinguished from venial, or notorious and unrepented sins, or sins against brotherly love."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "John often sets forth the same truth negatively, which he had before set forth positively."
2. "Whosoever—Greek, 'Every one who.' committeth sin—in contrast to 1 John 3:3, 'Every man that hath this hope in Him purifieth himself'; and 1 John 3:3- :, 'He that doeth righteousness.'"
3. "Sin is . . . transgression of . . . law—definition of sin in general. The Greek having the article to both, implies that they are convertible terms."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The object of the apostle here is to excite them to holiness, and to deter them from committing sin."
2. "The consideration which he here states is, that all sin is a transgression of law, and that he who commits it, under whatever pretence, is to be held as a transgressor of the law."
3. "This important verse may be considered in two aspects - as a definition of the nature of sin, and as an argument against indulgence in it, or against committing it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The phrase to do sin regards sin as something actually realized in its completeness."
2. "He that does sin realizes in action the sin (note the article thn) that which includes and represents the complete ideal of sin."
3. "Sin is the violation of the law of our being, the law which includes our threefold relation to God, to the men and things around us, and to ourselves."

### John Calvin:
1. "But now, as men are wont to indulge themselves more than they ought, in evils, he reproves this perverse indulgence, declaring that all they who sin are wicked and transgressors of the law."
2. "For the faithful, who are as yet tempted by the lusts of the flesh, are not to be deemed guilty of iniquity, though they are not pure or free from sin, but as sin does not reign in them, John says that they do not sin."
3. "The import of the passage is, that the perverse life of those who indulge themselves in the liberty of sinning, is hateful to God, and cannot be borne with by him, because it is contrary to his Law."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And ye know that he was manifested to take away sins: and in him is no sin." 
2. "To be pure from sin is to be cleansed from its indwelling; to be righteous is to be conformed to the requirements of law: it is the opposite of ‘lawlessness’ here, which contradicts express ordinance, and of ‘unrighteousness’ in chap. 1 John 5:17, which is the absence of the internal principle of right."
3. "Here, however, he only declares that the design of the Saviour’s manifestation was to take away not law, but transgression of law."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Sin is lawlessness." 
2. "Doing sin is the converse of doing righteousness."
3. "The present active participle means the habit of doing sin."

### John Gill:
1. "This, in connection with what follows, is true of any sin, great or small, but here designs a course of sinning, a wilful, obstinate, persisting in sin." 
2. "Sin is ultimately against God himself." 
3. "But then the transgression of what is not the law of God, whether the traditions of the elders among the Jews, or the ordinances of men among Papists, Pagans, and Turks, or any other, is no sin, nor should affect the consciences of men."

### John Wesley:
1. "Whosoever committeth sin — Thereby transgresseth the holy, just, and good law of God, and so sets his authority at nought."
