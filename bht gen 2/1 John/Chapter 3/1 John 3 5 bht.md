## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He became incarnate that He might blot [sin] out: He has no stain of it on Himself."
2. "The most palpable violations of the construction and sense are made by the rationalists."
3. "It is only by holding fast here the personal reference to Christ in himself, that we keep the logical coherence between that verse and this: the reasoning from that which He is not, and cannot be, to that which they that abide in Him are not and cannot be)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The very object of Christ's manifestation in the flesh was to take away all sins, as the scapegoat did typically." 
2. "In him is no sin - not 'was', but 'is', as in 1 John 2:1, 'He is righteous,' and 1 John 3:3, 'He is pure.' Therefore we are to be so."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Lord Jesus saw sin to be so great an evil, that he came into our world, and gave himself to the bitter sorrows of death on the cross, to redeem us from it." 
2. "The whole work of Christ was designed to deliver us from the dominion of sin, not to furnish us the means of indulgence in it; and that, therefore, we should be deterred from it by all that Christ has done and suffered for us." 
3. "An additional consideration to show that we should be holy. As he was perfectly pure and spotless, so should all his followers aim to be; and none can truly pretend to be his who do not desire and design to become like him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Including Christ's whole life on earth and its consequences." 
2. "John uses various terms to describe the incarnation." 
3. "He is essentially and forever without sin."

### John Calvin:
1. "He who believes in Christ is necessarily cleansed from his sins."
2. "Wherever Christ diffuses his efficacious grace, he denies that there is any more room for sin."
3. "It cannot then be but that the faithful are exposed to sin as long as they live in the world; but as far as the kingdom of Christ prevails in them, sin is abolished."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He (εκεινος). As in verse 1 John 3:3; John 1:18.Was manifested (εφανερωθη). Same form as in verse 1 John 3:2, but here of the Incarnation as in John 21:1, not of the second coming (1 John 2:28)."
2. "To take away sins (ινα τας αμαρτιας αρη). Purpose clause with ινα and first aorist active subjunctive of αιρω as in John 1:29. In Isaiah 53:11 we have αναφερω for bearing sins, but αιρω properly means to lift up and carry away (John 2:16)."
3. "And in him is no sin (κα αμαρτια εν αυτω ουκ εστιν). 'And sin (the sinful principle) in him is not.' As Jesus had claimed about himself (John 7:18; John 8:46) and as is repeatedly stated in the N.T. (2 Corinthians 5:21; Hebrews 4:15; Hebrews 7:26; Hebrews 9:13)."

### John Gill:
1. "Jesus Christ, the Word and Son of God, who is here meant, who was with the Father, and lay in his bosom from all eternity, was in the fulness of time made manifest in the flesh, or human nature, by assuming it into union with his divine person."
2. "The end of which manifestation was, to take away our sins; as the antitype of the scape goat, making reconciliation and satisfaction for them, through the sacrifice of himself."
3. "And in him is no sin; neither original, nor actual; no sin inherent; there was sin imputed to him, but none in him, nor done by him; and hence he became a fit person to be a sacrifice for the sins of others, and by his unblemished sacrifice to take the away."

### John Wesley:
1. "Christ...came into the world for this very purpose."
2. "To take away our sins...and leave none remaining."
3. "He could not suffer on his own account, but to make us as himself."
