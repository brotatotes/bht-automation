# 1 John 3:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who remain in close fellowship with Christ, by maintaining a deep and loving faith, live in a way that is not characterized by sin as long as they abide in Him. However, when they sin, it is evident that they have temporarily shifted their focus away from God. In that moment, they lose their experiential knowledge of Him, even if they had it before. Therefore, it is vital for believers to continually abide in Christ and cultivate their intimate relationship with Him, guarding against sin and staying connected to the source of their spiritual life and growth.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Nothing short of personal immanence in the personal Christ will satisfy the words: a living because He lives, and as receiving of His fullness." 
2. "If the child of God falls into sin, it is an act against nature, deadly to life, hardly endured, and bringing bitter repentance: it is as the taking of a poison, which if it be not corrected by its antidote, will sap the very springs of life."
3. "The cutting off by an act of sin of the sight and knowledge of Christ, shows, and shows in proportion as it prevails, unreality in that sight and knowledge."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He reasons from Christ's own
	entire separation from sin, that those in him must also be separate
	from it." 
2. "The life of sin and the life of God mutually exclude
	one another, just as darkness and light."
3. "All sin as such is at variance with the notion of one regenerated.
	Not that 'whosoever is betrayed into sins has never seen nor
	known God'; but in so far as sin exists, in that
	degree the spiritual intuition and knowledge of God do not exist
	in him."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We have some sort of relation to him similar to that which we have to our home... We remain steadfast in our attachment to him."
2. "He who is born again does not sin habitually... If a man sins habitually, it proves that he has never been renewed."
3. "He who is born again will not sin finally... There is a principle of grace by which he will ultimately be restrained and recovered."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "To abide in Christ is more than to be in Him, since it represents a condition maintained by communion with God and by the habitual doing of His will." 
2. "John does not teach that believers do not sin, but is speaking of a character, a habit."
3. "Throughout the Epistle he deals with the ideal reality of life in God, in which the love of God and sin exclude each other as light and darkness."

### John Calvin:
1. "Whosoever sinneth hath not seen him."
2. "For Christ is never dormant where he reigns, but the Spirit renders effectual his power."
3. "It may be rightly said of him, that he puts sin to flight, not otherwise than as the sun drives away darkness by its own brightness."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Sineth not (ουχ αμαρτανε). Linear present (linear μενων, keeps on abiding) active indicative of αμαρτανω, 'does not keep on sinning.'"
2. "Whosoever sinneth (ο αμαρτανων). Present (linear) active articular participle like μενων above, 'the one who keeps on sinning' (lives a life of sin, not mere occasional acts of sin as αμαρτησας, aorist active participle, would mean)."
3. "Hath not seen him (ουχ εωρακεν αυτον). Perfect active indicative of οραω. The habit of sin is proof that one has not the vision or the knowledge (εγνωκεν, perfect active also) of Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "Whosoever abideth in him,.... As the branch in the vine, deriving all light, life, grace, holiness, wisdom, strength, joy, peace, and comfort from Christ..."
2. "...or dwells in him by faith, enjoys communion with him as a fruit of union to him..."
3. "...nor has he ever savingly known him, or been experimentally acquainted with him; for though he may profess to know him in words, he denies him in works."

### John Wesley:
1. "Whosoever abideth in communion with him, by loving faith, sinneth not - While he so abideth." 
2. "Whosoever sinneth certainly seeth him not - The loving eye of his soul is not then fixed upon God."
3. "Neither doth he then experimentally know him - Whatever he did in time past."
