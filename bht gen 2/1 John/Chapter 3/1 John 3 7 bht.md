# 1 John 3:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is important to not be deceived by the notion that one can live a life of sin and still be considered a true child of God. A righteous person is not defined by their actions alone, but by their inner state of righteousness that is derived from being born of God. Good works are not what make a person righteous, but rather serve as an outward reflection of their inner righteousness. It is crucial to understand that claiming righteousness is not based on personal merit, but on the undeserved grace and favor of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as He is righteous." 
2. "The Apostle...is reasoning...from the hypothesis of a man's being a child of God, born of Him and like Him, to the necessity of his purifying himself and doing righteousness." 
3. "Good works of piety do not make a good pious man, but a good pious man does good pious works."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "he that doeth . . . is righteousâ€”Not his doing makes him righteous, but his being righteous makes him to do righteousness."
2. "Works do not justify, but the justified man works. We infer from his doing righteousness that he is already righteous and is therefore born of God."
3. "The tree that bears good fruit is a good tree, and has a living root; not that the fruit makes the tree and its root to be good, but it shows that they are so."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Let no man deceive you...by persuading you that a man may live in sinful practices, and yet be a true child of God."
2. "The man who does righteousness, or leads an upright life, is a righteous man, and no other one is."
3. "Such a man, however, will always feel that his claim to be regarded as a righteous man is not to be traced to what he is in himself, but to what he owes to the grace of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Little children. See on 2 1. Deceive [Ï€Î»Î±Î½Î±Ï„Ï‰] . Rev., better, lead astray."
2. "Not merely doing righteous acts. 'In his relation to other men he will do what is just; and in his relation to the gods he will do what is holy; and he who does what is just and holy cannot be other than just and holy' (Plato, 'Gorgias,' 507)."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Apostle shews here that newness of life is testified by good works; nor does that likeness of which he has spoken, that is between Christ and his members, appear, except by the fruits they bring forth; as though he had said, 'Since it behooves us to be conformed to Christ, the truth and evidence of this must appear in our life.'"
2. "The exhortation is the same with that of Paul in Galatians 'If ye live in the Spirit, walk also in the Spirit.' For many would gladly persuade themselves that they have this righteousness buried in their hearts, while iniquity evidently occupies their feet, and hands, and tongue, and eyes."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Let no one keep on leading you astray."
2. "He that keeps on doing righteousness."
3. "Christ as in verse 1 John 3:5."

### John Gill:
1. "suggesting, as the Gnostics did, that knowledge without practice was enough, and that it was no matter how a man lived, provided his notions of the Gospel were right"
2. "men are only made righteous by the righteousness of Christ, which he has wrought out which is revealed in the Gospel, and received by faith, and which God imputes without works"
3. "faith to be right which lays hold on the righteousness of Christ, by which he is truly righteous: even as he is righteous"

### John Wesley:
1. Let no one deceive you â€” Let none persuade you that any man is righteous but he that uniformly practises righteousness; he alone is righteous, after the example of his Lord.
