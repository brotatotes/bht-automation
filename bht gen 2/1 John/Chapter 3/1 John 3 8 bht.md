# 1 John 3:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When someone perpetually commits sin, they align themselves with the devil, who has been sinning from the beginning and hasn't stopped. The Son of God, in his manifestation, came to abolish the entirety of sin, which is the devil's handiwork. This suggests that if we place our trust in Him, He will surely accomplish this goal in us.
