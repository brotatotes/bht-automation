# 1 John 3:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The one who is born of God, who is regenerated and transformed in Christ, does not continue in a lifestyle of sin. The presence of the divine seed of faith within them prevents them from persisting in sin. As a new creation in Christ, they have a deep desire to resist and reject sin in all its forms. This transformation is the result of being born of God, and it enables the believer to live a life that reflects their new identity in Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "To be begotten of God and to sin, are states mutually excluding one another."
2. "The regenerate life is incompatible with sin, and gives the believer a hatred for sin in every shape, and an unceasing desire to resist it."
3. "The normal direction of the believer's energies is against sin; the law of God after the inward man is the ruling principle of his true self though the old nature, not yet fully deadened, rebels and sins."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If it can be used as referring to the doctrine of absolute perfection at all, it proves, not that Christians may be perfect, or that a 'portion' of them are, but that all are."
2. "The exact idea here, as it seems to me, is not that the 'seed' refers to 'the word of God,' as Augustin and others suppose, or to 'the Spirit of God,' but to the germ of piety which has been produced in the heart 'by' the word and Spirit of God, and which may be regarded as having been implanted there by God himself, and which may be expected to produce holiness in the life."
3. "The idea is clearly that the germ or principle of piety so permanently abides in the soul, that he who is renewed never can become again characteristically a sinner."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Whosoever is born [πας ο γεγεννημενος]...he who hath been begotten and remains God's child."
2. "His seed. The divine principle of life."
3. "Conceived as a perfect ideal, life in God excludes the possibility of sin."

### John Calvin:
1. "The design of regeneration is to destroy sin, and all who are born of God lead a righteous and holy life because the Spirit of God restrains the lusting of sin."
2. "The hearts of the godly are so effectually governed by the Spirit of God, that through an inflexible disposition they follow his guidance."
3. "The will is a natural power, but as nature is corrupted, it has only depraved inclinations. It is hence necessary that the Spirit of God should renew it, in order that it may begin to be good, and carry on what he has begun to the end."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The child of God does not have the habit of sin."
2. "And he cannot go on sinning, as is true of αμαρτανε in verse 1 John 3:8 and αμαρτανων in verse 1 John 3:6."
3. "A great deal of false theology has grown out of a misunderstanding of the tense of αμαρτανειν here."

### John Gill:
1. "Whosoever is born of God....are regenerated, or born from above....new creatures in Christ....gives up himself to it; he is not without the being of it in him....but he does not so commit it as to be the servant of it, a slave unto it, or to continue in it."
2. "And he cannot sin....live in a continued course of sinning, and with pleasure, and without reluctance, and so as to lie in it."
3. "The reason of the impeccability of the regenerate man, as such, is because he is born of God....preserve him from the temptations of Satan, the pollutions of the world, and the corruptions of his own heart."

### John Wesley:
1. "Whosoever is born of God...doth not commit sin."
2. "The divine seed of loving faith abideth in him; and, so long as it doth, he cannot sin."
3. "He is born of God - Is inwardly and universally changed."
