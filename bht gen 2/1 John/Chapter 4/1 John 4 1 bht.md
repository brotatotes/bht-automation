# 1 John 4:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are urged not to blindly trust every spirit that claims to be from God but to evaluate and examine them. This evaluation should be based on the standard of the written word of God. Any teaching that does not align with the principles and truths revealed in Scripture should be considered as not coming from the Spirit of God. It is essential to compare the teachings of all spirits, including the claims of prophets and spiritual leaders, with the truths found in the Bible to ensure that they are from God.

### Henry Alford:
1. "Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God."
2. "By the nature of the testimony of the human spirits, we shall know whether they are of God or not; whether they are organs of the Spirit of Truth or of the spirit of error."
3. "Many false-prophets are gone forth into the world."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Beloved—the affectionate address wherewith he calls their attention, as to an important subject."
2. "Every spirit—which presents itself in the person of a prophet. The Spirit of truth, and the spirit of error, speak by men's spirits as their organs."
3. "Even an angel's message should be tested by the word of God: much more men's teachings, however holy the teachers may seem."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Beloved, believe not every spirit... The true and the false teachers of religion alike claimed to be under the influence of the Spirit of God, and it was of importance that all such pretensions should be examined."
2. "But try the spirits whether they are of God... It is important that all pretensions of this kind should be subjected to a rigid examination. No one should be received as a religious teacher without the clearest evidence that he has come in accordance with the will of God."
3. "Because many false prophets are gone out into the world... it was their duty to be on their guard against them, for they had the very spirit of antichrist."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Beloved. Again the recognition of danger from false spirits prompts this affectionate address."
2. "Compare the phrase discerning of spirits, 1 Corinthians 12:10."
3. "The false prophet supports his claims by signs and portents and is thus distinguished from the false teacher."

### John Calvin:
1. "We ought, then, to take heed lest, being offended at the variety of opinions, we should discard teachers, and, together with them, the word of God."
2. "The word spirit I take metonymically, as signifying him who boasts that he is endowed with the gift of the Spirit to perform his office as a prophet."
3. "But the Spirit will only thus guide us to a right discrimination, when we render all our thoughts subject to God’s word; for it is, as it has been said, like the touchstone, yea, it ought to be deemed most necessary to us; for that alone is true doctrine which is drawn from it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Believe not every spirit, but prove the spirits whether they be of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world."
2. "The ‘spirits’ and the ‘false prophets’ are one. They are ‘antichrists’ in chap. 2; but the predominant reference to the Holy Ghost in this section gives occasion for the use of these two terms."
3. "As teachers they are not to be believed until tested: hence we are not to speak here of the gift of ‘discerning spirits’ (1 Corinthians 12:10), but of the universal duty incumbent on every Christian, of trying the doctrine brought concerning the Son of God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Believe not every spirit... Credulity means gullibility and some believers fall easy victims to the latest fads in spiritualistic humbuggery." 
2. "Prove the spirits... Put them to the acid test of truth as the metallurgist does his metals. If it stands the test like a coin, it is acceptable, otherwise it is rejected." 
3. "Many false prophets... It is an old story and recurs again and again along with false teachers."

### John Gill:
1. "Every true minister of the Gospel has the Spirit, and the gifts of the Spirit, more or less, to qualify him for his work; he is separated, and called to it by him, and receives his spiritual light find knowledge from him."
2. "Though some professing to have the Spirit of Christ are to be believed, yet not everyone; and though the Spirit is not to be quenched in any, nor prophesying to be despised, yet care should be taken what is heard and received."
3. "And the reason why such a trial should be made is, because many false prophets are gone out into the world: such who pretended either to a revelation of future things, and to foretell things to come; or rather to a gift of prophesying, or preaching in Christ's name, to be 'prophets' and spiritual men, and ministers of the word, but were 'false' ones."

### John Wesley:
1. "Believe not every spirit, but try the spirits." 
2. "We are to try all spirits by the written word: 'To the law and to the testimony!'" 
3. "If any man speak not according to these, the spirit which actuates him is not of God."
