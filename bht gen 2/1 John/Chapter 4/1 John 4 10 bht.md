# 1 John 4:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's love is incomparable, unmatched in its magnitude and demonstrated through this act, which leaves no doubt of its authenticity. It is a love that goes beyond human comprehension. Christ's sacrifice as the propitiation for our sins reconciles love and justice, bringing peace and righteousness through his atoning work.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In this is love, not in the fact that …, but in the fact that".… Thus taken, there is no difficulty whatever in the sentence."
2. "An act of His towards us. It is not the nature of our love to God, as contrasted with His to us, of which the clause treats, but the non-existence of the one love as set against the historical manifestation of the other."
3. "His death being therein implied, by which that propitiation was wrought, Ephesians 1:7; and that, God’s giving His own Son to death for us, being the greatest and crowning act of divine Love."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Herein is love—love in the abstract: love, in its highest ideal, is herein."
2. "The love was all on God's side, none on ours."
3. "Not that we loved God—though so altogether worthy of love. He loved us—though so altogether unworthy of love."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Herein is love - In this great gift is the highest expression of love, as if it had done all that it can do."
2. "But we were alienated from him. We had even no desire for his friendship and favor. In this state he showed the greatness of his love for us by giving his Son to die for his enemies."
3. "But that he loved us - Not that he approved our character, but that he desired our welfare. He loved us not with the love of complacency, but with the love of benevolence."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Propitiation. See on 2 2.

### John Calvin:
1. "He meant by these words to teach us that God’s love towards us has been gratuitous."
2. "God freely loved us, — how so? because he loved us before we were born, and also when, through depravity of nature, we had hearts turned away from him."
3. "Hence all who inquire, apart from Christ, what is settled respecting them in God’s secret counsel, are mad to their own ruin."
