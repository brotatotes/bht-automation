# 1 John 4:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If God has loved us and shown such a great manifestation of love, we are therefore obligated to love one another, especially our fellow Christians and brethren. This love should not be self-seeking or conditional, but rather an imitation of God's love towards us, which is undeserved and unparalleled. We should continue to show love for one another, reflecting the love that God has shown to us.
