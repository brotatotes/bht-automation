# 1 John 4:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God, who remains unseen, has provided a way for us to have a true knowledge of Him. This knowledge is revealed through our love for one another, which serves as evidence of His presence in our lives. Although we cannot physically see God, we can experience His nearness and indwelling through the exercise of love. Our love for one another not only signifies our love for God, but it also reflects His own love. This love, when expressed sincerely and genuinely, represents the perfect operation of His love within us.
