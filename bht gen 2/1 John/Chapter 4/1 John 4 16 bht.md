# 1 John 4:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's love for us is something we come to know and believe, which is made possible by the Spirit. It is not just a head knowledge, but a deep conviction in our hearts. This love is not only one-sided, but reciprocal, as we dwell in God's love and He dwells in us. It is a mutual indwelling that transforms our lives and draws us closer to Him.
