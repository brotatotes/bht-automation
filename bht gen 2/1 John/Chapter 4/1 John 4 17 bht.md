# 1 John 4:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The love of God within us is perfected, enabling us to have confidence in the day of judgment. By embracing us in love, God allows us to enjoy His grace manifested through Christ. Our love is not dependent on our love for others, but rather on God's unwavering love for us. This perfect love frees us from fear and allows us to boldly approach Christ, praising Him for our salvation both now and for all eternity.
