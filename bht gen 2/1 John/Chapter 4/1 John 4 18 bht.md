# 1 John 4:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who truly love Christ and His Gospel are not afraid of anyone or anything. The spirit of power, love, and a sound mind is completely opposite to a spirit of fear. In fact, the strength that comes from brotherly love is so great that it enables believers to face even death without fear. When love for one another is perfected, it frees believers from the fears of men, devils, and the judgment to come. In this perfect love, there is no room for slavish fear.
