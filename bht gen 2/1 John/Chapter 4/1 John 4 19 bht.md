# 1 John 4:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We love God because He first loved us. His love is the foundation of our love for Him, and it is through His love that we are able to love others. The early display of His love towards us, even before we knew Him, should animate and inflame our love for Him. His love is the source and motivation for our faith and love. This is the essence of true religion and the model of genuine Christianity.
