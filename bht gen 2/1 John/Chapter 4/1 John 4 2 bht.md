# 1 John 4:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By acknowledging that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh, a teacher shows that they are guided by the Spirit of God. This confession encompasses not only Jesus as the Christ and His physical incarnation, but also His offices as the anointed prophet, priest, and king. Any doctrine that carries this truth is from God, and anyone who preaches these truths aligns themselves with God and the truth. This confession serves as a crucial test for distinguishing between true and false teachers, enabling believers to discern who is truly inspired by the Spirit of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Every spirit—that is,
	Every teacher claiming inspiration by the HOLY
	SPIRIT."
2. "Jesus Christ is come in the
	flesh—a twofold truth confessed, that Jesus is the
	Christ, and that He is come (the Greek perfect
	tense implies not a mere past historical fact, as the aorist would,
	but also the present continuance of the fact and its blessed
	effects) in the flesh ("clothed with flesh": not
	with a mere seeming humanity, as the Docetæ afterwards
	taught: He therefore was, previously, something far above flesh)."
3. "His flesh implies His death for us, for only by assuming
	flesh could He die (for as God He could not), Hebrews 2:9;
	Hebrews 2:10; Hebrews 2:14;
	Hebrews 2:16; and His death implies
	His LOVE for us."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "By this; that is, by the test which is immediately specified... You may discern who are actuated by the Spirit of God."
2. "If they did not do this, it would be decisive in regard to their character and claims."
3. "The acknowledgment was to be that Christ assumed human nature; that he was really a man as he appeared to be: or that there was a real incarnation, in opposition to the opinion that he came in appearance only, or that he merely seemed to be a man, and to suffer and die."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Know ye [γινωσκετε] . Perceive."
2. "Confesseth [ομολογει] . That Jesus Christ is come in the flesh."
3. "The whole phrase forms the direct object of the verb confesseth."

### John Calvin:
1. "He lays down a special mark by which they might more easily distinguish between true and false prophets."
2. "As long then as we abide in Christ, there is safety; but when we depart from him, faith is lost, and all truth is rendered void."
3. "Christ is the end of the law and the prophets; nor do we learn anything else from the gospel but his power and grace."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The test of 'the Spirit of God' here alone in this Epistle, save verse 1 John 4:13."
2. "The predicate participle describes Jesus as already come in the flesh, his actual humanity, not a phantom body as the Docetic Gnostics held."
3. "A like test is proposed by Paul for confessing the deity of Jesus Christ in 1 Corinthians 12:3 and for the Incarnation and Resurrection of Jesus in Romans 10:6-10."

### John Gill:
1. "Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is of God; or of the Spirit of God; that is, every doctrine which carries this truth in it."
2. "It also includes his offices, as that Jesus of Nazareth was the Christ, the Messiah, which the Jews denied, and that he was the anointed prophet, priest, and King; and so is a confession or acknowledgment of all the doctrines of the Gospel."
3. "But the spirit, or doctrine, which contains these things in it, is certainly of God, or comes from him; or whoever brings these truths with him, and preaches them, he is, so far as he does so, on the side of God and truth, and to be regarded."

### John Wesley:
1. "Every spirit - Or teacher. Which confesseth - Both with heart and voice. Jesus Christ, who is come in the flesh, is of God - This his coming presupposes, contains, and draws after it, the whole doctrine of Christ."
