# 1 John 4:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If a person claims to love God but harbors hatred towards their brother, it is a contradiction and a falsehood. How can they truly love God whom they have not seen if they do not even love their brother whom they have seen on a daily basis? It is irrational and impossible to consider such a claim as truthful. Love should extend to those whom we can see and relate to, as they serve as a tangible expression of God's image.
