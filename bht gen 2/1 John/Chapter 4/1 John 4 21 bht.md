# 1 John 4:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The commandment to love God also extends to loving our fellow brothers and sisters. Just as love for God requires loving our neighbor, they are interconnected in the same commandment. This means that regardless of our differences in opinions or modes of worship, we are to love one another purely because we are all children of God. Any form of bigotry, which is a lack of this universal love, arises when we only love those who share our beliefs and practices, rather than loving them for Christ's sake.
