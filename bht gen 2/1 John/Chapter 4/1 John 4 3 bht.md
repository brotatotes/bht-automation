# 1 John 4:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Ye have heard that it cometh, and now it is in the world already - This false teaching, which denies the true nature of Christ, has already begun to infiltrate the world. The Apostle emphasizes the urgency of recognizing and rejecting this spirit of antichrist, as it threatens to undermine the essential doctrine of the Christian faith. It is important for believers to remain vigilant and steadfast in their confession of Jesus Christ as both fully human and fully divine.

1. "Confesseth not (μη ομολογε)... It is seen also in 2 Peter 1:9; Titus 1:11, a survival of the literary construction."
2. "The Vulgate (along with Irenaeus, Tertullian, Augustine) reads solvit (λυε) instead of μη ομολογε, which means 'separates Jesus,' apparently an allusion to the Cerinthian heresy."

1. "And every spirit that confesseth not,.... The proper deity and sonship of Christ, his true and real humanity, and his Messiahship; or any of his offices, doctrines, and ordinances; or his satisfaction and righteousness; or that peace, pardon, justification, life, and salvation, are by him..."
2. "...every spirit that dissolves Jesus, that separates the two natures, human and divine, in him, and makes two persons of them; or denies either of them, either that he is truly God, or really man, or denies him to be Jesus, the Saviour; who, as much as in him lies, destroys his person, office, and work, and makes void his obedience, sufferings, and death..."
3. "...every doctrine that is calculated against these truths is the spirit and doctrine of antichrist:whereof you have heard that it should come, and even now already is it the world; in the false teachers, the forerunners of antichrist..."
