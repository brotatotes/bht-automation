# 1 John 4:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We, as Apostles, are directly taught and sent by God, and by this we are able to discern and understand the spirit of truth versus the spirit of error, as explained in 1 John 4:2-6. Through our deep understanding and intimate connection with God, we are able to speak and convey His divine words that are pleasing and glorifying to Him. Therefore, it is important for us, as believers, to diligently discern the teachings we receive, both externally and internally, with a firm belief and adherence to the truth of God's word.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Apostle sets ὁ γινώσκων τὸν θεόν in the place of ὁ ὢν ἐκ τοῦ θεοῦ, as belonging more immediately to the matter in hand, the hearing, and receiving more knowledge."
2. "The Apostle is giving a test to distinguish, not the children of God from those who are not children of God, but the spirit of truth from the spirit of error, as is clear from the words following."
3. "We know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "We—true teachers of Christ: in contrast to them."
2. "Hereby... by their confessing, or not confessing, Jesus; by the kind of reception given them respectively by those who know God, and by those who are of the world and not of God."
3. "spirit of truth—the Spirit which comes from God and teaches truth."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Might not, and ought not, all Christians, and all Christian ministers, so to live that the same thing might be assumed in regard to them in their contact with their fellow-men; that their characters for integrity and purity might be so clear that no one would be disposed to call them in question?"
2. "Every one that has a true acquaintance with the character of God will receive our doctrine."
3. "They who do not receive the plain doctrines laid down in the word of God, whatever pretensions they may make to piety, or whatever zeal they may evince in the cause which they have espoused, can have no well-founded claims to the name Christian."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He that knoweth - he who is habitually and ever more clearly perceiving and recognizing God as his Christian life unfolds." 
2. "The knowledge is regarded as progressive and not complete." 
3. "The spirit of error - the phrase occurs nowhere else in the New Testament."

### John Calvin:
1. "We ought, however, always to bear in mind the subject which he here handles; small was the number of the godly, and unbelief prevailed almost everywhere; few really adhered to the Gospel, the greater part were running headlong into errors."
2. "By these words he intimates that the vast multitude to whom the Gospel is not acceptable, do not hear the faithful and true servants of God, because they are alienated from God himself. It is then no diminution to the authority of the Gospel that many reject it."
3. "But to this doctrine is added a useful admonition, that by the obedience of faith we are to prove ourselves to be of God...to revere God’s word is the only true evidence that we fear him."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "We are in tune with the Infinite God."
2. "The heart of Christianity is mysticism - spiritual contact with God in Christ by the Holy Spirit."
3. "There is no reason for Christians being duped by 'the spirit of error'."

### John Gill:
1. "being of God, they spoke the words of God, which were agreeable to him, which made for the glory of the three divine Persons"
2. "not only professionally, but practically; that has an experimental knowledge of him, that knows him as exercising lovingkindness, having tasted of his grace and goodness"
3. "not only externally, constantly attending on the ministry of the word, as such do; but internally, understanding what is heard, receiving it in love, cordially embracing it, and firmly believing it, and acting according to it"

### John Wesley:
1. We — Apostles.Are of God — Immediately taught, and sent by him.Hereby we know — From what is said, 1 John 4:2-6.
