# 1 John 4:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers, let us love one another, for love is the defining characteristic of God's children. This love, which flows from God Himself, shows that we have His Spirit and belong to Him. It is not enough to claim to love God while hating our brothers and sisters; this is a contradiction. Only those who truly love God and their neighbors are born of God and have been transformed by His love. Let us, therefore, persist in loving one another, manifesting the love that God has poured into our hearts through His Spirit.
