# 1 John 4:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God is love. This profound statement is the heartbeat of the Christian faith. It reveals that those who do not love, do not truly know God. Love is not just an attribute, but the very essence of God Himself. His love is all-encompassing, flowing from Him and transforming those who experience it. As believers, we are called to love one another, as this is a reflection of the love God has poured out on us. Through love, we come to know and experience the true nature of our loving Heavenly Father.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He that loveth not hath never known God...because God is love." 
2. "Love is the very essence, not merely an attribute, of God. It is co-essential with Him: He is all love, love is all of Him."
3. "Unless he is speaking of the essential being of God...the whole force of the axiom as it stands in the Apostle’s argument is lost."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "God is fundamentally and essentially LOVE."
2. "This man doth not love, and therefore knows not love: God is essentially love, therefore he knows not God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He that loveth not, knoweth not God - Has no true acquaintance with God; has no just views of him, and no right feelings toward him."
2. "Never was a more important declaration made than this; never was more meaning crowded into a few words than in this short sentence - “God is love.”"
3. "In the midst of all that occurs on the earth of sadness, sin, and sorrow, there are abundant evidences that God is love."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Knoweth not [ουκ εγνω]: The aroist tense: did not know, from the beginning. He never knew." 
2. "Is love [αγαπη εστι. ν]: Spirit and light are expressions of God's essential nature. Love is the expression of His personality corresponding to His nature."
3. "Truth and love stand related to each other. Loving is the condition of knowing."

### John Calvin:
1. "He also sets in opposition to this, according to his usual manner, the contrary clause, that there is no knowledge of God where there is no love."
2. "But the meaning of the Apostle is simply this, — that as God is the fountain of love, this effect flows from him, and is diffused wherever the knowledge of him comes."
3. "But two things in the Apostle’s words ought to be noticed, — that the true knowledge of God is that which regenerates and renews us, so that we become new creatures; and that hence it cannot be but that it must conform us to the image of God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He that loveth not (ο μη αγαπων). Present active articular participle of αγαπαω "keeps on not loving.""
2. "Knoweth not God (ουκ εγνω τον θεον). Timeless aorist active indicative of γινωσκω, has no acquaintance with God, never did get acquainted with him."
3. "God is love (ο θεος αγαπη εστιν). Anarthrous predicate, not η αγαπη. John does not say that love is God, but only that God is love. The two terms are not interchangeable. God is also light (1 John 1:5) and spirit (John 4:24)."

### John Gill:
1. "If a man loves not the children of God, those that are born of him, he does not know, so as to love God, the Father of them."
2. "There is an entire love between the three divine Persons, who are in the strictest, and in the most inconceivable and inexpressible manner affected to each other; their love is natural and essential."
3. "God loves all his creatures as such, nor does he hate any of them, as so considered; and he bears an everlasting, unchangeable, and invariable love to his elect in Christ Jesus."

### John Wesley:
1. "God is love — This little sentence brought St. John more sweetness, even in the time he was writing it, than the whole world can bring."
2. "God is often styled holy, righteous, wise; but not holiness, righteousness, or wisdom in the abstract, as he is said to be love."
3. "Love is his darling, his reigning attribute, the attribute that sheds an amiable glory on all his other perfections."
