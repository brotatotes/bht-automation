The love of God toward his chosen ones is beautifully revealed in the sending of his Son, a remarkable and unmistakable proof of his deep affection. This act is an incredible display of his love, magnifying even more when we consider that it is his one and only Son who is sent.

This extraordinary act of love is not just a one-time occurrence, but it is an everlasting expression of God's grace and mercy.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is the grand proof of God's love, His having sent 'His only-begotten Son, that we might live through Him,' who is the Life, and who has redeemed our forfeited life."
2. "Otherwise, too, He could not have been our life, our 'propitiation,' or our 'Saviour.'"
3. "It is...the grand motive to our mutual love."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In this was manifested the love of God - That is, in an eminent manner, or this was a most signal proof of it."
2. "The “measure” of that love, then, which was manifested in the gift of a Saviour, is to be found, (1) In the worth of the soul; (2) In its exposure to eternal death; (3) In the greatness of the gift; (4) In the greatness of his sorrows for us; and, (5) In the immortal blessedness and joy to which he will raise us."
3. "Who can estimate all this? All these things will magnify themselves as we draw near to eternity; and in that eternity to which we go, whether saved or lost, we shall have an ever-expanding view of the wonderful love of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "John describes the incarnation as a sending, more frequently than in any other way."
2. "The perfect tense, hath sent, points to the abiding results of the sending."
3. "A mode of expression common in John, enlarging upon the meaning of a noun by the addition of an adjective or a participle with the article."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ, then, is so illustrious and singular a proof of divine love towards us, that whenever we look upon him, he fully confirms to us the truth that God is love."
2. "He calls him his only begotten, for the sake of amplifying. For in this he more clearly showed how singularly he loved us, because he exposed his only Son to death for our sakes."
3. "He expresses the end for which Christ has been sent by the Father, even that we may live through him, for without him we are all dead, but by his coming he brought life to us; and except our unbelief prevents the effect of his grace, we feel it in ourselves."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Incarnation as in 1 John 3:5."
2. "Jesus alone completely reproduces the nature and character of God."
3. "This life begins here and now."

### John Gill:
1. "The love of God here spoken of, and instanced in, is not his general love to all his creatures, but his special love towards his elect, and which was before it was manifested."
2. "This is a most flagrant and notorious instance of it, in which it is exceedingly conspicuous; this is a most clear proof, a plain and full demonstration of it."
3. "To send his Son to be the Saviour of sinful men is an amazing instance of love; and which appears the more manifest, when it is observed that it is 'his only begotten Son' that is sent."
