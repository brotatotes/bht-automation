# 1 John 5:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Faith in Jesus as the Christ is of great importance, not just an intellectual assent but a wholehearted surrender. Denying this truth is to be a liar, and not believing it leads to death. The purpose of this passage is to assure believers of their eternal life, as faith in Jesus is the key to salvation. Additionally, loving God the Father naturally leads to loving one's fellow believers, as they are also begotten of God and part of His family.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Reason why our 'brother' (1 John 4:21) is entitled to such love, namely, because he is 'born (begotten) of God': so that if we want to show our love to God, we must show it to God's visible representative."
2. "Whosoever—Greek, 'Everyone that.' He could not be our 'Jesus' (God-Saviour) unless He were 'the Christ'; for He could not reveal the way of salvation, except He were a prophet: He could not work out that salvation, except He were a priest: He could not confer that salvation upon us, except He were a king: He could not be prophet, priest, and king, except He were the Christ [PEARSON, Exposition of the Creed]."
3. "born—Translate, 'begotten,' as in the latter part of the verse, the Greek being the same. Christ is the 'only-begotten Son' by generation; we become begotten sons of God by regeneration and adoption."

### John Calvin:

2. "The only true way of believing is when we direct our minds to him [Christ]."
3. "The Apostle declares that all they who really believe have been born of God; for faith is far above the reach of the human mind, so that we must be drawn to Christ by our heavenly Father."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Faith in Jesus as the Christ has here the only meaning that St. John ever gives it: that divinely wrought trust in the work as well as the person of Jesus which the Spirit produces."
2. "The exact link between faith and regeneration is untouched."
3. "The argument is, like that of chap. 1 John 4:20, derived from the general nature of the case; but it is carried to the highest region, and here has the emphasis."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Nothing less will satisfy John, not merely intellectual conviction, but full surrender to Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior."

3. "So then we prove our love for the common Father by our conduct towards our brothers and sisters in Christ."
