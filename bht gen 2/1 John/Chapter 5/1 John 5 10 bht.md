# 1 John 5:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believing in Jesus as the Son of God is not just acknowledging a fact, but rather it is having faith in God's witness and entrusting oneself to Him. Those who believe in Jesus have the assurance within themselves, a deep conviction that comes from the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. On the contrary, rejecting God's testimony and refusing to believe in Jesus reflects a grave charge against God Himself. Such unbelief questions the truthfulness of God's word, disregarding the weighty evidence and denying the glory and power of Christ's person.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The witness of God, by His Spirit, in himself, dwelling in him and witnessing that 'Jesus is the Lord,' 'the Christ,' and 'the Son of God.'"
2. "The witness of the Spirit in the believer himself to his own sonship is not here expressed, but follows as a consequence of believing the witness of God to Jesus' divine Sonship."
3. "Refusal to credit God's testimony ('believeth not God') is involved in refusal to believe IN (to rest one's trust in) Jesus Christ, the object of God's record or testimony."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The evidence that Jesus is the Son of God."
2. "There is the evidence derived from the fact that the soul has found peace by believing in him."
3. "These things constitute a mass of evidence for the truth of the Christian religion."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Faith in the person of Christ, not merely in the fact that Jesus is the Son of God."
2. "To believe God is to believe the message which comes from Him."
3. "The act perpetuates itself in the present condition of the unbeliever."

### John Calvin:
1. "He hence infers that we believe safely and with tranquil minds in Christ, because God by his authority warrants our faith."
2. "As the faithful possess this benefit, that they know themselves to be beyond the danger of erring, because they have God as their foundation; so he makes the ungodly guilty of extreme blasphemy, because they charge God with falsehood."
3. "This ought to be carefully observed. Some wonder why God commends faith so much, why unbelief is so severely condemned. But the glory of God is implicated in this; for since he designed to show a special instance of his truth in the gospel, all they who reject Christ there offered to them, leave nothing to him. Therefore, though we may grant that a man in other parts of his life is like an angel, yet his sanctity is diabolical as long as he rejects Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself."
2. "But he that believeth not God hath made him a liar: because he hath not believed the witness that God hath borne concerning His Son."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "John draws a distinction between 'not believing God' in the next clause, the testimony of God about his Son, and surrender to and reliance on the Son as here."
2. "In him... though the evidence is not decisive between 'in himself' and 'in him.'"
3. "Because he hath not believed... the subjective negative is regular with 'he that believeth not.'"

### John Gill:
1. "He that with the heart believes in [Christ] for righteousness, and eternal life, he being the Son of God, truly and properly God, and so able to save all that believe in him, hath the witness in himself."
2. "[The believer] comes to have such a witness in himself, that if ten thousand arguments were ever so artfully formed [...] they would all signify nothing to him, he would be proof against them."
3. "And such an one very readily receives into him the testimony God gives of his Son, of the glory and excellency of his person, and retains it in him."

### John Wesley:
1. "He that believeth on the Son of God hath the testimony...the dear evidence of this, in himself."
2. "He that believeth not God, in this, hath made him a liar."
