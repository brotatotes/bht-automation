# 1 John 5:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God graciously and freely gives us the gift of eternal life. This gift is not only a promise, but a reality that begins in the present. It is for all those who have put their faith in the Son. Through the Son, we have access to everlasting life, as he has acquired and secured it for us. This life, which Christ requested of the Father and now possesses, is the source from which believers receive spiritual blessings both in this life and in the life to come.
