# 1 John 5:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He that has the Son possesses eternal life and the knowledge of God, which is the essence of this life. On the contrary, those who do not have the Son lack this life and are spiritually dead, separated from God. The Son of God is the ultimate blessing that unbelievers miss out on.
