# 1 John 5:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When we approach God in prayer, we can have confidence and boldness, knowing that our prayers will be answered based on our faith in Jesus. However, it is essential to align our prayers with God's will and not expect Him to grant anything contrary to His plan. The Holy Spirit guides us in praying according to God's will, and our requests should be in line with what is best for us and brings glory to God. We can trust that even if God doesn't grant our exact requests, He hears us and responds in wisdom and love.
