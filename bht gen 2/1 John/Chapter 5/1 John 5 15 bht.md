# 1 John 5:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Even before we see the fulfillment of our prayers, we can have confidence that God has heard us. Our faith allows us to anticipate the blessings that we have asked for, knowing that God will answer our prayers in his own time and way. When the answers to our prayers come, we can recognize them as a direct response to our petitions.
