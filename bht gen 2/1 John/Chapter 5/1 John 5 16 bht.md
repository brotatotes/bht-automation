# 1 John 5:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers have a responsibility to pray for fellow believers who have sinned, seeking their restoration and salvation. However, there is a distinction between sins that can be forgiven and sins that lead to spiritual death and sever the fellowship with Christ. While we are called to intercede for those who have fallen into non-fatal sins, we are not encouraged to pray for sins that result in death. It is essential to recognize the seriousness of certain sins and leave them in the hands of God's divine judgment.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The asker shall be the means, by his intercessory prayer, of God giving life to the sinning brother."
2. "Kindly reproof ought to accompany his intercessions. Life was in process of being forfeited by the sinning brother when the believer's intercession obtained its restoration."
3. "To 'request' for a sin unto death [intercede, as it were, authoritatively for it, as though we were more merciful than God] would savor of presumption."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is our duty to pray for those who sin, and to seek the salvation of those whom we see to be going astray, and to be in danger of ruin, wherever they are, or whoever they may be."
2. "There were instances in the times of the prophets in which the sin of the people became so universal and so aggravated, that they were forbidden to pray for them."
3. "Let us remember the cases of Manasseh, of Saul of Tarsus, of Augustine, of Bunyan, of Newton, of tens of thousands who have been reclaimed from the vilest forms of iniquity, and then let us never despair of the conversion of any, in answer to prayer, who may have gone astray."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The sin unto death does not refer to a specific act, but to a class or species of sins, the tendency of which is to cut the bond of fellowship with Christ."
2. "Whatever breaks the fellowship between the soul and Christ, and, by consequence, between the individual and the body of believers, is unto death, for there is no life apart from Christ."
3. "Note the sharp distinctness with which that terrible sin is thrown out by the pronoun of remote reference and its emphatic position in the sentence."

### John Calvin:
1. "The prayers of the faithful so far avail as to rescue a brother from death."
2. "God does not so grievously punish their falls as to repudiate them. It hence follows that we ought to deem them brethren, since God retains them in the number of his children."
3. "He denies that sins are mortal, which, though worthy of death, are yet not thus punished by God. He therefore does not estimate sins in themselves, but forms a judgment of them according to the paternal kindness of God, which pardons the guilt, where yet the fault is."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Most sins are not mortal sins, but clearly John conceives of a sin that is deadly enough to be called 'unto death.'" 
2. "Jesus spoke of the unpardonable sin, which was attributing to the devil the manifest work of the Holy Spirit. It is possible that John has this idea in mind when he applies it to those who reject Jesus Christ as God's Son and set themselves up as antichrists." 
3. "John does not forbid praying for such cases; he simply does not command prayer for them. He leaves them to God."

### John Gill:
1. "Those who have such an interest at the throne of grace, and such boldness and freedom there, should make use of it for others, as well as themselves, and particularly for fallen believers."
2. "Every sin, even the least sin, is in its own nature mortal, or deserving of death; the proper wages of sin is death, yea, death eternal; yet none of the sins of God's elect are unto death, or issue in death, in fact."
3. "It is a sinning wilfully, not in a practical, but doctrinal way, after a man has received the knowledge of the truth; it is a wilful denial of the truth of the Gospel, particularly that peace, pardon, righteousness, eternal life, and salvation, are by Jesus Christ, contrary to the light of his mind, and this joined with malice and obstinacy."

### John Wesley:
1. "If any one see his brother... sin a sin which is not unto death... Let him ask, and God will give him life." 
2. "There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for that." 
3. "A sin unto death may likewise mean, one which God has determined to punish with death."
