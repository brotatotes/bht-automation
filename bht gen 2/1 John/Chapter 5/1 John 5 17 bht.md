# 1 John 5:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Sin encompasses all forms of unrighteousness, whether committed by believers or unbelievers. Not all sins, however, lead to eternal death. The sin unto death remains ambiguous, requiring further exploration of the Gospel writer's teachings on life and death. Despite the seriousness of sin and its deserving of punishment, the denial of Jesus as the Christ, the incarnation of God's Son, carries a distinct weight of severance from the very source of life. This sin bears the stamp of spiritual separation and holds eternal consequences.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "SIN is a large word, comprehending all unrighteousness whatever: whether of God‚Äôs children, or of aliens from Him."
2. "This sin unto death being thus a sin leading to eternal death, being no further explained to the readers here, must be presumed as meant to be understood by what the Evangelist has elsewhere laid down concerning the possession of life and death."
3. "The denial that Jesus is the Christ the incarnate Son of God. This alone of all sins bears upon it the stamp of severance from Him who is the Life itself."

2. "We are not to suppose that all sin of that kind is of such a character that it cannot possibly be forgiven."

1. "All unrighteousness against God or man is a sin against the law of God, and the wrath of God is revealed against it, and it is deserving of death."
2. "Yet all unrighteousness is not unto death, as the sins of David, which were unrighteousness both to God and man, and yet they were put away, and he died not; Peter sinned very foully, and did great injustice to his dear Lord, and yet his sin was not unto death."
3. "This is added for the relief of weak believers, who hearing of a sin unto death, not to be prayed for, might fear that theirs were of that kind, whereas none of them are; for though they are guilty of many unrighteousnesses, yet God is merciful to them and forgives, Hebrews 8:12, and so they are not unto death."

### John Wesley:
1. All deviation from perfect holiness is sin; but all sin is not unpardonable.
