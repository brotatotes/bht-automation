# 1 John 5:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We know that whoever is born of God does not habitually sin, for as long as their faith in God remains, they do not speak or act in ways that are disobedient to God's will. They are able to keep themselves by vigilantly watching and praying, protecting themselves from the influence of evil. By doing so, they are shielded from the harm that the wicked one may try to inflict upon them.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not - Is not habitually and characteristically a sinner; does not ultimately and finally sin and perish; cannot, therefore, commit the unpardonable sin."
2. "This passage, in its connection, is a full proof that a true Christian 'will' never commit the unpardonable sin, and, therefore, is a proof that he will never fall from grace."
3. "And that wicked one toucheth him not - The great enemy of all good is repelled in his assaults, and he is kept from falling into his snares."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "We know [οιδαμεν] . John uses this appeal to knowledge in two forms : we know (2 Timothy 2:14; 1 John 5:18, 1 John 5:19, 1 John 5:20); ye know (ii. 20; 1 John 3:5, 1 John 3:15)."
2. "The later is preferable. That wicked one [ο πονηρος] . See on 2 13. Rev., the evil one."
3. "Both this verb and qigganw (Colossians 2:21; Hebrews 11:28; Hebrews 12:20) express a touch which exerts a modifying influence upon the object, though qigganw indicates rather a superficial touch."

### John Calvin:
1. "Then he says that those sin not who do not wholly fall away from the grace of God; and hence he inferred that prayer ought to be made for all the children of God, because they sin not unto death."
2. "For when he says, that he is not touched by that wicked one, reference is made to a deadly wound; for the children of God do not remain untouched by the assaults of Satan, but they ward off his strokes by the shield of faith, so that they do not penetrate into the heart."
3. "And we know that we fight with no other weapons but those of God. Hence the faithful keep themselves from sin, as far as they are kept by God."

2. "Lineal present active indicative, 'does not keep on sinning,' as he has already shown in 1 John 3:4-10."
3. "It is Christ who keeps the one begotten of God...It is a difficult phrase, but this is probably the idea."

### John Gill:
1. "We know that whosoever is born of God... sinneth not; the sin unto death; nor does he live in sin, or is under the power and dominion of it..."
2. "...the sense is, that a believer defends himself by taking to him the whole armour of God, and especially the shield of faith, against the corruptions of his own heart, the snares of the world, and particularly the temptations of Satan..."
3. "...sometimes the believer is so enabled to wield the shield of faith, or to hold up Christ the shield by faith, and turn it every way in such a manner, that Satan... cannot come near him, nor in with him; cannot work upon him at all with his temptations, nor in the least hurt his peace, joy, and comfort..."

2. "He keepeth himself — Watching unto prayer."
3. "And, while he does this, the wicked one toucheth him not - So as to hurt him."
