# 1 John 5:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We know that we are children of God, as the witness and fruit of His Spirit confirm our identity. However, the whole world, which lacks His Spirit, is not only influenced by the wicked one but also engulfed in idolatry, fraud, violence, and various forms of wickedness. This vividly illustrates the deplorable state of the world, reflected in the actions, conversations, contracts, quarrels, and friendships of those who are engulfed in worldly pursuits.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We know (see summary above) that we (not emphatic: no ἡμεῖς as set over against ὁ κόσμος...to reassert solemnly these great axioms of the Christian life) are of God..."
2. "...the whole world lieth in the wicked one (this second member of the sentence does not depend on the preceding ὅτι, but like those of 1 John 5:18 ; 1 John 5:20, is an independent proposition. τῷ πονηρῷ, by the analogy of St. John’s diction, is masculine, not neuter...the κόσμος, all the rest of mankind, κεῖται ἐν τ . π., remains where it was, in, and in the power of, ὁ πονηρός."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The world lieth in the wicked one,"
2. "The world lieth in the power of, and abiding in, the wicked one, as the resting-place and lord of his slaves"
3. "While the believer has been delivered out of his power, the whole world lieth helpless and motionless still in it"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The apostle supposed that true Christians might have so clear evidence on that subject as to leave no doubt on their own minds that they were the children of God."
2. "The whole world...means not the material world, but the people who dwell on the earth, including all idolaters, and all sinners of every grade and kind."
3. "The world lies under the control of the wicked one, than to say that it lies 'in wickedness.'"


### Marvin Vincent:
1. "John expresses the relation of believers to God by the following phrases: To be born or begotten of God, denoting the initial communication of the new life."
2. "To be of God, denoting the essential connection in virtue of the new life."
3. "Child of God, denoting the relation established by the new life."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is only true faith, that applies to us, so to speak, the grace of God."
2. "It would then be difficult for them to hold on in their course, were they not so to value their calling as to disregard all the hindrances of the world."
3. "The faithful ought to study self-denial; and since nothing is seen in the world but wickedness and corruption, they must necessarily disregard flesh and blood that they may follow God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Of God (εκ του θεου). See 1 John 3:10; 1 John 4:6 for this idiom."
2. "Lieth in the evil one (εν τω πονηρω κειτα). Present middle indicative of the defective verb κειμα, to lie, as in Luke 2:12. Πονηρω is masculine, like ο πονηρος in verse 1 John 5:18."
3. "This is a terrible picture of the Graeco-Roman world of the first century A.D., which is confirmed by Paul in Romans 1 and 2 and by Horace, Seneca, Juvenal, Tacitus."

1. "The sons of God, and regenerated by him; this is known by the Spirit of God, which witnesses to the spirits of the saints that they are the children of God."
2. "The whole world lies in wickedness;...they are addicted to sin and wickedness...they are under his influence, and led according to his will, and they are governed by him, and are at his beck and command; and this is known, by sad experience, it is easy of observation."
3. "And cannot comprehend the things that are promised to the righteous in time to come: for this world is full of unrighteousness and infirmities."

### John Wesley:
1. "We know that we are children of God — By the witness and the fruit of his Spirit..." 
2. "But the whole world — All who have not his Spirit, not only is 'touched' by him, but by idolatry, fraud, violence lasciviousness, impiety, all manner of wickedness." 
3. "Lieth in the wicked one — Void of life, void of sense. In this short expression the horrible state of the world is painted in the most lively colours; a comment on which we have in the actions, conversations, contracts, quarrels, and friendships of worldly men."
