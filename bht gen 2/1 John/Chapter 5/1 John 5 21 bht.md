# 1 John 5:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of a world filled with idolatry and false worship, it is crucial for us as believers to remain vigilant and guard ourselves against any form of idolatry. This not only includes avoiding the worship of false gods and images, but also extends to abstaining from false doctrines and excessive love for anything or anyone other than God. Our ultimate allegiance and devotion should be directed solely towards the true God, finding our help, defense, and happiness in Him alone.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Keep yourselves from idols...the plain literal sense in this place. All around the Christian Church was heathenism: the born of God and the κείμενοι ἐν τῷ πονηρῷ were the only two classes: those who went out of one, went into the other: God's children are thus then finally warned of the consequence of letting go the only true God."
2. "God's children...can only abide by abiding in His Son Jesus Christ, in these solemn terms, to leave on their minds a wholesome terror of any the least deviation from the truth of God, seeing into what relapse it would plunge them."
3. "This is a more satisfactory view than that taken by Düsterdieck, that having so long and so much warned them against error in Christian doctrine, he could not part without also warning them against that of which they were indeed in less danger, relapse into heathenism."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Christians were then everywhere surrounded by idolaters, with whom it was impossible to avoid intercourse. Hence the need of being on their guard against any even indirect compromise or act of communion with idolatry."
2. "Some at Pergamos, in the region whence John wrote, fell into the snare of eating things sacrificed to idols."
3. "The moment we cease to abide 'in Him that is true (by abiding) in Jesus Christ,' we become part of 'the world that lieth in the wicked one,' given up to spiritual, if not in all places literal, idolatry."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "His great object had been to lead them to the knowledge and love of God, and all his counsels would be practically followed, if, amidst the temptations of idolatry, and the allurements of sin, nothing were allowed to estrange their hearts from him."
2. "The same caution is as needful for us as it was for those to whom John wrote. We may be in no less danger than they to whom John wrote were, of substituting other things in our affections in the place of the true God, and of devoting to them the time and the affection which are due to him."
3. "God should have the supreme place in our affections. The love of everything else should be held in strict subordination to the love of him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Keep yourselves - The exact phrase is not found elsewhere in the New Testament." 
2. "Guard - Rev., rightly, guard."
3. "The command, however, has apparently the wider Pauline sense, to guard against everything which occupies the place due to God."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Apostle not only condemns idolatry, but commands us to beware of all images and idols; by which he intimates, that the worship of God cannot continue uncorrupted and pure whenever men begin to be in love with idols or images."
2. "...the least occasion will infect us with its contagion. Dry wood will not so easily burn when coals are put under it, as idolatry will lay hold on and engross the minds of men, when an occasion is given to them."
3. "Let us then remember that we ought carefully to continue in the spiritual worship of God, so as to banish far from us everything that may turn us aside to gross and carnal superstitions."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The active voice φυλασσετε with the reflexive accents the need of effort on their part."
2. "Idolatry was everywhere and the peril was great."
3. "See Acts 7:41 for this word."

### John Gill:
1. "From Heathen idols and idolatry, into which the saints in those times might be liable to be drawn..."
2. "Moreover, errors and false doctrines... may be called idols, and should be guarded against, and abstained from..."
3. "…even every creature that is loved too much is an idol; hence covetousness is called idolatry..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Keep yourselves from idols — From all worship of false gods, from all worship of images or of any creature."
2. "Seek all help and defence from evil, all happiness in the true God alone."
3. "From loving, desiring, fearing anything more than God."
