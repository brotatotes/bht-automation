# 1 John 5:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The love of God is truly demonstrated by our obedience to His commandments. It is through our actions, not mere words or professions, that we show our love for Him. And it is a comforting truth that God's commandments are not burdensome, rather they are a joy and a delight to those who are born of Him.

3. "and his commandments are not grievous; heavy, burdensome, and disagreeable; by which are meant, not so much the precepts of the moral law, which through the weakness of the flesh are hard to be kept, and cannot be perfectly fulfilled; though believers indeed, being freed from the rigorous exaction, curse, and condemnation of the law, delight in it after the inward man, and serve it cheerfully with their spirit."
