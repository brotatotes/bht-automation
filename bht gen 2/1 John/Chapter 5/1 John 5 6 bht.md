# 1 John 5:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The testimony that Jesus is the Son of God is reinforced by the unshakeable witness of God himself. This witness encompasses the water of Jesus' baptism and the blood shed on the cross. The blood and water flowing from his side when he was pierced serve as a tangible affirmation. Additionally, the Spirit testifies to Jesus as the Son of God through the inspired writings of the Old Testament, the ministry of John the Baptist, the teachings of the apostles, and the revelations of the New Testament. Collectively, these testimonies provide irrefutable proof of Jesus' divine identity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The main objection to Hutherâ€™s view is, that, as well stated by DÃ¼sterd., it makes the coming by water and blood, which, by the context, is evidently in the Apostleâ€™s argument a substantiating consideration, to be merely an exceptional one."
2. "The blood of His Cross must, by all Scripture analogy, be that intended."
3. "The Holy Spirit is He, who testifies of Christ, who glorifies Him, and shows of the things which belong to Him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This Jesus, he that came by water and blood, by water, when His ministry was inaugurated by baptism in the Jordan, and He received the Father's testimony to His Messiahship and divine Sonship."
2. "'The Spirit . . . remaining on Him . . . I saw and bare record that this is the Son of God'; and 'there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood.'"
3. "We are baptized into His death: the grand point of union between us and Him, and, through Him, between us and God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He refers to three well-known things on which he probably had insisted much in his preaching - the water, and the blood, and the Spirit."
2. "By water - There have been many opinions in regard to the meaning of this phrase...A sufficient objection to this view is, that as in the corresponding word 'blood' there is undoubted reference to blood literally, it cannot be supposed that the word 'water' in the same connection would be used figuratively."
3. "That furnished an important attestation to the fact that he was the Messiah...water at his introduction to his work, as an ordinance in his church, as symbolical of the nature of his religion."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Water refers to Christ's baptism at the beginning of His Messianic work, through which He declared His purpose to fulfill all righteousness."
2. "Blood refers to His bloody death upon the cross for the sin of the world."
3. "These [water and blood] must point both to some purely historical facts in the life of our Lord on earth, and to some still present witnesses for Christ. They must not be interpreted symbolically, but understood of something so real and powerful, as that by them God's testimony is given to believers, and eternal life assured to them."

### John Calvin:
1. "That our faith may rest safely on Christ, he says the real substance of the shadows of the law appears in him."
2. "The comparison...is intended...not only that we may know that the Law of Moses was abolished by the coming of Christ, but that we may seek in him the fulfillment of those things which the ceremonies formerly typified."
3. "He shews in this clause how the faithful know and feel the power of Christ, even because the Spirit renders them certain; and that their faith might not vacillate, he adds, that a full and real firmness or stability is produced by the testimony of the Spirit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The witness borne to this Son of God as the perfected Christ or Saviour is now adduced; and the two great events are made prominent which rounded the Messianic history: the Baptism with its testimony to the Son of God, and the atoning death with its testimony." (32 words)
2. "No intelligent reader could fail to think of what the writer had certainly had in his thoughts, the mysterious and miraculous effusion of blood and water when the Saviourâ€™s side was pierced." (26 words)
3. "'And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is the truth.' The Supreme Witness of Jesus is the Holy Ghost, to whom the Saviour Himself bore witness as â€˜the Spirit of the truth.'" (34 words)

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He that came...referring to the Incarnation as a definite historic event, the preexistent Son of God 'sent from heaven to do God's will.'"
2. "Accompanied by water (as at the baptism) and blood (as on the Cross). These two incidents in the Incarnation are singled out because at the baptism Jesus was formally set apart to his Messianic work...and because at the Cross his work reached its culmination."
3. "It is true that at the Cross both water and blood came out of the side of Jesus when pierced by the soldier...a complete refutation of the Docetic denial of an actual human body for Jesus and of the Cerinthian distinction between Jesus and Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'water' is not meant the ablutions or washings of the ceremonial law; Christ came not by these, but to make an end of them; his blood, which cleanseth from all sin, being the antitype, and so the fulfilling end of them."
2. "But the sense is, that as at baptism, so at his sufferings and death, he was made manifest to be the Son of God; as he was to the centurion and others, that were with him, when they observed the earthquake, and the things that were done; and at his from the dead he was declared to be the Son of God with power."
3. "There may be here an allusion to the water and blood which came out of his side, when pierced on the cross, which this Apostle John was an eyewitness of."

### John Wesley:
1. "This is he...the firm, indubitable testimony of God." 
2. "Not by the water only...in token whereof, when all was finished, blood and water came out of his side."
3. "And it is the Spirit who likewise testifieth - Of Jesus Christ, namely, by Moses and all the prophets, by John the Baptist, by all the apostles, and in all the writings of the New Testament."
