# 1 John 5:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The testimony of the Spirit, water, and blood is continuous and harmonious. The Spirit testifies through miracles and the word, while the water and blood testify to the purification and cleansing obtained through Christ's atoning blood. Together, these witnesses affirm the truth that Jesus Christ is the divine and sole Savior of the world.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Spirit is, of the three, the only living and active witness, properly speaking: besides, the water and the blood are no witnesses without Him; whereas He is independent of them, testifying both in them and out of them."
2. "And this their one testimony is given by the purification in the water of baptism into His name, John 3:5; by the continual cleansing from all sin which we enjoy in and by His atoning blood; by the inward witness of His Spirit, which He hath given us."
3. "For there is not the remotest analogy between the terms in the one case and those in the other; the very order of them, differing as it does in the two cases, shows this. Is this triplicity a fact worthy of such a comparison?"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Two or three witnesses were required by law to constitute adequate testimony."
2. "The triad specified pointing to a still Higher Trinity."
3. "It is on earth that the context evidently requires the witness of the three, the Spirit, the water, and the blood, to be borne: mystically setting forth the divine triune witnesses, the Father, the Spirit, and the Son."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The supposed importance of the verse in its bearing on the doctrine of the Trinity has contributed to this, and has given to the discussion a degree of consequence which has pertained to the examination of the genuineness of no other passage of the New Testament."
2. "The reasons which seem to me to prove that the passage included in brackets is spurious, and should not be regarded as a part of the inspired writings, are briefly the following..."
3. "The removal of this text does nothing to weaken the evidence for the doctrine of the Trinity, or to modify that doctrine. As it was never used to shape the early belief of the Christian world on the subject, so its rejection, and its removal from the New Testament, will do nothing to modify that doctrine."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "These words are rejected by the general verdict of critical authorities."
2. "To rebut much of Porson's insolent sophistry was easy."
3. "If, in spite of all these objections, it be still genuine, no part of Scripture whatsoever can be proved either spurious or genuine."

### John Calvin:
1. "God, in order to confirm most abundantly our faith in Christ, testifies in three ways that we ought to acquiesce in him."
2. "For as our faith acknowledges three persons in the one divine essence, so it is called in so really ways to Christ that it may rest on him."
3. "But as the Spirit, who is one witness, is mentioned twice, it seems to be an unnecessary repetition. To this I reply, that since he testifies of Christ in various ways, a twofold testimony is fitly ascribed to him."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The fact and the doctrine of the Trinity do not depend on this spurious addition."
2. "Erasmus did not have it in his first edition, but rashly offered to insert it if a single Greek MS. had it."
3. "Some Latin scribe caught up Cyprian's exegesis and wrote it on the margin of his text, and so it got into the Vulgate and finally into the Textus Receptus by the stupidity of Erasmus."

### John Gill:
1. "The heavenly witnesses of Christ's sonship are, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost." 
2. "This passage holds forth and asserts the unity of God, a trinity of persons in the Godhead, the proper deity of each person, and their distinct personality."
3. "The three first Sephirot, or numbers, in the Cabalistic tree, intend the three divine Persons."

### John Wesley:
1. "There are three that testify â€” Literally, testifying, or bearing witness. The participle is put for the noun witnesses, to intimate that the act of testifying, and the effect of it, are continually present."
2. "The Spirit â€” In the word, confirmed by miracles."
3. "And these three harmoniously agree in one - In bearing the same testimony,-that Jesus Christ is the divine, the complete, the only Saviour of the world."
