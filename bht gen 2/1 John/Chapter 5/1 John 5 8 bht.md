# 1 John 5:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The testimony of the Spirit, the water, and the blood is united in confirming the truth of Jesus' divine sonship and messiahship. The Spirit convincingly reveals the glory of Christ to believers, while water baptism serves as a visible symbol of the purity of His religion. Furthermore, the shed blood of Christ on the cross and represented in the Lord's Supper testifies to His identity as the Son of God. These three witnesses join together to verify the Gospel's message that Jesus is the Christ, ultimately fulfilling the purpose for which John wrote his Gospel.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Their agreeing testimony to Jesus' Sonship and Messiahship they give by the sacramental grace in the water of baptism, received by the penitent believer, by the atoning efficacy of His blood, and by the internal witness of His Spirit." 
2. "By the baptism then received by Christ, and by His redeeming blood-shedding, and by that which the Spirit of God, whose witness is infallible, has effected, and still effects, by Him, the Spirit, the water, and the blood, unite, as the threefold witness, to verify His divine Messiahship."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Spirit of God has thus always borne witness to the fact that Jesus is the Christ, and he will continue to do it to the end of time, convincing yet countless millions that he was sent from God to redeem and save lost people."
2. "Perhaps it may be implied here, also, that water used in baptism now bears witness to the same thing, as it is the ordinance appointed by the Saviour, keeps up his religion in the world, and is a public symbol of the purity of his religion."
3. "That blood on the cross, or by the representation of its shedding in the Lord’s Supper, is a witness in the world to the truth that Jesus is the Son of God, and to the nature of his religion."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Agree in one [εις το εν εισιν] . Lit., are for the one. They converge upon the one truth, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, come in the flesh.

### John Calvin:
1. "He adds a third witness, the Holy Spirit, who yet holds the first place, for without him the water and blood would have flowed without any benefit."
2. "For whatever signs of divine glory may shine forth in Christ, they would yet be obscure to us and escape our vision, were not the Holy Spirit to open for us the eyes of faith."
3. "From these words we may learn, that faith does not lay hold on a bare or an empty Christ, but that his power is at the same time vivifying."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Spirit and the water and the blood... The same three witnesses..." 
2. "Agree in one... 'Are for the one thing,' to bring us to faith in Jesus as the Incarnate Son of God..."
3. "...the very purpose for which John wrote his Gospel."

### John Gill:
1. "By the 'Spirit' is not meant the human Spirit or soul of Christ; for however that may be a witness of the truth of his human nature, yet not of his divine sonship." 
2. "By water is designed, not internal sanctification, which though an evidence of regeneration and adoption, yet not of Christ's sonship; but water baptism, as administered on earth in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; and which is a noble and standing testimony to the proper, natural, and eternal sonship of Christ."
3. "The three witnesses on earth seem therefore to be the Gospel, attended with the Spirit and power of God, and the two ordinances of baptism, and the Lord's supper. And these agree in one; in their testimony of Christ, the word and ordinances agree together; and the sum and substance of them is Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "The testimony of the Spirit, the water, and the blood, is by an eminent gradation corroborated by three, who give a still greater testimony."
2. "Nothing can separate the Spirit from the Father and the Son. If he were not one with the Father and the Son, the apostle ought to have said, The Father and the Word, who are one, and the Spirit, are two."
3. "The seventh verse, therefore, with the sixth, 1 John 5:7,6 contains a recapitulation of the whole economy of Christ, from his baptism to pentecost; the eighth, 1 John 5:8 the sum of the divine economy, from the time of his exaltation."
