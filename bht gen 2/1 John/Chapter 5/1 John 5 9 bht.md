# 1 John 5:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If we are willing to accept the testimony of human beings in various matters, how much more should we believe in the testimony of God? God's testimony is of higher authority and infinitely more reliable than any human testimony. In this case, we are specifically referring to the testimony of God the Father, the Word, and the Spirit, declaring Jesus as the Savior of the world. This divine testimony is the foundation of our faith and should be wholeheartedly received and embraced.
