# 1 Peter 1:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The writer of this epistle, Peter, addresses the Christians as sojourners because they are believers who are living in a foreign country, not their own land. They are described as scattered because they were driven out of their homeland long ago. These believers, many of whom are of Jewish descent, are believed to have laid the foundation of the Gospel church in this particular region. Although some were initially scattered only within Judea and Samaria, later they spread to other places such as Phenice, Cyprus, and Antioch.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Peter (the Greek form of the name Cephas, a stone, given him by our Lord) an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the elect strangers of the dispersion."
2. "Belonging to the Jewish dispersion, as in reff. This leading character of the readers of 1 Peter has been acknowledged generally."
3. "There is no reason to exclude Gentile Christians from among them, as forming part of the Israel of God. Indeed, such readers are presupposed in the Epistle itself."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He who preaches otherwise than as a messenger of Christ, is not to be heard; if he preach as such, then it is all one as if thou didst hear Christ speaking in thy presence."
2. "Christians, if they rightly consider their calling, must never settle themselves here, but feel themselves travellers."
3. "The election here is that of individuals to eternal life by the sovereign grace of God, as the sequel shows."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He here addresses them as elect; in the following verse he shows them in what way they were elected."
2. "There has been much diversity of opinion as to the persons here referred to... it seems probable that he means here Christians as such, without reference to their origin, who were scattered through the various provinces of Asia Minor."
3. "It is not necessarily implied that these persons were strangers to Peter, or that he had never seen them; though this was not improbably the fact in regard to most of them."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Peter [πετρος] . See on Matthew 16:18. As Paul in his letters does not call himself by his original name of Saul, so Peter calls himself, not Simon, but Peter, the name most significant and precious both to himself and to his readers, because bestowed by his Lord." 
2. "An apostle. Of all the catholic epistles, Peter's alone puts forward his apostleship in the introduction. He is addressing churches with which he had no immediate connection, and which were distinctively Pauline. Hence he appeals to his apostleship in explanation of his writing to them, and as his warrant for taking Paul 's place."
3. "Sojourners [παρεπιδημοις] . Persons sojourning for a brief season in a foreign country. Though applied primarily to Hebrews scattered throughout the world (Genesis 23:4; Psalms 39:12), it has here a wider, spiritual sense, contemplating Christians as having their citizenship in heaven."

### John Calvin:
1. "For Paul did not wish to the faithful the beginning of grace and peace, but the increase of them, that is, that God would complete what he had begun." 
2. "He deems them to be the elect of God, for God does not sanctify any but those whom he has previously elected."
3. "Our salvation flows from the gratuitous election of God; but that it is to be ascertained by the experience of faith, because he sanctifies us by his Spirit; and then that there are two effects or ends of our calling, even renewal into obedience and ablution by the blood of Christ; and further, that both are the work of the Holy Spirit."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Peter uses this name, not Cephas or Simon, because he is writing to Christians scattered over Asia Minor."
2. "The Christian is a pilgrim on his way to the homeland."
3. "The N.T. by no means gives a full account of the spread of the Gospel."

### John Gill:
1. "The writer of this epistle describes himself first by his name, Peter, the same with Cephas, which signifies a rock, or stone; a name given him by Christ at his first conversion, and which respected his after firmness, solidity, resolution, and constancy."
2. "The persons he writes to are the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia... on account of their not being in their own land, and in a foreign country, and therefore said to be 'scattered', or 'the strangers of the dispersion'."
3. "Perhaps these Jews converted on the day of Pentecost, on their return hither, laid the first foundation of a Gospel church state in this country."

### John Wesley:
1. "To the sojourners — Upon earth, the Christians, chiefly those of Jewish extraction."
2. "Scattered — Long ago driven out of their own land."
3. "Those scattered by the persecution mentioned Acts 8:1, were scattered only through Judea and Samaria, though afterwards some of them travelled to Phenice, Cyprus, and Antioch."
