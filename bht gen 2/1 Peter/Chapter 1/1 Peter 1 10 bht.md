# 1 Peter 1:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The salvation mentioned here is of great value, as even the prophets diligently searched for it. They longed to see the fulfillment of the prophecies they themselves spoke of regarding the grace that God would show to believers under the Christian dispensation. These prophets, driven by curiosity and a desire to understand, eagerly sought after the true meaning behind their own prophecies. The salvation they sought after was far beyond what they had experienced under the Jewish dispensation.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The salvation here in view is the salvation already introduced first as ‘ready to be revealed in the last time,’ and then as a ‘salvation of souls.’ It is not to be limited either to the completed salvation of the future, or to the partial salvation of the present, but is God’s salvation generally."
