# 1 Peter 1:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The prophets, though not knowing the exact time of fulfillment, received revelations for our sake. The angels, with their longing to understand the mysteries of the salvation revealed to us, enhance the excellence of this salvation. Prophets and apostles alike minister to us through their prophecies and announcements. They eagerly awaited the fulfillment of what they foretold, and now we can enjoy the full benefit of these prophecies. Angels, too, desire to have a greater knowledge and understanding of the Gospel truths, which only serves to commend their excellency and prompts us to study them diligently.
