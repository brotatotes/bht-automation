### Albert Barnes:
1. "The allusion here is to the manner in which the Orientals were accustomed to dress. They wear loose, flowing robes, so that, when they wish to run, or to fight, or to apply themselves to any business, they are obliged to bind their garments close around them."
2. "The meaning here is, that they were to have their minds in constant preparation to discharge the duties, or to endure the trials of life - like those who were prepared for labor, for a race, or for a conflict."
3. "They were not to abandon the hopes of the gospel, but were to cherish those hopes to the end of life, whatever opposition they might meet with, and however much might be done by others to induce them to apostatize."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "He intimates that our minds are held entangled by the passing cares of the world and by vain desires, so that they rise not upward to God."
3. "The object of Peter was to call us away beyond the world; for this purpose the fittest thing was the recollection of Christ’s coming. For when we direct our eyes to this event, this world becomes crucified to us, and we to the world."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "God, then, by so marvellous a provision of His mercy, having begotten you unto a living hope, see that you make that hope your own, and live wholly up to it."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Because of which thing," the glorious free grace opened for Gentiles and Jews in Christ (verses 1 Peter 1:3-12).
2. Girding up (αναζωσαμενο). First aorist middle participle of αναζωννυμ, late and rare verb...vivid metaphor for habit of the Orientals, who quickly gathered up their loose robes with a girdle when in a hurry or starting on a journey.
3. Perfectly (τελειως). Adverb, old word (here alone in N.T.)...connected with ελπισατε (set your hope, first aorist active imperative of ελπιζω) in the Revised Version, but Bigg, Hort, and most modern commentators take it according to Peter's usual custom with the preceding verb, νηφοντες ("being perfectly sober," not "hope perfectly").

### John Gill:
1. "With the girdle of truth; see Ephesians 6:14 since angels desire to look into the mysteries of grace, do you apply your minds, and diligently attend unto them..."
2. "Though the phrase is sometimes used to denote preparation and readiness, and to be in a fit position to do anything..."
3. "and is a metaphor taken from the custom of the eastern nations, who used to wear long garments, which they gathered up close to them, and girt about them, when they were about any of the above things, that they might be no hinderance to them, and that they might perform them with more expedition and dispatch..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Gird up the loins of your mind - gather ye up all your thoughts and affections, and keep your mind always disencumbered and prepared to run the race which is set before you."
2. "Be watchful - as servants that wait for their Lord."
