2. "The sum of the whole law, and of all that God requires of us, is this, that his image should shine forth in us, so that we should not be degenerate children."

### John Gill:
1. "Since they were children of God, by adopting grace, and in regeneration brought to the obedience of faith, to whom the inheritance belonged, therefore they ought to continue hoping for it."
2. "To be conformed, or fashioned to the world, is to be fashioned to the lusts of it; and to be fashioned to the lusts of it is to indulge them, to make provision for them, to obey them, to live and walk in them; which should not be done by the children of God."
3. "They were made light in the Lord, and had knowledge of all these things; and therefore, as their light increased, and the grace of God, bringing salvation, appeared unto them, and shone out on then, it became them to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and not to walk as they had done before, since they had not so learned Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. Your desires — Which ye had while ye were ignorant of God.
