# 1 Peter 1:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God, our Father, called us not only externally but internally by His Spirit and grace. We should strive to imitate God, even though we can never fully equal Him. The arguments for imitating Him are strong, considering His nature and His calling to holiness. We are called to walk worthy of Him, following Him as obedient children, according to His will and what He directs and requires.
