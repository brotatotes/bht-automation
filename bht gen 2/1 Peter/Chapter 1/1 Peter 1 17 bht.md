## BHT:
If you acknowledge God as your Father, it is crucial to be mindful of how you speak and behave, for you do not want to bring dishonor to the name by which you are called. The Judge will not base his judgment on superficial appearances, but rather on the motives and intentions of your heart. As you journey through this temporary existence on earth, do so with a humble and loving fear, which is the perfect companion and guardian of hope.
