# 1 Peter 1:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The high price paid for our redemption is a constant reminder of the value and significance of our consecration to God. The blood of Christ, offered as a sacrifice, serves as a ransom that rescues and redeems us from sin and death. The preciousness of this price far surpasses any earthly riches, reminding us of our obligation to live a holy and devoted life. Let us not be influenced by the customs or traditions handed down to us by previous generations, but rather seek to align ourselves with the holiness and justice of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This argument enhances the duty of godly fear by the consideration of the inestimable price at which they were redeemed." 
2. "The diminutive forms stand generally for the coined or wrought metal: and such a sense would be applicable here." 
3. "This again makes it probable that the persons here more especially addressed are Gentile Christians."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The blood of Christ is not in Scripture said to buy heaven for us: heaven is the 'inheritance' given to us as sons, by the promise of God."
2. "The Lamb who redeems the spiritual Israelites does so 'without money or price.'"
3. "Holiness is the natural fruit of redemption 'from our vain conversation'; for He by whom we are redeemed is also He for whom we are redeemed."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There is no more effectual way to induce true Christians to consecrate themselves entirely to God, than to refer them to the fact that they are not their own, but have been purchased by the blood of Christ."
2. "The word here means that they were rescued from sin and death by the blood of Christ, as the valuable consideration on account of which it was done; that is, the blood, or the life of Christ offered as a sacrifice, effected the same purpose in regard to justice and to the maintenance of the principles of moral government, which the punishment of the sinner himself would have done."
3. "The idea here is, that a price far more valuable than any amount of silver or gold had been paid for the redemption of the people of God, and that they were under proportionate obligation to devote themselves to his service."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Ye were redeemed... It carries the idea of a ransom - price... With silver or gold money."
2. "Conversation...Rev., manner of life."
3. "Received by tradition from your fathers... improved by Rev., handed down from your fathers."

### John Calvin:
1. "But we know how dreadfully sacrilegious it is to regard as common the blood of the Son of God."
2. "There is hence nothing which ought so much to stimulate us to the practice of holiness, as the memory of this price of our redemption."
3. "In vain is pretended in this case the authority of the Fathers or an ancient custom. For the Prophet Ezekiel cried to the Jews, 'Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A redemption is in view which is expressed by a verb that is found in the N. T. only in other two passages...It has radically the sense of redeeming by payment of a ransom price."
2. "Here the ransom price is stated first negatively as not ‘corruptible’ (or ‘perishable’) things, not even the most valuable of these, such as silver or gold."
3. "What they were ransomed from is a particular manner of life which formed a bondage too strong to be broken by any ordinary ransom...It is further described by a term meaning ‘ancestral,’ ‘hereditary,’ or ‘traditional,’ which indicates how mighty a spell it must have wielded over them."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The appeal is to an elementary Christian belief, the holiness and justice of God with the added thought of the high cost of redemption." 
2. "The ransom is the blood of Christ. Peter here amplifies the language in Isaiah 52:3." 
3. "Slaves were set free by silver and gold."

### John Gill:
1. "The redemption of a soul, which is of more worth than a world, requires a greater price than gold and silver."
2. "The soul is immortal and incorruptible, but these are corruptible things, which may be cankered, or wear away, and perish by using."
3. "These were the inventions and decrees of them they called אבות, 'fathers', to whose dogmas and decisions they paid the utmost respect."

### John Wesley:
1. Your vain conversation — Your foolish, sinful way of life.
