Just as the blood of the paschal lamb was essential for Israel's redemption from Egypt, so the blood of Christ was necessary for our redemption from the bondage of sin. The innocence and purity of Christ are contrasted with the corruptible and perishable treasures of silver and gold, highlighting the incomparable worth of His sacrifice. Truly, Christ's sacrificial offering is of utmost value and secures our salvation.
