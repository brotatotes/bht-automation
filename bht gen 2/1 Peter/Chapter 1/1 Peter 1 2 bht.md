# 1 Peter 1:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The chosen ones were known and selected by God, not based on their own merit, but on God's divine purpose. The Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, are involved in the mystery of salvation. This election brings both comfort and responsibility, as the chosen ones are called to separate from the world and live in obedience. The knowledge and foreknowledge of God encompass His predestination and divine love, and it is through faith and obedience to the truth of the Gospel that we partake in the blessings of being elect.

1. "Their election is in virtue of this, in pursuance of this (Alford), or has this for its norm... It is a foreknowledge, therefore, which comes near the ideas of predestination and creative or appropriating love, and which makes it certain that its objects shall be in the relation which God purposes for them."
2. "If their election has its ground and norm in the foreknowledge of the Father, it realizes itself now within the sphere or condition of a patent separation from the world, which is effected by the Spirit."
