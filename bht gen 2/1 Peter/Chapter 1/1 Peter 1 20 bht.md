# 1 Peter 1:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The redemption of Christ was not a last-minute solution, but an eternal plan orchestrated by God. Before the foundation of the world, God chose Christ to be the Savior, pre-ordained him to be united with human nature, and appointed him for various purposes. The scheme of redemption was drawn in eternity, the persons to be redeemed were determined, and even the Gospel itself was ordained beforehand for our glory. Christ, existing from everlasting, was manifested in the flesh at the appointed time, veiled under the shadows of the ceremonial law but clearly revealed in the Gospel.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

3. "This œÜŒ±ŒΩŒ≠œÅœâœÉŒπœÇ of Christ, as Wiesinger remarks, marks this as the end of the times, and this last time shall only endure so long, as this œÜŒ±ŒΩŒ≠œÅœâœÉŒπœÇ requires."

### Albert Barnes:

3. "He says that this was done in these last times, meaning the same as when Paul says, 'In the fullness of time,' (Galatians 4:4;) for it was the mature season and the full time which God in his counsel had appointed."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The phrase, ‚Äòbefore the foundation of the world,‚Äô used by Paul (Ephesians 1:4), and by Christ Himself in reference to His own pre-incarnate life (John 17:24), carries us above all time into an eternity out of which time and history issued, and in which God‚Äôs purpose was formed."
2. "Foreknowledge no doubt here, as in 1 Peter 1:2, means not mere prescience, but recognition, and lies near the idea of providing or determining."
3. "The preciousness of the redemption has been carefully set forth by four different definitions of its cost which have risen in a climax from the simple notice of blood, to that of blood with all the value arising from the ethical quality of Him who shed it, to that of Christ‚Äôs blood, and finally to that of the blood of the Christ who was eternally in God‚Äôs view as the Ransom."

"He was before, he existed from everlasting; he lay in the bosom of his Father from all eternity: and was veiled and hid under the shadows of the ceremonial law, during the legal dispensation; but in the fulness of time was manifest in the flesh, and more clearly revealed in the Gospel, and to the souls of men."
