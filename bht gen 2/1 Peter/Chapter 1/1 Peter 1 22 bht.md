# 1 Peter 1:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The purification of our souls originates from a personal intention and effort, as faith purifies our hearts and gives us a pure motive of love to God. This purification leads to unfeigned brotherly love, a love that extends to all those in Christ. Our love for the brethren is the evidence of our faith and regeneration, and it should come from a pure heart, free from secondary purposes. Therefore, let us make personal exertions to purify our souls and cultivate fervent love towards one another, with a pure and sincere heart.
