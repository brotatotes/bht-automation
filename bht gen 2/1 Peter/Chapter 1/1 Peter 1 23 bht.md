# 1 Peter 1:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but incorruptible, by means of the word of God, living and abiding. This new birth is not dependent on perishable elements, but on the enduring power of God's Word. It is through this living and abiding Word that the transformation occurs, giving rise to a new life that stands in steadfastness and permanence. The Gospel itself is incorruptible, bearing fruits that are not subject to decay or failure. It is the means by which dead sinners are quickened and faith is engendered, leading to a life lived in communion with Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but incorruptible, by means of the word of God, living and abiding."
2. "The word of God is not the begetting principle itself, but only that by which the principle works: as it were the coccus or grain which is the involucrum and vehicle of the mysterious germinating power."
3. "The word itself is no mere perishing vehicle; no mere sacramental symbol, lost in the using: but it lives by and with the divine principle of life which it conveys and expands, and abides forever."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "As natural relationship gives rise to natural affection, so spiritual relationship gives rise to spiritual, and therefore abiding love, even as the seed from which it springs is abiding, not transitory as earthly things."
2. "We are born again of the Spirit, yet not without the use of means, but by the word of God. The word is not the beggeting principle itself, but only that by which it works: the vehicle of the mysterious germinating power."
3. "The Gospel bears incorruptible fruits, not dead works, because it is itself incorruptible."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The result of such a birth, or of being begotten in this way - for so the word rendered 'born again' more properly signifies - is only corruption and decay."
2. "By truth, communicating a living principle to the soul which can never decay."
3. "As God is ever-living, that which is produced directly by him in the human soul, by the instrumentality of truth, may be expected also to endure forever."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Being born again [Î±Î½Î±Î³ÎµÎ³ÎµÎ½Î½Î·Î¼ÎµÎ½Î¿Î¹] . Rev., having been begotten again... Of [ÎµÎº] seed - by [Î´Î¹Î±] the word."
2. "Word of God [Î»Î¿Î³Î¿Ï… Î¸ÎµÎ¿Ï…] . The gospel of Christ."
3. "Not the personal Word, as the term is employed by John. Nevertheless, the connection and relation of the personal with the revealed word is distinctly recognized."

### John Calvin:
1. "It behoved them to form a life worthy of God and of their spiritual regeneration."
2. "Peter collected together those things which may lead us to an upright and a holy life."
3. "The object, then, of Peter was to teach us that we cannot be Christians without regeneration."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The tense denotes a subsisting state due to an act in the past, and, therefore, here a new life in which they stand in virtue of a decisive change equivalent to a new birth."
2. "The former originates in what is incorruptible, and therefore is itself unsusceptible of failure or decadence."
3. "It is not quite clear which of the two subjects, God or the Word, is qualified by the adjectives 'living' and 'abiding.' The order in the Greek is peculiar, the noun 'God's' being thrust in between the two adjectives."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Having been begotten again." 
2. "Not of corruptible seed." 
3. "Through the word of God."

### John Gill:

3. "The Gospel also may be said to live...points out the way of life and salvation to sinners; and is a means of quickening dead sinners, and of ingenerating that faith by which men live on Christ."
