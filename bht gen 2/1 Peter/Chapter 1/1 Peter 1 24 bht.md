# 1 Peter 1:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Every human creature is transient and withering as grass, including all the wisdom, strength, wealth, and righteousness that he possesses, which are the most short-lived part of him. Man's glory, like a flower, has already fallen off even as we speak. But there is good news, for the Gospel reveals lasting riches, honor, wisdom, strength, spiritual knowledge, an everlasting righteousness, and true holiness in Christ.
