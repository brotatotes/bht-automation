# 1 Peter 1:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is both the Father of Jesus in his divine nature and his God in his humanity. This God, our Father, has regenerated us, giving us new life and a living hope that brings revival and vitality to our hearts and souls. This hope is rooted in the resurrection of Christ, which not only serves as a pledge and assurance for us but also is deeply connected to our own rising from spiritual death. Just as Christ lives, so shall we live with him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "The resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead...potentiates the new birth unto a living hope."


### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Blessed—A distinct Greek word (eulogetos, 'Blessed BE') is used of God, from that used of man (eulogemenos, 'Blessed IS')." 
2. "Living is a favorite expression of Peter...He delights in contemplating life overcoming death in the believer. Faith and love follow hope."
3. "Our 'hope' is, Christ rising from the dead hath ordained the power, and is become the pattern of the believer's resurrection. The soul, born again from its natural state into the life of grace, is after that born again unto the life of glory."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There was great mercy shown them in the fact that they were renewed."
2. "The resurrection of the Lord Jesus is the foundation of our hope."
3. "The fact that Christians are chosen to salvation should be a subject of gratitude and praise."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Blessed [ευλογητος] . eu, well, logov, a word. Well - spoken - of; praised; honored. Used in the New Testament of God only."
2. "Hath begotten us again [αναγεννησας ημας] . The verb is used by Peter only, and by him only here and ver. 23. It is in the aorist tense, and should be rendered, as Rev., begat; because regeneration is regarded as a definite historical act accomplished once for all."
3. "Lively [ζωσαν] . Better, as Rev., literally rendering the participle, living: a favorite word with Peter."

### John Calvin:
1. "For, when their value appears to us, all other things will be deemed worthless, especially when we consider what Christ and his blessings are; for everything without him is but dross."
2. "Whosoever, then, seeks really to know the only true God, must regard him as the Father of Christ; for, whenever our mind seeks God, except Christ be thought of, it will wander and be confused, until it be wholly lost."
3. "He shews that God was induced by no merits of ours to regenerate us unto a living hope, because he assigns this wholly to his mercy. But that he might more completely reduce the merits of works to nothing, he says, great (multam) mercy."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The gifts of God’s grace to the believer, and the believer’s relation to God, depend upon the prior relation between God and Christ."
2. "It is due to God’s regenerating grace. We have it only because He begat us again, a phrase used in the New Testament only by Peter... reflecting the Master’s own instructions to Nicodemus."
3. "The hope which originated thus in God’s act is living. With the birth comes the quality of life which distinguishes the believer’s hope from all other hopes."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. This precise language in 2 Corinthians 1:3; 2 Corinthians 1:3; and part of it in 2 Corinthians 11:31; Romans 15:6. See John 20:17 for similar language by Jesus."
2. "Begat us again. First aorist active articular (ο, who) participle of αναγενναω, late, and rare word to beget again, in Aleph for Sirach (Prol. 20), in Philo, in Hermetic writings, in N.T. only here and verse 1 Peter 1:23."
3. "Unto a living hope. Peter is fond of the word 'living' (present active participle of ζαω) as in 1 Peter 1:23; 1 Peter 2:4; 1 Peter 2:5; 1 Peter 2:24; 1 Peter 4:5; 1 Peter 4:6. The Pharisees cherished the hope of the resurrection (Acts 23:6), but the resurrection of Jesus gave it proof and permanence (1 Corinthians 15:14; 1 Corinthians 15:17)."

### John Gill:
1. "To be 'begotten again', and so to be born again, is opposed unto, and distinguished from our first birth, when we were conceived, and shapen in sin; and designs a birth, spiritual, holy, and heavenly."
2. "God, and not man, is the efficient cause of this, which is sometimes ascribed to the Spirit, and sometimes to the Son, and here to the Father; and it is not men's works, but his own good will and pleasure, his great love and free favour, his rich grace and abundant mercy, are the impulsive, or moving cause of it."
3. "Christ's resurrection is the virtual cause of regeneration, or regeneration is in virtue of Christ's resurrection; had he not risen from the dead, none would have been quickened, or made to live, or have been raised to newness of life."

### John Wesley:
1. "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ — His Father, with respect to his divine nature; his God, with respect to his human."
2. "Who hath regenerated us to a living hope — An hope which implies true spiritual life, which revives the heart, and makes the soul lively and vigorous."
3. "By the resurrection of Christ — Which is not only a pledge of ours, but a part of the purchase-price. It has also a close connexion with our rising from spiritual death, that as he liveth, so shall we live with him."
