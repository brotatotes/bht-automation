# 1 Peter 1:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers have been given an invaluable inheritance from God, one that is incorruptible and unfading. This inheritance, likened to a vast estate, is freely bestowed on them as children of God. Unlike earthly treasures that are subject to decay and defilement, this heavenly inheritance is preserved in the safekeeping of God Himself, beyond the reach of danger and corruption. It is a picture of blessedness, reserved in heaven and awaiting the true and legitimate heirs of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "By κληρονομία (cf. ch. 1 Peter 3:7; 1Pe 3:9) is imported the whole fulness of blessings not seen, of which the Christian as a child of God (ἀναγενν . 1Pe 1:3) has expectation, cf. Galatians 4:7."
2. "This inheritance is more closely defined, as σωτηρία (1 Peter 1:5; 1Pe 1:9), as χάρις, χάρις ζωῆς (1 Peter 1:13; ch. 1Pe 3:7), as δόξα (ch. 1Pe 5:1), as ἀμαράντινος τῆς δόξης στέφανος (ch. 1Pe 5:4), or ἡ αἰώνιος τοῦ θεοῦ δόξα (ch. 1Pe 5:10)."
3. "Our inheritance is glorious in these three respects: it is in substance, incorruptible: in purity, undefiled: in beauty, unfading."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The inheritance is the believer's already by title, being actually assigned to him; the entrance on its possession is future, and hoped for as a certainty." 
2. "Negations of the imperfections which meet us on every side here are the chief means of conveying to our minds a conception of the heavenly things which 'have not entered into the heart of man,' and which we have not faculties now capable of fully knowing."
3. "The rich man is either a dishonest man himself, or the heir of a dishonest man. Even Israel's inheritance was defiled by the people's sins. Defilement intrudes even on our holy things now, whereas God's service ought to be undefiled."

### Albert Barnes:
1. ""Christians are regarded as the adopted children of God, and heaven is spoken of as their inheritance - as what their Father will bestow on them as the proof of his love.""
2. ""The meaning here is, that the inheritance will be imperishable, or will endure forever.""
3. ""The idea here, therefore, is not precisely the same as is expressed by the word 'incorruptible.' Both words indeed denote perpetuity, but that refers to perpetuity in contrast with decay; this denotes perpetuity in the sense that everything there will be kept in its original brightness and beauty.""

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "An inheritance is originally a portion which one receives by lot in a general distribution." 
2. "The loveliness of the heavenly inheritance is described as exempt from the blight which attaches to earthly bloom."
3. "The verb signifies keeping as the result of guarding. Thus in John 17:11, Christ says, 'keep [τηρσον] those whom thou hast given me;'"

### John Calvin:
1. "The inheritance is said to be reserved, or preserved, that we may know that it is beyond the reach of danger."
2. "For consciences will calmly recumb here, that is, when the Lord cries to them from heaven, 'Behold, your salvation is in my hand and is kept for you.'"
3. "But as salvation is not indiscriminately for all, he calls our attention to faith, that all who are endued with faith, might be distinguished from the rest, and that they might not doubt but that they are the true and legitimate heirs of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "When we are begotten, that is to say, into the hope, we are begotten into the inheritance. To have the one is to have the other." 
2. "The inheritance is described as incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away. There is perhaps a climax in these negatives, from what has in itself no seeds of decay, to what is proof against external touch of pollution, and from that to what is superior even to the law of changing seasons and bloom succeeded by blight."
3. "The inheritance is further described positively as reserved in heaven for you. It is thereby made doubly safe, 'laid up and kept,' and that 'among God’s own treasures, under His own eye, and within the shelter of His omnipotence.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Unto an inheritance...a picture of the blessedness in store for us pilgrims."
2. "Incorruptible...imperishable...So many inheritances vanish away before they are obtained."
3. "That fadeth not away...These inscriptions will fade away, but not this inheritance in Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "It is an 'inheritance'; a large estate, and rich possession, they are born heirs apparent to."
2. "It is free from corruption in itself; nor can it be corrupted by others, by moth, or rust, or other things."
3. "This serves both to commend the inheritance, to set forth the excellency of it, lying in such a place as heaven; for the situation of an inheritance adds oftentimes to the valuableness of it; and also the safety and security of it; it is safe, being in heaven, and more so as it is in Christ's hands there."

### John Wesley:
1. "Incorruptible — Not like earthly treasures."
2. "Defiled — Pure and holy, incapable of being itself defiled, or of being enjoyed by any polluted soul."
3. "And that fadeth not away — That never decays in its value, sweetness, or beauty, like all the enjoyments of this world."
