# 1 Peter 1:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Regenerated persons greatly rejoice, even in the midst of their temporary troubles and trials, because they are kept by the power of God. They understand that their present sufferings are only for a little while compared to the eternal glory that awaits them. These afflictions are allowed by God for their spiritual growth and are not always necessary. Although they may experience sorrow, they do not despair, for they have faith, hope, and love, and even in their grief, they find unspeakable joy.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἀγαλλιᾶσθε is a stronger word than χαίρειν, implying the external expression and exuberant triumph of joy."
2. "This past part., more than any thing, favours the quasi-future acceptation of ἀγαλλιᾶσθε: looking back from the time of which exultation, the grief is regarded as passed away and gone."
3. "πειρασμοῖς, as in ref. James, trials, arising from whatever cause; here, mainly from persecution."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Salvation is realized by faith as a thing so actually present as to cause exulting joy in spite of existing afflictions."
2. "The 'grieved' is regarded as past, the 'exulting joy' present. Because the realized joy of the coming salvation makes the present grief seem as a thing of the past."
3. "Trials test your faith and come in many and various kinds."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The prospect which they had of the future inheritance was to them a source of the highest joy, even in the midst of their many sufferings and trials."
2. "That must be a valuable religion which will make people happy in the midst of persecutions and heavy calamities."
3. "There was some good to be accomplished by them, which made it desirable and proper that they should be thus afflicted."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word is always employed in the New Testament for great or lively joy."
2. "More literally and correctly, as Rev., for a little while."
3. "The word gives a vivid picture of the diversity of the trials, emphasizing this idea rather than that of their number, which is left to be inferred."

### John Calvin:
1. "But the faithful know by experience, how these things can exist together, much better than can be expressed in words."
2. "Thus sorrow does not prevent their joy, but, on the contrary, give place to it."
3. "Hence the godly bear sorrow, as the tamed ox the yoke, or as a horse, broken in, the bridle, though held by a child."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In the present series of verses... to regard the 'wherein' as referring to the immediate antecedent, viz. the 'last time.'"
2. "This particular term for joy... It denotes a strong, a lively joy, intenser than is expressed by the ordinary term..."
3. "Yet the terror of the fact is at once relieved by a double qualification... 'if need be,' or 'if it must be so.' This means that temptations come only where there is a call for them."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Ye greatly rejoice (αγαλλιασθε). Present middle indicative (rather than imperative) of αγαλλιαομα, late verb from αγαλλομα, to rejoice, only in LXX, N.T., and ecclesiastical literature as in Matthew 5:12."
2. "Now for a little while (ολιγον αρτ). Accusative case of time (ολιγον) probably as in Mark 6:31, though it can be used of space (to a small extent) as in Luke 5:3."
3. "If need be (ε δεον). Present active neuter singular participle of δε (it is necessary). Some MSS. have εστιν after δεον (periphrastic construction). Condition of first class."

### John Gill:
1. "Regenerated persons rejoice, in that they are the elect of God, according to his everlasting love towards them, and free grace, and good will; in their regeneration, which is an evidence of their election of God; in the abundant mercy of God displayed in their regeneration..."
2. "The character of the saints in this world is, that they are as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing, rejoicing even in their tribulations and temptations; yea, for them, and on account of them..."
3. "Afflictive dispensations, in whatsoever form, are necessary, by the will of God, who has appointed them, and therefore must be, and ought to be, quietly submitted to, and patiently borne, on that consideration..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Wherein - That is, in being so kept. Ye even now greatly rejoice, though now for a little while - Such is our whole life, compared to eternity."
2. "If need be - For it is not always needful. If God sees it to be the best means for your spiritual profit."
3. "Ye are in heaviness - Or sorrow; but not in darkness; for they still retained both faith, 1 Peter 1:5, hope, and love; yea, at this very time were rejoicing with joy unspeakable, 1 Peter 1:8."
