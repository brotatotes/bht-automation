# 1 Peter 1:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The testing of faith is a valuable and important process, even more significant than testing gold. Just as gold is tested with fire to remove impurities and determine its genuineness, our faith also needs to pass through the fire of trials to reveal its true value. When our faith is tested and proven genuine, it will be praised and honored by God, and our good works will be commended. At the revelation of Jesus Christ, not only will His glory be revealed, but the true character of His faithful followers will also be unveiled.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The faith itself: see above), yet is (usually, habitually) proved by fire"
2. "G..old though perishable yet needs fire to try it the inference lying in the background, how much more does your faith, which is being proved for eternity, not for mere temporary use, need a fiery trial?"
3. "May be found unto praise and glory and honour in the revelation of Jesus Christ"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "That your faith may be found unto praise, namely, the praise to be bestowed by the Judge."
2. "If gold, though perishing, is yet tried with fire in order to remove dross and test its genuineness, how much more does your faith, which shall never perish, need to pass through a fiery trial to remove whatever is defective, and to test its genuineness and full value?"
3. "At Christ's revelation shall take place also the revelation of the sons of God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The testing of [faith], the process of showing whether it was or was not genuine, was a much more important and valuable process than that of testing gold in the fire."
2. "It is desirable that the faith of Christians should be tried...in order to show its true value."
3. "God takes various methods of trying his people, with a design to test the value of their piety, and to separate it from all impure mixtures."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word means a test. As the means of proof, however, is not only the touchstone itself, but the trace of the metal left upon it, the sense here is the result of the contact of faith with trial, and hence the verification of faith." 
2. "The expression is equivalent to your approved faith."
3. "It thus differs from peirazein, to try or tempt (see on peirasmoiv, ver. 6), in that that verb indicates simply a putting to proof to discover what good or evil is in a person; and from the fact that such scrutiny so often develops the existence any energy of evil, the word acquired a predominant sense of putting to the proof with the design or hope of breaking down the subject under the proof - in other words, of temptation in the ordinary sense."

### John Calvin:
1. "And though the words seem to have a different meaning, he yet compares faith to gold, and makes it more precious than gold, that hence he might draw the conclusion, that it ought to be fully proved."
2. "For our life is now hidden in Christ, and will remain hidden, and as it were buried, until Christ shall appear from heaven; and the whole course of our life leads to the destruction of the external man, and all the things we suffer are, as it were, the preludes of death."
3. "For trials as to us are full of reproach and shame, and they become glorious in Christ; but that glory in Christ is not yet plainly seen, for the day of consolation is not yet come."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The statement now introduced connects itself closely with the conditional notice of suffering. It points them at once to the ultimate object of their possible subjection to many painful things now."
2. "The comparison between the probation of character and the testing of metals, which occurs so often elsewhere, has a limited application here."
3. "The descriptions [praise, honour, glory] are cumulative rather than ascensive, word being added to word in order to convey some faint conception of the gracious reward which is to be found at last to have been the end in view."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The proof of your faith."
2. "Faith stands the test of fire better than gold."
3. "This is the result of the probation by God as the Refiner of hearts."

### John Gill:
1. "The grace of faith is much more precious than gold; since that perisheth by using, but faith does not; and since it is so valuable as not to be obtained by it."
2. "Faith, being tried in the fire of afflictions, is purged from unbelief; and the believer is purged from his dross and tin, and his iniquity is purged, and the fruit of all is to take away sin."
3. "His faith will be praised for its steadiness and constancy, notwithstanding all persecutions and tribulations; and his good works, the fruits of faith, will be taken notice of by him with commendation."

### John Wesley:
1. "That the trial of your faith — That is, your faith which is tried."
2. "Which is much more precious than gold — For gold, though it bear the fire, yet will perish with the world."
3. "May be found — Though it doth not yet appear. Unto praise — From God himself. And honour — From men and angels. And glory — Assigned by the great Judge."
