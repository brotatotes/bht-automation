# 1 Peter 1:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Having not seen Christ in the flesh does not diminish the love that believers have for him. Their love is deep and heartfelt, rooted in their faith and the Gospel message they have received. It is a love that surpasses mere physical sight and is a testament to the transformative work of the Spirit in their hearts. Such a love is difficult to put into words, as it transcends human understanding and can only be truly experienced by those who have encountered and embraced Christ.

3. "Ye rejoice...with joy unspeakable...The happiness...when they first had evidence that their sins were forgiven...was unspeakable...thousands of mature Christians who could find no words to express the peace and joy...in the love of Christ, and the hope of heaven."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Receiving [Œ∫ŒøŒºŒπŒ∂ŒøŒºŒµŒΩŒøŒπ] . The verb originally means to take care of or provide for; thence to receive hospitably or entertain; to bring home with a view to entertaining or taking care of."

### John Calvin:
1. "The first clause in order is, that faith is not to be measured by sight. For when the life of Christians is apparently miserable, they would instantly fail, were not their happiness dependent on hope."
2. "The second clause is, that faith is not a cold notion, but that it kindles in our hearts love to Christ."
3. "It is an incomparable benefit, that consciences are not only at peace before God, but confidently exult in the hope of eternal life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Yet they had Him as the object of their love and faith, and in that they had enough to make their clouded life bright."
2. "Their present might seem grievous in comparison with that future of which Peter had given them a glimpse. But if it denied them Christ in the possession of sight, it admitted the deeper possession of faith. And to have that is to have joy."
3. "The quality of this joy is expressed both by the repetition of the verb already used to express exultant joy (1 Peter 1:6), and by the addition of two remarkable adjectives. The former of these, which is found in no other passage of the N. T., and is of very rare occurrence elsewhere, conveys a different idea from the ‚Äòunspeakable‚Äô in 2 Corinthians 12:4, and is more analogous to the ‚Äòwhich cannot be uttered‚Äô of Romans 8:26."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Happy are those not seeing and yet believing." 
2. "Unutterable, like Paul's 'indescribable' gift."

### John Gill:
1. "Whom having not seen, ye love,... and yet Christ being made known to them, through the preaching of the Gospel, they received and embraced him, and their affections were strongly set upon him..."
2. "their love was not carnal, but spiritual; it was a fruit of the Spirit of God in their souls; was accompanied with faith in Christ, and proceeded upon the report the Gospel made of him..."
3. "a joy in believing on him, which is better experienced than expressed; a joy that not only strangers intermeddle not with, know nothing of, which entirely passes their understanding, but is such as saints themselves cannot speak out, or give a full and distinct account of..."

### John Wesley:
1. Having not seen ‚Äî In the flesh.
