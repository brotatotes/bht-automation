# 1 Peter 1:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls refers to the culmination of faith, where believers obtain the ultimate reception of glory or condemnation from the Lord. This salvation is not just a future hope but a present reality, as believers now receive and enjoy the full possession of salvation. It involves the deliverance from a state of wrath, demonstrating the peace and joy that comes from believing. Ultimately, salvation encompasses the spiritual and eternal deliverance of the soul, which is what believers were appointed to from all eternity.
