# 1 Peter 2:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We are called to lay aside all malice and evil-speaking, cleansing ourselves of vices that offend brotherly love. As new creatures, we tear off the foul garment of corrupt habits. Let us live with child-like candor, devoid of envy and evil-speakings. Our lives should be marked by kindness and honesty, putting away all dissimulation and guile, reflecting the love of Christ.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "Malice, c., are utterly inconsistent with the 'love of the brethren,' unto which ye have 'purified your souls.' The vices here are those which offend against the BROTHERLY LOVE inculcated above."

3. "It is one of the purposes of religion to bring us back to this state, and to strip off all the subterfuges which we may have acquired in life; and he in whom this effect is not accomplished has never been converted."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. All [πασαν - παντα] . Lit., every, or all manner of. Evil - speaking [καταλαλιας] . Lit., speakings against. A rare word. Only here and 2 Corinthians 12:20.

### John Calvin:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The vices to be renounced...are compared implicitly to a foul garment enwrapping the old man. They are the 'Nessus shirt' of corrupt habits which the new man tears off." 
2. "The renunciation of everything alien to child-like candour, to the transparency and healthfulness of the child-like character."
3. "The malice which purposes evil to a brother is named first as at the root of all...the masked acts by which we painfully cover our assault upon a brother's good, exasperate our envyings of his good, and these find vent in evil-speakings or overt attempts to talk him down."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Putting away therefore (αποθεμενο ουν). Second aorist middle participle of αποτιθημ, old and common verb, in metaphorical sense either to cleanse defilements (1 Peter 3:21; James 1:21) or to put off clothing (Romans 13:12; Colossians 3:5; Ephesians 4:22). Either sense suits here. Therefore (ουν) because of the new birth (1 Peter 1:23) and the new life demanded."
2. "Wickedness (κακιαν). This old word, from κακος (evil), in the ancients meant vice of any kind and note πασαν (all) here."
3. "Hypocrisies (υποκρισεις). Singular (υποκρισιν) in the best MSS. See 1 Peter 1:22 (ανυποκριτον) and Mark 7:6 for Christ's denunciation of hypocrites which the disciples did not understand, including Peter (Matthew 15:16)."

### John Gill:
1. "He dissuades them from them, and advises to 'lay them aside', either as weights and burdens, which it was not fit for new born babes to carry; see Hebrews 12:1 or rather as old worn out clothes, as filthy rags, which should be put off, laid by, and never used more..."
2. "Hypocrisy to God is, when persons profess that which they have not, as love to God, faith in Christ, zeal for religion, fervent devotion, and sincerity in the worship of God; and do all they do to be seen of men, and appear outwardly righteous, and yet are full of all manner of iniquity."
3. "Envies; at each other's happiness and prosperity, riches, honours, gifts temporal or spiritual; for such are works of the flesh, show men to be carnal, are unbecoming regenerated persons."

### John Wesley:
1. Wherefore laying aside — As inconsistent with that pure love.All dissimulation — Which is the outward expression of guile in the heart.
