# 1 Peter 2:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Once considered nothing, individuals who were scattered across many nations have now been chosen by God to be His people. They were once without mercy and lacked knowledge of forgiveness, but through God's pure mercy and grace, they have been shown compassion and received His forgiveness. This transformation is not based on their own merits, but rather on God's unfathomable goodness. It is a reminder for them to be grateful and to demonstrate their gratitude through their actions, living a life that reflects the new identity bestowed upon them by God.
