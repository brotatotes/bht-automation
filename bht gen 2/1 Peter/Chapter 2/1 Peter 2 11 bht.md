# 1 Peter 2:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As beloved pilgrims and strangers in this foreign land, it is imperative that we purify our souls and abstain from the earthly lusts that seek to wage war against our salvation. We must walk in a manner worthy of our heavenly citizenship, not allowing ourselves to be encumbered by worldly desires. Instead, let us focus on the spiritual journey before us, abstaining from the sinful passions and affections of the flesh, and guarding our hearts against the enemies that seek to hinder our progress towards eternal life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Beloved (as this word is only found once again in this Epistle, we may apply to it Wiesinger’s remark, “The seldomer our Apostle uses this endearing term, the weightier it is where it does occur as the opening of a hortatory discourse”)."
2. "I exhort you as sojourners and strangers. [...] Still, from the more general reference of this first exhortation, the other and wider reference must not be left out of sight. These words, belong, not to [the exhortation], but to abstain. They form the ground why the readers should abstain, not why the Writer should exhort."
3. "The [carnal lusts], which gathers up into a class the [desires] and asserts it of all of them that they war against the soul: thus rendering a reason, 'quippe quae.' With [those desires], it might have been taken, 'from those fleshly lusts, which' war against the soul."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Purify your souls as strangers on earth who must not allow yourselves to be kept back by earthly lusts, and because these lusts war against the soul's salvation."
2. "Walk piously among unbelievers so that they may cease to calumniate Christians, and may themselves be converted to Christ."
3. "Not only the gross appetites which we have in common with the brutes, but all the thoughts of the unrenewed mind."

1. "Christians are not properly citizens of this world, but that their citizenship is in heaven, and that they are here mere sojourners."
2. "They should, therefore, act as become such persons; as sojourners and travelers do."
3. "We should not encumber ourselves with much of this world’s goods. Many professed Christians get so many worldly things around them, that it is impossible for them to make a journey to heaven."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Beloved [αγαπητοι]. A favorite term with Peter, occurring eight times in the epistles."
2. "Strangers [παροικους]. Rev., sojourners. Compare ch. 1 17, 'the time of your sojourning [παροικιας].'"
3. "Which [αιτινες]. The compound pronoun denotes a class, of that kind which, classifying all fleshly desires in one category."

### John Calvin:
1. "And first, to call them away from the indulgence of carnal lusts, he employs this argument, that they were sojourners and strangers." 
2. "By the lusts or desires of the flesh he means not only those gross concupiscences which we have in common with animals, but also all those sinful passions and affections of the soul, to which we are by nature guided and led." 
3. "He proves our carelessness in this respect, that while we anxiously shun enemies from whom we apprehend danger to the body, we willingly allow enemies hurtful to the soul to destroy us; nay, we as it were stretch forth our neck to them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The injunction is given in terms of tender urgency."
2. "The opening designation occurs no less than eight times in the Epistles of Peter, and in every case except the present the A. V. translates it simply ‘beloved,’ not ‘dearly beloved.’"

### Archibald T. Robertson:

3. "See this struggle between the flesh and the spirit vividly pictured by Paul in Galatians 5:16-24."
