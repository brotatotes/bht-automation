# 1 Peter 2:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible teaches that we are to subject ourselves to every human institution for the Lord's sake, whether it is a king or any other form of government. This submission is not a blind obedience, but one that is limited and restrained to those in authority. It is important to understand that this does not mean blindly accepting or condoning any actions contrary to God's law. Rather, it is a recognition of the divine appointment of civil government. Our submission is for the Lord's sake, recognizing His sovereign authority over all things.
