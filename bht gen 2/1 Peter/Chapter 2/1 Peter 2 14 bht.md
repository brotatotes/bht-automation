# 1 Peter 2:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Magistrates, whether rulers or governors, play a crucial role in society. It is important to submit to their governance as they are appointed by God and hold authority. While no tyranny is without corruption, any form of government is better than anarchy. Though the apostle may not have emphasized the duty to obey governors, it remains an essential aspect of governance. Magistrates have the responsibility to punish the wicked and protect the innocent. Ultimately, God has established various forms of government to administer justice, suppress evil, and commend those who do good.
