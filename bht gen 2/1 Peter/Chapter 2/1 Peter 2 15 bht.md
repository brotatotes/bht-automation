# 1 Peter 2:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By engaging in well-doing, we have the opportunity to silence the ignorance of those who oppose us. Their ignorance stems from not knowing God and not understanding our true character. Therefore, we are called to live according to the laws of civil society and demonstrate a life of rectitude and dutifulness. This will not only discredit their false accusations but also evoke pity towards them because they are oblivious to the truth.
