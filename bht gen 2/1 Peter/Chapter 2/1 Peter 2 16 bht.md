# 1 Peter 2:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They were Christ's freemen, free from sin and the condemnation of the law, but they were not free to live in contempt of God's laws or to disregard authority. Their freedom in Christ did not excuse them from submitting to and obeying those in positions of authority, as their obedience was an expression of their service to God and Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "As free (children of God, His family and people, His kingly priesthood: not merely free from the law, or free from sin, or free from earthly subjection, but generally and abstractedly free Christ’s freed men)."
2. "Not as having your freedom for a veil of your evil intent."
3. "But as God’s servants (and therefore bound to submit yourselves to that which God ordains)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Well-doing" is the natural fruit of being freemen of Christ, made free by "the truth" from the bondage of sin.
2. Duty is enforced on us to guard against licentiousness, but the way in which it is to be fulfilled is by love and the holy instincts of Christian liberty.
3. We are given principles, not details.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They were free from sin and condemnation. They acknowledged Christ as their supreme Head, and the whole spirit and tendency of his religion prompted to the exercise of freedom." 
2. "To spread the gospel in its purity everywhere would be to break every yoke of oppression and bondage, and to make people everywhere free."
3. "Not a few have done this who have professed to be Christians; and, occasionally, a fanatical sect now appears who make the freedom which they say Christianity confers, a pretext for indulgence in the most base and degrading vices."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The idea is that of using Christian freedom as a mask for ungodly license."
2. "Paul uses the kindred verb (Romans 4:7) of the covering of sins."
3. "On the sentiment, compare Galatians 5:13."

### John Calvin:
1. "True liberty, then, is that which harms or injures no one."
2. "It is obvious, hence, to conclude, that we obtain liberty, in order that we may more promptly and more readily render obedience to God; for it is no other than a freedom from sin; and dominion is taken away from sin, that men may become obedient to righteousness."
3. "For as we ought to be the servants of God, that we may enjoy this benefit, so moderation is required in the use of it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Liberty is apt to degenerate into licence."
2. "Their freedom was not to be used as a means for concealing or palliating wickedness, and they themselves, while free, were also God’s bond-servants and under obligation to fulfill His will."
3. "The ‘cloke’ of the A. V. is apt to mislead. The Greek term simply means a ‘covering,’ and is used in the Old Testament to denote the covering of badgers’ skins upon the tabernacle... It has no reference (as Beza strangely supposes) to the cap put on by manumitted slaves. Neither does it mean ‘cloak,’ except in the figurative sense of something that hides the true character of conduct."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For this ethical sense of ελευθερος see Galatians 4:26."
2. "And not holding your liberty" (present active participle of εχω, with usual negative μη with participle."
3. "There is no such thing as absolute freedom (personal freedom), for that is anarchy."

### John Gill:
1. "They were Christ's freemen, were free from sin, its damning and domineering power, and from the curses and condemnation of the law, and had freedom of access to God, and a right to all the privileges and immunities of the house of God."
2. "They were not free to sin, and to live in the contempt of the laws of God and men, to despise government, speak evil of dignities, and break in upon the rules of civil society."
3. "They that are free are the servants of God and Christ, and show themselves to be so by submitting to and obeying those that are under them, and ordained by them; and which is no ways inconsistent with, and contrary to their Christian liberty."

### John Wesley:
1. As free — Yet obeying governors, for God's sake.
