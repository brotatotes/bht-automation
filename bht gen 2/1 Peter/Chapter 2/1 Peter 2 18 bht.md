# 1 Peter 2:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Apostle Peter encourages servants to submit to their masters with a sense of reverence and respect. This directive encompasses not only the kind and considerate masters but also extends to those who are difficult and harsh. The focus is on demonstrating fidelity and fulfilling their obligations regardless of their masters' behavior. Peter's intention is not to endorse slavery but to highlight the principles of faithful service in all situations. This exhortation remains relevant beyond the specific context of slavery, offering guidance for anyone in a position of service or responsibility towards others.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Ye servants, in subjection in all fear to your masters; not only to the good and considerate, but also to the perverse."
2. "Possibly, as Steiger supposes, it may be here used to include the 'liberti' who still remained in their master's house."
3. "These masters are, as Gerh., 'sÃ¦vi et intractabiles, duri ac morosi'."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Peter's special object seems to be to teach them submission, whatever the character of the masters might be."
2. "The general exhortation is taken up again in 1 Peter 2:12- :, 'being subject,' is joined to the hortatory imperatives going before, namely, 'abstain,' 'submit yourselves,' 'honor all men.'"
3. "Those bound to obey must not make the disposition and behavior of the superior the measure of the fulfillment of their obligations."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word should not and cannot be employed to prove that slavery existed in the churches to which Peter wrote, and still less to prove that he approved of slavery, or regarded it as a good institution."
2. "It would be incumbent on [servants], while they remained in that condition, to perform with fidelity their duties as Christians, and to bear with Christian meekness all the wrongs which they might suffer from those in whose service they were."
3. "Though the terms used here do not necessarily imply that those to whom the apostle gave this direction were slaves, yet it may be presumed that they probably were, since slavery abounded throughout the Roman empire; but the directions will apply to all who are engaged in the service of others, and are therefore of permanent value."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Not a common term in the New Testament, occurring only in three other passages."
2. "The word implies rather the not being unduly rigorous."
3. "The word froward is Anglo - Saxon fream - ward or from - ward, the opposite of to - ward."

### John Calvin:
1. "He first would have servants to be subject with all fear; by which expression he means that sincere and willing reverence, which they acknowledge by their office to be due."
2. "For subjection due to men is not to be so far extended as to lessen the authority of God."
3. "This passage, then, shews how boldly they trifle with the Word of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Peter selects it probably with a conciliatory purpose, as a more courteous term than the common one. It presents the slave in closer relation to the family, and so conveys a softened view of his position."
2. "The slaveâ€™s duty is thus given as an integral section of the great law of subjection to â€˜every ordinance of man for the Lordâ€™s sake.â€™"
3. "It means, therefore, careful solicitude to give faithful service, â€˜shrinking from transgressing the masterâ€™s willâ€™."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "ÎŸÎ¹ÎºÎµÏ„Î·Ï‚, old word from Î¿Î¹ÎºÎ¿Ï‚ (house), means one in the same house with another (Latin domesticus), particularly house servants (slaves) in distinction from the general term Î´Î¿Ï…Î»Î¿Ï‚ (slave)."
2. "Either the participle is here used as an imperative (so in 1 Peter 3:1; 1 Peter 3:7) as in Romans 12:16, or the imperative ÎµÏƒÏ„Îµ has to be supplied."
3. "There were slave-owners (masters) like this as there are housekeepers and employers of workmen today. This is no argument for slavery, but only a sidelight on a condition bad enough at its best."

### John Gill:
1. "The manner in which they are to be subject to them is, with all fear; with reverence to their persons, strict regard to their commands, faithfulness in any trust reposed in them, diligence in the discharge of their duty, and carefulness of offending them."
2. "Not only to the good and gentle... but also to the froward; the ill-natured, morose, and rigorous; who exact more labour than is requisite; give hard words, and harder blows; withhold sufficiency of food from them, and keep back the hire of their labours."

### John Wesley:
1. Servants â€” Literally, household servants. With all fear - Of offending them or God.Not only to the good â€” Tender, kind.And gentle â€” Mild, easily forgiving.
