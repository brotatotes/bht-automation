# 1 Peter 2:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For this is a commendable act, a demonstration of grace's presence in one's life. It is an action motivated by a sincere desire to honor God, to act according to one's conscience in matters of faith. This includes patiently enduring hardships and mistreatment, without complaint or resistance, and submitting to God's will. It is in these moments of obedient suffering that one's commitment to God is truly tested and demonstrated.

3. "The motive which gives nobility to endurance is put in the foreground. By this ‘consciousness of God’ is meant neither exactly the ‘conscience toward God’ of the A. V. and R. V., nor ‘conscientiousness before God,’ far less ‘the consciousness which God has of us’ (as some strangely put it), but that consciousness which we have of God, which at once inspires the sense of duty and elevates the idea of duty."
