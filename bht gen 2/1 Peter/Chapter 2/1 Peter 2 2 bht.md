# 1 Peter 2:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Christians, we are often compared to children in the Scriptures. Just as a newborn baby desires and feeds on milk, we are called to earnestly desire the pure and sincere Word of God. This Word, which nourishes our souls like milk nourishes our bodies, is what we need to grow in our faith, love, and holiness. Let us, like newborn babes, hunger and thirst for the Word so that we may grow in our relationship with Christ and become more like Him in every aspect of our lives.

2. "Our English is too poor in psychological distinctions."
3. "The growth is the measure of the fulness of that not only rescue from destruction, but positive blessedness."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The childlike spirit is indispensable if we would enter heaven."
2. "The babe, instead of chemically analyzing, instinctively desires and feeds on the milk; so our part is not self-sufficient rationalizing and questioning, but simply receiving the truth in the love of it."
3. "The word is to be desired with appetite as the cause of life, to be swallowed in the hearing, to be chewed as cud is by rumination with the understanding, and to be digested by faith."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is not uncommon, in the Scriptures, to compare Christians with little children."
2. "There is no doubt that there is allusion to the gospel in its purest and most simple form, as adapted to be the nutriment of the new-born soul."
3. "Young Christians strongly resemble children, babies; and they need watchful care, and kind attention, and appropriate aliment, as much as new-born infants do."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "New-born [αρτιγεννητα] . Peculiar to Peter, and only in this passage. Lit., born but just now [αρτι]."
2. "Desire [επιποθησατε] . The compound is intensive; earnestly desire. So Rev., long for."
3. "The sincere milk of the word [το λογικον αδολον γαλα] . The A. V. has rendered logikon, of the word; but wrongly. It describes the quality of the milk as spiritual or rational, as opposed to liberal and ceremonial."

### John Calvin:
1. "That no one might think that infancy, void of understanding and full of fatuity, was commended by him, he in due time meets this objection; so he bids them to desire milk free from guile, and yet mixed with right understanding."
2. "Simplicity and quickness of understanding are two things apparently opposite; but they ought to be mixed together, lest simplicity should become insipid, and lest malicious craftiness should creep in for want of understanding."
3. "Milk is called the simpler mode of teaching, and one suitable to children, when there is no progress made beyond the first rudiments."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The contrast is not between Christians at different stages of Christian maturity, but between these converts as once they were and as now they have just come to be."
2. "'Milk' here does not mean the elementary doctrine which is suitable for babes in Christ... It is simply a figurative expression for the food which they must have, seeing that they are now in a new life."
3. "This increase will be secured, and that goal reached, only ‘thereby,’ or rather, ‘therein;’ that is, so far as the Word is made the mental food in which their new life instinctively seeks its nourishment, and made this with that great object in view."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Possibly slight proof that the Epistle written before Romans by Paul."
2. "Unadulterated milk which, alas, is so hard to get."
3. "Peter uses the word of God as the food for growth."

### John Gill:
1. "they were as 'babes', not on account of their want of knowledge, or unskilfulness in the word of righteousness; or of nonproficiency in the learning of divine truths, and their great dulness, backwardness, and imperfection; but because of their harmlessness and innocence, meekness and humility; and for the sincerity of their faith and love, obedience and profession."
2. "by 'the sincere milk of the word' is meant the Gospel, even the whole of it, and not, as elsewhere, the more plain and easy truths of it."
3. "desire after it supposes knowledge of it; and where there is an experimental knowledge, there will be a value and esteem for it, even above necessary food, and, at times, an hungering and thirsting after it, an impatient longing for, and desire of it."

### John Wesley:
1. "Desire - Always, as earnestly as new born babes do, 1 Peter 1:3."
2. "The milk of the word - That word of God which nourishes the soul as milk does the body, and which is sincere, pure from all guile, so that none are deceived who cleave to it."
3. "That you may grow thereby - In faith, love, holiness, unto the full stature of Christ."
