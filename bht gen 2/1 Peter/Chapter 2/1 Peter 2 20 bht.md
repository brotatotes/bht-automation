# 1 Peter 2:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When faced with deserved punishment, remaining silent and not complaining is commendable, but it should not be seen as a great honor. It is merely the least that can be done. However, if you do good and still suffer, yet endure it patiently without resentment or retaliation, this is pleasing to God. It is through His grace that such endurance is rewarded with glory.
