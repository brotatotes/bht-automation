# 1 Peter 2:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christians are called to patiently endure undeserved suffering, as Christ himself suffered for them as a model to follow. Christ's suffering was not only for their benefit but also to fulfill God's law and make reconciliation for sin. He left an example of meekness, patience, courage, and resignation to God's will. Through his sufferings, Christ provided a writing copy, a guide, and footprints for his followers to imitate and trace. By following in his steps of innocence and patience, Christians can live with Christ and fulfill their vocation in bearing wrongs.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For (proof that undeserved suffering is χάρις παρὰ θεῷ, by the instance of Christ’s sufferings, which were our example) to this (state, viz. the endurance of wrongful sufferings) ye were called." 
2. "Christ also suffered for you, leaving behind for you a copy that ye should follow upon His footsteps."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Christ's sufferings, while they are for an example, were also primarily sufferings 'for us,' a consideration which imposes an everlasting obligation on us to please Him."
2. "Christ's precepts and sermons were the transcript of His life. Peter graphically sets before servants those features especially suited to their case."
3. "Follow his steps - footsteps, namely, of His patience combined with innocence."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "For even hereunto were ye called - Such a spirit is required by the very nature of your Christian vocation."
2. "Because Christ also suffered for us - The sense, however, is not essentially varied. The object is, to hold up the example of Christ to those who were called to suffer, and to say to them that they should bear their trials in the same spirit that he evinced in his."
3. "Leaving us an example - The apostle does not say that this was the only object for which Christ suffered, but that it was an object, and an important one. The word rendered 'example' (ὑπογραμμὸν hupogrammon) means properly 'a writing copy,' such as is set for children; or an outline or sketch for a painter to fill up; and then, in general, an example, a pattern for imitation."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A graphic word, meaning a copy set by writing-masters for their pupils."
2. "Some explain it as a copy of characters over which the student is to trace the lines."
3. "From writers and painters, the metaphor changes now to a guide."

### John Calvin:
1. "For the Apostle here reminds all the godly in common as to what the condition of Christianity is, as though he had said, that we are called by the Lord for this end, patiently to bear wrongs; and as he says in another place that we are appointed to this."
2. "But we must notice the words, Leaving us an example. For as he treats of imitation, it is necessary to know what in Christ is to be our example."
3. "Hence, that we may live with him, we must previously die with him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Patient endurance of undeserved suffering should be deemed no strange thing. Painful as it was, it was involved in their Christian vocation."
2. "The best authorities give the second person here instead of the ‘for us’ of the Received Text. The phrase means here, too, not ‘in your stead,’ but ‘in your behalf,’ or ‘for your good.’"
3. "The object of this bequest is next stated, in order that ye might follow his steps, or footprints. The change of figure from a teacher setting a copy to be imitated, to a guide making a track to be intently kept by those coming after him, is to be noticed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They were called to suffer without flinching (Hort), if need be."
2. "The fact that Christ suffered (επαθεν) lifts their suffering to a new plane."
3. "Peter does not mean that Christ suffered only as an example (1 Peter 1:18), but he did leave us his example for our copying (1 John 2:6)."

### John Gill:
1. "For even hereunto were ye called....to patience in suffering for it, which highly becomes them."
2. "Christ also suffered for us; in our room and stead, to fulfil the law, satisfy the justice of God, and make reconciliation for sin."
3. "Christ is an example to his people in the exercise of grace...in his meekness, patience, courage, and resignation to the will of God, which is what is here intended, and in which his people are to follow and imitate him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Called - To suffer wrongfully."
2. "Leaving you an example - When he went to God."
3. "That you might follow his steps - Of innocence and patience."
