# 1 Peter 2:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ, as a man, was born into a sinful world and experienced afflictions, yet he himself did not sin. His appearance as a sinful man did not reflect the truth of his character, as there was no deceit or falsehood in his words or actions. While Christ suffered unjustly, bearing his sufferings with patience, sinners are encouraged to follow his example and patiently endure their own trials.
