The title of Shepherd and Bishop of your souls emphasizes that Christ cares deeply for their souls and serves as their ultimate protector and overseer. This designation conveys the idea that their souls are of immense value and worth, and it is Christ who diligently ensures their well-being. In light of this, they can trust in His loving guidance and gratefully commit to not wandering any longer.

2. "On the ground of such instances as Matthew 9:22; Matthew 10:13, Mark 5:30; Mark 8:33, John 12:40; John 21:20, it seems necessary to give the verb the middle sense here, although it might seem more in harmony with the context to render it â€˜are returned,â€™ so as to bring out more clearly what had been done for them."
