## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The allusion is to Psa 118:22 and Isaiah 28:16. Obs. that no ὡς must be supplied before λίθον, as is done in E. V. al.: Christ is the stone: we do not come to Him as we come to a stone."

### Albert Barnes:

### John Calvin:
1. "Let it then be noticed, that Peter connects an access to God with the taste of his goodness."
2. "For as the human mind necessarily dreads and shuns God, as long as it regards him as rigid and severe; so, as soon as he makes known his paternal love to the faithful, it immediately follows that they disregard all things and even forget themselves and hasten to him."
3. "But Peter forbids us to esteem Christ the less, however despised he may be by the world, because he, notwithstanding, retains his own worth and honor before God."

### Philip Schaff:
