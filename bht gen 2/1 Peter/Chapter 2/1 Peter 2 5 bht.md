# 1 Peter 2:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are like living stones, dug out and separated by God's grace, and are now alive to God through Christ. As a spiritual house, they are an abode of God through the Spirit. Their offerings, whether soul or body, thoughts or actions, are presented to God as spiritual sacrifices, accepted through Jesus Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Being God’s spiritual temple, they form an holy priesthood to Him, approaching and serving before Him in virtue of that Living and Holy One, whose mystic Body they are, and in whom the Father is well pleased."
2. "No where is this more clearly declared by inference, than here."
3. "Spiritual, because as the temple, as the priests, as the God, so the offering."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Christians are both the spiritual temple and the priests of the temple... All believers alike, and not merely ministers, are now the dwelling of God and priests unto God." 
2. "Christian houses of worship are never called temples because the temple was a place for sacrifice, which has no place in the Christian dispensation; the Christian temple is the congregation of spiritual worshippers."
3. "Imperfect as are our services, we are not with unbelieving timidity, which is close akin to refined self-righteousness, to doubt their acceptance through Christ."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The purpose of the apostle here is to compare the church to a beautiful temple - such as the temple in Jerusalem, and to show that it is complete in all its parts, as that was."
2. "The special abode of God on the earth was now removed from that temple to the Christian church."
3. "The only sense in which the term can now be used in the Christian church is a sense in which it is applicable to all Christians alike - that they 'offer the sacrifice of prayer and praise.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The metaphor of a house built of living stones is violent, and sufficiently characteristic of Peter; yet it pictures, in a very striking way, the union of stability, growth, and activity in the ideal church."
2. "Note the transition from babes growing (ver. 2) to stones built up."
3. "The word is often used of carrying from a lower to a higher place. Thus Matthew 17:1; Luke 24:51. In this sense ver. 24 of this chapter is suggestive, where it is said that Christ bare [ανηνεγκεν] our sins: carried them up to the cross."

### John Calvin:
1. "We must further observe, that he constructs one house from the whole number of the faithful. For though every one of us is said to be the temple of God, yet all are united together in one, and must be joined together by mutual love, so that one temple may be made of us all."
2. "Then, as it is true that each one is a temple in which God dwells by his Spirit, so all ought to be so fitted together, that they may form one universal temple."
3. "Here, then, is the third thing that enforces the exhortation; for he declares that what is required is acceptable to God, lest fear should make us slothful."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The imperative is to be preferred (with Beza, de Wette, Luthardt, Huther, Schott, Alford, etc.), as most consistent with the use of the similar ‘be ye’ in 1 Peter 1:15, with the hortatory force which seems inherent in the participle ‘coming’ (1 Peter 2:4), and with Peter’s practice of introducing charges in the form of imperatives accompanied by participles expressing the conditions of their fulfilment..."
2. "It may be that they are to be built up on the Foundation in the character of, or because they are, a spiritual house; or it may be rather that they are to be built up in order to make a spiritual house."
3. "The one thing it affirms is that all Christians as such, and without distinction, constitute a priestly fraternity corresponding to the community of priests established under the Law..."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Peter applies the metaphor about Christ as the living stone to the readers, 'ye yourselves also.'"
2. "If the metaphor of a house of living stones seems 'violent' (Vincent), it should be remembered that Jesus employed the figure of a house of believers."
3. "Peter has the same idea of Revelation 1:6 (ιερεις, priests) that all believers are priests (Hebrews 4:16) and can approach God directly."

### John Gill:
1. "Saints likewise are compared to stones; they lie in the same quarry, and are the same by nature as the rest of mankind, till dug out and separated from thence by the powerful and efficacious grace of God."
2. "They [saints] are lasting and durable, and will never perish, nor be removed out of the building: and because of that life which they derive from him [Christ], and have in him, they are called 'lively', or 'living stones.'"
3. "Now such [spiritual sacrifices] are acceptable to God by Jesus Christ; through whom they are offered up; for it is through him the saints have access to God, present themselves to him, and their services; and both persons and services are only accepted in Christ, and for his sake, and in virtue of his sacrifice, which is always of a sweet smelling savour to God."

### John Wesley:
1. "Believers... alive to God through him."
2. "Being spiritual yourselves, and an habitation of God through the Spirit."
3. "To offer up your souls and bodies, with all your thoughts, words, and actions, as spiritual sacrifices to God."
