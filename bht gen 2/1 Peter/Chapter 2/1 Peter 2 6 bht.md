# 1 Peter 2:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ is described as the chief corner stone, a foundation that not only strengthens the construction of the building but unites all believers, regardless of their background or location. Belief in Christ ensures that one will not be put to shame or be confounded in any way, as it is expressed in the words of Isaiah. Those who trust in Christ can have confidence before Him and will remain secure in their faith, even in the face of opposition or challenges. Ultimately, their person and state will be safe, bringing honor and glory to God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

2. "Behold, I place in Zion a chief corner-stone, chosen, had in honour...and he that believeth on Him shall not be ashamed."
3. "On ἀκρογωνιαῖον, see ref. Eph. note. Here, whatever may be the case there, can hardly be any idea of the ‘lapis summangularis’ joining the two walls, Jewish and Gentile, together, as some (e. g. Œc.) have thought."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Behold—calling attention to the glorious announcement of His eternal counsel."
2. "elect—so also believers"
3. "confounded—same Greek as in Romans 9:33, 'ashamed.' In Isaiah 28:16, 'make haste,' that is, flee in sudden panic, covered with the shame of confounded hopes."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "He is thus, then, a corner-stone, that he might be the rule of the building, as well as the only foundation."
3. "To be ashamed means the same thing. Peter has retained the real sense of the Prophet, though he has followed the Greek version."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The reason why they are to be built up into a spiritual house with the view to being a holy priesthood offering spiritual sacrifices, lies in its having been God’s will, as that is expressed in Scripture, to make Christ the foundation of His Church with that object."
2. "The corner-stone is that stone in the foundation on which the angle of the building rests, and which is all-important to the stability of the building and the coherence of its parts."
3. "The passage as it stands in Isaiah is set over against the Egyptian alliance which was sought at the time, and against the hurt and shame which are declared in the same connection to be destined for those who lean on Egypt instead of Jehovah."

2. "Peter and Paul make it 'the primary foundation stone at the structure' (W. W. Lloyd)."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ is here called a chief corner stone, as in Ephesians 2:20 because he not only adorns and strengthens the building, but unites the parts, and keeps them together, even all the saints, Jews or Gentiles, in all ages and places, whether in heaven or earth..."
2. "...he, as such, is chosen of God for that purpose, and is precious both to God and man..."
3. "...he shall have confidence before Christ, and not be ashamed at his coming; he shall be safe now, being laid on this stone; nor shall he be removed from it, or intimidated by any enemy, so as to flee from it; nor shall he make haste, as it is inIsaiah 28:16 to lay another foundation; and he shall be found upon this hereafter; so that his person and state will be safe, though many of his works may be burnt up."

### John Wesley:
1. He that believeth shall not be confounded — In time or in eternity. Isaiah 28:16.
