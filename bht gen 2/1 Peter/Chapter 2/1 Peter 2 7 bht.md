# 1 Peter 2:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ is the precious and essential cornerstone for believers, providing them with a firm foundation for their faith. Unbelievers, however, will ultimately recognize the significance of Christ, albeit to their own regret. This truth is reflected in the words of Scripture, particularly in Psalm 118:22, which emphasizes Christ as the rejected Stone who subsequently becomes the cornerstone, solidifying his role as the essential and central figure in God's plan.

1. "The phrase ‚Äòwho believe‚Äô is put last in the original (=for you, therefore, is the honour, for you, I say, who believe), because it is only on the ground of their faith (which is given not as a condition here, but as a fact) that the assurance is applied to them."
2. "Most interpreters now agree that the subject of the sentence is not Christ Himself, but what is called (in reference, that is, to the dignity expressed in the former sentence) ‚Äòthe honour,‚Äô i.e the honour already spoken of, and that the predicate is the ‚Äòfor you.‚Äô"
3. "The sentence takes up the whole idea, which has just been expressed, of an honour in which the foundation stands with God, and what that fact carries with it to believers."
