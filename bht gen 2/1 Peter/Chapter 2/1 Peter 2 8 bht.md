# 1 Peter 2:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The rejection of Christ becomes the means of ruin, as those who stumble over Him bring destruction upon themselves. Their refusal to build their lives on Him is like running into a solid cornerstone that leads to their own downfall. The rejection of Christ is a crime that God will judge, just as He did with the Jews who denied and crucified Him. This rejection was not by chance, but rather part of God's plan and the result of their disobedience. Christ becomes a stumbling block to those who oppose the Word of God and resist His message.
