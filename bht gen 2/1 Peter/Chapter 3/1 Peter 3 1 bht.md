# 1 Peter 3:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Wives are encouraged to submit to their husbands, focusing on their own husbands and the unique relationship they have. They have the ability to win over their husbands through their Christian behavior, without using words. This silent persuasion can have a powerful impact, leading to their husbands being converted and drawn to Jesus Christ. Lives transformed by the influence of a devoted wife can bring about the gain of souls to the kingdom of Christ, making the loss to Satan.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Wives, in subjection to your own husbands, that even if any are disobedient to the word, they shall be won without word."
2. "A soul converted is gained to itself, gained to the pastor, or friend, or wife, or husband who sought it, and gained to Jesus Christ."
3. "They shall be won without word, by your Christian behaviour."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Every time that obedience is enjoined upon women to their husbands, the Greek, 'idios,' 'one's own peculiarly,' is used, while the wives of men are designated only by heauton, 'of themselves.'"
2. "Feeling the need of leaning on one stronger than herself, the wife (especially if joined to an unbeliever) might be tempted, though only spiritually, to enter into that relation with another in which she ought to stand to 'her own spouse.'"
3. "'Unspoken acting is more powerful than unperformed speaking [...] A soul converted is gained to itself, to the pastor, wife, or husband, who sought it, and to Jesus Christ; added to His treasury who thought not His own precious blood too dear to lay out for this gain.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If any wives have husbands who are not true Christians... there might be hope still that they would be converted by the Christian influence of a wife at home."
2. "They also may without the word be won... by another influence than preaching."
3. "The habitual deportment of the wife was to be such as to show the reality and power of religion; to show that it had such influence on her temper, her words, her whole deportment, as to demonstrate that it was from God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Peter means in like manner with servants (ch. 2 18)."
2. "The word used by Christ, Matthew 18:15: 'gained thy brother.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "He expressly reminds them of their duty, and brings forward a particular reason why they ought the more carefully to obey, even that they might by their probity allure their husbands to the faith."
2. "Peter’s words are not to be so understood as though a holy life alone could lead the unbelieving to Christ, but that it softens and pacifies their minds, so that they might have less dislike to religion."
3. "Then Peter shews that wives by a holy and pious life could do so much as to prepare their husbands, without speaking to them on religion, to embrace the faith of Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The fact that in the decadence of the language the adjective lost much of its original force, makes it doubtful how much emphasis can be allowed it here. It may point, however, to the nature of the marriage relation, the legal claims, the peculiar and exclusive union which it involved, as furnishing a reason for submission."
2. "The case supposed is expressed as an exceptional and trying one."
3. "The idea, therefore, is that, even in those most unpromising cases where the heathen husband steeled himself against the power of God’s own Word, the Christian wife might haply win him over to Christianity by the silent persuasion of a blameless life, without word of hers."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Wives are not enjoined to be in subjection to the husbands of other women, as some think it fine to be."
2. "That they be gained... as in Matthew 18:15."
3. "Won by pious living, not by nagging."

### John Gill:
1. "Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands....but what is suitable to the relation they stand in to their husbands." 
2. "the hearts of such as were averse to Christianity, and the Gospel, as unbelieving husbands, may be so softened, and wrought upon, as to entertain a better opinion of it, and in process of time be inclined to hear and attend it."
3. "as every soul that is delivered from the power of darkness, and is translated into the kingdom of Christ, is a loss to Satan, it is a gain to Christ, and to his church."

### John Wesley:
1. If any — He speaks tenderly.Won — Gained over to Christ.
