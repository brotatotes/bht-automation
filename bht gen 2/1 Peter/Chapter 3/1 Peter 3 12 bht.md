# 1 Peter 3:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Lord's watchful eye is constantly fixed upon the righteous, bringing them immeasurable goodness and protection. Their prayers do not go unheard; instead, the Lord inclines His ears to their pleas, ready to respond. Conversely, those who engage in wicked deeds face the penetrating gaze of the Lord's disapproval. His face turns against them, casting them away from His presence and exposing them to the consequences of their evil actions.
