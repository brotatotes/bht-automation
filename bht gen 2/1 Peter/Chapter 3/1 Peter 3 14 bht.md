# 1 Peter 3:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Even if you should endure suffering for standing up for Christ and the Gospel, it is not a disadvantage, but rather a benefit to you. Don't be afraid of the fear that the ungodly world has. Instead, take comfort in the fact that the Spirit of God and glory rests upon you, and know that you have been delivered by Christ from the power of the present evil world and every enemy.
