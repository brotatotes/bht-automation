# 1 Peter 3:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To live a life pleasing to God, we must sanctify the Lord God in our hearts, honoring Him as holy and trusting in His providence. When asked about our hope, we should be prepared to give a gentle and respectful defense, bolstered by our unwavering faith in God. This defense should be offered in meekness, avoiding anger or hostility. Our hope lies in the promise of eternal life and the truth of the Gospel, which we should confidently and graciously proclaim to others. By sanctifying Christ as Lord, we can overcome the fear of man and live boldly for Him.
