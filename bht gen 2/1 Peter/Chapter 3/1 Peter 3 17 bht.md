# 1 Peter 3:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Patiently enduring suffering can be a powerful testament to one's faith and a reflection of Christ's example. When we suffer for doing good, it is an opportunity to demonstrate our true Christianity, even if it seems undeserved. These trials, ordered by the will of God, serve a greater purpose and can result in the growth of our character and a deepening of our relationship with Him. We must trust in His divine will and seek comfort in the knowledge that our suffering is not in vain.
