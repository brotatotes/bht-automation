# 1 Peter 3:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By the Spirit, Christ preached through Noah to the disobedient generation who were then alive. These spirits, the wicked men before the flood, were imprisoned by God's justice until the day of judgment. This reminds us that Christ has always existed and even before becoming incarnate, he fulfilled his prophetic role in the Old Testament. It also emphasizes that the Gospel has been preached since ancient times, including to those who lived before Abraham. Those who reject the message of salvation still face the same impending judgment.

3. "to the spirits in prison (the disembodied spirits, which were kept shut up (Jude 1:6; 2Pe 2:4) in the place of the departed awaiting the final judgment: in Scheol, as Syr.)"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The same 'Spirit' which was efficacious in restoring him to life, after he was put to death, was that by which he preached to the spirits in prison."
2. "The word used here (ἐκήρυξεν ekēruxen) is of a general character, meaning to make a proclamation of any kind, as a crier does, or to deliver a message."
3. "The obvious sense is, that Peter supposed there were 'spirits in prison' at the time when he wrote, and that to those same spirits the Son of God had at some time 'preached,' or had made some proclamation respecting the will of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "By which [εν ω]. Wrong. Rev., correctly, in which: in the spiritual form of life; in the disembodied spirit." 
2. "To the spirits [πνευμασιν] . As in Hebrews 12:23, of disembodied spirits, though the word yucai, souls, is used elsewhere (Revelation 6:9; Revelation 20:4)." 
3. "In prison [εν φυλακη]. Authorities differ, some explaining by 2 Peter 2:4; Jude 1:6; Revelation 20:7, as the final abode of the lost."

### John Calvin:
1. "He then says, that Christ did not rise only for himself, but that he made known to others the same power of his Spirit, so that it penetrated to the dead."
2. "Hence there is no reason to fear that it will not flow to us."
3. "It seems to me that φυλακὴ rather means a watchtower in which watchmen stand for the purpose of watching, or the very act of watching, for it is often so taken by Greek authors; and the meaning would be very appropriate, that godly souls were watching in hope of the salvation promised them, as though they saw it afar off."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The verb ‘preached’ is used absolutely here. It is not to be taken, however, in the vague sense of making proclamation, showing Himself, or bearing witness to Himself, far less in the sense of preaching judgment, but in the sense which it elsewhere has in the New Testament, where it occurs, both with the object expressed (e.g. the gospel, the kingdom of God, Christ, etc.), and with the object unexpressed (e.g. Matthew 11:1; Mark 1:38, etc.), of Christ’s earthly ministry of preaching, which was a message of grace."
2. "The word ‘spirits’ is used here, as in Hebrews 12:23, in the sense of disembodied spirits."
3. "The phrase ‘in prison’ has the definite force which it has in 2 Peter 2:4, Jude 1:6, Revelation 20:7, and is not to be explained away as merely equivalent to ‘in safe-keeping,’ or ‘in the world of the dead’ generally."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The language is plain enough except that it does not make it clear whether Jesus did the preaching to spirits in prison at the time or to people whose spirits are now in prison, the point of doubt already discussed."
2. "The metaphorical use of εν φυλακη can be illustrated by 2 Peter 2:4; Judges 1:6; Revelation 20:7 (the final abode of the lost)."
3. "The words mean personal action by Christ 'in spirit' as illustration of his 'quickening' (verse 1 Peter 3:18) whether done before his death or afterwards."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ, by his Spirit, by which he was quickened, went in the ministry of Noah, the preacher of righteousness, and preached both by words and deeds, by the personal ministry of Noah, and by the building of the ark, to that generation who was then in being."
2. "Christ neither went into this prison, nor preached in it, nor to spirits that were then in it when he preached, but to persons alive in the days of Noah, and who being disobedient, when they died, their separate souls were put into prison, and there they were when the apostle wrote."
3. "From hence we learn, that Christ was, that he existed in his divine nature before he was incarnate, he was before Abraham, he was in the days of Noah; and that Christ also, under the Old Testament, acted the part of a Mediator, in his divine nature, and by his Spirit discharged that branch of it, his prophetic office, before he appeared in human nature; and that the Gospel was preached in those early times, as unto Abraham, so before him."

### John Wesley:
1. "By which Spirit he preached - Through the ministry of Noah."
2. "To the spirits in prison — The unholy men before the flood, who were then reserved by the justice of God, as in a prison, till he executed the sentence upon them all."
3. "And are now also reserved to the judgment of the great day."
