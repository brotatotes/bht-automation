# 1 Peter 3:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Your chaste behavior should be marked by modesty, purity, and a sincere reverence for your husbands. Let your conduct be free from impurity and focused on pleasing them, not just in terms of physical fidelity, but also in showing them respect and honor. This fear or reverence should extend to both your husbands and to God, as it is through your conduct that others will form their opinion of Christianity.
