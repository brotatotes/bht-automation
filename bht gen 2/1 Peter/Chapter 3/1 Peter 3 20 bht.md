# 1 Peter 3:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Noah warned the people of his time about the impending flood and the judgment of God, yet they continued in their disobedience and disbelief. The ark that Noah built was a symbol of salvation through faith in Christ, just as those who entered the ark were saved. This serves as a reminder that God often bears patiently with the ungodly, providing them with an opportunity to turn from their wickedness before judgment comes. Noah's warning and the subsequent flood highlight the importance of repentance and heeding the call to escape the wrath to come.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The water is in the Apostle’s view the medium of saving, inasmuch as it bore up the ark."
2. "The fact merely is stated. The statement of the fact, however, has been felt to be accompanied by such great difficulties."
3. "It is not purgatory, it is not universal restitution; but it is one which throws blessed light on one of the darkest enigmas of the divine justice: the cases where the final doom seems infinitely out of proportion to the lapse which has incurred it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Noah's days are selected, as the ark and the destroying flood answer respectively to 'baptism' and the coming destruction of unbelievers by fire."
2. "A long period of God's 'long-suffering and waiting,' as Noah had few to help him, which rendered the world's unbelief the more inexcusable."
3. "The same water which drowned the unbelieving, buoyed up the ark in which the eight were saved."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To say that people were formerly rebellious, or rebellious in a specified age, is no evidence that they are otherwise now."
2. "God waited on that guilty race for 120 years, a period sufficiently protracted to evince his long-suffering toward one generation."
3. "They were borne up by the waters, and were thus preserved. The thought on which the apostle makes his remarks turn, and which leads him in the next verse to the suggestions about baptism, is, that water was employed in their preservation, or that they owed their safety, in an important sense, to that element."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In which they were gathered, and in which they were saved."
2. "By passing through the water, or being brought safely through the water into the ark."
3. "They were brought safely through water."

### John Calvin:
1. "I understand him otherwise, that then the true servants of God were mixed together with the unbelieving, and were almost hidden on account of their number."
2. "For he meets, as I think, a doubt, which might have harassed the faithful of that day... and he chose an example the most remarkable in antiquity, even that of the world drowned by the deluge; for then in the common ruin of mankind, the family of Noah alone escaped."
3. "This ought to be applied to the ungodly, whom God’s patience rendered more slothful; for when God deferred his vengeance and did not immediately execute it, the ungodly boldly disregarded all threatenings; but Noah, on the contrary, being warned by God, had the deluge for a long time before his eyes. Hence his assiduity in building the ark; for being terrified by God’s judgment, he shook off all torpidity."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The clause may describe the ‘spirits’ according to the conduct which made them spirits ‘in prison.’ So it is understood by most." 
2. "The ‘waiting’ is given in the imperfect tense to bring out its lengthened continuance. It is expressed, too, by a verb for which Paul has a particular fondness, and which conveys the idea of the  intenseness  or  patience  of the waiting." 
3. "The mention of the precise number saved serves to throw into still stronger light both the disobedience to which the long-suffering of God addressed itself, and the grace that failed not to separate the believing few."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "These spirits now in prison once upon a time were disobedient." (απειθησασιν ποτε).
2. "A hundred years apparently after the warning Noah was preparing the ark and Noah as a preacher of righteousness forewarned the people, who disregarded it."
3. "They came through the water in the ark and so were saved by the water in spite of the flood around them."

### John Gill:
1. "They continued in their profaneness and impiety, and to corrupt their ways, and fill the earth with violence and wickedness; not believing what they were threatened with, or that ever a flood would come upon them, and destroy them."
2. "The ark was a type of Christ, into whom whoever enters by faith, or in whom whoever believes, shall be saved; but as they that entered into the ark were but few, so are those that enter in at the strait gate, or believe in Christ."
3. "This instance of the dispensation of the providence of God to the old world is very appropriately... God's usual method has been to afford the outward means to ungodly men, and to bear with them long, and then bring down his vengeance upon them, and save his own people."

### John Wesley:
1. "When the longsuffering of God waited ... Noah warned them all to flee from the wrath to come."
