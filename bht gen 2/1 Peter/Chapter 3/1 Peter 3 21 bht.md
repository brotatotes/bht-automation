# 1 Peter 3:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through baptism, we are saved from the overwhelming flood of sin in the world, just as Noah was saved through the ark. It is important to note that baptism is not simply an outward sign, but a source of inward grace. Through baptism, we gain a divine consciousness that our lives and actions are accepted through the sacrifice and resurrection of Jesus.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Water saves in both cases. It saved them, becoming to them a means of floating their ark and bearing them harmless: it saves us, becoming to us baptism: and that baptism not material, but spiritual."
2. "not putting away of the filth of the flesh, but enquiry of a good conscience after God."
3. "by means of the resurrection of Jesus Christ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Water saved Noah not of itself, but by sustaining the ark built in faith, resting on God's word: it was to him the sign and mean of a kind of regeneration, of the earth."
2. "The flood was for Noah a baptism, as the passage through the Red Sea was for the Israelites; by baptism in the flood he and his family were transferred from the old world to the new."
3. "Not the putting away of the filth of the flesh" but of the soul. It is the ark (Christ and His Spirit-filled Church), not the water, which is the instrument of salvation: the water only flowed round the ark so not the mere water baptism, but the water when accompanied with the Spirit."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The sense is, that as Noah was saved by water, so there is a sense in which water is made instrumental in our salvation. [...] Baptism, including all that is properly meant by baptism as a religious rite [...] now saves us."
2. "The water saved Noah and his family from perishing in the flood; to wit, by bearing up the ark. Baptism, in the proper sense of the term, as above explained, where the water used is a symbol, in like manner now saves us; that is, the water is an emblem of that purifying by which we are saved."
3. "The apostle saw a resemblance in some respects between the one and the other; such a resemblance that the one naturally suggested the other to his mind, and the resemblance was so important as to make it the proper ground of remark."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word occurs only once elsewhere, Hebrews 9:24: 'the figures of the true.'" 
2. "The meaning here is much disputed, and can hardly be settled satisfactorily. The rendering answer has no warrant. The meaning seems to be (as Alford), 'the seeking after God of a good and pure conscience, which is the aim and end of the Christian baptismal life.'"
3. "To these questions the triune Jehovah answers in baptism, 'Yea!' Now is laid the solid foundation for a good conscience. The conscience is not only purified from its guilt, but it receives new vital power by means of the resurrection of Jesus Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "Noah, saved by water, had a sort of baptism. And this the Apostle mentions, that the likeness between him and us might appear more evident."
2. "Our baptism is an antitype (ἀντίτυπον) to the baptism of Noah... the Apostle only means that there is a likeness, and as they commonly say, a correspondence."
3. "Not the putting away of the filth of the flesh... that the external symbol is not sufficient, except baptism be received really and effectually: and the reality of it will be found only in a few."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The comparison, therefore, is not between the Flood and Baptism, but simply between water in one service and water in another."
2. "The saving efficacy is not of a material kind like that exerted by water in the case of the Ark and its eight... these two terms ‘putting off’ and ‘filth’ are peculiar to Peter."
3. "What Peter intends seems to be to explain that, when he speaks of baptism as having a saving efficacy, he does not mean a mere ceremonial washing, but one which carries a moral value with it."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Water in baptism now as an anti-type of Noah's deliverance by water."
2. "Baptism, Peter explains, does not wash away the filth of the flesh either in a literal sense, as a bath for the body, or in a metaphorical sense of the filth of the soul."
3. "Thus taken, it matters little whether εις θεον (toward God) be taken with επερωτημα or συνειδησεως."

### John Gill:
1. "The ark, and deliverance by it, as it was a type of Christ, and salvation by him, so it was a figure of baptism, and baptism was the antitype of that."
2. "Baptism saves not as a cause, for it has no causal influence on, nor is it essential to salvation. Christ only is the cause and author of eternal salvation."
3. "Baptism is a means of leading the faith of the baptized person, as to the blood of Christ, for pardon and cleansing, so to the resurrection of Christ, to justification."

### John Wesley:
1. "The thing typified by the ark, even baptism, now saveth us - Through the water of baptism we are saved from the sin which overwhelms the world as a flood." 
2. "Not the bare outward sign, but the inward grace; a divine consciousness that both our persons and our actions are accepted through him who died and rose again for us."
