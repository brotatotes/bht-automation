# 1 Peter 3:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Wives should not put all their focus and effort into external adornment such as extravagant hairstyles, expensive jewelry, or lavish clothing. Instead, they should prioritize inner qualities and virtues. The admonition is not against all forms of adornment, but rather against excessive vanity and the pursuit of material splendor. Christians should avoid indulging in these worldly displays and instead cultivate the beauty of a humble and virtuous heart.

### Henry Alford:
1. "Of whom (the wives; you, who are addressed) let the adornment be much better, not the outward adornment of braiding of hair and putting round of golden ornaments or of putting on of dresses."
2. "The sex which began first our engagement to the necessity of clothing, having still a peculiar propensity to be curious in that, to improve the necessity to an advantage."
3. "The three verbal substantives, as Bengel, 'innuunt operam comendi multa tempora absumentem'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The true notion of ornament or adorning is that which will make any person or thing appear well, or beautiful, to others."
2. "Let not this be the main or principal thing; let not her heart be set on this... Religion promotes neatness, and cleanliness, and a proper attention to our external appearance according to our circumstances in life, as certainly as it does to the internal virtue of the soul."
3. "We are to dress decently, and in the manner that will attract least attention, and we are to show that our hearts are interested supremely in more important things than in outward adorning."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Roman women of the day were addicted to ridiculous extravagance in the adornment of the hair."
2. "The attendants will vote on the dressing of the hair as if a question of reputation or of life were at stake, so great is the trouble she takes in quest of beauty."
3. "Female extravagance in dress in the days of the empire reached an alarming pitch."

### John Calvin:
1. "Wives are to adorn themselves sparingly and modestly...Peter does not without cause seek to correct in them this vanity."
2. "Peter did not intend to condemn every sort of ornament, but the evil of vanity, to which women are subject."
3. "What decency requires is moderation and modesty...They whose minds are purified from all vanity, will duly order all things, so as not to exceed moderation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The adornment which wives are to value is not that which is effected by the particular acts of plaiting or braiding the hair, wearing of gold, or putting on of apparel."
2. "The arts themselves had gone to unheard of excess, as we learn from literature, coins, and sculpture, among the heathen ladies of the Empire."
3. "Not only that many of the first Christian converts were women, but that not a few were women of means and position."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Whose adorning (ων κοσμος). Genitive plural of the relative referring to γυναικων (wives). Κοσμος has here its old meaning of ornament (cf. our cosmetics), not the common one of world (John 17:5) considered as an orderly whole."
2. "Not the outward adorning of plaiting the hair (ουχ ο εξωθεν εμπλοκης τριχων). The use of ουχ here rather than μη (usual negative with the imperative) because of the sharp contrast in verse 1 Peter 3:4 (αλλ'). The old adverb εξωθεν (from without) is in the attributive position like an adjective."
3. "Peter is not forbidding the wearing of clothes and ornaments by women, but the display of finery by contrast. Cf. 1 Timothy 2:9-13; Isaiah 3:16."

1. "Let not that be solely or chiefly attended to, nor anxiously sought after, nor ever in order to allure and ensnare others, or to fill with pride and vanity."

2. "The apostle means such apparel as is unbecoming and unsuitable, for he cannot be thought to forbid the putting on of any apparel."

3. "Women should not so much regard, and be so intent upon the outward adorning of their bodies, with any sort of clothing, and especially such as does not become them, as the inward adorning of their minds."

### John Wesley:
1. "Three things are here expressly forbidden: curling the hair, wearing gold, (by way of ornament,) and putting on costly or gay apparel."
2. "These, therefore, ought never to be allowed, much less defended, by Christians."
