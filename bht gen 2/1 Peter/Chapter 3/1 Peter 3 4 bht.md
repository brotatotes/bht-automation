# 1 Peter 3:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The hidden man of the heart, which implies a meek and quiet spirit, is the complete inward holiness that adorns the soul. A meek spirit willingly avoids causing trouble, while a quiet spirit patiently bears all wrongs without being troubled. It is important to remember that excessive adornment can often lead to pride and anger, more than we realize.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is not, as in ref. Rom., merely the inner man as distinguished from the outer man, which unbelievers have as well as believers: and that for this reason, that the κρυπτὸς ἄνθρωπος is not here that which is to be adorned, but is itself the adornment."
2. "The incorruptible ornament of the meek and quiet spirit ('mansuetus, qui non turbat: tranquillus, qui turbas aliorum fert placide. Ad illud refer 1Pe 3:5 fin.: ad hoc, 1Pe 3:6 fin.' Bengel) which is in the sight of God ('qui interna, non externa spectat,' Bengel) of great price."
3. "And this is designated as being τῆς καρδίας, a gen. of apposition, consisting in the heart, changed, and lovely with Christian affections and graces), in (standing in, as its condition and element. No art. is needed before ἐν, because this clause is further descriptive, not of ἄνθρωπος, but of κόσμος."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Singularity mostly comes from pride and throws needless hindrances to religion in the way of others."
2. "Great is he who uses his earthenware as if it were plate not less great is he who uses his silver as if it were earthenware."
3. "Meek in affections and feelings; quiet in words, countenance, and actions."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'hidden' here means that which is concealed; that which is not made apparent by the dress, or by ornament."
2. "Whatever pertains to outward decoration, however beautiful and costly, is fading; but that which pertains to the soul is enduring."
3. "A wife, therefore, if she would permanently please her husband, should seek the adorning of the soul rather than the body; the ornament of the heart rather than gold and jewels."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Meek [πραεος] . See on Matthew 5:5. Of great price [πολυτελες] . The word used to describe costly raiment, 1 Timothy 2:9.

### John Calvin:
1. "The word heart, no doubt means the whole soul. He at the same time shews in what consists the spiritual adorning of women, even in the incorruptness of a meek and quiet spirit... Peter means that the ornament of the soul is not like a fading flower, nor consists in vanishing splendor, but is incorruptible." 
2. "By mentioning quiet and a tranquil spirit, he marks out what especially belongs to women; for nothing becomes them more than a placid and a sedate temper of mind... nothing is more fitted to correct the vanity of which Peter speaks than a placid quietness of spirit."
3. "But Peter, on the contrary, bids them to be more anxious for what is before God of a great price... to be more concerned with what is valuable in the sight of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The contrast here being between those external accessories of ornamentation on which it is vain to depend for power of attraction or persuasion, and those inner qualities of character which are the secret of all permanent, personal influence."
2. "The inner personality of moral beauty which makes the wife’s true adorning, which belongs to the heart and cannot be seen by the outer eye..."
3. "The quality of meekness implies more than gentleness. In the old Greek ethics it amounts only to mildness, in the sense of the opposite of roughness and violence...In the New Testament it is not mere equanimity, but the grace of a positive denial of self which holds disputings alien to it, and curbs the tendency of nature to passion, resistance, and resentment."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "See Paul's use of ανθρωπος for the outer and old, the inner and new man."
2. "For αφθαρτος see 1 Peter 1:4; 1 Peter 1:23. For πραυς see Matthew 5:5; Matthew 11:29."
3. "Πνευμα (spirit) is here disposition or temper (Bigg), unlike any other use in the N.T."

### John Gill:
1. "By which is meant internal grace; which gives a beauty and ornament to the soul."
2. "It is called spirit, seed, the root of the matter, and oil in the vessels."
3. "This grace of meekness, humility, and quietness, is a fruit of the Spirit, and so a part of the hidden man, and is what is very ornamental to a believer."

### John Wesley:
1. "The hidden man of the heart - Complete inward holiness, which implies a meek and quiet spirit."
2. "A meek spirit gives no trouble willingly to any: a quiet spirit bears all wrongs without being troubled."
3. "All superfluity of dress contributes more to pride and anger than is generally supposed."
