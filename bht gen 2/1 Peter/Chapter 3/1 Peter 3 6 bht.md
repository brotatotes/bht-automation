# 1 Peter 3:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As children of God, we are called to obey and submit to the authority of our husbands, following the example of Sarah. Just as Sarah obeyed Abraham and called him lord, we should willingly submit and respect our husbands. However, our obedience should not be motivated by fear, but by a desire to do what is right in the sight of God. By doing so, we show ourselves to be worthy of the legacy of faith passed down to us from Sarah, as we fulfill our roles within the family unit. (Genesis 18:12)
