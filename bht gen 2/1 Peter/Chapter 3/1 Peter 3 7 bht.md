## BHT:
Husbands are called to live in harmony with their wives, understanding their natural weaknesses and treating them with tenderness and respect.

In doing so, their prayers will not be hindered, enabling them to experience an unhindered connection with God.

2. "Both [the man and the wife] being God's instruments in His beneficent work of the multiplication of mankind."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Both husband and wife are vessels in God's hand, and of God's making, to fulfil His gracious purposes. Both weak, the woman the weaker. The sense of his own weakness, and that she, like himself, is God's vessel and fabric, ought to lead him to act with tender and wise consideration towards her who is the weaker fabric), giving (literally, 'assigning,' 'apportioning') honor as being also (besides being man and wife) heirs together."
2. "The reason why the man should give honor to the woman is, because God gives honor to both as fellow heirs; compare the same argument, 1 Peter 3:7."
3. "He does not take into account the case of an unbelieving wife, as she might yet believe."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "The reasons assigned for doing this seem to imply it. As unto the weaker vessel - It is not uncommon in the Scriptures to compare the body to a vessel...by which the soul accomplishes its purposes, or is the helper of the soul."
3. "This passage contains a very important truth in regard to the female sex. Under every other system of religion but the Christian system, woman has been regarded as in every way inferior to man. Christianity teaches that, in respect to her higher interests, the interests of religion, she is every way his equal. She is entitled to all the hopes and promises which religion imparts."

### Marvin Vincent:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There is a submission which husbands, notwithstanding that the man is the head of the woman, have to yield, not less than wives, to the idea and object of the married state as one form of the 'every ordinance of man.'"
2. "If the home life is to be regulated so as to be 'according to knowledge,' there must be a considerate recognition of the natural weakness of the woman, and a readiness to give her the honourable regard which is due to her as the husband’s associate in life and in grace."
3. "The recognition of another as having the same place as ourselves in God’s offer of grace, above all if that other has the sacred name of wife, should teach us to yield the honour which has been enjoined."
