# 1 Peter 3:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Finally, let there be unity of mind, sympathizing and loving one another, showing compassion and humility. This unity of mind refers to having the same thoughts and feelings, especially in regard to the Gospel. In addition to this, we are called to have genuine compassion for our fellow believers, being there for them in both good times and bad. We should also extend this compassion to those who are suffering, showing mercy and providing help. Finally, we are to be courteous, treating everyone with respect and kindness. Let us truly embrace these qualities in our relationships with others.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Finally, all being of one mind, sympathising, loving the brethren, compassionate, humble-minded."
2. "The meaning is not confined to cases of sorrow: the χαίρειν μετὰ χαιρόντων is also included."
3. "Humility being essential both to true gentleness of love and to true patience under injuries."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Having compassion one of another—Greek, 'sympathizing' in the joy and sorrow of others."
2. "Courteous—genuine Christian politeness; not the tinsel of the world's politeness; stamped with unfeigned love on one side, and humility on the other."
3. "But the oldest manuscripts read, 'humble-minded.' It is slightly different from 'humble,' in that it marks a conscious effort to be truly humble."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Be ye all of one mind - See the notes at Romans 12:16. The word used here (ὁμόφρων homophrōn) does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. It means, of the same mind; like-minded; and the object is to secure harmony in their views and feelings."
2. "Having compassion one of another - 'Sympathizing,' (συμπαθεῖς sumpatheis;) entering into one another’s feelings, and evincing a regard for each other’s welfare."
3. "Be pitiful - The word used here (εὔσπλαγχνος eusplangchnos) occurs nowhere else in the New Testament, except in Ephesians 4:32, where it is rendered 'tender-hearted.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Indicating unity of thought and feeling."
2. "Interchange of fellow - feeling in joy or sorrow."
3. "Tender - hearted. From eu, well, and splagcna, the nobler entrails, which are regarded as the seat of the affections, and hence equivalent to our popular use of heart."

### John Calvin:
1. "Sympathy (συμπάθεια) extends to all our faculties, when concord exists between us; so that every one condoles with us in adversity as well as rejoices with us in prosperity, so that every one not only cares for himself, but also regards the benefit of others."
2. "Be pitiful, or merciful, which is added, means that we are not only to help our brethren and relieve their miseries, but also to bear with their infirmities."
3. "Wisely then does Peter bid us to be humble-minded (ταπεινόφρονες,) lest pride and haughtiness should lead us to despise our neighbors."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "What Peter sets in the forefront of this summary of universal Christian duties is that oneness of judgment and inclination on which Paul so often touches."
2. "It denotes oneness in feeling, and covers Paul’s ‘rejoice with them that do rejoice,’ as well as his ‘weep with them that weep.’"
3. "Lowliness of mind in the classical Ethics ranked not as a virtue, but as a fault or infirmity, that of meanness of spirit or faint-heartedness. The adjective which Peter uses has even in Plutarch’s writings an unfavourable sense. In Christianity it becomes a grace, contrasted with the heathen virtue of ‘high-mindedness,’ and born of the sense of unworthiness."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Likeminded (ομοφρονες). Old compound (ομοσ, φρην), here only in N.T." 
2. "Our 'sympathetic' in original sense." 
3. "Humble minded (ταπεινοφρονες). Late compound (ταπεινοσ, φρην), in Plutarch, Proverbs 29:23, here only in N.T."

3. "be pitiful"; to those that are in distress; put on bowels of mercy, and relieve and succour them... "be courteous"; gentle and affable, carrying it friendly to one another...

### John Wesley:
1. "Sympathizing — Rejoicing and sorrowing together. Love all believers as brethren."
2. "Be pitiful - Toward the afflicted."
3. "Be courteous — To all men. Courtesy is such a behaviour toward equals and inferiors as shows respect mixed with love."
