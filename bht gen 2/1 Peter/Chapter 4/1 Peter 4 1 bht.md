# 1 Peter 4:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We are encouraged to follow the example of Christ, who suffered indignities, reproaches, and persecutions for our sake. By arming ourselves with the same mindset, we can bear all afflictions and persecutions willingly and cheerfully, with meekness and patience, just as He did. This mindset serves as an armor of protection against our enemies and enables us to be delivered from sin, living a life of righteousness.
