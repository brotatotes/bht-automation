# 1 Peter 4:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do not be alarmed or astonished by the trials and sufferings that you are experiencing, for they are not strange or unexpected for believers. Just as metals are tested and refined through fire, so too are you being tested through various afflictions. These trials are not a coincidence, but are allowed by the wisdom of God for the purpose of testing and purifying your faith. Therefore, do not be surprised or discouraged, but instead, stand firm in your faith, knowing that these trials are meant to strengthen and manifest the life of Christ in you.
