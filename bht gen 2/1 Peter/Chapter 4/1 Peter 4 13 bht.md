# 1 Peter 4:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Suffering for the sake of Christ may seem difficult, but it is a reason to rejoice. By sharing in Christ's sufferings, we are reminded that our trials are not in vain. We can take comfort in knowing that as we endure suffering, we are partaking in the fellowship of Christ and will ultimately be glorified with Him. Our present sufferings serve as a reminder of the future unveiling of Christ's glory, which will bring about an exultant, abundant joy that far surpasses anything we experience in this life.
