# 1 Peter 4:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers who suffer for the sake of Christ are blessed, despite the reproaches and vilification they endure. This suffering should be on account of Christ, not for any wrongdoing. The Spirit of glory and of God rests upon those who are reproached for the name of Christ, bringing them comfort, strength, and the honor of glorifying Christ in the midst of their suffering. Such suffering is a part of their Christian journey, but they can find joy and peace knowing that God's Spirit is with them.
