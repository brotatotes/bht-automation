# 1 Peter 4:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christians are urged not to bring upon themselves sufferings due to their own wrongdoing, but rather to endure only for their faith in Christ. They should abstain from immoral actions such as murder and theft, which would bring about justified punishments according to God's law. It is important for believers to live in a way that is honorable and reflects the virtues of their Christian identity, avoiding any involvement in unrighteous actions or interfering in the affairs of others.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In the name of Christ, I say: for let no one of you suffer (reproach or persecution: suffer in any way) as (being) a murderer, or a malefactor, or as a prier into other men’s matters." 
2. "The word probably alludes to the ἐπίσκοπος of the church, combining it with ἀλλοτριο -, to show the incongruity."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Reproached in the name of Christ" - FOR let none.
2. Christians, from mistaken zeal, under the plea of faithfulness, might readily step out of their own calling and make themselves judges of the acts of unbelievers.
3. Literally, "a bishop in what is (not his own, but) another's" province - an allusion to the existing bishops or overseers of the Church; a self-constituted bishop in others' concerns.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They were to be careful that their sufferings were brought upon them only in consequence of their religion, and not because any crime could be laid to their charge."
2. "If even such charges were brought against them, there should be no pretext furnished for them by their lives."
3. "One who busies himself with what does not concern him; that is, one who pries into the affairs of another; who attempts to control or direct them as if they were his own."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A busybody in other men's matters [αλλοτριοεπισκοπος]. One who usurps authority in matters not within his province."
2. "Revolves around the officious interference of Christians in the affairs of their Gentile neighbors, through excess of zeal to conform them to the Christian standard."

### John Calvin:
1. "It behoved Christians to deserve well of all, even when they were badly and cruelly treated by the world."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is as if it had run thus ‘It is of reproach  in the name of Christ, and of that only, that I speak; for let no one suppose that he can suffer with just cause as an evil-doer, and yet have the blessedness that I affirm.'" 
2. "The word is one which is found nowhere else in the New Testament. There seems, indeed, to be no other independent occurrence of it in the whole range of Greek literature."
3. "The term points, therefore, to an offence, which came as close to the peculiar temptations of Christians, as the other three forms of evil seemed to lie at a distance from them."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Let no one of you suffer." Prohibition with μη and present active imperative.
2. "Two specific crimes (murderer, thief) and one general phrase (κακοποιος, evildoer, 1 Peter 2:12; 1 Peter 2:14), and one unusual term αλλοτριεπισχοπος (a meddler in other men's matters)."
3. "The idea is apparently one who spies out the affairs of other men."

### John Gill:
