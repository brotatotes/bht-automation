# 1 Peter 4:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers should not be ashamed when they suffer as Christians, for it is an honorable thing. In the early days of the Church, Christians were called by various names, but the term Christian emerged as a milestone in the Church's development. It is important to remember that the honor for bearing this name belongs to God, who counts believers worthy of such an honor and exempts them from judgment. Those who suffer reproach for the Gospel should not only endure it, but also take pride in the fact that they suffer for what is right.
