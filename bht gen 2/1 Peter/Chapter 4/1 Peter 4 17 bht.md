# 1 Peter 4:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The time has arrived for the judgment to commence its work within the church, as it is right for God to start with His own household. This judgment is not meant to punish the believers but to refine them through afflictions and persecution, which are loving corrections from God. However, for those who reject the gospel and disobey God, their end will be one of extreme severity and eternal destruction. The righteous, having already endured their share of suffering, will bear witness to the misery brought upon the wicked.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is the season of the judgment, beginning at the house of God."
2. "If first it begin at us, what will be the end of them that disobey the gospel of God?"
3. "Judicium, initio tolerabilius, sensim ingravescit. Pii sua parte perfuncti cum immunitate spectant miserias impiorum: impii dum pios affligunt, suam mensuram implent et discunt quae sua ipsorum portio futura sit: sed id melius sciunt pii, quare patientes sunt."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Another ground of consolation to Christians. All must pass under the judgment of God; God's own household first, their chastisement being here, for which they should glorify Him as a proof of their membership in His family, and a pledge of their escape from the end of those whom the last judgment shall find disobedient to the Gospel."
2. "judgment must begin at the house of God—the Church of living believers. Peter has in mind Ezekiel 9:6; compare Amos 3:2; Jeremiah 25:29. Judgment is already begun, the Gospel word, as a 'two-edged sword,' having the double effect of saving some and condemning others, and shall be consummated at the last judgment."
3. "if . . . at us, what shall the end be of them, &c.—If even the godly have chastening judgments now, how much more shall the ungodly be doomed to damnatory judgments at last."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There is reason to think that this trial will now occur, and there is a propriety that it should be made."
2. "The reference is, doubtless, to some fearful calamity which would primarily fall on the 'house of God;' that is, to some form of persecution which was to be let loose upon the church."
3. "If God brings such trials upon us who have obeyed his gospel, what have we not reason to suppose he will bring upon those who are yet in their sins?"

### John Calvin:
1. "For this necessity, he says, awaits the whole Church of God, not only to be subject to the common miseries of men, but especially and mainly to be chastised by the hand of God. Then, with more submission, ought persecutions for Christ to be endured."
2. "It is a sweet consolation that God does not execute his judgments on us as on others, but that he makes us the representatives of his own Son, when we do not suffer except for his cause and for his name."
3. "God so regulates his judgments in this world, that he fattens the wicked for the day of slaughter. He therefore passes by their many sins, and, as it were, connives at them. In the meantime, he restores by corrections his own children, for whom he has a care, to the right way, whenever they depart from it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The judgment is conceived of as a process which makes the house of God its starting-point, which is even now commencing there in the Church’s baptism of suffering, and which cannot stop there."
2. "To the ‘house of God’ itself this judgment was a process of sifting and separation, a judgment like that referred to by Paul (1 Corinthians 11:31), which had for its object that those tried by it should not be condemned with the world."
3. "The judgment of God works its searching course out of the Church into the world of heathenism. And if it visits even the household of faith as a refining fire, what end can it portend for those who withstand the Gospel of Him whose prerogative judgment is?"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The persecution on hand (1 Peter 1:7) was a foretaste of more to come." 
2. "By 'house of God' he can mean the same as the 'spiritual house' of 1 Peter 2:5 or a local church."
3. "'Of those disobeying the gospel of God.' See the same idea in Romans 2:8."

### John Gill:
1. "By judgment is meant, not punishment for sin, strictly speaking, because Christ has endured this in the room and stead of his church and people, and therefore in justice cannot be inflicted on them; but afflictions and persecutions, and which are fatherly chastisements, and different from God's judgment on the world, and condemnation with it."
2. "The first times of Christianity, or of the preaching of the Gospel, were times of trouble and distress; for as it was necessary the Gospel should be confirmed by signs and wonders, so that it should be tried and proved by the sufferings of the saints for it."
3. "What shall the end be of them that obey not the Gospel of God?...and in the world to come everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and eternal vengeance in flames of fire."

### John Wesley:
1. "The time is come for judgment to begin at the house of God — God first visits his church, and that both in justice and mercy."
2. "What shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel — How terribly will he visit them! The judgments which are milder at the beginning, grow more and more severe."
3. "But good men, having already sustained their part, are only spectators of the miseries of the wicked."
