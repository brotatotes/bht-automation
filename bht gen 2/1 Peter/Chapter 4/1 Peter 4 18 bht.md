# 1 Peter 4:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The righteous, those who are made righteous by the righteousness of Christ, are scarcely saved. Their salvation is a difficult and challenging process, as Christ himself faced difficulties in working out their salvation. This salvation can be understood in both temporal and eternal senses, with the former being the primary focus. However, the eternal implications are even more profound. On the other hand, the ungodly, those who do not know God, and the openly sinful will be revealed and face the consequences of their actions on the day of judgment.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The citation is verbatim from the LXX, except that μέν is omitted between ὁ and δίκαιος. The LXX departs from the Heb. text, which is as the E. V., 'Behold the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth: much more the wicked and the sinner.'" (18.)
2. "If the righteous is with difficulty saved, the ungodly and sinner, where shall he appear?" (18.)
3. "The absence of a second article, and the singular verb, both show that the same person is meant by both the ungodly and sinner." (18.)

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The 'scarcely' marks the severity of the ordeal, and the unlikelihood (in a mere human point of view) of the righteous sustaining it; but the righteousness of Christ and God's everlasting covenant make it all sure."
2. "The 'ungodly'—having no regard for God; negative description. The 'sinner'—loving sin; positive; the same man is at once God-forgetting and sin-loving."
3. "They will 'appear' in judgment."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word implies that there is some difficulty, or obstruction, so that the thing came very near not to happen, or so that there was much risk about it."
2. "The apostle in this passage seems to have had his eye on a verse in Proverbs, Proverbs 11:31, and he has merely expanded and illustrated it."
3. "Often it seems to be wholly doubtful whether those who have been converted will be kept to eternal life."

### John Calvin:
1. "The design of what he says, as I have already stated, is to show that the children of God should not faint under the bitterness of present evils, but that they ought, on the contrary, calmly to bear their afflictions for a short time, as the issue will be salvation, while the ungodly will have to exchange a fading and fleeting prosperity for eternal perdition."
2. "But the argument is from the less to the greater; for if God spares not his own children whom he loves and who obey him, how dreadful will be his severity against enemies and such as are rebellious!"
3. "It is in the meantime certain that we are guided by God’s hand, and that we are in no danger of shipwreck as long as we have him as our pilot."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The words 'in the earth' show that in Proverbs the requital in view is that which comes in the form of temporal blessings and chastisements."
2. "Here, therefore, it does not express any uncertainty or incompleteness in the grace of salvation, but indicates with what difficulty and at what cost even the man who is in a right relation with God, is made secure in the judgment."
3. "And if that is so, how shall it be with the man who, as being both careless of God and in practice a sinner, is in a wrong relation to the Judge?"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "And if the righteous is scarcely saved" - Quotation from Proverbs 11:31.
2. "The Christian is not saved by his own righteousness."
3. "Will appear."

### John Gill:
1. "The 'righteous' are such, not who are so in their own opinion, or merely in the esteem of others, nor on account of their vility, morality, and external righteousness before men, or by the deeds of the law; but who are made righteous by the righteousness of Christ imputed to them."
2. "But they are said to be 'scarcely' saved, because of the difficulty of it, both with respect to Christ, who met with difficulties in working out their salvation; by reason of the strictness of divine justice, and the demands of the righteous law, which would make no abatement."
3. "The profane sinner, the Christless, impenitent, unbelieving, and unregenerate man; otherwise all men are sinners, in themselves; but here it means such as are destitute of the sanctifying grace of the Spirit, and the justifying righteousness of Christ, and that live and die in their sins."

### John Wesley:
1. "If the righteous scarcely be saved — Escape with the utmost difficulty." 
2. "The salvation here primarily spoken of is of a temporal nature. But we may apply the words to eternal things, and then they are still more awful."
3. "The ungodly — The man who knows not God. And the open sinner appear - In that day of vengeance."
