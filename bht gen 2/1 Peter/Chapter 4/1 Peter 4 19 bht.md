# 1 Peter 4:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When facing suffering in accordance with God's will, it is important for believers to trust and commit their souls to Him as a sacred depositum. As they persevere in doing good and endure well, they can rely on God, their faithful Creator, whose truth, love, and power provide a secure foundation. In every trial, may their constant care be to act righteously and confidently entrust the outcome to God, who will take care of the rest.
