# 1 Peter 4:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are urged to no longer live according to the desires of worldly men, but rather to devote the remaining time they have in this mortal body to the will of God. By the death of Christ, they have been freed from the influence of worldly ambitions and are now called to conform their lives to the singular purpose of following God's will. The contrast between the lusts of men and the will of God reveals the fallen nature of humanity, which is in opposition to God's perfect plan.

### Henry Alford:
1. "No longer by the lusts of men, but by the will of God." 
2. "To live the rest of your time in the flesh."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "That he (the believer, who has once for all obtained cessation from sin by suffering, in the person of Christ, namely, in virtue of his union with the crucified Christ) should no longer live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God" 
2. "Rest of his time in the flesh proves that the reference is here not to Christ, but to the believer, whose remaining time for glorifying God is short"
3. "Live" in the truest sense, for heretofore he was dead. Not as ALFORD, "Arm yourselves . . . with a view no longer to live the rest of your time"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He has become, through the death of Christ, dead to the world and to the former things which influenced him..."
2. "The remainder of the time that he is to continue in the flesh; that is, that he is to live on the earth."
3. "The object of redemption is to rescue us from being swayed by wicked lusts, and to bring us to be conformed wholly to the will of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Live [βιωσαι] . Only here in New Testament. The rest of the time [επιλοιπον] . Only here in New Testament.

### John Calvin:
1. "He sets forth the way of ceasing from sin, that renouncing the covetings of men we should study to form our life according to the will of God."
2. "The course of good living is thus to begin with the former, but we are to advance to the latter."
3. "Nothing is right and well ordered in man’s life as soon as he wanders from this rule."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The ‘lusts of men’ and the ‘will of God’ are contrasted as two opposite services to which one’s life may be dedicated... or as two opposite patterns or standards to which one’s life may be conformed."
2. "Their standard is to be God’s will. Bengel notices the contrast between the ‘lusts’ which are various, and the ‘will of God’ which is one."
3. "The phrase ‘in the flesh’ means simply ‘in the mortal, bodily life.’ Peter never uses the word ‘flesh’ (at least in this Epistle), in the ethical sense which it often has in Paul, as denoting the sinful nature of man or the ‘principle and realm of earthliness.’"

1. "That ye no longer should live... here only in N.T."

1. "A suffering saint after death is clear of sin."
2. "A person who is guarded and fortified against the fears of death should no longer live to the lusts of men, but to the will of God."
3. "The lusts of men and the will of God being opposed to each other shows that the nature of man is sadly corrupted and is opposite to God."

### John Wesley:
1. "That ye may no longer live in the flesh — Even in this mortal body."
2. "To the desires of men — Either your own or those of others."
3. "These are various; but the will of God is one."
