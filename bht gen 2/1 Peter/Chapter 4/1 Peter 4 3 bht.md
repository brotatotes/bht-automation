# 1 Peter 4:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The time past should suffice for the indulging of our wicked propensities; from now on, we should live differently. The power of the gospel is shown in the conversion of those who were once engaged in such vices, reminding us not to lose hope for those currently indulging in similar behaviors. Our inclination towards these immoral actions highlights our need for God's grace. The abominable idolatries associated with drinking and licentiousness should be seen as detestable to Christians. It is important to remember the past and use it as a catalyst for repentance and transformation in our lives.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For sufficient is the past time to have wrought out the will of the Gentiles."
2. "Walking as ye have done in lasciviousnesses, lusts, wine-bibbings, revellings, drinking-bouts, and nefarious idolatries."
3. "The Jews certainly never went so far into Gentile abominations as to justify its assertions."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Peter takes the lowest ground: for not even the past time ought to have been wasted in lust; but since you cannot recall it, at least lay out the future to better account."
2. "Gentilesâ€”heathen: which many of you were."
3. "The Greek means petulant, immodest, wantonness, unbridled conduct: not so much filthy lust."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We have spent sufficient time in indulging ourselves, and following our wicked propensities, and we should hereafter live in a different manner."
2. "The fact that they were thus converted shows the power of the gospel, and also that we should not despair in regard to those who are indulging in these vices now."
3. "For any purpose whatever for which anyone could ever suppose it to be desirable to live in sin, the past should suffice. But why should it ever be deemed desirable at all? The fruits of sin are always disappointment, tears, death, despair."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The time past may suffice for you to have wrought the desire, etc., walking as ye have done; the perfect participle having an inferential reference to a course of life now done with."
2. "Aselgeiaiv, wantonness....excesses of all kinds, with possibly an emphasis on sins of uncleanness."
3. "Revellings [ÎºÏ‰Î¼Î¿Î¹Ï‚]...originally signifies merely a merry-making; most probably a village festival...these revels also entered into religious observances."

### John Calvin:
1. "The memory of our past life ought to stimulate us to repentance."
2. "He intimates that we ought to persevere to the end, as when Paul says, that Christ was raised from the dead, to die no more."
3. "Peter does not so ascribe these vices to the Gentiles, as though he charged every individual with all these, but that we are by nature inclined to all these evils, and not only so, but that we are so much under the power of depravity, that these fruits which he mentions necessarily proceed from it as from an evil root."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The past may suffice; there is a figure in that, meaning much more than the words express: It is enough, Oh! too much, to have so long, so miserable a life" (Leighton).
2. "No doubt uncleanness is the foremost thing in view in these excesses... But Peter begins with a wide, plural term, sufficient to include unbridled conduct of all kinds, and then goes on from the general to the particular."
3. "Here, as so often elsewhere, idolatry and immorality are associated as going hand in hand with each other. The 'abominable' of the A. V. and R. V. scarcely conveys the point of the adjective. It describes the idolatries as unlawful, outside the pale of Divine law."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jews sometimes fell in with the ways of Gentiles as today some Christians copy the ways of the world." 
2. "In unbridled lustful excesses." 
3. "To the Christian all 'idolatry' is 'abominable,' not allowed, but particularly those associated with drinking and licentiousness."

### John Gill:
1. "These converted persons, in the past time of their life, before conversion, 'walked' in sin; which denotes a series and course of sinning, a persisting and progress in it, with delight and pleasure, promising themselves security and impunity."
2. "The particular sins they walked in are reducible to these three heads, unchastity, intemperance, and idolatry."
3. "Now when they walked in these things, they 'wrought the will of the Gentiles'; they did the things which the sinners of the Gentiles, the worst of men, that knew not God, took pleasure in, and what they would have others do."

### John Wesley:
1. "Revellings, banquetings â€” Have these words any meaning now?"
2. "Then the former meant, meetings to eat; meetings, the direct end of which was, to please the taste: the latter, meetings to drink."
3. "Both of which Christians then ranked with abominable idolatries."
