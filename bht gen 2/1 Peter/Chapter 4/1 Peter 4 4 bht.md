### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They think it strange (ξενιζοντα). Present passive indicative of ξενιζω, old verb (from ξενος, stranger), to entertain a guest (Acts 10:23), to astonish (Acts 17:20). See also 1 Peter 4:12. 'They are surprised or astonished.'"
2. "That ye run not with them (μη συντρεχοντων υμων). Genitive absolute (negative μη) with present active participle of συντρεχω, old compound, to run together like a crowd or a mob as here (just like our phrase, 'running with certain folks')."
