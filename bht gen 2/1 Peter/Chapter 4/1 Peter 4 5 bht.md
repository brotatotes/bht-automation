# 1 Peter 4:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The comfort and reassurance of Christians who are unjustly slandered is the focus of this passage. Those who wrongfully accuse believers will themselves be held accountable for their evil-speaking. The judgment may not be imminent, but the Judge is fully prepared. Christians are encouraged to patiently endure trials and opposition, trusting that the Lord will ultimately vindicate them when He comes to judge. This judgment will be inclusive of all, both the living and the dead.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The consideration is propounded for the comfort and stay of Christians unjustly slandered."
2. "Him that is ready to judge (aor.: once for all, decisively) living and dead."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "Ready‚Äîvery speedily."
3. "Christ's coming is to the believer always near."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They are guilty in this of a great wrong and they must answer for it to God." 
2. "The meaning is, not that he was about to do it, or that the day of judgment was near at hand - whatever the apostle may have supposed to be true on that point - but that he was prepared for it; all the arrangements were made with reference to it; there was nothing to hinder it."
3. "The meaning in this connection seems to be, that they should bear their trials and the opposition which they would meet with patiently, not feeling that they were forgotten, nor attempting to avenge themselves; for the Lord would vindicate them when he should come to judgment, and call those who had injured them to an account for all the wrongs which they had done to the children of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Having himself in readiness; there at God's right hand in heaven."
2. "Implying, also, a near judgment."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The formula ‚Äòready to‚Äô (which is used again only in Acts 21:13; 2 Corinthians 12:14), along with the tense in which the ‚Äòto judge‚Äô is cast, points to the last judgment as certain and near, and to the Judge as prepared to judge once for all."
2. "This Judge, too, as we may infer from the general conclusion to which chap. 1 Peter 3:17-22 led up, is Christ, the Christ who is reviled when Christians are reviled, the Christ who, in the time of His own suffering, committed His case to Him that judgeth righteously."
3. "The universality and impartiality of the judgment are thus expressed. For the phrase ‚Äòquick and dead‚Äô is not to be limited either to the heathen slanderers, or (with Schott) to the Christians who are to get their rights, whether alive or dead, at Christ‚Äôs coming."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For this use with ŒªŒøŒ≥ŒøŒΩ (account) see Matthew 12:36; Luke 16:2; Acts 19:40; Hebrews 13:17."
2. "The sudden use of the relative Œø see Romans 3:8."
3. "The quick and the dead (Œ∂œâŒΩœÑŒ±œÇ Œ∫Œ± ŒΩŒµŒ∫œÅŒøœÖœÇ). 'Living and dead.'"

### John Gill:
1. "To calm the minds of God's people, and make them to sit easy under all censures, reproaches, and calumnies, and not think of avenging themselves, but commit themselves to him that will judge righteously..."
2. "Even to him,that is ready to judge the quick and the dead; that is, all men, such as will be found alive when he comes, and those that have died before, who will then be raised from the dead, to receive their judgment..."
3. "He may be truly said to be ready for it, as he is every way equal to it, and will finish it with righteousness."

### John Wesley:
1. Who shall give account ‚Äî Of this, as well as all their other ways.To him who is ready ‚Äî So faith represents him now.
