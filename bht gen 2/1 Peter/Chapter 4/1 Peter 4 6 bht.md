# 1 Peter 4:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The purpose of preaching the gospel is so that all people, both living and dead, may be accountable and judged by God. Through hearing the gospel, they have the opportunity to live according to God's will and in the guidance of the Holy Spirit. This preaching is not limited to a certain group but extends to all generations, affecting both those alive in the present and those who have passed away. Ultimately, the transformation of the soul into the image of God is the desired outcome of this proclamation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "that they might indeed be judged (aor.) according to men as regards the flesh, but might live on (pres.) according to God as regards the spirit."
2. "The want of the article does not justify any limitation of this word: for the art. is also wanting before νεκρούς in 1 Peter 4:5, which indisputably is universal in its reference."
3. "Our Lord is ready to judge the dead: and with reason: for even they have not been without opportunity of receiving His gospel: as the example which was adduced in ch. 1Pe 3:19 shows."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The sense seems to be, Peter, as representing the true attitude of the Church in every age, expecting Christ at any moment, says, The Judge is ready to judge the quick and dead—the dead, I say, for they, too, in their lifetime, have had the Gospel preached to them, that so they might be judged at last in the same way as those living now (and those who shall be so when Christ shall come), namely, 'men in the flesh,' and that they might, having escaped condemnation by embracing the Gospel so preached, live unto God in the spirit (though death has passed over their flesh)."
2. "He says, 'live,' not 'made alive' or quickened; for they are supposed to have been already 'quickened together with Christ'."
3. "The Gospel, substantially, was 'preached' to the Old Testament Church; though not so fully as to the New Testament Church."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The expression, “For, for this cause,” refers to an end to be reached, or an object to be gained, or a reason why anything referred to is done."
2. "The most natural and obvious interpretation is to refer it to those who were then dead, to whom the gospel had been preached when living, and who had become true Christians."
3. "The argument, then, in this verse is, that in the trials which we endure on account of religion, we should remember the example of those who have suffered for it, and should remember why the gospel was preached to them. It was in a subordinate sense, indeed, that they might glorify God by a martyr’s death; but in a higher sense, that in this world and the next they might truly live."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is then a remarkable consolation to the godly, that death itself brings no loss to their salvation."
2. "Though Christ, then, may not appear a deliverer in this life, yet his redemption is not void, or without effect; for his power extends to the dead."
3. "But if the grace of Christ once penetrated to the dead, there is no doubt but that we shall partake of it when dead."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The preaching itself can be understood only as an offer of grace."
2. "For the whole statement then takes this form 'Christ is ready to judge quick and dead; and with justice shall the dead, no less than the living, be judged by Him; for His Gospel is preached to all, in the other world, if not in this.'"
3. "It fits in with the idea of the previous verse and the counsels of the whole section. It does justice to the prominence given to this 'life according to God in the spirit' as the great aim of the Gospel."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "There are those who take 'dead' here in the spiritual sense...but consider it 'impossible' for Peter to use the same word in two senses so close together...but Jesus did it in the same sentence..." 
2. "Bigg takes it to mean that all men who did not hear the gospel message in this life will hear it in the next before the final judgement." 
3. "There is contrast also between 'according to men' and 'according to God'."

### John Gill:
1. "By the Gospel is meant the good news of the incarnation, sufferings, and death of Christ, and salvation by him: and includes all the doctrines of grace, as of pardon, righteousness, and eternal life." 
2. "The Gospel is preached to them also, that they may be left without excuse." 
3. "The persons to whom it was preached are to them that are dead; not in a figurative sense, dead in trespasses and sins; though this is the case of all mankind, and of God's elect, in a state of nature."

### John Wesley:
1. "For to this end was the gospel preached...That they might be judged...They might live according to the will and word of God, in the Spirit."
2. "In their several generations...In the flesh according to the manner of men."
3. "The soul renewed after his image."
