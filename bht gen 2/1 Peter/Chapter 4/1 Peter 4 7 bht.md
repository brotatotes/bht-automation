# 1 Peter 4:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The end of all things is quickly approaching, which includes the resolution of any wrongs and the alleviation of your sufferings. Therefore, it is important to maintain clarity of mind and self-control while remaining vigilant in prayer. Temperance aids in watchfulness, which in turn enhances your prayer life. So, be watchful for opportunities to pray, and pray with a reverent spirit, relying on the guidance of the Holy Spirit in both the content and manner of your prayers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The end of all things is at hand...be therefore of temperate mind and be sober unto prayers." 
2. "Above all things, having your love towards one another intense, because love covereth a multitude of sins."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The nearness meant is not that of mere 'time,' but that before the Lord; as he explains to guard against misapprehension, and defends God from the charge of procrastination."
2. "We live in the last dispensation, not like the Jews under the Old Testament. The Lord will come as a thief; He is 'ready' to judge the world at any moment; it is only God's long-suffering and His will that the Gospel should be preached as a witness to all nations, that induces Him to lengthen out the time which is with Him still as nothing."
3. "Temperance promotes wakefulness or watchfulness, and both promote prayer. Drink makes drowsy, and drowsiness prevents prayer."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The phrase, 'the end of all things,' would naturally refer to the end of the world; the winding up of human affairs... It might mean that so far as they were concerned, or in respect to them, the end of all things drew near."
2. "The fact that it is such language as we now naturally address to people, saying that in respect to them 'the end of all things is at hand,' shows that it cannot be demonstrated that Peter did not use it in the same sense, and consequently that it cannot be proved that he meant to teach that the end of the world was then soon to occur."
3. "The important truth, then, taught by this passage is, 'that the near approach, of the end of all things should make us serious and prayerful.'"


### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Is at hand [ηγγικεν] . Lit., has come near. The word constantly used of the coming of Christ and his kingdom."
2. "Therefore, as Rev., be ye of sound mind. Compare Mark 5:15."
3. "Lit., prayers. The plural is used designedly: prayers of all kinds, private or public."

### John Calvin:
1. "He intimates that we ought not to sit still in the world, from which we must soon remove."
2. "The cares of this world overwhelm us, and make us drowsy, if the view of present things dazzles our eyes... were the trumpet of Christ to sound in our ears, it would powerfully rouse us and not suffer us to lie torpid."
3. "He yet reminds them that they were to pray earnestly, not formally."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The subjects which are now introduced...relate specially to what Christians should be in face of temptations to heathen vice and under the burden of heathen persecution."
2. "The death of the individual believer has a very secondary place in apostolic teaching...the event with which the New Testament is accustomed to fill the Christian's vision of the future...is an event of universal, not of merely personal, importance that Second Coming of Christ which is to put an end to the present world itself."
3. "Soundness of mind and sobriety are essential to the prayerful frame, and specially so where the believer suffers from the contagion of vicious surroundings and the distraction of trial."

2. "Be ye therefore of sound mind...in view of the coming of Christ." 
3. "Be sober unto prayer...and plural prayers. Cf. Ephesians 6:18."
