# 1 Peter 4:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Love is emphasized as the paramount virtue, as it animates our actions and without it, other duties lack life. Love covers a multitude of sins by forbearingly bearing each other's burdens, forgiving and forgetting past offenses. Through prayer, love seeks to have others covered by God and can be instrumental in converting sinners and covering a multitude of sins. Love is of great value in treating others, as it allows us to extend charity, forgiveness, and grace, covering over a multitude of imperfections and offenses.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Above all things—not that 'charity' or love is placed above 'prayer,' but because love is the animating spirit, without which all other duties are dead."
2. "Charity shall cover the multitude, c.—The oldest manuscripts have 'covereth.' Quoted from Proverbs 10:12... 'Covereth' so as not harshly to condemn or expose faults; but forbearingly to bear the other's burdens, forgiving and forgetting past offenses."
3. "By prayer for them, love tries to have them covered by God; and so being the instrument of converting the sinner from his error, 'covereth a (not 'the,' as English Version) multitude of sins'; but the former idea from Proverbs is the prominent one."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Have fervent charity among yourselves - Warm, ardent love toward each other."
2. "For charity shall cover the multitude of sins - Love to another shall so cover or hide a great many imperfections in him, that you will not notice them."
3. "Love, however, is of inestimable value in the treatment of others; and imperfect as we are, and liable to go astray, we all have occasion to cast ourselves on the charity of our brethren, and to avail ourselves much and often of that 'love which covers over a multitude of sins.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Fervent [εκτενη] . See, on the kindred adverb fervently, notes on ch. 1 22. Love covereth, etc. Compare James 5:20; Proverbs 10:12.

### John Calvin:
1. "And above all things He commends charity or love as the first thing, for it is the bond of perfection."
2. "A contrary effect is ascribed to love, that is, that men who love one another, kindly and courteously forgive one another; hence it comes that, willingly burying each other’s vices, one seeks to preserve the honor of another."
3. "This singular benefit love brings to us when it exists among us, so that innumerable evils are covered in oblivion."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The preference which is given to brotherly love is not given as if it were superior to prayer and the other virtues, or as if these were to be subordinated to the interests of that, but because without it nothing else can make the inner life of the Church what it should be."
2. "It is to be cultivated with ‘persevering intensity’ (Huther), as the disposition to which the soul without risk can surrender itself entirely, and which, the more it is cherished, adds new grace to sobriety and the other virtues, and deepens the life of the Church."
3. "The reason is found in what love does now and naturally, within the Church. It works for concord, throwing a covering over sins, forgiving them, excusing them, making as little of them as possible, while the genius of hatred is the opposite."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Above all things (προ παντων). Being fervent (εκτενη εχοντες)."
2. "For love covereth a multitude of sins  (οτ αγαπη καλυπτε πληθος αμαρτιων)."


### John Gill:
1. "And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves,.... Not but that charity, or love, is to be exercised towards all men, even towards enemies, but more especially towards the saints..." (27 words)
2. "... this love ought to be mutual and reciprocal, and to be warm and fervent... this the apostle exhorts to above all things else; since outward sobriety, and watchings, and prayer, and all other duties, are nothing without this..." (37 words)
3. "...charity, or true love, thinks no ill, but puts the best constructions upon the words and actions of fellow Christians, and does not take them up, and improve and exaggerate them, but lets them lie buried in oblivion: it takes no notice of injuries, offences, and affronts, but overlooks them, bears with them, and forgives them..."
