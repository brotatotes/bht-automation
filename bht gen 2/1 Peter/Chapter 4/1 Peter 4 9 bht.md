# 1 Peter 4:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Using hospitality is an important aspect of Christian living, especially when it comes to welcoming strangers and those in need. In fact, some have even entertained angels without knowing it. Therefore, it is crucial to practice hospitality towards one another without any complaints or grumbling. Instead, let us show genuine love and cheerfulness as we extend a helping hand to those who need it. Proverbs 10:12 also reminds us of the importance of love in our interactions and relationships.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Loquitur non de pomposa hospitalitate... sed de Christiana illa et sancta hospitalitate... ex sincera caritate promte in ædes suas recipiunt, eos amanter et benigne complectuntur, tanquam Christi membra et ecclesiæ concives fovent."
2. "The opposite to γογγυσμός in hospitality is simple open-heartedness... the consequence of it, 'occulta maledicentia, odiosa exprobratio beneficiorum,' as Gerhard here."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Not the spurious hospitality which passes current in the world, but the entertaining of those needing it, especially those exiled for the faith, as the representatives of Christ, and all hospitality to whomsoever exercised from genuine Christian love."
2. "Without grudging—Greek, 'murmuring.' 'He that giveth, let him do it with simplicity,' that is open-hearted sincerity; with cordiality."
3. "Not secretly speaking against the person whom we entertain or upbraiding him with the favor we have conferred in him."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Without grudging - Greek, 'without murmurs;' that is, without complaining of the hardship of doing it; of the time, and expense, and trouble required in doing it."
2. "The idea of grudging, in the common sense of that word - that is, of doing it unwillingly, or regretting the expense, and considering it as ill-bestowed, or as not producing an equivalent of any kind - is not exactly the idea here."
3. "It greatly enhances the value of hospitality, that it be done on our part with entire cheerfulness. One of the duties involved in it is to make a guest happy; and this can be done in no other way than by showing him that he is welcome."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Using hospitality. Compare Romans 13:13.

### John Calvin:
1. "After having generally exhorted them to love one another, he specially mentions one of the duties of love."
2. "He then bids them mutually to exercise it, so that no one might require more from others than what he himself was prepared to render."
3. "Then the Apostle would have us to show kindness willingly and with a cheerful mind."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The duty of hospitality occupies a very notable place in the New Testament teaching"
2. "Taking it for granted, however, that the laws of hospitality are honoured, and that believers who have the power will be ready to open the door to every needy brother, Peter deals here with the spirit in which all should be done."
3. "Only when hospitality is offered in this spirit does it answer to the high strain of love which should prevail among Christian brethren."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Using hospitality (φιλοξενο). 'Friendly to strangers,' old word..."
2. "Complaint spoils hospitality."
3. "Hospitality made mission work possible (3 John 1:5)."

### John Gill:
1. "Use hospitality....or, 'be lovers of strangers,' as the phrase may be rendered...especially good men, that are obliged to remove from their native country for the sake of religion...and these are to be loved: and love is to be shown them...by directing, counseling, and advising them, and if need be, by giving them food, and raiment, and lodging."
2. "...some, by the practice of it, have entertained angels unawares, as Abraham, and Lot; and even Christ himself, as the two disciples traveling to Emmaus..."
3. "....as they were in foreign countries, and at a distance from one another, whenever by any providence they were brought where each other were, that they would be hospitable to one another...without grudging...without murmurings...and without complaints of them, finding fault, and picking quarrels with them..."

### John Wesley:
1. One to another — Ye that are of different towns or countries.Without murmuring — With all cheerfulness. Proverbs 10:12.
