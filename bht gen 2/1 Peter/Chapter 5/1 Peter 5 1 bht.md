# 1 Peter 5:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle's exhortations are focused on patient suffering for Christ. As an elder himself, he humbly places himself on the same level as those he is addressing, choosing to entreat and beseech them rather than command. His authority comes not from claims of high office, but from his role as a fellow elder. His eyewitness testimony of Christ's sufferings and his own experiences of suffering for Christ lend great weight and influence to his exhortation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

3. "An eye-witness of Christ's sufferings, and so qualified to exhort you to believing patience in suffering for well-doing after His example."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The language which Peter uses is not that of stern and arbitrary command; it is that of kind and mild Christian exhortation."
2. "He does not put it on the ground of his apostolical authority; or urge it because he was the vicegerent of Christ; or because he was the head of the church; or because he had any pre-eminence over others in any way."
3. "His own solemn declaration here makes it certain that he was present. He alludes to it now, evidently because it qualified him to exhort those whom he addressed."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The expression is decisive against the primacy of Peter."
2. "The eye-witness, as a spectator, is always such with a view to giving testimony."
3. "Therefore he speaks of himself as a witness, especially in the sense of being called to testify of what he has seen."

### John Calvin:
1. "In opposition to the first vice he sets alacrity or a willing attention; to the second, liberality; to the third, moderation and meekness, by which they are to keep themselves in their own rank or station."
2. "For whosoever has not this end in view, to spend himself and his labor disinterestedly and gladly in behalf of the Church, is not a minister of Christ, but a slave to his own stomach and his purse."
3. "What stands opposed to this virtue is tyrannical pride, when the pastor exempts himself from all subjection, and tyrannizes over the Church."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The omission of the article perhaps generalizes the statement, as if Peter had said, ‘Such as are elders among you I exhort.’"
2. "The next verse makes it clear that the term ‘elders,’ or (to reproduce the Greek word itself) ‘presbyters,’ is used in the official sense."
3. "One distinction, and only one, is alluded to. It is that of having seen what Christ suffered. Among all these fellow-elders he was the one who had witnessed that."

2. "A witness. This is what Jesus had said they must be...So Paul was to be a μαρτυς."
3. "'The partner also,' 'the partaker also.' See Luke 5:10; 2 Corinthians 1:7; 2 Peter 1:4."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle returns to particular exhortations...chiefly concern patient suffering for Christ." 
2. "Being an elder himself, it was acting in character to exhort them; nor could it be objected to as impertinent and unbecoming; and since he was still in a higher office, on which account he could have commanded, it shows great humility in him to put himself upon a level with them, and only entreat and beseech them; he does not call himself the prince of the apostles and pastors, and the vicar of Christ, as his pretended successor does, but a fellow elder." 
3. "The exhortation of a person in such an office, as before expressed, and of one that was an eyewitness of Christ's sufferings, and had endured so much for Christ, and had had so large an experience of his grace, and such full assurance of glory, must carry great weight and influence in it."

### John Wesley:
1. "I who am a fellow-elder — So the first though not the head of the apostles appositely and modestly styles himself."
2. "And a witness of the sufferings of Christ — Having seen him suffer, and now suffering for him."
