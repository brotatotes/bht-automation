## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The God of all grace...who called you...unto His eternal glory in Christ Jesus."
2. "When ye have suffered a little while...shall Himself perfect, shall confirm, shall strengthen, shall ground you."
3. "He who has begun grace with a view to glory, will not cut off grace till it be perfected in glory."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Comforting assurance that God will finally 'perfect' His work of 'grace' in them, after they have undergone the necessary previous suffering."
2. "He from the first 'called unto glory.' He will not let His purpose fall short of completion. If He does so in punishing, much more in grace."
3. "Join to 'called you': suffering, as a necessary preliminary to glory, was contemplated in God's calling."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "But the God of all grace - The God who imparts all needful grace."
2. "After you have suffered as long as he shall appoint. The Greek is, “having suffered a little,” and may refer either to time or degree."
3. "The tendency of affliction is to make us perfect."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Shall himself perfect...the putting of all the parts into right relation and connection." 
2. "Shall stablish...the word used by Christ in his exhortation to Peter, 'strengthen thy brethren'."
3. "Shall strengthen...that you may overcome every adverse force. A saying worthy of Peter. He is strengthening his brethren."

### John Calvin:
1. "Doctrine is in vain poured forth into the air, unless God works by his Spirit."
2. "He prays that God may give success to their labors."
3. "If our calling is founded on Christ, and refers to the celestial kingdom of God and a blessed immortality, it follows that it is not transient nor fading."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This assurance is introduced as a contrast with, or qualification of, what has been said of the burdens of believers. Hence the opening ‘but,’ or ‘moreover’ (not ‘and’). Such things they must expect from the adversary,  but  what may they not expect from God?" 
2. "The designation of God as the ‘God of all grace,’ the God who is so rich in grace that all grace comes from Him, adds to the strength of the assurance. The title is itself a consolation."
3. "So great an act of grace was the pledge of further gifts of grace. Unless so great an object is to be frustrated, it must be that God will carry them through their sufferings, and make these the means of  perfecting, stablishing,  and  strengthening  them with a view to that glory."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The God of all grace" (ο θεος της χαριτος).
2. "For God's 'calling' us (καλεσας) see 1 Thessalonians 5:23; 1 Corinthians 1:8; Romans 8:29."
3. "After that ye have suffered a little while" (ολιγον παθοντας).

### John Gill:
1. "The sufferings of the saints here are but for a while; that they are in love and kindness; and that they shall certainly enjoy the glory they are called unto by him."
2. "The saints are called 'by', or 'in Jesus Christ'; the glory they are called to is in his hands; and they themselves, by being called unto it, appear to be in him, and as such to belong unto him."
3. "God will make his people 'perfect': and which respects not their justification; for in that sense they are perfect already in Christ, their head...but their sanctification; for though all grace is implanted in them at once, yet it is gradually brought to perfection."

### John Wesley:
1. "Now the God of all grace — By which alone the whole work is begun, continued, and finished in your soul."
2. "Himself — Ye have only to watch and resist the devil: the rest God will perform."
3. "Stablish — That nothing may overthrow you. Strengthen — That ye may conquer all adverse power. And settle you — As an house upon a rock."
