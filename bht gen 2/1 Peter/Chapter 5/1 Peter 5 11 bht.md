# 1 Peter 5:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To give Him the might, glory, and dominion is to acknowledge His sovereignty and the divine goodness He bestows on us. This doxology expresses a sense of gratitude and recognition of His rule over all things. It is fitting to ascribe dominion to Him, for His kingdom reigns supreme and He dispenses grace and favor in a sovereign manner. The inclusion of Amen signifies the Apostle's prayer and belief that this is truth.
