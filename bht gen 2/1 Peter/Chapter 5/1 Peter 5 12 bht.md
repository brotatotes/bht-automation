# 1 Peter 5:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Silvanus, a faithful companion of Paul, was chosen as a suitable messenger by Peter to confirm the true grace of God in the churches. The sufferings endured by the believers necessitated attestation and affirmation of the gospel truth to prevent them from falling away. Peter's letter, though brief, carried weight as a testimony to the certainty of the grace received through the preaching of the Gospel. Encouraging them to stand firm in this grace, Peter assured them that their faith was grounded in the reality of God's own grace, which they could confidently rely on amidst their hardships.
