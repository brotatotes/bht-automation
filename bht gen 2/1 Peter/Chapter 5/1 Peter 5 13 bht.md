# 1 Peter 5:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The mentioned passage refers to the presence of the church in Babylon, whether it be the actual city or symbolically representing Rome. Most scholars favor the interpretation of the literal city, where it is believed Peter wrote this letter. This church is described as being chosen and elected along with the recipients of the letter, sharing in faith and salvation. Furthermore, the warm greetings from the church and the mention of Mark as Peter's spiritual son highlight the close bond and unity within the Christian community.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἡ ἐν Βαβυλῶνι συνεκλεκτή must be an individual person also."
2. "perhaps the actual son of St. Peter, bearing this name"
3. "St. Mark is reported by Eus. l. c., and iii. 39, 1 Peter 5:8 , vi. 14, 25, to have been the ἀκόλουθος and μαθητής and ἑρμηνευτὴς Πέτρου."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In English Version the sense is clear: 'That portion of the whole dispersion, or Church of Christianized Jews, with Gentile converts, which resides in Babylon.'"
2. "That Mark had a spiritual connection with the Asiatic churches which Peter addresses, and so naturally salutes them, appears from 2 Timothy 4:11; Colossians 4:10."
3. "The earliest distinct authority for Peter's martyrdom at Rome is Dionysius, bishop of Corinth, in the latter half of the second century."


### Albert Barnes:
1. "The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you - It will be seen at once that much of this is supplied by our translators; the words "church that is" not being in the original."
2. "The Greek is, ἡ ἐν Βαβυλῶνι συνεκλεκτὴ hē en Babulōni suneklektē; and might refer to a church, or to a female."
3. "But the Arabic, Syriac, and Vulgate, as well as the English versions, supply the word "church." This interpretation seems to be confirmed by the word rendered "elected together with" -  συνεκλεκτὴ suneklektē."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The majority of interpreters, however, refer it to the church."
2. "The allegorical interpretation becomes still less likely when it is observed that other geographical designations in this epistle... have undoubtedly the literal meaning."
3. "For these and other reasons a succession of distinguished interpreters and historians, from Erasmus and Calvin, on to Neander, Weiss, Reuss, Huther, etc., have rightly held by the literal sense."

### John Calvin:
1. "Many of the ancients thought that Rome is here enigmatically denoted... nor do they care for Christ, provided Peter be left to them."
2. "Moreover, let them only retain the name of Peter's chair, and they will not refuse to set Rome in the infernal regions."
3. "Since, then, Peter had Mark as his companion when he wrote this Epistle, it is very probable that he was at Babylon: and this was in accordance with his calling; for we know that he was appointed an apostle especially to the Jews."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The great majority of interpreters, however, including Luther, Calvin, and most of those of our own day, prefer the other view; and there is an obvious fitness in giving the greetings of the Christian community, within whose bounds Peter was at present resident, as the greetings of a church which, though widely separated geographically, was ‘co-elect’ with those ‘elect sojourners’ in other countries to whom he was writing."
2. "The allegorical interpretation becomes still less likely when it is observed that other geographical designations in this Epistle (chap. 1 Peter 1:1) have undoubtedly the literal meaning."
3. "It was to the house of Mary, the mother of this Mark, that Peter repaired on his deliverance from prison (Acts 12:12). The old friendship, therefore, is found still alive after a long and changeful interval. It was this Mark who was the occasion of the sharp contention between Paul and Barnabas, which is noticed in Acts 15:0."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Either actual Babylon or, as most likely, mystical Babylon (Rome) as in the Apocalypse."
2. "The natural way to take it is for Peter's wife."
3. "So this fact agrees with the numerous statements by the early Christian writers that Mark, after leaving Barnabas, became Peter's 'interpreter' and under his influence wrote his Gospel."

### John Gill:
1. "It is best therefore to understand it literally, of Babylon in Assyria, the metropolis of the dispersion of the Jews, and the centre of it, to whom the apostle wrote..."
2. "The church in this place is said to be elected together with you; that is, were chosen together with them in Christ, before the foundation of the world, to grace here, and glory hereafter..."
3. "This Church, he says, saluteth you; wishes all peace, happiness, and prosperity of every kind, and so doth Marcus, my son..."

### John Wesley:
1. "The church that is at Babylon - Near which St. Peter probably was when he wrote this epistle."
2. "Elected together with you - Partaking of the same faith with you."
3. "My son - Probably converted by St. Peter, and he had occasionally served him, 'as a son in the gospel.'"
