## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Salute one another in a kiss of love."
2. "Peace be to you all that are in Christ."
3. "Here it is, 'peace to you, I mean, all that are, and in as far as they are, in Christ; in union and communion with Him.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Kiss of charity — 'an holy kiss': the token of love to God and the brethren. Love and holiness are inseparable." 
2. "Peace — Peter's closing salutation; as Paul's is, 'Grace be with you,' though he accompanies it with 'peace be to the brethren.' 'Peace' (flowing from salvation) was Christ's own salutation after the resurrection, and from Him Peter derives it." 
3. "Be with you all that are in Christ Jesus — The oldest manuscripts omit 'Jesus.' In Ephesians 6:24, addressed to the same region, the same limitation of the salutation occurs, whence, perhaps, Peter here adopts it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity - A kiss of love; a common method of affectionate salutation in the times of the apostles."
2. "Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus - That are true Christians."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Kiss of charity. Compare 1 Corinthians 16:20. 

### John Calvin:
1. "Of the kiss of love we have spoken elsewhere."
2. "Now he bids this to be the kiss of love."
3. "The sincerity of the heart might correspond with the external act."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Christian Fathers, too, speak of it as the ‘kiss of peace,’ or the ‘kiss in the Lord.’"
2. "The practice of saluting with a kiss was as common in the ancient East, and specially among the Jews, as is the custom of saluting with hand-shaking in the modern West."
3. "The closing words ‘in Christ’ are peculiarly Pauline in tone."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "With a kiss of love (εν φιληματ αγαπης). As in 1 Corinthians 16:20. The abuse of this custom led to its confinement to men with men and women with women and to its final abandonment (Apost. Const. ii. 57, 12)."
2. "That are in Christ (τοις εν Χριστω). This is the greatest of all secret orders and ties, one that is open to all who take Christ as Lord and Saviour."

### John Gill:
1. "Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity.... and such a love the Jews call, as the apostle does here, 'a kiss of love'; for as Philo the Jew observes, a kiss and love differ, the one may be without the other, a mere compliment, a show of friendship, and not arise from sincere love." 
2. "Peace with you all, that are in Christ Jesus; who were chosen in him before the foundation of the world; and appeared to be in him by the effectual calling; and were at least by profession in him, and were in Christ mystical, and incorporated in a Gospel church." 
3. "The epistle is closed with Amen, as is common; the apostle wishing that this might be the case, and believing that it would be."
