# 1 Peter 5:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Pastors have the responsibility to feed the flock of God, which includes guiding, guarding, and nourishing the members. They are to discharge their duties willingly, with a genuine love for their work, and not as a burden. Their motive should not be to gain dishonorable wealth, but rather to genuinely care for the well-being of the flock. This entails providing pure doctrine and spiritual food, exercising sound judgment in their teaching, and ensuring that the flock is strengthened in their faith through the Gospel of the grace of God and the message of a crucified Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The verb includes in one word the various offices of a shepherd; the leading, feeding, heeding."
2. "He orders them to feed the flock of God, not generally, nor œcumenically, but locally, as far as concerned that part of it found among them."
3. "Prompted by a desire not of gain, but of good to the flock; ready and enthusiastic, as the children of Israel, and even the workmen, gave their services eagerly and gratuitously to build the tabernacle of old."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Feed—as a shepherd, by discipline and doctrine. Lead, feed, heed: by prayer, exhortation, government, and example." 
2. "The dignity is marked by the term 'elder'; the duties of the office, to tend or oversee, by 'bishop.'" 
3. "Necessity is laid upon them, but willingness prevents it being felt, both in undertaking and in fulfilling the duty."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Feed the flock of God - Discharge the duties of a shepherd toward the flock." 
2. "Not by constraint, but willingly - Go cheerfully to your duty as a work which you love, and act like a freeman in it, and not as a slave."
3. "Not for filthy lucre - Shameful or dishonorable gain. But of a ready mind - Cheerfully, promptly."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Feed [ποιμανατε]...the verb denotes all that is included in the office of a shepherd - guiding, guarding, folding, no less than feeding..."

### John Calvin:
1. "The flock of Christ cannot be fed except with pure doctrine, which is alone our spiritual food."
2. "Hence pastors are not mute hypocrites, nor those who spread their own figments, which, like deadly poison, destroy the souls of men."
3. "He then shews how they were rightly to perform the pastoral office, though the word ἐπισκοπεῖν generally means to preside or to oversee."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The charge reminds us also of Paul’s counsel to the Ephesian elders (Acts 20:28). In the oldest of the classical writers the relations of ruler to people are familiarly described as the relations of shepherd to flock."
2. "The designation ‘the flock of God’ expresses both the unity of the Church and the fact that it is God’s possession, not that of the elders."
3. "This first definition describes the elder’s duty as one which is not to be taken up like an unwelcome burden imposed on one, or a task from which one cannot retreat. In such circumstances there will be, as Calvin suggests, a dull and frigid discharge of the work."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Tend (ποιμανατε). First aorist active imperative of ποιμαινω, old verb, from ποιμην (shepherd) as in Luke 17:7."
2. "But willingly (αλλα εκουσιως). By contrast. Old adverb, in N.T. only here and Hebrews 10:26."
3. "But of a ready mind (αλλα προθυμως). Old adverb from προθυμος (Matthew 26:41), here only in N.T."

### John Gill:
1. "Feed the flock of God which is among you... the church of God, over which they were elders or pastors, consisting of Christ's sheep and lambs."
2. "Feeding includes the whole of the pastor's work, the ministry of the word, the administration of ordinances, and the rule and government of the church."
3. "[Feed them] not with every wind of doctrine... but with knowledge and understanding of divine and evangelical truths... with the words of faith and sound doctrine... with the Gospel of the grace of God... and with a crucified Christ himself."

### John Wesley:
1. "Feed the flock — Both by doctrine and discipline."
2. "Not by constraint — Unwillingly, as a burden."
3. "Not for filthy gain — Which, if it be the motive of acting, is filthy beyond expression."
