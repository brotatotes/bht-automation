# 1 Peter 5:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The appointed leaders are cautioned against using their position as a means of dominion over others, but rather, they are called to lead by example and humility, valuing the spiritual inheritance of God's people. The church is seen as a collective heritage, and pastors are entrusted with specific portions of this flock. Instead of seeking power and authority, pastors should model godly behavior, serving as examples to the believers. This genuine leadership fosters a spirit of willingness and obedience among the flock, as they look to their pastors for guidance and support.

2. "the portions (entrusted to you) ... the heritage of God."
3. "but becoming patterns of the flock... œÑœçœÄŒøŒπ, because the flock will look to you."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Not that we have dominion over your faith." 
2. "The flock, as one whole, is God's heritage, or flock in the singular."
3. "A monstrosity it is to see the highest rank joined with the meanest mind, the first seat with the lowest life, a grandiloquent tongue with a lazy life, much talking with no fruit."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Their dominion is not to be that of temporal lordship; it is to be that of love and truth."
2. "The meaning here is, 'not lording it over the possessions or the heritage of God.'"
3. "Peter has drawn here with great beauty, the appropriate character of the ministers of the gospel, and described the spirit with which they should be actuated in the discharge of the duties of their office."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "But this carries the idea of high-handed rule."
2. "Hence Wycliffe translates the passage, 'neither as having lordship in the clergie.'" 
3. "The word here, though its interpretation is somewhat disputed, seems to refer to the several congregations - the lots or charges assigned to the elders."

### John Calvin:
1. "Peter here condemns unreasonable exercise of power, as the case is with those who consider not themselves to be the ministers of Christ and his Church, but seek something higher."
2. "And he calls particular churches 'lots,' (cleros ;) for as the whole body of the Church is the Lord‚Äôs heritage, so the churches, scattered through towns and villages, were as so many farms, the culture of which he assigns to each presbyter."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Rule and office are recognized in the N. T. Church, and those who guide its affairs receive a variety of names. But they are never described as being lords over the flock."

### John Gill:
1. "Not as those who domineer over such that are appointed in the dignities of the priesthood." 
2. "They are not to take upon them an absolute authority over the consciences of men; they are not to teach for doctrines the commandments of men; nor to have the dominion over the faith of men, but to be helpers of their joy."
3. "They should go before the flock, and set an example to believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity."

### John Wesley:
1. "Neither as lording over the heritage ‚Äî Behaving in a haughty, domineering manner, as though you had dominion over their conscience."
2. "The word translated heritage, is, literally, the portions. There is one flock under the one chief Shepherd; but many portions of this, under many pastors."
