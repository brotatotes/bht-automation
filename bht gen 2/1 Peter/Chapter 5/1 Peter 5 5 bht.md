## BHT:
Instructed to humbly submit to our elders, we are reminded to show respect and deference to those who are older. As followers of Christ, we are encouraged to clothe ourselves in humility, tightly binding it around us. This call to humility reflects the example of Jesus, who modeled servanthood by washing His disciples' feet. God opposes pride but extends grace to the humble. Let us embrace humility, acknowledging the wisdom of our elders and showing respect to others. By doing so, we demonstrate a spirit of deference, reflecting the character of Christ in our lives.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "So Christ uses the term 'younger.' For He explains it by 'he that doth serve,' literally, 'he that ministereth as a deacon'; just as He explains 'the greatness' by 'he that is chief,' literally, 'he that ruleth,' the very word applied to the bishops or presbyters." 
2. "Then translate, 'Gird fast on humility (lowliness of mind) to one another.' The verb is literally, 'tie on with a fast knot.' Or, 'gird on humility as the slave dress (encomboma)': as the Lord girded Himself with a towel to perform a servile office of humility and love, washing His disciples' feet."
3. "Pride caused the need of man's clothing, and pride still reigns in dress; the Christian therefore clothes himself in humility. God provides him with the robe of Christ's righteousness, in order to receive which man must be stripped of pride."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Submit yourselves unto the elder - That is, with the respect due to their age, and to the offices which they sustain."

3. "The proud...To the humble."

### John Calvin:
1. "He bids every one that is inferior in age to obey the counsels of the elders, and to be teachable and humble; for the age of youth is inconstant, and requires a bridle."
2. "For, when authority is granted to the elders, there is not given them the right or the liberty of throwing off the bridle, but they are also themselves to be under due restraint, so that there may be a mutual subjection."
