# 1 Peter 5:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In times of affliction and suffering, we are called to humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God. This means recognizing His authority and submitting to His will. It is a reminder to not exalt ourselves or display pride, but to acknowledge our lowliness and dependence on Him. This humility should be accompanied by patience, as we await God's appointed time for exaltation. Just as the hand of God can bring troubles, it can also uplift and exalt us when we approach Him with humility and trust in His timing.
