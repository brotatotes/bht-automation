# 1 Peter 5:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are encouraged to unload their cares and worries onto God, for He is willing and able to handle any troubles that they may face. This requires a complete trust in God's care and provision, surrendering all worries and concerns to Him. By doing so, believers can find rest and peace knowing that God is in control and will provide for their needs.
