# 1 Peter 5:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Be vigilant and sober-minded. Let your mind be clear, focused on the things of God and free from the distractions and worries of this world. The devil is like a roaring lion, seeking to devour and destroy. But do not fear, for greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world. Stay alert, aware of the enemy’s schemes, and resist him steadfastly, standing firm in your faith.
