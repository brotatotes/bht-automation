2. "Steadfast is Anglo-Saxon, stede, a place, and faest, fast; and hence means firm in its place; but stereoi conveys also the sense of compactness, compact solidity, and is appropriate, since a number of individuals are addressed and exhorted to withstand the onset of Satan as one compacted body."
