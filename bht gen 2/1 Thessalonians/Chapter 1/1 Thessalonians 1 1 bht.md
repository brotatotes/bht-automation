## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He does not name himself an Apostle, probably for (an amplification of) the reason given by De Wette, because his Apostleship needed not any substantiation to the Thessalonians."
2. "We may notice that the gen. plur. of the persons constituting the church occurs only in the addresses of these two Epistles."
3. "The ἐν, as usual, denotes communion and participation in, as the element of spiritual life."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "An undesigned propriety in the Epistles, evincing genuineness."
2. "So realizing was their Christian faith, that they were able hourly to look for the Lord Jesus."
3. "This marks that they were no longer heathen. This marks that they were not Jews, but Christians."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Silvanus, or Silas, and Timothy were properly united with him on this occasion, because they had been with him when the church was founded there."
2. "Silas is first mentioned in the New Testament as one who was sent by the church at Jerusalem with Paul to Antioch, and he afterward became his traveling companion."
3. "Which is in God the Father, and in the Lord Jesus Christ - Who are united to the true God and to the Redeemer; or who sustain an intimate relation to the Father and the Lord Jesus."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Paul 's official title; 'Apostle' is omitted in the addresses of both Epistles, although in 1 Thessalonians 2:6 he uses ajpostoloi apostles, including Silvanus and Timothy under that title. The title appears in all the other Epistles except Philippians and Philemon."
2. "The use of the genitive of the national name is peculiar. Comp. 1 Corinthians 1:22; 2 Corinthians 1:1; Galatians 1:2; Philippians 1:1; Colossians 1:2."
3. "In both Hebrew and N. T. usage, ejkklhsia implies a community based on a special religious idea, and established in a special way. In N. T. it is also used in a narrower sense, of a single church, or of a church confined to a single place."

### John Calvin:
1. "The brevity of the inscription clearly shews that Paul’s doctrine had been received with reverence among the Thessalonians, and that without controversy they all rendered to him the honor that he deserved."
2. "The ministers of Satan, it is true, had endeavored to trouble this Church also, but it is evident that their machinations were fruitless."
3. "By which terms (if I mistake not) he intimates, that there is truly among the Thessalonians a Church of God. This mark, therefore, is as it were an approval of a true and lawful Church."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The omission of the official title Apostle can scarcely be accounted for by supposing that Paul had not yet assumed it, but is due to the affection subsisting between him and his Thessalonian converts." 
2. "In God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. The former predicate ‘in God the Father,’ distinguishes it from the Gentile assemblies; the latter, ‘in the Lord Jesus Christ,’ from the Jewish congregation."
3. "Grace unto you, and peace. Paul wishes them a participation in God’s undeserved favour, the grace that has brought salvation to men; and in that peace which the Lord bequeathed to His followers."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul does not here call himself 'apostle' as in the later Epistles, perhaps because his position has not been so vigorously attacked as it was later."
2. "This church is grounded in and exists in the sphere and power of God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
3. "These words, common in Paul's Epistles, bear 'the stamp of Paul's experience.' They are not commonplace salutations, but the old words 'deepened and spiritualised.'"

### John Gill:
1. "Paul, who is called by his bare name, lest these young converts should be offended and stumble at any pompous title, which they might imagine carried an appearance of arrogance and pride." 
2. "Silvanus and Timothy are mentioned to show their continued harmony and consent in the doctrines of the Gospel." 
3. "The church is described as being in God the Father, having his love and favor, and in fellowship with him. They were also described as being in the Lord Jesus Christ, chosen in him, and in communion with him."

### John Wesley:
1. "St. Paul neither uses the title of an apostle, nor any other, as writing to pious and simple-hearted men, with the utmost familiarity." 
2. "There is a peculiar sweetness in this epistle, unmixed with any sharpness or reproof."
3. "Those evils which the apostles afterward reproved having not yet crept into the church."
