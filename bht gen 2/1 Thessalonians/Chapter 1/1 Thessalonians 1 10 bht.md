# 1 Thessalonians 1:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The hope of the second coming of Christ is not just a wish, but a steadfast and certain expectation. God raised Jesus from the dead, confirming his Sonship. Through his death and resurrection, Jesus not only redeemed us from sin but also delivers us from the coming wrath. This wrath is the divine judgment that will be poured out on the unbelieving. However, for those who trust in Jesus, there is deliverance in this life and in the world to come. Jesus is our eternal Deliverer, bringing us true hope and salvation.
