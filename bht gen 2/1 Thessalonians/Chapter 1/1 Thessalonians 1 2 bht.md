# 1 Thessalonians 1:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We express our gratitude to God continually for each and every one of you, recognizing the existence of a church and acknowledging the gifts bestowed upon them. Furthermore, we give thanks for the virtues that have been manifested within them -- virtues that are the result of the grace and goodness of God. In all of this, we attribute no credit to ourselves, but rather attribute everything to God and His working in the lives of the Thessalonian believers. We are forever grateful and offer our thanks to Him for His faithful work among them.

3. "ἀδιαλείπτως seems by the nearly parallel place, Romans 1:9, to belong to μνείαν ὑμ. ποι., not to μνημονεύοντες, as Lün., Pelt, al."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The structure of the sentences in this and the following verses, each successive sentence repeating with greater fulness the preceding, characteristically marks Paul's abounding love and thankfulness in respect to his converts."
