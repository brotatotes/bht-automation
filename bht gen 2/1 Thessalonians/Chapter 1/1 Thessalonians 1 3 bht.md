# 1 Thessalonians 1:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These quotes highlight the active nature of faith and love. Faith is not a passive belief but actively engages in various tasks. Love, on the other hand, labors continually for others. The Thessalonian believers had a strong and enduring hope in Christ, serving as an anchor in their lives. Their faith, love, and hope were not superficial or insincere but were recognized and commended by God. It is important to remember and praise them for their diligent efforts and steadfast commitment to the work of the Kingdom.
