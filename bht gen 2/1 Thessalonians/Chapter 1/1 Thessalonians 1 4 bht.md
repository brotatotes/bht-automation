# 1 Thessalonians 1:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Knowing your election, which is through faith, is a profound understanding of being chosen by God. This election is not a result of human effort, but is based on God's sovereign will and love. It is evidenced by the effectual calling, which is the fruit of God's grace.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἐκλογή must not be softened down: it is the election unto life of individual believers by God."
2. "ὑμῶν, objective genitive after ἐκλογήν knowing that God ἐξελέξατο ὑμᾶς."
3. "ὑπὸ θεοῦ belongs to ἠγαπημένοι, as in 2 Thessalonians 2:13, see also Romans 1:7; not to εἰδότες, as Est. thinks possible (ὑπό for παρά?), nor to ἐκλογήν either as E. V., ‘your election of God,’ which is ungrammatical (requiring τὴν ὑπ. θ. ἐκ.), or as Œc., Thl., all., ὑπὸ θ. τὴν ἐκλ. ὑμ. (εἶναι), which would introduce an irrelevant emphasis on ὑπὸ θεοῦ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Your election of God...means that God has elected you as individual believers to eternal life."
2. "The Greek is rather, 'beloved by God'."

### John Calvin:
1. "For it tended in no small degree to recommend them — that God himself had testified by many tokens, that they were acceptable and dear to him."
2. "the reason is immediately added — that it was not a bare preaching that had been brought to them, but such as was conjoined with the efficacy of the Holy Spirit, that it might obtain entire credit among them."
3. "the election of God, which is in itself hid, is manifested by its marks—when he gathers to himself the lost sheep and joins them to his flock, and holds out his hand to those that were wandering and estranged from him."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Knowing (ειδοτες)... since we know, the third participle with the principal verb" 
2. "The use of αδελφο for members of the same brotherhood can be derived from the Jewish custom"
