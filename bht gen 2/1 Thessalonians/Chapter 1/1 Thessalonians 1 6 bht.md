### Albert Barnes:

2. "The manner in which the Saviour lived was a prominent topic of their preaching, and also that it was one of the means of the conversion of the Thessalonians...Nothing is better adapted to show them the evil of their own guilty lives than the contrast between their lives and his."

### John Calvin:
1. "The sum, therefore, is this — that an evidence of Divine election shewed itself not only in Paul’s ministry, in so far as it was furnished with the power of the Holy Spirit but also in the faith of the Thessalonians, so that this conformity is a powerful attestation of it."

3. "For we see very many, not otherwise disinclined to the gospel, who, nevertheless, avoid it, from being intimidated through fear of the cross. Those, accordingly, who do not hesitate with intrepidity to embrace along with the gospel the afflictions that threaten them, furnish in this an admirable example of magnanimity."
