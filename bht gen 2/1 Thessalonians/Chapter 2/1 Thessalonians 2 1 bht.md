# 1 Thessalonians 2:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, the author expands on what was previously mentioned in 1 Thessalonians 1:5-6. Firstly, he discusses Paul and his fellow laborers and how they conducted themselves in their preaching and ministry. Then, he shifts the focus to the Thessalonians themselves and how they had received and embraced the message that was proclaimed to them. It is a continuation of the theme of the previous verses, providing further insights into the dynamics of the relationship between the messengers and the recipients of the gospel.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He makes use now of that knowledge to carry out the description of his preaching among them, with a view, by recapitulating these details, to confirm them, who were as yet but novices, in the faith."
2. "And within this limitation, we may observe that the verb is γέγονεν, not ἐγένετο; to be understood therefore not of any mere intent of the Apostle at the time of his coming among them, but of some abiding character of his preaching."
3. "It probably expresses, that his εἴσοδος was and continued 'no empty scheme' (‘no light matter,’ as we say; οὐχ ἡ τυχοῦσα, Chrys.), but an earnest, bold, self-denying endeavour for their good."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Not only do strangers report it, but you know it to be true [ALFORD] 'yourselves.'" 
2. "It was full of 'power' (1 Thessalonians 2:13-52.2.16-:). The Greek for 'was,' expresses rather 'hath been and is,' implying the permanent and continuing character of his preaching."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Paul frequently appeals to his own life, and to what they, among whom he labored, knew of it, as a full refutation of the slanderous accusations of his enemies."
2. "Every minister of the gospel ought so to live as to be able, when slanderously attacked, to make such an appeal to his people."
3. "The object does not appear to be so much to show that their ministry was successful, as to meet a charge of their adversaries that they were impostors. Paul tells them that from their own observation they knew that this was not so."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Was not in vain [ου κενη γεγονεν] . More accurately, hath not proved vain. Kenh is empty. Mataia, also rendered vain, is fruitless.

### John Calvin:
1. "He now...reminds the Thessalonians of what they had themselves experienced...for confirming their faith."
2. "It was therefore an evidence of a Divine work that Paul...did...shew no hesitation in making an attempt upon a large and opulent city, with the view of subjecting the inhabitants of it to Christ."
3. "In the second department the same Divine power is beheld...he stood firm and undaunted, from which it appears that he was held up by the hand of God." (57 words)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For yourselves know. What I say of our preaching I do not say without warrant, nor need I rest it on the testimony of others, for yourselves are my witnesses."
2. "That it hath not been vain. This is generally supposed to refer not to the effects but to the essential character of the preaching; as if Paul had said, It was not vapid and unreal and powerless."
3. "But the tense of the verb indicates that the word ‘vain’ involves in Paul’s mind something still existing; therefore not a quality attaching to the preaching itself, but to its effects; as it be had said, It has not been useless and inefficacious."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For yourselves know...that it hath not been found vain." 
2. "Every pastor watches wistfully to see what will be the outcome of his work."
3. "Κενος is hollow, empty, while ματαιος is fruitless, ineffective."

### John Gill:
1. "It was not a vain show with outward pomp and splendour... but with great meanness, poverty, reproach, and persecution."
2. "The doctrine they taught was not comparable to chaff and wind; it was not corrupt philosophy and vain deceit, the traditions and commandments of men, but sound doctrine, the wholesome words of our Lord Jesus Christ."
3. "Their coming to Thessalonica was not a human scheme, a rash enterprise, engaged in on their own heads, on a slight and empty foundation; but upon good and solid grounds, by divine direction and counsel."

### John Wesley:
1. What was proposed, 1 Thessalonians 1:5,6, is now more largely treated of: concerning Paul and his fellowlabourers, 1 Thessalonians 2:1-12; concerning the Thessalonians, 1 Thessalonians 2:13-16.
