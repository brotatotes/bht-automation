# 1 Thessalonians 2:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As witnesses from God, they exhorted and consoled, persuading others to willingly and joyfully embrace the truth of religion. This personal and individual dealing, like a father caring for his children, led to a slow, toilsome, and affectionate application of the Gospel to individuals. By testifying and appealing to what God had revealed, they provided a solid and affectionate guidance, ensuring that converts understood and continued in their faith, looking to Christ as their only Savior and finding comfort in His soul comforting doctrines.

2. "No one will ever be a good pastor, unless he shows himself to be a father to the Church that is committed to him."

2. "Comforted...with the soul comforting doctrines of free justification by the righteousness of Christ, of full pardon by his blood, and of a plenary satisfaction and atonement by his sacrifice; and under all their afflictions and persecutions for the sake of Christ, with exceeding great and precious promises of the presence, grace, and strength of Christ here, and glory hereafter."
