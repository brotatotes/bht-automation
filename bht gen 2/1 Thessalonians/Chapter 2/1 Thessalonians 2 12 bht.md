# 1 Thessalonians 2:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is a call to be part of God's kingdom and to share in His glory. This means living in a way that honors God, reflecting His kindness, righteousness, and holiness. Our response to this calling should be to walk worthily of God, imitating His works and living as children of the light. This is because God, who is holy, has called us to Himself, and it is only fitting that we strive to be holy like Him.
