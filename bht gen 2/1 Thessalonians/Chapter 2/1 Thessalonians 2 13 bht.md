### John Calvin:
1. "The circumstance, therefore, that the word of God is regarded by many with such contempt, that it is scarcely held in any estimation — that many are not at all actuated by fear, arises from this, that they do not consider that they have to do with God."
2. "Hence we learn from this passage what credit ought to be given to the gospel — such as does not depend on the authority of men, but, resting on the sure and ascertained truth of God, raises itself above the world; and, in fine, is as far above mere opinion, as heaven is above earth."
3. "There is a mistake on the part of Erasmus in rendering it, 'the word of the hearing of God,' as if Paul meant that God had been manifested. He afterwards changed it thus, 'the word by which you learned God,' for he did not advert to the Hebrew idiom."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "His thankfulness was no doubt intensified by the apparent unlikelihood that the word of a stranger, a Jew, without wealth or influence, without letters of commendation, without even a good command of Greek and a good accent; of a man still limping from the wounds he had received at Philippi, should be received as the word of God."
2. "Paul felt an indescribable joy when he found that his simple scheme of deliverance from evil, his gospel, worked; that it not only looked well on paper, but actually made men holy and courageous.

3. "God works by and with his word, and his word only effectually works when it comes in power; or is the power of God unto salvation to them that believe"
