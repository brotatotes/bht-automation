# 1 Thessalonians 2:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The believers in this passage showed their faith by mirroring the endurance of other churches, enduring persecution at the hands of their own countrymen. Their patient endurance in the face of opposition was a visible manifestation of the power of God's word working in their lives. This similarity in the fruits of their faith, their afflictions, and their experiences serves as compelling evidence for the truth of the Gospel. The perseverance and steadfastness demonstrated by these believers in the midst of persecution strengthen our understanding of the transformative work of Christ in the lives of His followers.
