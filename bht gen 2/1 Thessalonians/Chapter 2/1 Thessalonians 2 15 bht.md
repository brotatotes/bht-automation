# 1 Thessalonians 2:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Their actions were both heinous and damning, for they not only killed the Lord Jesus but also persecuted the prophets and the apostles. Their opposition went beyond one nation or religion; it was contrary to all men, as they sought to hinder the salvation of the Gentiles. Their relentless persecution and hostility revealed their true nature, destined for everlasting destruction. This opposition to God was not a new phenomenon but a continuation of their forefathers' resistance. The Jews, infamous for their stubborn faith and hostility towards others, were stripped of honor, leaving them with nothing but infamy.
