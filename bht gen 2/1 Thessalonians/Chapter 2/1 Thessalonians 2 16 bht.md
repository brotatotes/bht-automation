# 1 Thessalonians 2:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jews hindered the preaching of the Gospel to the Gentiles, filling up the measure of their sins and becoming ripe for vengeance. The wrath of God came upon them to the utmost extent, exhausting its force on them. Their opposition to the Gospel resulted in stumbling blocks and a great stumbling block was created when they accused Paul of profaning the gospel. However, the salvation of the Gentiles was freely offered to them as it was to the Jews. The divine wrath had already begun and would be manifested in the judgment to come.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "not of the result merely, ‘so that,’ but of the intention, not of the Jews themselves, but of their course of conduct, viewed as having an intent in the divine purposes: as so often in St. Paul."
2. "the (predestined, or predicted, or merited) wrath (of God) came upon them (he looks back on the fact in the divine counsels as a thing in past time, q. d. 'was appointed to come:’ not 'has come.’ No sense of anticipation need be sought in ἔφθασεν in later Greek, except when it governs an accusative of the person, as ch. 1 Thessalonians 4:15; see reff.) to the utmost (to the end of it, i.e. the wrath: so that it shall exhaust all its force on them..."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Their hindrance of the Gospel preaching to the Gentiles was the last measure added to their continually accumulating iniquity, which made them fully ripe for vengeance."
2. "But," they shall proceed no further, for "the divine wrath has come upon them to the uttermost"; not merely partial wrath, but wrath to its full extent, "even to the finishing stroke."
3. "The past tense implies that the fullest visitation of wrath was already begun. Already in A.D. 48, a tumult had occurred at the Passover in Jerusalem, when about thirty thousand were slain; a foretaste of the whole vengeance which speedily followed."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Paul maintained that the Jews and Gentiles were now on a level with regard to salvation; that the wall of partition was broken down; that the Jew had no advantages over the rest of mankind in this respect, and that the pagan might be saved without becoming Jews, or being circumcised."
2. "Paul maintained just the opposite opinion, that pagans might be saved without becoming proselytes to the Jewish system, and that, in fact, salvation was as freely offered to them as to the children of Abraham."
3. "The 'wrath of God' may be said to have come upon a man when he abandons him, even though there may not be as yet any external expressions of his indignation."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "To speak - that they might be saved... to tell the Gentiles that they might be saved."
2. "Always blind and stubborn, the Jews filled up the measure of their sins by their treatment of Christ and his apostles."
3. "The wrath of God had not come upon them to the uttermost. The meaning is that the divine wrath had reached the point where it passed into judgment."

### John Calvin:
1. "For as they furiously opposed the Gospel everywhere, there arose from this a great stumblingblock, more especially as they exclaimed that the gospel was profaned by Paul, when he published it among the Gentiles."
2. "Paul charges them with this crime — that they regard the salvation of the Gentiles with envy, but adds, that matters are so, in order that their sins may be filled up, that he may take away from them all reputation for piety."
3. "By this we are warned that we must carefully take heed lest, in the event of our adding from time to time sin to sin, as is wont to happen generally, the heap at last reaches as high as heaven."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Jews were always blind and stubborn; but when they slew their Lord, and drove forth His apostles, they filled up the measure of their iniquities." 
2. "In the beginning of sin and evil it seems as if men were free agents and had the power of going on or retreating. But as the crisis of their late approaches, they are bound under a curse; and the form in which their destiny presents itself to our minds, is as though it were certain, and only a question of time now soon it is to be fulfilled."
3. "To the apostle, reading the future in the present, the state of Judæa at any time during the last thirty years before the destruction of the city, would have been sufficient to justify the expression, ‘wrath is come upon them to the uttermost’."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They not simply oppose his work among the Jews, but also to the Gentiles... That they may be saved" 
2. "It was the only hope of the Gentiles, Christ alone and not the mystery-religions offered any real hope."
3. "Paul vividly foresees and foretells the final outcome of this attitude of hate on the part of the Jews. Tristis exitus, Bengel calls it. Paul speaks out of a sad experience."
