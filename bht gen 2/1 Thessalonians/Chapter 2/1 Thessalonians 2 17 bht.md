# 1 Thessalonians 2:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Amidst the heartfelt emotions expressed by the apostle, there is a deeper understanding to be gleaned. It is not merely a fleeting affection that Paul displays in his longing, but rather a notable example of his steadfastness. His temporary separation from the Thessalonians stirred up transient passions, but it is crucial to discern the enduring disposition of his soul, which serves as the foundation from which these emotions flow.
