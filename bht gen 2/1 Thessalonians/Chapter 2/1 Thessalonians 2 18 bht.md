# 1 Thessalonians 2:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul desired to come to the Thessalonians, but Satan hindered him, likely through the persecuting Jews in Acts 17:13 who stirred up trouble and prevented him from returning to them. Satan, as his name implies, is continuously working against the Gospel and the growth of the Church, seeking to obstruct the will of God and the execution of His plans. However, his power is limited and can only act with divine permission, never being able to ultimately thwart God's purposes.
