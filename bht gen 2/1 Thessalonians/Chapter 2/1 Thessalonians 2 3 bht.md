## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The two senses of παράκλησις, exhortation and consolation, so easily passing into one another (compare 1Th 2:11), are suggestive of the external state of the early church, sorrowing amid the evils of the world, and needing as its first lesson to be comforted; and not less suggestive of the first lesson of the Gospel to the individual soul, of peace in believing." 
2. "'The word is used transitively and intransitively. In the former case, it is ‘imposture’ (Mat 27:64) or ‘seduction’ (Eph 4:14): in the latter and more usual, error." 
3. "Still such a meaning seems to want example. If it be correct, this represents (Lün.) the subjective side, the motive, as ἐκ πλάνης the objective side, the ground."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For—The ground of his 'boldness' (1 Thessalonians 2:2), his freedom from all 'deceit, uncleanness, and guile'." 
2. "'Uncleanness, in relation to one's self (impure motives of carnal self-gratification in gain, Ephesians 4:14- :), or lust; such as actuated false teachers of the Gentiles (Philippians 1:16; 2 Peter 2:10; 2 Peter 2:14; Judges 1:8; Revelation 2:14; Revelation 2:15)." 
3. "The same Gospel which exhorts comforts. Its first lesson to each is that of peace in believing amidst outward and inward sorrows."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The means which they used to induce them to become Christians were not such as to delude them."
2. "It was such as to lead to holiness and purity."
3. "No point was carried by art, cunning, or stratagem. Everything was done on the most honorable and fair principles."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Our exhortation did not proceed from any false teaching which we had ourselves received." 
2. "Here in the sense of impurity on the side of sordidness."
3. "Paul means that his exhortation did not proceed from greed for gain or lust for power."

### John Calvin:
1. "He maintains that his doctrine was free from all deception and uncleanness."
2. "He declares his integrity, inasmuch as he had not come to them under the influence of any impure desire, but actuated solely by upright disposition."
3. "He had done nothing fraudulently or maliciously, but had, on the contrary, manifested a simplicity befitting a minister of Christ."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "Paul is keenly sensitive against charges against the correctness of his message and the purity of his life."
3. "There was no necessary connection in the popular mind between religion and morals. The ecstatic initiations in some of the popular religions were grossly sensual."

### John Gill:
1. "The ministry of the Gospel... consisted of doctrines full of comfort to distressed minds, such as free justification by the righteousness of Christ, full pardon by his blood, and complete satisfaction by his sacrifice."
2. "It was no imposture... the ministers of it connive at uncleanness in others, or practise it themselves... the doctrine which is according to godliness, and which teaches men to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts."
3. "There was no artifice used in the dispensing of it; it was plain and simple, without any colour and guile... because there was nothing false, impure, or artful in it."
