# 1 Thessalonians 2:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostles did not stoop to using words of flattery, for they preached the truth about human nature and sin. Instead of seeking to please men, they boldly exposed the sins of the people and called them to repentance and faith in Christ. They did not hide any secret motives behind their preaching; their intentions were pure and their aim was to serve Christ and the well-being of souls. This was evident in their open and honest proclamation of the gospel, as witnessed by both men and by God Himself.
