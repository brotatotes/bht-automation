# 1 Thessalonians 2:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul and his companions demonstrated gentleness and tenderness towards the Thessalonians. They did not seek personal gain or advantage, but rather genuinely cared about the well-being and spiritual growth of others. They nurtured the Thessalonians with the sincere milk of the word, treating them with the kindness and affection of a mother nursing her own children. This gentle and nurturing approach reflected their selflessness and genuine concern for the Thessalonians' welfare.
