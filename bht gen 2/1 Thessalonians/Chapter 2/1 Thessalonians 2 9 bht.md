# 1 Thessalonians 2:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostles labored with great diligence and exerted themselves to the point of weariness. They did not seek their own comfort or burden others for support. Instead, they worked tirelessly both day and night to fulfill their ministry of preaching the Word. This involved not only the physical labor of teaching, but also the mental labor of prayer, study, and preparation. Their dedication and selflessness serve as an example for all who are in service to the Lord.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Labour and pains: no distinction can be established."
2. "In order not to burden any of you, viz. by accepting from you the means of sustenance."
3. "To you not quite = ὑμῖν: the latter represents the preaching more as a thing imparted, this as a thing diffused."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Greek for 'labor' means hardship in bearing; that for 'travail,' hardship in doing; the former, toil with the utmost solicitude; the latter, the being wearied with fatigue."  
2. "Their labors with their hands for a scanty livelihood had to be engaged in not only by day, but by night also, in the intervals between spiritual labors."  
3. "Though but 'three Sabbaths' are mentioned, Acts 17:2, these refer merely to the time of his preaching to the Jews in the synagogue. When rejected by them as a body, after having converted a few Jews, he turned to the Gentiles."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Ye remember, brethren, our labour...And travail - see the notes on 2 Corinthians 11:27. The word means 'wearisome labor.'" 
2. "For labouring night and day - That is, when he was not engaged in preaching the gospel. He appears to have labored through the week and to have preached on the Sabbath; or if engaged in preaching in the day time during the week, he made it up by night labor." 
3. "We preached unto you the gospel of God - That is, I supported myself when I preached among you. No one, therefore, could say that I was disposed to live in idleness; no one that I sought to make myself rich at the expense of others."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Kopov emphasises fatigue, mocqov hardship."
2. "Rend. that we might not burden. Put you to expense for our support."
3. "Comp. 2 Thessalonians 3:8."

### John Calvin:
1. "To spare them he did not spare himself."
2. "He must assuredly have burned with a wonderful and more than human zeal, inasmuch as, along with the labor of teaching, he labors with his hand as an operative, with the view of earning a livelihood."
3. "Paul, therefore, in laying no burden upon the Thessalonians, does something more than could, from the requirements of his office, have been required from him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Toil and travail. These words, and the expression ‘night and day,’ are intended to bring out strongly the very hard and exhausting labour in which Paul was involved by his desire to support himself while ministering in the Gospel to the Thessalonians."
2. "That Paul did not mean to impose on the ministers of Christ in general a law of self-maintenance, is sufficiently obvious from his treatment of the whole subject in 1 Corinthians 9:0."
3. "He saw reason to adopt it as his own usual rule (though he sometimes accepted pecuniary assistance, 2 Corinthians 11:8), but spoke of his own practice as exceptional, not normal, and emphatically asserted the right of the labourer to his hire a notable proof of Paul’s sagacity and freedom from bias in judgment."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Travail (μοχθον). Old word for difficult labour, harder than κοπος (toil)." 
2. "Night and day (νυκτος κα ημερας). Genitive case, both by day and by night, perhaps beginning before dawn and working after dark."
3. "That we might not burden any of you (προς το μη επιβαρησα τινα υμων). Use of προς with the articular infinitive to express purpose (only four times by Paul)."

### John Gill:
1. "The great pains they took, even to weariness."
2. "Neither to the whole body, nor to any single person; which shows that they did not seek their own ease and worldly interest."
3. "For the ministry of the word is a work, and a laborious one, when closely attended to; a preparation for it by prayer, reading, meditation, and much study, are wearisome and fatiguing."
