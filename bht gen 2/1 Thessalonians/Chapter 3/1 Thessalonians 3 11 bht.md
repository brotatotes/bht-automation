1. "May God Himself, even our Father (there being but one article in the Greek, requires this translation, 'He who is at once God and our Father'), direct."
2. "It is a remarkable proof of the unity of the Father and Son, that in the Greek here, and in 2 Thessalonians 2:16; 2 Thessalonians 2:17, the verb is singular, implying that the subject, the Father and Son, are but one in essential Being, not in mere unity of will."
3. "Paul does not think the prosperous issue of a journey an unfit subject for prayer."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The reference is particularly to the 'Father,' the First Person of the Trinity. It does not refer to the divine nature in general, or to God as such, but to God as the Father of the Lord Jesus."
2. "What can be its meaning, unless the apostle believed that the Lord Jesus had power to direct his way to them, and that it was proper for him to express this wish to him; that is, to pray to him?"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Our God and Father himself" - Note one article with both substantives for one person.
2. "Direct our way" - First aorist optative (acute accent on penult, not circumflex first aorist active infinitive) of κατευθυνω, old verb to make straight path. Singular verb also, though both God and Christ mentioned as subject (unity in the Godhead).
3. "Apart from μη γενοιτο ( may it not come to pass ) the optative in a wish of the third person is found in N.T. only in 1 Thessalonians 3:11; 1 Thessalonians 3:12; 1 Thessalonians 5:23; 2 Thessalonians 2:17; 2 Thessalonians 3:5; 2 Thessalonians 3:16; Romans 15:5; Romans 15:13."

2. "He is the Father of Christ, and of all the saints...mentioned to encourage freedom and boldness in prayer...and to raise an expectation of succeeding and receiving an answer."
3. "Our Lord Jesus Christ...is equally the object of prayer with God his Father and ours; who is...truly and properly God, who knows all things, and is the Almighty, and whose grace is sufficient for us."

### John Wesley:
1. Direct our way — This prayer is addressed to Christ, as well as to the Father.
