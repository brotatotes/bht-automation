# 1 Thessalonians 3:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Timotheus, our brother and minister of God, has been sent to you as a fellow laborer in the Gospel of Christ. In sending Timothy, we highly honor him and you, Thessalonians, must receive him with great respect and treat him according to his character and office. Apart from the honor, one of the aims of the Gospel ministry is to bring comfort to those who are distressed or afflicted, as it is the will of God to speak comforting words to His people through the ministers of His Gospel.
