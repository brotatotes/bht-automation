# 1 Thessalonians 3:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the apostles were with the Thessalonians, they preached to them in person, sharing the Gospel and warning them about the tribulations they would face due to their faith. This was not just a mere prediction, but the fulfillment of God's appointed will. The Thessalonians themselves experienced the reality of the persecution that had been foretold, as seen in the tumultuous events that took place. Rather than being discouraged, these challenges served as a confirmation of the truth of their mission and ministry.
