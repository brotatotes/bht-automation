# 1 Thessalonians 3:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle expresses his deep gratitude to God, for he realizes that no thanksgiving can truly match the joy that fills his heart. This joy is not ordinary, but rather an extraordinary expression of vibrant life, ignited by the Thessalonians' unwavering faith and love. Their steadfastness in the face of trials and their growth in faith deserve fresh thanksgiving. The joy that Paul experiences is genuine and borne out of a sincere love for them, a joy that is not self-seeking or worldly, but one that withstands the scrutiny of God.
