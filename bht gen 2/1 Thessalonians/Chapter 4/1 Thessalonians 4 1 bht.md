2. "Many persons, like the son in the parable, seem to think that their knowledge of duty, and recognition of it in conscience, is some sort of compensation for their non-performance of it."
3. "The Thessalonians, however, were walking as Paul had directed them; but he knew the tendency there is to be content with a half-completed course, to allow some sin to remain because much has been cast out, to weary before the whole work is accomplished, and therefore he is bent upon having them ‘abound yet more.’"
