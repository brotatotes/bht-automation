# 1 Thessalonians 4:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The believers were commended for their love and their progress in exercising this grace towards one another. They had demonstrated love without partiality, embracing everyone. However, the apostle did not want them to become complacent with their current level of love. He urged them to increase and abound in their love, striving to love even more and extending their love to a wider circle of people. The goal was not perfection, for no grace or believer is perfect in this life, but a continuous growth in the expression of brotherly love.
