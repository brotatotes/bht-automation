# 1 Thessalonians 4:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The believers were urged to conduct themselves honorably, in a manner befitting their Christian profession. They were to be honest, faithful, and kind, doing good to others and showing respect. This would help create a positive impression on those outside of the church. By diligently working and providing for themselves, they would not be dependent on others, but instead be able to meet their own needs and generously assist those in need. This would prevent any reproach on the name of God and uphold the virtues of their faith.

2. "The phrase is to be taken in connection not merely with that which immediately precedes it - as if 'their walking honestly toward those who were without' would preserve them from want - but as meaning that their industrious and quiet habits; their patient attention to their own business, and upright dealing with every man, would do it."
3. "No man should be dependent on others as the result of idle habits; of extravagance and improvidence; of the neglect of his own business, and of intermeddling with that of others."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The literal sense is suggested by the familiar phrase in good form."
2. "Paul has in view the impression to be made by his readers on those outside of the church."
3. "In the latter case it would refer to depending upon others for their support, which some, in view of the immediately expected parousia, were disposed to do, neglecting their own business."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is probably derived from the expressions 'without the camp,' 'without the synagogue;' and conveys the idea of exclusion not simply from the Church, but from all that satisfies man."
