# 1 Thessalonians 4:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The insights shared remind us that Christianity beautifully acknowledges and affirms our love and desire for those who have passed away. Rather than diminishing or embittering our affection, the faith tempers and consoles our grief. It offers us a profound hope that enables us to hold onto our love for the departed within the larger context of the promise of resurrection and eternal life. This understanding allows us to approach our mourning with both tenderness and assurance, knowing that our love is not in vain but is ultimately embraced and fulfilled in Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "is with our Apostle a common formula of transition to the imparting of weighty information."
2. "He forbids ŒªœÖœÄŒµ·øñœÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ altogether. But we must remember, what sort of ŒªœÖœÄŒµ·øñœÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ it was. Surely not absolutely the mourning for our loss in their absence, but for theirs (see above), and in so far, for ours also."
3. "This shows of what kind their ŒªœçœÄŒ∑ was: viz. a grief whose ground was unbelief in a resurrection: which regarded the dead as altogether cut off from Christ‚Äôs heavenly kingdom."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Observe, the glory and chief hope of the Church are not to be realized at death, but at the Lord's coming; one is not to anticipate the other, but all are to be glorified together at Christ's coming."
2. "Death affects the mere individual; but the coming of Jesus the whole Church; at death our souls are invisibly and individually with the Lord; at Christ's coming the whole Church, with all its members, in body and soul, shall be visibly and collectively with Him."
3. "Not all natural mourning for dead friends is forbidden: for the Lord Jesus and Paul sinlessly gave way to it; but sorrow as though there were 'no hope,' which indeed the heathen had not: the Christian hope here meant is that of the resurrection."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Thessalonians were plainly distressed at the thought of separation from their departed brethren, and had partially lost sight of the elements of the Christian hope - reunion with them and fellowship with the Lord."
2. "The resurrection of Jesus involves the resurrection of believers. The living and the dead Christians shall alike be with the Lord."
3. "Only believers have hope of life after death. The speculations and surmisings of pagan philosophy do not amount to a hope."

### John Calvin:
1. "For we must not bewail the dead beyond due bounds, inasmuch as we are all to be raised up again."
2. "The knowledge of a resurrection is the means of moderating grief."
3. "Let, therefore, the grief of the pious be mixed with consolation, which may train them to patience. The hope of a blessed resurrection, which is the mother of patience, will effect this."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Death is called sleep by Pagan as well as by Christian writers...suggested by the stillness and repose...which characterize both conditions."
2. "No sleep lasts for ever, else it is not sleep; a waking follows every sleep...only a transitory state out of which body and soul shall together arise."
3. "These words do not merely forbid such sorrowing as the hopeless indulge in, but all sorrowing...To bewail their condition is wholly out of place."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "We do not wish. You ignorant." 
2. "No advantage in ignorance of itself." 
3. "This picture of the hopelessness of the pagan world about the future life is amply illustrated in ancient writings and particularly by inscriptions on tombs."

### John Gill:
1. "It was in common use among the Eastern nations, when they spoke of their dead, to say they were asleep."
2. "The apostle's view is not to encourage and establish a stoical apathy, a stupid indolence, and a brutal insensibility, which are contrary to the make of human nature, to the practice of the saints, and even of Christ and his apostles, and our apostle himself; but to forbid excessive and immoderate sorrow, and all the extravagant forms of it the Gentiles ran into."
3. "The words are to be understood not of other Christians, who have no hope of the eternal welfare of their deceased friends; not but that the sorrow of those who have a good hope of the future Well being of their dear relatives, must and ought to be greatly different from that of others, who have no hope at all."

### John Wesley:
1. "Herein the efficacy of Christianity greatly appears, - that it neither takes away nor embitters, but sweetly tempers, that most refined of all affections, our desire of or love to the dead."
