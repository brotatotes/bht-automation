## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Apostle here, as always, uses the direct term ἀπέθανε in reference to our Lord, to obviate all possible misconception: in reference to the faithful he appropriately uses the consolatory term κοιμᾶσθαι."
2. "In this they resemble: but in the expressed particulars here, they differ. Christ’s was simply ἀνέστη: theirs shall be a resurrection through Him, at His coming."
3. "The logical construction of the sentence seems to me so plainly to require the connexion of διὰ τοῦ Ἰησοῦ with κοιμηθέντας, that it must be a grammatical impossibility only, which can break that connexion."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Believers are laid in sleep by Jesus, and so will be brought back from sleep with Jesus in His train when He comes."
2. "The facts of Christ's experience are repeated in the believer's. He died and then rose: so believers shall die and then rise with Him."
3. "The same Hand that shall raise them is that which laid them to sleep."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The meaning is not that the fact of the resurrection depends on our believing that Jesus rose, but that the death and resurrection of the Saviour were connected with the resurrection of the saints; that the one followed from the other, and that the one was as certain as the other."
2. "They do not 'sleep' in paganism, or in infidelity, or in the gloom of atheism - but in the blessed hope which Jesus has imparted. They lie, as he did, in the tomb - free from pain and sorrow, and with the certainty of being raised up again."
3. "As the head was raised, so will all the members be. As God brought Christ from the grave, so will he bring them; that is, his resurrection made it certain that they would rise."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Which sleep should be, which have been laid asleep or have fallen asleep, giving the force of the passive."
2. "Dia tou Ihsou can by no possibility be rendered in Jesus, which would be ejn Ihsou : see 1 Corinthians 14:18; 1 Thessalonians 4:16. It must mean through or by means of Jesus."
3. "The attempt to construe dia tou Ihsou with touv koimhqentav those who have fallen asleep by means of Jesus, gives an awkward and forced interpretation. It has been explained by supposing a reference to martyrs who have died by Jesus; because of their faith in him."
4. "Dia tou Ihsou should be construed with axei will bring. Rend. the whole : them also that are fallen asleep will God through Jesus bring with him."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ was raised up from the dead, that we might be partakers of the same resurrection."
2. "Those who have doubts as to the resurrection, do great injury to Christ: nay more, they do in a manner draw him down from heaven."
3. "To sleep in Christ, is to retain in death the connection that we have with Christ, for those that are by faith ingrafted into Christ, have death in common with him, that they may be partakers with him of life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The argument is more fully drawn out in 1 Corinthians 15:0, in which passage, as here, Paul proceeds upon the fact of Christ’s resurrection, and from it infers the certainty of that of His people."
2. "In this argument is involved the important principle that Jesus Christ is the Head and Representative of His people, in such a sense that in His human history we see the history and experience of each Christian acted out in all its essential parts."
3. "It will be observed that while Paul uses the consolatory word ‘sleep’ when he speaks of believers, he uses the word ‘died’ when speaking of Christ. He does so because between the death of Christ and that of His people there was an essential difference; the one being an endurance of the curse, the other being exempt from this sting."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Assuming the death and resurrection of Jesus to be true."
2. "Through or by means of Jesus."
3. "Jesus is the connecting link for those that sleep and their resurrection."

### John Gill:
1. "Nothing is more certain or more comfortable, and more firmly to be believed, than that Christ died for the sins of his people, and rose again for their justification."
2. "The saints that are dead are not only represented as asleep, as before, but as 'asleep in Jesus'; to distinguish them from the other dead, the wicked; for the phrase of sleeping in death is promiscuously used of good and bad."
3. "To represent death as a sleep makes it very easy and familiar; but it is more so, when it is considered as sleeping in Jesus, in the arms of Jesus; and such as are asleep in him must needs be at rest, and in safety."

### John Wesley:
1. So — As God raised him.With him — With their living head.
