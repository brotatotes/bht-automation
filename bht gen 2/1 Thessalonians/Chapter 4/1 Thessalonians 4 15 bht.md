# 1 Thessalonians 4:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle Paul emphasizes that his message is not based on his own imagination, but on a direct revelation from the Lord. He wants to correct the belief that only those who remain alive until the coming of the Lord will have an advantage over the dead. In reality, the order of the resurrection will begin with the dead rising first. This reassures the Thessalonians and believers of all ages that there is no reason to be anxious about the fate of the dead in Christ.
