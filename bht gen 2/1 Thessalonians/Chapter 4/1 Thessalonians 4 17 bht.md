# 1 Thessalonians 4:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The believers are promised to be caught up to meet the Lord. This gathering together signifies the eternal life with Christ that all generations of Christians are encouraged to look forward to. The ascent to meet the Lord will be swift and carried out by the power of Christ. The believers will have a temporary stay in the air, which is not specified in the Bible. However, it is clear that their abode with the Lord is not in the air, but in heaven. This promise of eternal life is appointed specifically for those who hope in it.
