# 1 Thessalonians 4:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The will of God is for us to be sanctified, set apart for holiness in both our internal and external lives. Internally, the Spirit of God works in our hearts, illuminating our understanding, conforming our will to God's, and directing our affections towards divine things. Externally, our sanctification is demonstrated through a holy way of life. This includes abstaining from fornication, which was commonly practiced and accepted by the Gentiles. Let us strive for sanctification in all aspects, knowing it is God's desire for us.

2. "Therefore ·ºÅŒ≥ŒπŒ±œÉŒºœåœÇ must be taken in the most general sense, and that which is afterwards introduced, ·ºÄœÄŒ≠œáŒµœÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ, &c., as a part of our ·ºÅŒ≥ŒπŒ±œÉŒºœåœÇ."
3. "·ºÄœÄŒ≠œáŒµœÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ and Œµ·º∞Œ¥Œ≠ŒΩŒ±Œπ are not the negative and positive sides of ·ΩÅ ·ºÅŒ≥. ·ΩëŒº., but the latter (Œµ·º∞Œ¥Œ≠ŒΩŒ±Œπ to Œ¥ŒπŒµŒºŒ±œÅœÑœÖœÅŒ¨ŒºŒµŒ∏Œ±) further specifies and ensures the former."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is the will or command of God that you should be holy."
2. "The word here rendered 'sanctification'... means here 'purity of life,' and particularly abstinence from those vices which debase and degrade the soul."
3. "That ye should abstain from fornication - A vice which was freely indulged among the pagan, and to which, from that fact, and from their own former habits, they were particularly exposed."

### Marvin Vincent:

3. "About the time of Paul, a political sanction was given to this worship by deifying the Emperor as Cabeirus."

### John Calvin:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The reason why the precepts had been given and were to be kept, was that God desired their sanctification."
2. "What God wills and intends, He also makes provision for: hence the encouragement the Christian has in knowing that all his efforts after holiness are in accordance with that will which accomplishes all it designs."

2. "External sanctification arises from this, and lies in holiness of life and conversation."
3. "Abstinence from fornication being a branch of external holiness; and because this sin was common among the Gentiles, and not esteemed a sin by them."

### John Wesley:
1. "Sanctification ‚Äî Entire holiness of heart and life: particular branches of it are subjoined."
2. "That ye abstain from fornication ‚Äî A beautiful transition from sanctification to a single branch of the contrary; and this shows that nothing is so seemingly distant, or below our thoughts, but we have need to guard against it."
