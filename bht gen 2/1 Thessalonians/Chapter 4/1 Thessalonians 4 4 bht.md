# 1 Thessalonians 4:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To possess one's vessel in sanctification and honor requires knowledge and chastity. It means to enjoy one's spouse and exercise authority in a respectful way. This includes keeping the body under control and maintaining purity and chastity. Marriage is intended to promote holiness and self-control rather than giving in to natural desires.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "On the meaning of τὸ σκεῦος, there has been much difference. Very many Commentators understand it of 'the body.'"
2. "But a more fatal objection than any of the former is, that the context is entirely against the meaning. The ἁγιασμός has been explained to consist in ἀπέχεσθαι ἀπὸ τῆς πορνείας. And now this πορνεία comes to be specified, wherein it consists, and how it may be guarded against: viz. in carrying on the divinely-appointed commerce of the sexes in holiness and honour."
3. "Many have therefore understood σκεῦος in its literal meaning as applied to τὸ πρᾶγμα, i.e. the woman (or indeed the man, on the other side, inasmuch as the woman has ἐξουσία over his body...) So that thus it would be an exhortation to the woman also: so De Wette."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "know—by moral self-control."
2. "how to possess his vessel—rather as Greek, 'how to acquire (get for himself) his own vessel'"
3. "in sanctification—Thus, 'his own' stands in opposition to dishonoring his brother by lusting after his wife"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'vessel' here (σκεῦος skeuos), probably refers to the body...because it is that which contains the soul, or in which the soul is lodged."
2. "The injunction then is, that we should preserve the body pure...that we should honor it as a noble work of God, to be employed for pure purposes."
3. "The word body, however, accords more naturally with the usual signification of the word...It was the duty of females, and of the unmarried among the males, as well as of married men, to observe this command."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The entire passage exhibits two groups of parallel clauses; the one concerning sexual, and the other business relations."
2. "EiJudenai is used Hebraistically in the sense of have a care for, regard, as ch. 5 12, 'Know them that labor,' etc. : recognize their claim to respect, and hold them in due regard."
3. "The admonition aptly follows the charge to abstain from fornication. On the contrary, let each one treat honorably his own wife."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They were to abstain from fornication; and, that they might do so, each was to possess a wife of his own."
2. "Let every man get a wife of his own, that thus neither the public prostitute nor another man’s spouse may be a temptation to him."
3. "Men are therefore to marry that they may be pure and without shame."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Learn the habit of purity"
2. "The man shall acquire his own wife 'in sanctification and honour'"
3. "There is no double standard here."

### John Gill:
1. "And as there, husbands are to dwell with their wives according to knowledge, so here, knowledge is required to a man's possessing his vessel aright."
2. "Now for a man to possess his vessel in this sense is to enjoy his wife and to use that power he has over her in a becoming manner."
3. "For a man to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour is to keep under his body and bring it into subjection and preserve it in purity and chastity."

### John Wesley:
1. "That every one know - For this requires knowledge, as well as chastity."
2. "To possess his vessel - His wife."
3. "In sanctification and honour - So as neither to dishonour God or himself, nor to obstruct, but further, holiness; remembering, marriage is not designed to inflame, but to conquer, natural desires."
