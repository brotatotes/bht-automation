# 1 Thessalonians 4:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Marriage should be honored and cherished as an honorable and sanctifying union, without succumbing to the passion of lust. Those who do not know God may not have the same understanding of holiness and purity, lacking the knowledge of God's perfect holiness. Christians are held to a higher standard and responsibility due to their increased knowledge, as compared to those who are ignorant of God. It is important to recognize the gravity of actions that go against God's design for marriage, as they have far-reaching consequences.
