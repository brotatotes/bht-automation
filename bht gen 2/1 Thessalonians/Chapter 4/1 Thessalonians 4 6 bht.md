# 1 Thessalonians 4:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The interpretation of this teaching is that one should not go beyond the bounds of rectitude in acquiring possessions, taking advantage of or overreaching others. The Lord, as the coming Judge and Avenger, will ensure that those who defraud or deprive others of their rights will face consequences. It is a universal command to refrain from defrauding and taking advantage of others and should be heeded with a sense of fear and apprehension of God's judgment.
