# 1 Thessalonians 4:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The duty of showing love and kindness to fellow believers is an essential teaching of the Bible. It is a practical and tangible expression of God's love being enacted through us. This love is not superficial or mimicked, but rather, it is a result of being divinely taught and transformed by God Himself. It is a love that surpasses mere human affection and extends to all brothers and sisters in Christ. This divine teaching is written on our hearts, and its effect is evident in our actions, as we love others just as Christ has loved us.

### John Calvin:
1. "He assigns a reason — because they had been divinely taught — by which he means that love was engraven upon their hearts, so that there was no need of letters written on paper."
2. "He does not mean simply what John says in his first Canonical Epistle, the anointing will teach you, but that their hearts were framed for love; so that it appears that the Holy Spirit inwardly dictates efficaciously what is to be done, so that there is no need to give injunctions in writing."
3. "He subjoins an argument from the greater to the less; for as their love diffuses itself through the whole of Macedonia, he infers that it is not to be doubted that they love one another."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And He effects this by first of all knitting us to Himself. By loving Him we get into sympathy with all who love Him, and we also contract His own way of looking at men."
2. "So that where religion makes men severe rather than tender, censorious rather than meek and hopeful, proud rather than lowly, uncharitable in feeling and act rather than considerate and helpful, their religion is a failure."
3. "You need no one to teach you, for you yourselves are already taught, taught directly by Him whose ministers we are, taught by Him whose teaching not only enlightens conscience but animates the will, so that the result of His teaching is apparent in your conduct."

3. "Being written upon the hearts of the Thessalonians, by the finger of the Spirit of God, whereby they were dearly directed, and powerfully taught to exercise this grace, and discharge this duty, and under the influence of the same spirit did exercise it."

### John Wesley:
1. We need not write — Largely.For ye are taught of God — By his Spirit.
