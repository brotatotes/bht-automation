# 1 Thessalonians 5:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Concerning the precise times of these events, the Apostle Paul assures the believers that there is no need for him to write, for they have already received the necessary teachings on this subject. The focus of Paul's message is not to indulge in futile speculations about the timing, but rather to provide encouragement, comfort, and guidance for their faith, hope, and endurance in the midst of trials. The emphasis lies not on knowing when these events will occur, but on being prepared and watchful for the Lord's coming, for he intentionally keeps the exact timing hidden.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

3. "It is evident from this, as well as from other parts of this Epistle, that this had been, from some cause, a prominent topic which he had dwelt on when he was with them."

### Marvin Vincent:

3. "The distinction is so well marked that have the phrases cronou kairov the right moment of the time, and eukairov cronov the opportune moment."

### John Calvin:
1. "He speaks, however, by way of anticipation, saying, that they have no need that he should write as to those things which the curious desire to know."
2. "As, therefore, those waver between doubtful opinions who require that moments of time should be marked out for them, as if they would draw a conjecture from some plausible demonstration, he accordingly says that discussions of this nature are not necessary for the pious."
3. "Now Christ designed that the day of his coming should be hid from us, that, being in suspense, we might be as it were upon watch."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Paul therefore passes to this subject, and with instinctive courtesy and skill turns their minds from useless inquiries to profound moral truths."
2. "‚ÄòTimes and seasons‚Äô became a common expression, giving a greater completeness than either word alone would give; but probably the distinctive meaning of each word was lost sight of."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "ŒßœÅŒøŒΩŒøœÇ is rather an extended period and Œ∫Œ±ŒπœÅŒøœÇ a definite space of time."

### John Gill:
1. "To write to them concerning the things themselves was necessary and useful, to stir up and encourage their faith, hope, and expectation of them; to allay their grief for departed friends, and to comfort one another under the various trials and exercises of life." 
2. "But to write to them about the time of these things would be trifling and unnecessary, would be an idle speculation, and an indulging a vain curiosity." 
3. "For these things are equally true of Christ's second coming, as of the kingdom of Christ coming with power and glory, and of the destruction of Jerusalem."

### John Wesley:
1. But of the precise times when this shall be.
