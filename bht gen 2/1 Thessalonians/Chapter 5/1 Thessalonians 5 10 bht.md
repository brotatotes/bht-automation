## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "If we wish to preserve the uniformity of metaphor, we may interpret in this sense: that our Lord died for us, that whether we watch or sleep we should live."
2. "This interpretation confounds with the others, so the sense 'live or die' must be accepted, and the want of perspicuity with it."
3. "The construction of a subjunctive with Îµá¼´Ï„Îµ ... Îµá¼´Ï„Îµ is not classical: an optative is found in such cases."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "whether we wake or sleepâ€”whether we be found at Christ's coming awake, that is, alive, or asleep, that is, in our graves."
