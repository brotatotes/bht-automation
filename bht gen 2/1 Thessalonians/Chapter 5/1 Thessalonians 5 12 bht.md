## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The persons indicated by κοπιῶντας, προϊσταμένους, and νουθετοῦντας, are the same, viz. the πρεσβύτεροι or ἐπίσκοποι."
2. "ἐν κυρίῳ, as the element in which, the matter with regard to which, their presidency takes place: = 'in divine things.'"
3. "οὐκ ἐν τοῖς κοσμικοῖς, ἀλλ ' ἐν τοῖς κατὰ κύριον."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Recognize their office, and treat them accordingly with reverence and with liberality in supplying their needs."
2. "Labor" expresses their laborious life; "are over you," their pre-eminence as presidents or superintendents ("bishops," that is, overseers); "admonish you," one of their leading functions.
3. "Their presidency over you is in divine things; not in worldly affairs, but in things appertaining to the Lord."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'know' seems to mean that they were not to make themselves strangers to them - to be cold and distant toward them - to be ignorant of their needs, or to be indifferent to them."
2. "They should seek to be personally acquainted with him, and make him their confidant and counselor in their spiritual troubles."
3. "And they are to 'know' or regard him as their spiritual teacher and ruler; not to be strangers to the place where he preaches the word of life, and not to listen to his admonitions and reproofs as those of a stranger, but as those of a pastor and friend."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Know them for what they are, and as entitled to respect because of their office."
2. "Used of superintendents... It does not indicate a particular office, but is used functionally."
3. "The recognition of those who ministered to the congregations depended on the free choice of their members."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is for this reason that Paul is so careful to recommend them. To acknowledge means here to have regard or respect; but Paul intimates that the reason why less honor is shewn to teachers themselves than is befitting, is because their labor is not ordinarily taken into consideration."
2. "The excellence and dignity of this work are inestimable: hence those whom God makes ministers in connection with so great a matter, ought to be held by us in great esteem."
3. "For although kings and magistrates also preside by the appointment of God, yet as the Lord would have the government of the Church to be specially recognized as his, those that govern the Church in the name and by the commandment of Christ, are for this reason spoken of particularly as presiding in the Lord."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To know. ‘That is, to appreciate, not to be unaware of their real work’ (Vaughan)."

3. "But if not in Thessalonica, in other churches, symptoms soon appeared of a separation of the ruling from the teaching elders."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Old word for toil even if weary." 
2. "Those who stand in front of you, your leaders in the Lord, the presbyters or bishops and deacons."
3. "Putting sense into the heads of people. A thankless, but necessary, task."

### John Gill:
1. "Labourers; who laboured in the word and doctrine; gave up themselves to meditation, reading, and prayer; laboured hard in private, to find out the meaning of the word of God."
2. "And what the apostle directs them to, as their duty towards these persons, is to 'know' them; that is, not to learn their names, and know their persons, who they were; but that they would make themselves known to them, and converse freely and familiarly with them."
3. "Have the presidency and government in it, and go before the saints, and guide and direct them in matters both of doctrine and practice, being ensamples to the flock."
