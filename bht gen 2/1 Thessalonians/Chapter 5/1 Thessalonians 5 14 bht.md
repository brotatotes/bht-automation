# 1 Thessalonians 5:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is crucial to admonish those who live disorderly lives, as they need to be brought back on track and held accountable for their actions. On the other hand, it is essential to offer comfort to those who are feeble-minded and lacking in courage, providing them with encouragement and support. Patience should be exercised towards all individuals, even those who may be difficult or obstructive, for it is through this patience that we can effectively address their issues and guide them towards spiritual growth and transformation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "·ºÑœÑŒ±Œ∫œÑŒøœÇ is especially said of the soldier who does not remain in his rank: so inordinatus in Livy." L√ºn.: hence disorderly.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

3. "be patient toward all men... We ought to show it 'toward all men' [BENGEL]."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is the duty of every church member, as well as of the ministers of the gospel, affectionately to admonish those whom they know to be living contrary to the requirements of the gospel."
2. "Many a church is like an army where half the soldiers are out of the line; where there is entire insubordination in the ranks, and where not half of them could be depended on for efficient service in a campaign."
3. "Every Christian - especially every one who has been long in the service of his Master - has a fund of experience which is the property of the church, and which may be of incalculable value to those who are struggling now amidst many embarrassments along the Christian way."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Those who are out of line, referring to the idlers and busybodies described there." 
2. "Fainthearted, those of little heart." 
3. "The primary sense is, keeping one's self directly opposite to another so as to sustain him."

### John Calvin:
1. "He commands, therefore, that the unruly be admonished, that is, those who live dissolutely... for they are deserving of greater severity, and they cannot be brought to repentance by any other remedy." 
2. "On the other hand, he commands that the unruly should be admonished sharply, in order that the weak may be treated with kindness and humanity, and that the faint-hearted may receive consolation."
3. "He recommends, however, patience towards all, for severity must be tempered with some degree of lenity, even in dealing with the unruly. This patience... contrasts with a feeling of irksomeness, for nothing are we more prone to than to feel wearied out when we set ourselves to cure the diseases of our brethren."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The connection would lead a reader to suppose that this referred to those who rebelled against the authority of the elders or presiding ecclesiastical officials; but the similar expressions in the Second Epistle, 1 Thessalonians 3:6-7; 1 Thessalonians 3:11, would seem to indicate that those are meant who had abandoned their ordinary occupations from misapprehensions regarding the coming of the Lord."
2. "The feeble-minded...those timid persons who were dismayed by the persecutions which had overtaken the young Church, or who were downcast by the loss of friends through death."
3. "How are we to treat the scrupulous, conscientiously bigoted, slow, obstructive, little-minded members? Are we to leave them out of account and override their prejudices? We are to support, or, as the word means, hold to them. We are to befriend and consider them."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Admonish the disorderly. Put sense into the unruly mob who break ranks."
2. "Encourage the fainthearted. Old verb to encourage or console. Small-souled, little-souled, late word in LXX."
3. "Support the weak. Cling to, hold on to. The weak are those tempted to sin. "

### John Gill:
1. "Warn them that are unruly; or disorderly, idle persons, working not at all, busying themselves with other men's matters... exhort them to work with their own hands, to do their own business, and with quietness eat their own bread." 
2. "Reprove those who keep not their places in the church, but are like soldiers that go out of their rank... exhort them to fill up their places, to abide by the church, and the ordinances of Christ."
3. "Comfort the feebleminded: such as are not able to bear the loss of near and dear relations; are ready to stagger under the cross... speak a comfortable word to them, encourage them with the doctrines of grace, and the promises of the Gospel."
