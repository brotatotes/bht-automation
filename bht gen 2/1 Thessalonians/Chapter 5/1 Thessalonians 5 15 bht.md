# 1 Thessalonians 5:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
See that none render evil for evil unto any man. Instead, watch over both yourselves and each other, and diligently strive to follow that which is good. This involves not retaliating with ill words or actions, but rather pursuing morally, honestly, and benevolently good works. Remember, this command applies to all people, not just those within the Christian community. Show kindness and goodness to everyone, even to those who mistreat or oppose you.
