# 1 Thessalonians 5:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the Bible, we are encouraged to rejoice always, finding uninterrupted happiness in our relationship with God. This rejoicing flows out of our constant joy in the Lord, which is cultivated through prayer without ceasing. When we maintain a posture of continual prayer and gratitude, we attain a level of Christian perfection that enables us to give thanks in all circumstances. Our unwavering joy, unceasing prayer, and gratitude reflect our deep connection with God and our commitment to living in alignment with His purposes.
