# 1 Thessalonians 5:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are called to pray diligently and persistently, without interruption. Prayer should not be sporadic or limited to times of need, but a regular and constant practice. It is important to engage in direct supplications to God, to lay all our concerns before Him, and to maintain an uninterrupted and constant spirit of prayer. Through prayer, we can seek God's guidance, receive strength and assistance, and commune with Him in our hearts even amidst the busyness of life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "προσεύχεσθε, not of the mere spirit of prayer, as Jowett: but, as in parallel, Ephesians 6:18, of direct supplications to God."
2. "These may be unceasing, in the heart which is full of his presence and evermore communing with Him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 17. The Greek is, "Pray
	without intermission"; without allowing prayerless gaps
	to intervene between the times of prayer.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We are to be regular and constant in the observance of the stated seasons of prayer."
2. "We are to maintain an uninterrupted and constant spirit of prayer."
3. "That Christian is in a bad state of mind who has suffered himself...to be brought into such a condition that he cannot engage in prayer with proper feelings."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Without ceasing [αδιαλειπτως] . Comp. Romans 9:0; Romans 12:12; Ephesians 6:18; Colossians 4:2.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We obey this precept when our prayers are not fitful and intermittent, but steady and persistent; when we are careful to lay all our concerns before God, and when day is linked to day in our life by a regular recurrence to Him as our Guide and Father."
2. "Paul does not mean that we should employ our whole time in prayer, but that we should not omit those times of devotion we have resolved upon, nor forget to bring any matter before God, nor relax our earnestness through any disappointment or decay of faith."
3. "The words do not refer to the spirit of prayer but to the practice of it, although it is of course true that unless the spirit of prayer be maintained, the practice also will be fallen from."

### John Gill:
1. "Believers should be daily, and often found in the performance of this duty; for as their wants daily return upon them, and they are called to fresh service, and further trials and exercises, they have need of more grace, strength, and assistance." 
2. "There is such a thing as mental prayer, praying in the heart, private ejaculations of the soul, which may be sent up to heaven, while a man is engaged in the affairs of life."
3. "These words are opposed to the practice of such, who either pray not at all, or, having used it, have left it off, or who only pray in a time of trouble and distress."
