# 1 Thessalonians 5:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do not suppress the work of the Holy Spirit in your life and in the lives of others. The Spirit is like a fire that burns with love, joy, prayer, and thanksgiving. Guard against the temptation to neglect doing good or to engage in evil, as it may dampen the flame of the Spirit within you and those around you.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Spirit being first revealed as a cleansing fire and an enlightening flame, is spoken of as being extinguished, when His influence is resisted either by sensual and worldly living, or ‘by a studied repression and disregard of its manifestation, arising from erroneous perceptions and a mistaken dread of enthusiasm’ (Ellicott)."
