# 1 Thessalonians 5:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers should humbly acknowledge their limited knowledge concerning the exact timing of the day of the Lord's coming. The day of the Lord refers to the time when Christ will visibly manifest His power and authority. This coming will be sudden and unexpected, resembling the stealthiness of a thief in the night. While there may be signs leading up to this event, believers should not rely on them to determine the precise moment of His appearing. Instead, they are encouraged to remain vigilant and prepared, recognizing that the Lord's coming will take place swiftly and without prior notice.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "but the day of the Lord's coming, the παρουσία, which has been spoken of, in some of its details, above."
2. "It is both the suddenness, and the terribleness (surely we cannot with Ellic. omit this element, in the presence of the image in the next verse) of the Day's coming, which is here dwelt on: cf. next verse."
3. "οὕτως fills up the comparison as a thief in the night (comes), so ... it comes (not for future, but expressing, as so often by the present, the absolute truth and certainty of that predicated it is its attribute, to come)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The night is wherever there is quiet unconcern."
2. "The thief not only gives no notice of his approach but takes all precaution to prevent the household knowing of it."
3. "Signs will precede the coming, to confirm the patient hope of the watchful believer; but the coming itself shall be sudden at last."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The 'day of the Lord' means that day in which he will be manifested, or in which he will be the prominent object in view of the assembled universe."
2. "He intends that his coming to this world shall be sudden and unexpected, 'like that of a thief in the night'; that there shall be no such indications of his approach that it shall not be sudden and unexpected; and that no warning of it shall be given so that people may know the time of his appearing."


### Marvin Vincent:
1. "These expressions refer to a definite time when the Lord is expected to appear, and Paul expects this appearance soon."
2. "The phrase day of the Lord denotes a time in which God will conspicuously manifest his power and goodness or his penal justice."
3. "It is noteworthy how many of the gospel lessons on watchfulness are associated with the night and a visit by night."

### John Calvin:
1. "He places exact knowledge in contrast with an anxious desire of investigation."
2. "The day of Christ will come suddenly and unexpectedly, so as to take unbelievers by surprise, as a thief does those that are asleep."
3. "This, however, is opposed to evident tokens, which might portend afar off his coming to the world. Hence it were foolish to wish to determine the time precisely from presages or prodigies."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Perfectly accurate knowledge on this point is, that there can be no perfectly accurate ascertainment of the date of the Lord's coming." 
2. "More truly should we say that the apostle meant all these, ere they had separated themselves from the indistinct future."
3. "That is, without warning, or when least expected, as described in the following verse."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Know perfectly (ακριβως οιδατε). Accurately know, not 'the times and the seasons,' but their own ignorance."
2. "As a thief in the night (ως κλεπτης εν νυκτ). As a thief at night, suddenly and unexpectedly."
3. "Cometh (ερχετα). Prophetic or futuristic present tense."

### John Gill:
1. "For yourselves know perfectly,.... With great exactness and accuracy, with great clearness and perspicuity, as a certain truth, which was made plain and evident to them, and about which there could be no question..."
2. "that the day of the Lord; of the Lord Jesus, when he will show himself to be King of kings, and Lord of lords, and the Judge of the whole earth..."
3. "and such will be the coming of Christ, it will be sudden, and unknown before hand, and when least thought of and expected..."

### John Wesley:
1. For this in general ye do know; and ye can and need know no more.
