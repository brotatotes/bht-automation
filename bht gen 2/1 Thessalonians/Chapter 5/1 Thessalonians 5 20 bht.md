# 1 Thessalonians 5:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do not despise the preaching of the word of God, for the apostle is referring to the ministry of preaching and teaching, not just extraordinary gifts. The prophecies of the Old Testament hold great value and serve to strengthen our faith, and we should hold in high esteem the predictions of Christ. Let us not overlook the prophecies of men like Agabus, as they should not be underestimated. Disregarding any of these means of grace will quench the Spirit within us.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "They were liable to be despised in comparison with the more evidently miraculous gift of tongues."
2. "In 1 Corinthians 14:5, &c., he takes pains to show that prophecy was in reality the greater gift."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Prophesyings—whether exercised in inspired teaching, or in predicting the future." 
2. "'Despised' by some as beneath 'tongues,' which seemed most miraculous." 
3. "Declared by Paul to be a greater gift than tongues, though the latter were more showy."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They were not to undervalue it in comparison with other things."
2. "The office of setting forth the truth of God is to be the permanent office in the church..."
3. "No man is made the poorer, or the less respectable, or more miserable in life or in death, by following the counsels of a minister of Christ when he makes known the gospel."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Prophesyings [προφητειας] . The emphasis on prophesyings corresponds with that in 1 Corinthians 14:1-5, 1 Corinthians 14:22 ff. Prophecy in the apostolic church was directly inspired instruction, exhortation, or warning."
2. "His spirit received a spiritual truth in symbol : his understanding interpreted it in its application to actual events, and his speech uttered the interpretation. He was not ecstatically rapt out of the sphere of human intelligence, although his understanding was intensified and clarified by the phenomenal action of the Spirit upon it."
3. "The gift of tongues carried the subject out of the prophetic condition in which spirit, understanding, and speech operated in concert, and into a condition in which the understanding was overpowered by the communication to the spirit, so that the spirit could not find its natural expression in rational speech, or speech begotten of the understanding, and found supernatural expression in a tongue created by the Spirit."

### John Calvin:
1. "Let every one, therefore, who is desirous to make progress under the direction of the Holy Spirit, allow himself to be taught by the ministry of prophets."
2. "[...] a prophet is an interpreter of the will of God. Paul prohibits us from despising it, if we would not choose of our own accord to wander in darkness."
3. "Let us, however, learn from the example of Paul, to conjoin the Spirit with the voice of men, which is nothing else than his organ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Despise not prophesyings (προφητειας μη εξουθενειτε)."
2. "Stop counting as nothing (εξουθενεω, ουθεν=ουδεν)."
3. "Late form in LXX."
4. "Plural form προφητειας (accusative)."
5. "Chief of the spiritual gifts (1 Thessalonians 5:1)."
6. "Depreciated in Thessalonica as in Corinth later."

### John Gill:
1. "The prophecies of the Old Testament...have still their usefulness...and faith strengthened."
2. "Predictions of Christ...should be had in great esteem"
3. "The prophecies of private men, such as Agabus...are not to be slighted."

### John Wesley:
1. "Despise not prophesyings - That is, preaching; for the apostle is not here speaking of extraordinary gifts."
2. "It seems, one means of grace is put for all; and whoever despises any of these, under whatever pretence, will surely (though perhaps gradually and almost insensibly) quench the Spirit."
