# 1 Thessalonians 5:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, the emphasis is on examining and evaluating everything that comes our way. We are called to exercise discernment and not simply accept things at face value. The goal is to discern what is true, beneficial, and aligned with God's Word. It is an encouragement to actively test and hold on to what is good, while being cautious of anything that might be deceitful or in opposition to God's teachings. By applying this principle, we can navigate through various teachings and beliefs, staying grounded in the truth and avoiding harmful influences.

1. "Prove all things [œÄŒ±ŒΩœÑŒ± Œ¥ŒøŒ∫ŒπŒºŒ±Œ∂ŒµœÑŒµ]. A general exhortation, not confined to prophesyings; but Paul elsewhere insists that a test be applied to phenomena which claim to be supernatural."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul admonishes the Thessalonians to keep the middle path between these two extremes, while he prohibits them from condemning anything without first examining it; and, on the other hand, he admonishes them to exercise judgment, before receiving, what may be brought forward, as undoubted truth."
