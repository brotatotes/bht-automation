# 1 Thessalonians 5:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Be diligent in avoiding anything that even seems evil, whether it is in yourself or in others. Do not be deceived by seemingly good things that may actually be harmful. Hold steadfastly to what is virtuous and refrain from any actions or beliefs that may lead to offense or scandal. Be cautious of new ideas that may carry the appearance of evil. Let the love of truth guide you, and seek to grow in discernment so that you may avoid anything that has even the slightest semblance of evil.
