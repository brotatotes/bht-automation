# 1 Thessalonians 5:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The God of peace, who is the source of true peace and reconciliation, is called upon to plant His doctrine in our minds. Our own efforts are insufficient, but through His peace, we are sanctified and guided towards holiness. We are to continually progress in our pursuit of holiness, allowing every part of our being to partake in this sanctification. This includes consecrating both our body and soul as an undivided whole. By relying on God's supernatural gift of peace and pursuing holiness, we can be preserved blameless and protected from falling away.
