# 1 Thessalonians 5:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Pray for us, brethren, as the apostle Paul humbly asks for the prayers of the believers. He is a man of like passions, facing temptations, opposition, and hardships in his work. Just as Paul consistently requests prayer in his letters to various churches, so he earnestly desires the prayers of the people of God. By praying for their ministers, believers can advance the cause of piety in their own hearts. Therefore, let us join our hearts in prayer, seeking God's guidance, protection, and empowerment for those who labor in His service.
