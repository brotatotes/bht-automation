## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The meaning of this conjuration is, that an assembly of all the brethren should be held, and the Epistle then and there publicly read."
2. "The aorist, ἀναγνωσθῆναι, referring to a single act, shews this."
3. "I should account for it, not by supposing any distrust of the ciders, nor by the other hypotheses which he suggests, but by the earnestness of spirit incidental to the solemn conclusion of an Epistle of which he is conscious that it conveys to them the will and special word of the Lord."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The earnestness of his adjuration implies how solemnly important he felt this divinely inspired message to be."
2. "He makes this the occasion of a solemn charge, that so its being publicly read should be a sample of what should be done in the case of the others."
3. "The 'all' includes women and children, and especially those who could not read it themselves."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I charge you by the Lord" - It is equivalent to binding persons by an oath.
2. "That this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren" - The Epistle was to be read to the whole church on some occasion.
3. "Injunctions of this kind occurring in the Epistles, look as if the apostles regarded themselves as under the influence of inspiration, and as having authority to give infallible instructions to the churches."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "I charge [ενορκιζω] . N. T. o. Rev. stronger and more literal, I adjure." 
2. "This strong appeal may perhaps be explained by a suspicion on Paul 's part that a wrong use might be made of his name and authority (see 2 Thessalonians 2:2), so that it was important that his views should be made known to all."
3. "Lightfoot refers to 2 Thessalonians 3:17, as showing a similar feeling in his anxiety to authenticate his letter."

### John Calvin:
1. "For there will always be found some who say that it is of no advantage to publish generally things that otherwise they recognize as very excellent."
2. "We find, therefore, that the Spirit of God would have those things which he had set forth in this Epistle, through the ministry of Paul, to be published throughout the whole Church."
3. "Hence it appears, that those are more refractory than even devils themselves, who in the present day prohibit the people of God from reading the writings of Paul, inasmuch as they are no way moved by so strict an adjuration."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I charge you by the Lord. Why this vehemence of adjuration? Was there a danger that the letter would not be read? No better reason can be given than that Paul’s affectionate anxiety for the spiritual welfare of his converts broke out in this earnest request that his counsels should be delivered to them all."
2. "It is, however, matter of congratulation that in this, the first of Paul’s extant Epistles, there should occur this urgent injunction that what he had written should be publicly read."
3. "Bengel remarks that what Paul so urgently enjoined is precisely that which the Church of Rome as earnestly prohibits."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I adjure you by the Lord" (ενορκιζω υμας τον Κυριον). Late compound for old ορκιζω (Mark 5:7), to put one on oath, with two accusatives (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 483f.). Occurs in inscriptions.
2. "That this epistle be read unto all the brethren" (αναγνωσθηνα την επιστολην πασιν τοις αδελφοις). First aorist passive infinitive of αναγινωσκω with accusative of general reference in an indirect command.
3. "Clearly Paul wrote for the church as a whole and wished the epistles read aloud at a public meeting. In this first epistle we see the importance that he attaches to his epistles."

### John Gill:
1. "I charge you by the Lord...that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren; to all the members of the church, who are called 'holy', because they were sanctified or set apart by God...that all might hear, and learn, and receive some advantage from it..."
2. "...thren; to all the members of the church...that the sacred Scriptures, neither one part nor another, nor the whole of them, are to be kept from private Christians, but may be read, and heard, and used by all."
3. "it shows that oaths may be used on certain and solemn occasions."

3. "Be read to all the brethren — That is, in all the churches."
