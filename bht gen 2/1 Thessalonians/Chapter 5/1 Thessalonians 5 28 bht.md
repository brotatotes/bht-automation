# 1 Thessalonians 5:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The closing benediction found in 1 Thessalonians 5:28 is a reflection of Paul's habit of ending his letters with a salutation of grace. This grace represents the unmerited kindness and divine favor that Paul desires for the believers. It is also worth noting that the subscription that claims the letter was written from Athens is not genuine, as evidence suggests that it was actually written from Corinth. The importance of ensuring access to the Scriptures is emphasized, as the Bible is considered the richest blessing to mankind and is uniquely suited for the common mind.
