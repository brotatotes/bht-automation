## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The vivid description dispenses with any copula."
2. "It is pressing too close the comparison ὥσπερ ἡ ὠδὶν κ . τ . λ ., when De W. says that it 'assumes the day to be near, for that such a woman, though she does not know the day and the hour, yet has a definite knowledge of the period.'"
3. "For it is not the woman, nor her condition, that is the subject of comparison, but the unexpected pang of labour which comes on her."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "then—at the very moment when they least expect it."
2. "sudden—"unawares" (Luke 21:34)."
3. "shall not escape—Greek, 'shall not at all escape.' Another awful feature of their ruin: there shall be then no possibility of shunning it however they desire it (Amos 9:2; Amos 9:3; Revelation 6:15; Revelation 6:16)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is clear from this...that when the Lord Jesus shall come the world will not all be converted."
2. "The impenitent and wicked world will be sunk in carnal security when he comes...they will be unprepared for his advent."

### John Calvin:
1. "The day of the Lord will be like a thief in the night...because it will come suddenly to unbelievers, when not looked for, so that it will take them by surprise, as though they were asleep."
2. "Assuredly from deep contempt of God...they await in a spirit of carelessness not merely that last judgment, but also such as are of daily occurrence."
3. "He sometimes furnishes tokens of this nature of a sudden advent, but that will be the principal one, when Christ will come down to judge the world, as he himself testifies, comparing that time to the age of Noe, inasmuch as all will give way to excess, as if in the profoundest repose."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "When ‘unbelieving and unthinking’ men are persuading themselves that there is no cause for apprehension, then destruction comes upon them suddenly."
2. "The woman is seized as she travels, or sits at table, or lies asleep - the suddenness being all the more striking because she thinks she is prepared for it."

3. "...the inevitableness of it, it will certainly come at the full and appointed time, though that is not known: and they shall not escape..."

### John Wesley:
1. When they — The men of the world say.
