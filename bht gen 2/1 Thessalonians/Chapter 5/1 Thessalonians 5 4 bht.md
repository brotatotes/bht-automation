# 1 Thessalonians 5:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Though the world may dwell in ignorance and moral slumber, we, as believers, have been called out of darkness and into the light. We are not in darkness, unaware and unprepared for the day of the Lord. Rather, we have been awakened to the truth and are eagerly waiting for His return. We must remain watchful and alert, for just as a thief comes unexpectedly, so too will the day of the Lord. Let us not be caught off guard, but instead eagerly anticipate the glorious arrival of our Savior.
