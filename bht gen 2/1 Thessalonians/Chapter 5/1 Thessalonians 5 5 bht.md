You and all believers have been enlightened by the Spirit of God, allowing you to understand the depth of your sinful nature, the insufficiency of your own righteousness, and the excellence of Christ's righteousness. As children of light and heirs of the day, you have been freed from the darkness of Jewish legalism and the ignorance of the Gentiles. You no longer belong to the night of ignorance and unregeneracy.
