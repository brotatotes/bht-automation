1. "Sleep" here is worldly apathy to spiritual things (Romans 13:11; Ephesians 5:14).
2. "Watch" for Christ's coming; literally, "be wakeful." The same Greek occurs in 1 Corinthians 15:34; 2 Timothy 2:26.
3. "Be sober" - refraining from carnal indulgence, mental or sensual (2 Timothy 2:26).

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Let us regard it as an event which is certainly to occur, and which may occur at any moment."
2. "The Lord Jesus, when he comes, will find the wicked sunk not only in carnal security, but in sinful indulgences."
3. "A man who expects soon to see the Son of God coming to judgment, ought to be a sober man."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Let us watch [γρηγορωμεν]. See on Mark 13:35, and comp. Ephesians 5:14."
2. "Be sober [νηφωμεν]. Primarily in a physical sense, as opposed to excess in drink, but passing into the ethical sense of calm, collected, circumspect."
3. "Alert wakefulness and calm assurance will prevent their being surprised and confused by the Lord's coming, as by a thief in the night."

### John Calvin:
1. "For as he lately shewed that it were by no means seemly that they should be blind in the midst of light, so he now admonishes that it were dishonorable and disgraceful to sleep or be drunk in the middle of the day." 
2. "Let us not sleep, says he; that is, let us not, sunk in indolence, become senseless in the world. As others, that is, unbelievers, from whom ignorance of God, like a dark night, takes away understanding and reason."
3. "And be sober, that is, casting away the cares of the world, which weigh us down by their pressure, and throwing off base lusts, mount to heaven with freedom and alacrity."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Our position as children of light implies a certain corresponding wakefulness."
2. "We are the children of light because we live in Christ; it follows that we look and long for His appearing, and do not sleep as other men may who do not desire or expect His coming."
3. "The best commentary on these words is the exhortation of our Lord: ‘Take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Accordingly therefore, as in 2 Thessalonians 2:15 and only in Paul in N.T." 
2. "Present active subjunctive (volitive), let us not go on sleeping."
3. "Present active subjunctive (volitive) again, let us keep awake (late verb γρηγορεω from perfect εγρηγορα)."

### John Gill:
1. "Let us not act that part they do, or be like them; which professors of religion too much are, when they indulge themselves in carnal lusts and pleasures, and are careless and thoughtless about the coming of the day of the Lord."
2. "But let us watch...against sin, and all appearance of it; against the temptations of Satan, the snares of the world, and the errors of wicked men, who lie in wait to deceive."
3. "And be sober...that the heart be overcharged with the cares of this world; for men may be inebriated with the world, as well as with wine; and the one is as prejudicial to the soul as the other is to the body."

### John Wesley:
1. Awake, and keep awake — Being awakened, let us have all our spiritual senses about us.
