# 1 Thessalonians 5:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The night is the time when people typically sleep and engage in drunkenness, which are actions associated with darkness. Those who partake in these behaviors do not love the light. It is important for enlightened individuals to refrain from indulging in excessive drinking or being consumed by worldly concerns, as these can impair their ability to live according to the light of truth.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There is no distinction, as Macknight pretends, between μεθυσκόμενοι and μεθύουσιν... they are synonymous..." 
2. "Nor are the expressions to be taken in a spiritual sense... the repetition of the same verbs as subjects and predicates shews that νυκτός is merely a designation of time, and to be taken literally."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "To sleep by day would imply great indolence; to be drunken by day, great shamelessness."
2. "We Christians profess to be day people, not night people; therefore our work ought to be day work, not night work; our conduct such as will bear the eye of day, and such has no need of the veil of night."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Night is the time for sleep...it is in accordance with the character of those who are of the night, that is, sinners, to be sunk in stupidity and carnal security, as if they were asleep." 
2. "It is no more appropriate for Christians to be inactive than it is for people to sleep in the daytime."
3. "The object of the apostle here is, to exhort Christians to be sober and temperate, and the meaning is, that it is as disgraceful for them to indulge in habits of revelry, as for a man to be drunk in the day-time."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Be drunken [μεθυσκομενοι] . Lit. who are made drunk or get drunk. See on John 2:10. In N. T. always of intoxication."
2. "In LXX, the Hebrews shekar strong drink is several times rendered by mequsma."
3. "Jude 1:13:4, Jude 1:7; 1 Samuel 1:11, 1 Samuel 1:15."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Every man has a natural shame of being found asleep in the day-time, no matter what good excuse he has for it."
2. "If even nature thus teaches us to be ashamed of sleeping through the hours God gives us for wakeful work, let us, who are of the day, watch."
3. "When a man begins not only to exceed at night, when weariness or conviviality might tempt him, but, even before the day’s work is well begun, is found unfit for any duty, he is, humanly speaking, hopeless."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They that be drunken are drunken in the night" - No need of "be" here, they that are drunken. 
2. "No real difference in meaning between μεθυσκω and μεθυω, to be drunk, except that μεθυσκω (inceptive verb in -σκω) means to get drunk."
3. "Night (νυκτος, genitive by night) is the favourite time for drunken revelries."

### John Gill:
1. "The night is the usual season for sleep, and sleep is only for such who are in darkness, and are children of the night..."
2. "Drunkenness is a work of darkness, and therefore men given to excessive drinking love darkness rather than light, and choose the night for their purpose."
3. "Equally shameful it is, that enlightened persons should be inebriated, either with the cares of this life, or with an overweening opinion of themselves."

### John Wesley:
1. They usually sleep and are drunken in the night - These things do not love the light.
