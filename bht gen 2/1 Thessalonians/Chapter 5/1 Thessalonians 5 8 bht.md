# 1 Thessalonians 5:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This passage encourages believers to be watchful and prepared for spiritual battles. The defensive armor mentioned, such as the breastplate of righteousness and helmet of salvation, helps protect against the enemy's attacks. Faith and love are the key elements that a Christian should cultivate, ultimately working together. The hope of salvation is compared to a helmet, preserving believers from being overcome by sin and Satan. By casting off the works of darkness and walking in the light, believers can live a life that is pleasing to God and be ready to stand firm in the face of spiritual challenges.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Notice, that these arms are defensive only, as against a sudden attack and belong therefore not so much to the Christianâ€™s conflict with evil, as (from the context) to his guard against being surprised by the day of the Lord as a thief in the night."
2. "The best defenses against such a surprise are the three great Christian graces, Faith, Hope, Love, which are accordingly here enumerated."
3. "We must not perhaps press minutely the meaning of each part of the armour, in the presence of such variation in the two passages."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Faith," as the motive within, and "love," exhibited in outward acts, constitute the perfection of righteousness.
2. The helmet is "salvation"; here, "the hope of salvation." In one aspect "salvation" is a present possession; in another, it is a matter of "hope."
3. Our Head primarily wore the "breastplate of righteousness" and "helmet of salvation," that we might, by union with Him, receive both.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "But let us, who are of the day, be sober - Temperate, as people usually are in the daytime."
2. "Putting on the breast-plate of faith and love - This is a favorite comparison of the apostle Paul."
3. "And for an helmet, the hope of salvation."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The son of day clothes himself for the day's work or battle." (ÎµÎ½Î´Ï…ÏƒÎ±Î¼ÎµÎ½Î¿Î¹)
2. "Notice that only defensive armor is mentioned, in accordance with the darkness and uncertainty of the last time."
3. "The fundamental elements of Christian character, faith, hope, and love, are brought forward again."

### John Calvin:
1. "He calls us as it were to arms, that he may shew that it is not a time to sleep. It is true that he does not make use of the term war; but when he arms us with a breastplate and a helmet, he admonishes us that we must maintain a warfare."
2. "Whoever, therefore, is afraid of being surprised by the enemy, must keep awake, that he may be constantly on watch."
3. "He designs to teach that the life of Christians is like a perpetual warfare, inasmuch as Satan does not cease to trouble and molest them. He would have us, therefore, be diligently prepared and on the alert for resistance."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For watching, â€˜faithâ€™ is manifestly the most essential piece of the Christian panoply."
2. "All through this faith there must be â€˜loveâ€™ interwoven."
3. "Undoubtedly it is the assurance that eternity is ours which best defends us against the temptations of this present world."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The same figure of breastplate in Ephesians 6:14, only there 'of righteousness.'"
2. "The idea of watchfulness brings the figure of a sentry on guard and armed to Paul's mind."
3. "Late word meaning around the head and in Polybius, LXX, and in the papyri."

### John Gill:
1. "Let us cast off the works of darkness, and have no fellowship with them... let us walk as children of the light, living soberly, righteously, and godly." 
2. "Faith may answer to the Thummim and love to the Urim... these two graces go together, faith works by love, and love always accompanies faith."
3. "And for a helmet, the hope of salvation... it covers the head in the day of battle, and preserves from being overcome by sin and Satan."
