# 1 Timothy 1:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The sin condemned here encompasses various forms of theft, including the stealing of liberty through kidnapping and slavery. This includes the abhorrent practice of manstealing, which is considered the worst of all thefts. Such actions not only transgress the laws of God but also face the judgment of God, as seen in the punishment of Sodom and Gomorrah. It is crucial for believers to hold fast to sound doctrine, which brings health and vitality, nourishing souls unto eternal life. Let us reject any involvement in the trafficking and enslavement of our fellow human beings, recognizing the gravity of such offenses.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "No stealing of a man's goods can equal in atrocity the stealing of a man's liberty."
2. "Christianity teaches principles sure to undermine, and at last overthrow it, wherever Christianity has had its natural development."
3. "Gospel grace is the only true means of sanctification as well as of justification."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Some, indeed, are taken in war and sold as slaves, but the mass of those who have been reduced to servitude have become slaves by being kidnapped."
2. "None become slaves voluntarily, and consequently the whole process of making slaves partakes of the nature of theft of the worst kind."
3. "A measure of that criminality also adheres to all who own slaves, and who thus maintain the system - for it is a system known to have been originated by theft."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The penalty of death is attached to it, Exodus 21:16."
2. "The sound doctrine [τη υγιαινουση διδασκαλια] . A phrase peculiar to the Pastorals."
3. "The contents of this sound teaching which is according to godliness are not theoretical or dogmatic truth, but Christian ethics, with faith and love."

### John Calvin:
1. "There being chiefly three ways in which men injure their neighbors, namely, violence, dishonesty, and lust, he reproves successively those three ways."
2. "He declares that by his preaching, he supports that very sentence which the Lord pronounced in his law, against 'everything that is contrary to sound doctrine.' Hence it follows, that they who depart from the gospel, do not adhere to the spirit of the law, but merely pursue its shadow."
3. "For inquisitive and ambitious persons are always in a diseased state; they have no health in them they are like those unhappy patients who have lost their appetite, and who suck and lick, but cannot receive any nourishment."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Sins against the seventh commandment, recognising the true division of natural and unnatural vices, came first; then the worst form of offence against the eighth, the kidnapping and man-stealing to which the prevalence of slavery naturally gave rise; lastly, the two forms of evil forbidden by the ninth, falsehood, with, or without, the added guilt of perjury." 
2. "Contrary to sound doctrine. Here for the first time we come across the word that more than any other is characteristic of the Pastoral Epistles... occurring in this figurative sense in them and in them only. What it marks out is the tendency of the true doctrine to a healthy spiritual state, of all departure from the truth to a state morbid and unhealthy."
3. "The idea of health presupposed is that of clear perception, calm feeling, a will strong and steadfast - the mens sana, even though the corpus sanum be absent."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "By the use of this word Paul deals a blow at the slave-trade (cf. Philemon)."
2. "Only here in N.T. For similar lists, see 1 Corinthians 5:11; 1 Corinthians 6:9; Galatians 5:19; Romans 1:28; Romans 13:13; Colossians 3:5; Ephesians 5:5; 2 Timothy 3:2."
3. "The healthful (υγιαινω, old word for being well, as Luke 5:31; 3 John 1:2, in figurative sense in N.T. only in the Pastorals) teaching."

### John Gill:
1. "For whoremongers,.... Fornicators and adulterers, who were transgressors of the seventh command, these God will judge, and such shall have their portion in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone."
2. "The wrath of God was revealed from heaven in a very visible and remarkable manner against this abomination, by raining fire and brimstone upon Sodom and Gomorrah, and upon the cities of the plain, who defiled themselves in this way."
3. "By 'sound doctrine' is meant the doctrine of the Gospel, which is in itself pure and incorrupt, and is the cause of soundness and health to others; it is health to the navel, and marrow to the bones; its doctrines are the wholesome words of Christ, and by them souls are nourished up unto eternal life."

### John Wesley:
1. "Manstealers — The worst of all thieves, in comparison of whom, highwaymen and housebreakers are innocent."
2. "What then are most traders in negroes, procurers of servants for America, and all who list soldiers by lies, tricks, or enticements?"
