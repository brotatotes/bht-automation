# 1 Timothy 1:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Gospel, also known as the glorious gospel, does not nullify or abolish the law, but rather upholds and establishes it. It is through the Gospel that the righteousness of God is revealed, and it is this righteousness that fulfills the requirements of the law. The Gospel proclaims the glory of God and His perfect plan of salvation for mankind. It is a testament to His wisdom, grace, and love, and through it, we gain a deeper understanding of His righteous standards and His desire to bring salvation to all who believe.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This exemption of the righteous from the law, and assignment of it to the lawless as its true object, is 'according to the Gospel of the glory of the blessed God.'" 
2. "The Gospel manifests God's glory...in accounting 'righteous' the believer, through the righteousness of Christ, without 'the law'; and in imparting that righteousness whereby he loathes all those sins against which the law is directed."
3. "The term, 'blessed,' indicates at once immortality and supreme happiness. The supremely blessed One is He from whom all blessedness flows. This term, as applied to GOD, occurs only here and in 1 Timothy 6:15: appropriate in speaking here of the Gospel blessedness, in contrast to the curse on those under the law."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The law really forbade all which was prohibited in the gospel, and was designed to restrain all who would act contrary to that gospel."
