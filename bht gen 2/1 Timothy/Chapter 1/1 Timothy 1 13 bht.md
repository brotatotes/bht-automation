# 1 Timothy 1:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul acknowledges that he was once a blasphemer, a persecutor, and insolent. However, he reflects on how his actions were done in ignorance and unbelief. Despite his past, he obtained mercy from God. It is interesting to note that his ignorance did not excuse his sin, but it left room for God's mercy to come into play, enabling his transformation.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Notwithstanding that I was before a blasphemer, persecutor, injurious."

3. "I obtained mercy...God's mercy, and Paul's want of it, stand in sharp contrast...Those who have felt mercy can best have mercy on those out of the way."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The meaning is, that he had reviled the name of Christ, and opposed him and his cause - not believing that he was the Messiah; and in thus opposing he had really been guilty of blasphemy."
2. "Hence, learn that people may have very different views of their conduct when they come to look at it in subsequent life. What they now regard as harmless, or even as right and proper, may hereafter overwhelm them with shame and remorse."
3. "Yet, a little more fullness had been desirable on a subject of this nature. It is certain, that, independent of the nature of the ignorance, whether willful or otherwise, the character of crime is affected by it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Paul was uJbristhv when he persecuted the church. He was uJbrisqeiv shamefully entreated... Similar regretful references of Paul to his former career appear in Acts 22:4; Galatians 1:13, Galatians 1:23."  
2. "I obtained mercy [ηλεηθην] . Comp. Ver. 16. In speaking of his conversion, Paul uses cariv grace. See ver. 14, and the apostleship he speaks of himself as one who has obtained mercy [ηλεημενος] of the Lord to be faithful."


### John Calvin:
1. "We see how candidly he acknowledges that it might be brought against him as a reproach, and how far he is from extenuating his sins, and how, by willingly acknowledging his unworthiness, he magnifies the greatness of the grace of God."
2. "Not satisfied with having called himself a 'persecutor,' he intended to express more fully his rage and cruelty by an additional terns, an oppressor."
3. "But he appears to insinuate that there is no room for pardon, unless when ignorance can be pleaded in excuse. What then? Will God never pardon any one who has sinned knowingly? I reply, we must observe the word unbelief; for this term limits Paul’s statement to the first table of the law."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A blasphemer . . . Probably in both senses of the word, as implying (1) violent and railing speech against men, (2) actual blasphemy against the Name which be now recognised as above every name." 
2. "Because I did it ignorantly. From one point of view St. Paul looked upon his past state as one in which he had been as ‘the chief of sinners.’ Yet, on the other hand, his eyes had not been opened, he had not sinned wilfully against a light clearly seen, and so the sin was one of ignorance leading to unbelief; and thus mercy, though he could not claim it as deserved, was still possible."
3. "And the view which he thus took of God’s dealings with himself enlarged his sympathies and made him more hopeful for others."

1. "Before (το προτερον). Accusative of general reference of the articular comparative, 'as to the former-time,' formerly, as in Galatians 4:13."

3. "Ignorantly (αγνοων). Present active participle of αγνοεω, 'not knowing.' Old verb (Romans 2:4). In a blindness of heart."

### John Gill:
1. "This, as well as what follows, is said, to illustrate the grace of God in his conversion, and call to the ministry."
2. "But I obtained mercy: the Vulgate Latin version reads, 'the mercy of God'; God had mercy on him, unasked and unsought for, as well as unmerited."

### John Wesley:
1. "But I obtained mercy — He does not say, because I was unconditionally elected; but because I did it in ignorance."
