## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "[The saying] is the saying, and worthy of all (all possible, i.e. universal) reception...that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners." 
2. "The aim and extent of the Lord's mercy intensifies the feeling of his own especial unworthiness."
3. "The expression is one of the deepest humility...deep humility ever does so: it is but another form of [acknowledging oneself as] the chief and only ones in his sight."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Faithful is the saying." 
2. "Paul, unlike the false teachers, understands what he is saying, and whereof he affirms; and by his simplicity of style and subject, setting forth the grand fundamental truth of salvation through Christ, confutes the false teachers' abstruse and unpractical speculations."
3. "His instance was without a rival since the ascension, in point of the greatness of the sin and the greatness of the mercy: that the consenter to Stephen, the proto-martyr's death, should be the successor of the same!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word rendered 'saying,' means in this place doctrine, position, or declaration." 
2. "He came when he was under no necessity of coming; he came to save, not to destroy; to reveal mercy, not to denounce judgment; to save sinners - the poor, the lost, the wandering, not to condemn them; he came to restore them to the favor of God, to raise them up from their degradation, and to bring them to heaven."
3. "That a true Christian will always be ready to admit that his past life has been evil; (2)That this will become the abiding and steady conviction of the soul; and, (3)That an acknowledgment that we are sinners is not inconsistent with evidence of piety, and with high attainments in it. The most eminent Christian has the deepest sense of the depravity of his own heart and of the evil of his past life."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "This is a faithful saying. A favorite phrase in these Epistles."
2. "Worthy of all acceptation. The phrase only here and ch. 4 9...complete and excluding all doubt."
3. "Came into the world. The phrase is unique in the Pastorals, and does not appear in Paul. It is Johannine."

### John Calvin:
1. "He shews that it was profitable to the Church that he had been such a person as he actually was before he was called to the apostleship, because Christ, by giving him as a pledge, invited all sinners to the sure hope of obtaining pardon."
2. "Let it be to us as a seal to impress on our hearts a firm belief of the forgiveness of sins, which otherwise with difficulty finds entrance into the hearts of men."
3. "Accordingly, the more any one is oppressed by his sins, let him the more courageously betake himself to Christ, relying on this doctrine, that he came to bring salvation not to the righteous, but to 'sinners.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This is a faithful saying."
2. "Came into the world to save sinners."
3. "Of whom I am chief."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Faithful is the saying." A definite saying seems to be referred to, possibly a quotation of a current saying quite like the Johannine type of teaching.
2. "Chief." Not I was but I am. It is not easy to think of any one but St. Paul as penning these words. It is not mock humility here, but sincere appreciation of the sins of his life as a persecutor of the church of God, of men and even women.
3. "Acceptation." Genitive case with worthy of. Late word in N.T. only here and 1 Timothy 4:9.

### John Gill:
1. "The doctrine of Christ's coming into the world, and of salvation by him, as it is the sum and substance of the Gospel, so it is a 'faithful saying'; in which the faithfulness of God is displayed..."
2. "It is the Christian Cabala, or the evangelical tradition, delivered by the Father to Christ, by him to his apostles, and by them to the saints, by whom it is cordially received."
3. "Christ came into the world, being sent by his Father, but not against his will, but with his free consent: he came voluntarily in the fulness of time into this sinful world, where he was ill treated; and this was not by local motion, or change of place, but by assumption of nature; and the end of it was, that he might be the Saviour of lost sinners..."

### John Wesley:
1. "This is a faithful saying â€” A most solemn preface."
2. "And worthy of all acceptation â€” Well deserving to be accepted, received, embraced, with all the faculties of our whole soul."
3. "That Christ â€” Promised. Jesus â€” Exhibited. Came into the world to save sinners' â€” All sinners, without exception."
