## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This command I commit (as a deposit, to be faithfully guarded and kept) to thee, son Timotheus, according to the former prophecies concerning thee, that thou mayest war in them the good warfare, holding fast faith and good conscience."
2. "Some having thrust from them made shipwreck concerning the faith of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I delivered over to Satan, that they may be disciplined not to blaspheme."
3. "The delivering to Satan, as in 1 Corinthians 5:5, seems to have been an apostolic act, for the purpose of active punishment, in order to correction."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This charge—namely, 'that thou in them (so the Greek) mightest war,' that is, fulfil thy high calling, not only as a Christian, but as a minister officially, one function of which is, to 'charge some that they teach no other doctrine' (1 Timothy 1:3-:)."
2. "I commit—as a sacred deposit (1 Timothy 6:20; 2 Timothy 2:2) to be laid before thy hearers. according to—in pursuance of; in consonance with."
3. "The prophecies which went before on thee—the intimations given by prophets respecting thee at thy ordination, 1 Timothy 4:14 (as, probably, by Silas, a companion of Paul, and 'a prophet,' Acts 15:32). Such prophetical intimation, as well as the good report given of Timothy by the brethren (Acts 16:2), may have induced Paul to take him as his companion."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "When a young man enters on the active duties of life, and when great interests are entrusted to him, it is not improper to remind him of the hopes which had been cherished of him; of the anticipations which had been formed of his future usefulness; and of the expressions which have been used by the pious and the discerning respecting his future character."
2. "A virtuous young man will not willingly disappoint the long-cherished hopes of his friends. He will be likely to be made more diligent by the remembrance of all their fond anticipations of his future success."
3. "The Christian life is often compared to a warfare or struggle for victory...The meaning here is, that [Timothy] should contend with earnestness as a Christian and a minister in that holy service in which he was engaged, and endeavor to secure the victory."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "I commit this charge unto thee in accordance with prophetic intimations which I formerly received concerning thee."
2. "Prophecy is ranked among the foremost of the special spiritual endowments enumerated by Paul."
3. "Thou mightiest war the good warfare - covering all the particulars of a soldier's service."

### John Calvin:
1. "Son Timothy...he reminds him what kind of testimony he had obtained from the Spirit of God; for it was no small excitement, that his ministry was approved by God, and that he had been called by divine revelation before he was called by the votes of men."
2. "The same thing happened to Paul and Barnabas, (Acts 13:2,) when they were ordained to be teachers of the Gentiles; for it was a new and uncommon occurrence, and they could not otherwise have escaped the charge of rashness."
3. "By this he means that Timothy, relying on such approbation of God, ought to fight more courageously. What is there that either ought to give, or can give us greater cheerfulness than to know that God has appointed us to do what we are doing?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "After the ecstasy of praise is over, the writer returns to the ‘charge’ or ‘commandment’ from which he had diverged."

3. "By them mightest war a good warfare. Better ‘the good warfare,’ the campaign of truth against falsehood, of good against evil, and ‘in them,’ as though he were to think of them, and of the spiritual gifts that followed on them, as weapons and resources."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I commit... as food on table, in the middle to entrust (Luke 12:48) and used by Jesus as he was dying (Luke 23:46). Here it is a banking figure and repeated in 2 Timothy 2:2." 
2. "According to the prophecies which went before on thee... He began his ministry rich in hopes, prayers, predictions."
3. "That by them thou mayest war the good warfare... As if in defensive armour."

### John Gill:
1. "This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy.... includes the charge of preaching it himself, and intends the glorious Gospel of the blessed God committed to his trust..."
2. "Nor are any particular revelations made unto the Apostle Paul concerning Timothy intended... rather the testimonies of the brethren at Lystra and Iconium... are designed."
3. "For not that warfare is intended, which is common to all believers... but that warfare, which is peculiar to the ministers of the word... and their warfare lies in publishing and defending the Gospel of Christ..."

### John Wesley:
1. "This charge I commit to thee — That thou mayest deliver it to the church."
2. "According to the prophecies concerning thee — Uttered when thou wast received as an evangelist, 1 Timothy 4:14; probably by many persons, 1 Timothy 6:12; that, being encouraged by them, thou mightest war the good warfare."
