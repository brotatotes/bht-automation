# 1 Timothy 1:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Faith, compared to a precious liquor, relies on a good conscience as its clean container. As a teacher must hold fast to the pure truth of the gospel, so must believers firmly adhere to faith. A good conscience is one that is well-informed and follows its dictates honestly. Neglecting a good conscience can lead to shipwrecking one's faith, as individuals make willful choices to thrust away their conscience and retain their sin. In this way, a bad conscience becomes the mother of all heresies, leading those who have not sincerely embraced faith into falsehood and hypocrisy.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Faith. The personal subjective trust in God, as coupled with the ‘good conscience.’"
