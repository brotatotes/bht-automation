# 1 Timothy 1:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Timothy, Paul's true child in faith, was converted by Paul and treated as a son. In extending grace, mercy, and peace to Timothy, Paul acknowledges that while God is the Father of all in faith, he is honored to share in that role as a minister of the gospel. The addition of mercy to the salutation reflects Paul's desire for tender grace towards those in need. This experience prepares Timothy to minister God's love and favor to others.
