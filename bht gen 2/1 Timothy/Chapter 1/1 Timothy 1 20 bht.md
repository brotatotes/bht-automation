# 1 Timothy 1:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Hymenaeus and Alexander, mentioned in 1 Timothy, led people astray with false teachings. Hymenaeus erred in believing the resurrection had already taken place, causing others to lose faith. To discipline them, Paul delivered them to Satan, using his apostolic authority. This severe punishment aimed to teach them not to blaspheme, either by contradicting the resurrection doctrine or through sinful behavior. The hope was that they would repent and learn from the suffering inflicted upon them. Through this example, we can see the importance of maintaining sound doctrine and the need for discipline within the church community.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
