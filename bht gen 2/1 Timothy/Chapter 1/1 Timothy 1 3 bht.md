# 1 Timothy 1:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle exhorts Timothy to ensure that there is no deviation from the true doctrine that he himself has preached. This charge is a reminder to teach nothing other than what has been taught, not adding anything to it or replacing it with other teachings. The focus is on preserving the purity of the doctrine and not allowing any new or false teachings to infiltrate.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The sentence begins 'As I exhorted thee,' but in his negligence of writing, the Apostle does not finish the construction..." 
2. "The sense of 'to tarry' or 'stay at a place' is sufficiently clear..." 
3. "The meanings of 'other teaching' and 'false teaching'...lie very close to one another."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The office of superintending overseer, needed for a time at Ephesus or Crete, in the absence of the presiding apostle, subsequently became a permanent institution on the removal, by death, of the apostles who heretofore superintended the churches."
2. "I cannot think with BIRKS, that this verse is compatible with his theory, that Paul did not actually visit Ephesus, though in its immediate neighborhood."
3. "I besought—a mild word, instead of authoritative command, to Timothy, as a fellow helper."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is clear from this, that Paul and Timothy had been laboring together at Ephesus, and the language accords with the supposition that Paul had been compelled to leave before he had completed what he had designed to do there."
2. "It was for a temporary purpose, and not as a permanent arrangement. It was to correct certain errors prevailing there which Paul would have been able himself soon to correct if he had been suffered to remain."
3. "He was left there for a purpose which is specified, and that is as far as possible from what are now regarded as the appropriate functions of a prelatical bishop."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Even as [καθως] . An awkward construction, there being nothing to answer to kaqwv." 
2. "To abide [προσμειναι] . To continue on. The compound does not occur in Paul, but is found in Acts 11:23; Acts 13:43; Acts 18:18."
3. "The charge is not to teach anything contrary to the sound teaching (verse 10) or irreconcilable with it."

### John Calvin:
1. "To keep what has been gained is not a smaller virtue than to make new acquisitions."
2. "The truth of God is one, so is there but one plain manner of teaching it, which is free from false ornament, and which partakes more of the majesty of the Spirit than of the parade of human eloquence."
3. "We give the name of another doctrine not only to that which is openly at variance with the pure doctrine of the gospel, but to everything that either corrupts the pure gospel by new and borrowed inventions, or obscures it by ungodly speculations."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There was, as the word implies, probably some reluctance on the part of the young disciple to leave the apostle whom he loved so devotedly, and with whom he had for so many years travelled in the closest companionship."
2. "The first part of the word implies (as in 2 Corinthians 6:14) ‘unequally yoked,’ something discordant and out of harmony."
3. "The undefined way in which St. Paul usually speaks of his Judaizing opponents and others whom he condemns... Timothy would know whom he had in view."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "As I exhorted (καθως παρεκαλεσα). There is an ellipse of the principal clause in verse 1 Timothy 1:4 (so do I now not being in the Greek)."
2. "To tarry (προσμεινα). First aorist active infinitive of προσμενω, old verb, attributed by Luke to Paul in Acts 13:43."
3. "Certain men (τισιν). Dative case. Expressly vague (no names as in 1 Timothy 1:20), though Paul doubtless has certain persons in Ephesus in mind."

### John Gill:
1. "Than the doctrine of Christ and his apostles; than what had been preached by the apostle at Ephesus, and the saints there had received; than what was agreeably to the Scriptures of truth, and was according to godliness; for all other doctrines must be divers and strange ones."
2. "Nor would he have them teach in another way, in new words, but hold fast the form of sound words; for new words often produce new doctrines."
3. "It seems as if there were some teachers in this place the apostle was suspicious of, or he had heard that they began to innovate in the doctrine of faith; wherefore he desires Timothy to continue a while, in order to be a check on these persons, and to charge them not to introduce any new doctrine."

### John Wesley:
1. Charge some to teach no other doctrine — Than I have taught. Let them put nothing in the place of it, add nothing to it.
