# 1 Timothy 1:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Beware of getting caught up in fables, whether they be old wives' tales, Jewish traditions, or any other idle and unprofitable stories. Similarly, be cautious of engaging in endless genealogies, as they often lead to debates and controversies. Rather, let us focus on godly edifying, building up one another in faith and avoiding unnecessary arguments and disputes.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is fair to assume, as the ‘fables’ are called ‘Jewish’ in Titus 1:4, that they were more or less like those of which the Talmud is so full, legends that had been engrafted on the history of the Old Testament."
2. "Whether the ‘genealogies’ were pedigrees in the strict sense of the term, by means of which Judaizing teachers claimed the authority of illustrious ancestry, or lists such as those of the later Gnostics of the successive emanations of æons, male and female, with names such as Depth, Silence, Wisdom, and Fulness, from the primal abyss of Deity, we cannot now decide."
