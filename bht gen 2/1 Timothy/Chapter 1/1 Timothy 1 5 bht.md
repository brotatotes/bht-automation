# 1 Timothy 1:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The ultimate purpose of the commandment is love, which is both the foundation and the end goal of our faith. In order to cultivate this love, we must have a pure heart, a good conscience, and unfeigned faith. Love is not just an outward expression, but it originates from a heart that has been cleansed by faith and is accompanied by a clear conscience. The commandment exists to bring about love, which is the essence of the moral law and the Gospel alike.
