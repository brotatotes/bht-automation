# 1 Timothy 1:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The false teachers in question had a strong desire to be seen as knowledgeable in the law, but their understanding was severely lacking. They lacked the comprehension and knowledge both of the very things they confidently spoke about and the subject matter itself. Despite their claims and assertions, they were ignorant of the true nature and purpose of the law. This ignorance led them to make bold and confident statements about matters they had no understanding of. Just as the proverb goes, ignorance truly is rash.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Judaizers here meant corrupted the law with 'fables,' which they pretended to found on it, subversive of morals as well as of truth."
2. "Their error was not in maintaining the obligation of the law, but in abusing it by fabulous and immoral interpretations of, and additions to, it."
3. "Neither understanding their own assertions, nor the object itself about which they make them. They understand as little about the one as the other."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Desiring to be teachers of the law - That is, to have the credit and reputation of being well versed in the law of Moses, and qualified to explain it to others."
2. "Understanding neither what they say - That is, they do not understand the true nature and design of that law which they attempt to explain to others."
3. "They made affirmations of what they knew nothing of, and though they made confident observations, yet they often pertained to things about which they had no knowledge."

3. "Such is the foundation of faith, according to the learned Papists. And then we must not call in question that we ought to apply to the departed saints as our advocates and intercessors.
