# 1 Timothy 1:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The law is good and in accordance with God's holiness, justice, and truth. It is meant to be used lawfully, not as a means for attaining righteousness, but to awaken the sense of sin in the ungodly. It is acknowledged that the law is good, but it must be used properly. The true purpose of the law is to guide believers, pointing out God's will and leading them in holiness. It serves to convict unbelievers of their need for the Gospel. In using the law lawfully, we recognize its moral excellence and its role in pointing to Christ.
