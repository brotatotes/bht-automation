# 1 Timothy 1:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The purpose of the law is not to burden those who are already righteous, but to bring awareness to the sins and shortcomings of those who claim to follow God. Although the righteous strive to please God and do what is right, they can still benefit from the external guidance of the law to reveal areas of their lives that need correction. The reason the commandments do not condemn the Christian is not because they lack authority, but because Christ, as our surety, fulfilled them. He took on the responsibility of fulfilling the requirements of the law on our behalf.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The law is not made for a righteous man—not for one standing by faith in the righteousness of Christ put on him for justification, and imparted inwardly by the Spirit for sanctification."
2. "But as the justified man often does not give himself up wholly to the inward leading of the Spirit, he morally needs the outward law to show him his sin and God's requirements."
3. "The reason why the ten commandments have no power to condemn the Christian is not that they have no authority over him, but because Christ has fulfilled them as our surety."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The purpose of the law was not to fetter and perplex those who were righteous, and who aimed to do their duty and to please God. It was not intended to produce a spirit of servitude and bondage...the main purpose of the law was not to fetter the minds of the righteous by numberless observances and minute regulations, but that it was to restrain the wicked from sin."
2. "No good man feels himself lettered and manacled by wholesome laws, nor does he feel that the purpose of law is to reduce him to a state of servitude."
3. "There is no sin which man will not commit if unrestrained, and there is in fact no conceivable form of crime of which he has not been guilty."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Knowing [ειδως] . The participle is connected with tiv one, a man, in the preceding clause. Is not made [ου κειται] . Lit. Is not laid down, set, appointed."
2. "Righteous [δικαιω] . Morally upright. Not in the Pauline sense of justified by faith. Comp. 2 Timothy 2:22; 2 Timothy 3:16."
3. "Disobedient [ανυποτακτοις] . Only in Pastorals and Hebrews. Better unruly. Disobedient is too specific. It means those who will not come into subjection."

### John Calvin:
1. "They who wish to be regarded as the greatest zealots for the law, give evidence by their whole life that they are the greatest despisers of it."
2. "He takes for granted the well-known sentiment, that 'from bad manners have sprung good laws,' and maintains that the law of God was given in order to restrain the licentiousness of wicked men."
3. "He therefore wished to repress the impudence of adversaries, who armed themselves with the name of 'the law' against godly men, whose whole life exhibits the actual role of the law, since they had very great need of the law, and yet did not care much about it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The law would not be needed but for the lawless element in men which needs correction."
2. "The next four words, while expressing different shades of evil, have this in common, that they all speak of evil in its relation to God, of sins against the First Table."
3. "In the strong words chosen to indicate the sins of deepest dye in each case, we may probably trace a righteous indignation at the sins of the Heathen world."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Is not made for the use of knowing this" (ου κειτα, ἡ χρησις ειδως τουτο). 
2. "Unruly, ungodly, sinners, unholy, and profane" (ανυποτακτοις, ασεβεσ, αμαρτωλοις, ανοσιοις, βεβηλοις). 
3. "Murderers of fathers, murderers of mothers, and manslayers" (πατρολωιαις, μητρολωιαις, ανδραφονοις).

### John Gill:
1. "No man is naturally righteous since Adam, excepting the man Christ Jesus... those only are righteous men, who are made so through the imputation of Christ's righteousness to them."
2. "The law does not lie upon a righteous man, or against him... the righteous man delights in it, and cheerfully serves it, and the love of Christ constrains him to obey it freely."
3. "The law lies upon and against the lawless and disobedient, the ungodly and sinners, the unholy and profane... on and against these the law lies as an accusing, terrifying, cursing, and condemning law."

### John Wesley:
1. "The law doth not lie against a righteous man."
2. "They who despise the authority of the lawgiver violate the first commandment, which is the foundation of the law, and the ground of all obedience."
3. "Who break the third commandment by taking his name in vain."
