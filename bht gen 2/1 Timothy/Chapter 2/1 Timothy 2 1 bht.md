# 1 Timothy 2:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
I exhort, with all earnestness, that prayer be made for all men, as God is gracious and desires the salvation of all. True prayer is not just a mere formality, but a passionate expression of holy zeal and divine love, fueled by the Spirit of God. Let us give thanks to God for all men, recognizing that He desires the salvation of all, and Christ is the Mediator for all.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "First of all, doubtless, is to be connected with 'I exhort' what I begin with (for special reasons), is... As the destruction of Jerusalem drew near, the Jews (including those at Ephesus) were seized with the dream of freedom from every yoke; and so virtually 'blasphemed' God's name by 'speaking evil of dignities.' Hence Paul, in opposition, gives prominence to the injunction that prayer be made for all men, especially for magistrates and kings."
2. "Some professing Christians looked down on all not Christians, as doomed to perdition; but Paul says all men are to be prayed for, as Christ died for all."
3. "The accumulation of terms implies prayer in its every form and aspect, according to all the relations implied in it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The duty of praying for the salvation of the whole world was not to be regarded as a subordinate and secondary thing."
2. "There is one great Intercessor between God and man, who pleads for our salvation on the ground of what he himself has done, but we are permitted to intercede for others."
3. "Prayers should be made for all people - for all need the grace and mercy of God; thanks should be rendered for all, for all may be saved."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The verb signifies to fall in with a person; to draw near so as to converse familiarly. Hence, enteuxiv is not properly intercession in the accepted sense of that term, but rather approach to God in free and familiar prayer." 
2. "In ejnteuxeiv here the idea of interposition is prominent: making prayers a factor in relations with secular rulers."

### John Calvin:
1. "Those exhortations depend on the preceding commandment."
2. "Paul appears to me purposely to join together three terms for the same purpose, in order to recommend more warmly, and urge more strongly, earnest and constant prayer."
3. "That wonderful goodness which he shows every day...is worthy of being praised; and our love of our neighbor ought also to extend to those who are unworthy of it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The list may be looked on as showing that the primitive worship of the Church included the same elements as those which we find in the earliest liturgies."
2. "Intercessions on behalf of the desolate and oppressed, with an implied prayer against the wickedness of the oppressor."
3. "The word rendered 'intercessions' includes earnest personal pleading, meeting God, as it were, in prayer, whether for ourselves or others."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "First of all (πρωτον παντων). Take with παρακαλω. My first request (first in importance)."
2. "Intercessions (εντευξεις). Late word (Polybius, Plutarch, etc.), only here in N.T. and 1 Timothy 4:5, though the verb εντυγχανω in Romans 8:27; Romans 8:34; Romans 11:2; Romans 11:25."
3. "The scope of prayer is universal including all kinds of sinners (and saints)."

### John Gill:
1. "The two principal parts of public worship, being the ministry of the word and prayer..."
2. "...this does not so much regard the order of time, that prayer should be made early in the morning, in the first place, before anything else is done, and particularly before preaching, which seems to have been the custom of the primitive saints..."
3. "These are to be made for all men; not only for all the saints, for all the churches of Christ, and ministers of the Gospel; nor only for near relations and friends, according to the flesh; but for all the inhabitants of the country and city in which men dwell... even for all sorts of men, Jews and Gentiles, rich and poor, high and low, bond and free, good men and bad men..."

### John Wesley:
1. "I exhort therefore — Seeing God is so gracious."
2. "But true prayer is the vehemency of holy zeal, the ardour of divine love, arising from a calm, undisturbed soul, moved upon by the Spirit of God."
3. "We may likewise give thanks for all men, in the full sense of the word, for that God 'willeth all men to be saved,' and Christ is the Mediator of all."
