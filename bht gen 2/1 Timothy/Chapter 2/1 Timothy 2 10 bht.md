# 1 Timothy 2:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Women should focus less on external decorations and more on adorning themselves with good works. Their actions speak louder than words, and it is through these good works that their professing of godliness is truly shown. Good works are like good clothes, adorning men and women as believers. They are not what make them Christians, but they enhance their personal character and their testimony to the world.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Their adorning is to be effected by means of good works: not that they are to be clothed in, or with, them."
2. "Works, not words in public, is their province."
3. "Works are often mentioned in the Pastoral Epistles in order to oppose the loose living, combined with the loose doctrine, of the false teachers."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is not appropriate for women who profess to be the followers of the Saviour, to seek to be distinguished for personal, external decorations."
2. "They profess to have fixed the affections on God their Saviour, and to be living for heaven; and it is not becoming in them to seek such ornaments as would indicate that the heart is supremely attached to worldly things."
3. "Good works, or deeds of benevolence, eminently become a Christian female. The nature of woman seems to be adapted to the performance of all deeds demanding kindness, tenderness, and gentleness of feeling."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Professing [επαγγελλομεναις] . In the sense of professing only in the Pastorals."
2. "Const. by good works with professing godliness : omit the parenthesis which - godliness; take which [ο] as = with that which [εν τουτω ο] and construe it with adorn."

### John Calvin:
1. "Undoubtedly the dress of a virtuous and godly woman must differ from that of a strumpet."

3. "The Greek for ‘godliness’ (θεοσέβειαν ) occurs here only in the New Testament, and is somewhat stronger than the εύσεβεία commonly so rendered..."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul wishes women to wear 'becoming' clothes, but θεοσεβειαν (godliness) is part of the 'style' desired."
2. "Good dress and good works combined."

### John Gill:
1. "It best became them not so much to adorn themselves with any outward adornings, as with good works."
2. "Good works are like good clothes, they do not make persons men and women, but they adorn them as such."
