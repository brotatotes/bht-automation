# 1 Timothy 2:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He calls on women to be humble learners, receiving instruction and growing in their knowledge of Christ and the Gospel. If they have questions or concerns, they should not disrupt the public assembly, but rather seek understanding from their husbands in the privacy of their homes. In this way, they demonstrate their submission not only to the ministers of the word but also to their own husbands, living out the teachings of Christ with a willing heart and joyful obedience.
