# 1 Timothy 2:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's intention for male authority and female submission can be seen in the original order of creation. The fact that Adam was formed first before Eve indicates his priority and headship. This design was not based merely on the priority of existence, but serves to affirm the subordinate nature of women and the intended structure of authority. The purpose of this arrangement is to establish the complementary roles of men and women, where the man has been given the responsibility of leadership and the woman is to support and submit to his authority.
