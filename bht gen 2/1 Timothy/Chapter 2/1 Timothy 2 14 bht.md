# 1 Timothy 2:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Genesis 3:17, Adam is reproved for listening to the voice of his wife. This emphasizes the reason why a woman should not have authority over a man. She was deceived by the serpent, which highlights her susceptibility to deception and her capacity to deceive others. The transgression of Eve in listening to the serpent's deceit is a reminder of the consequences of disobedience. It is clear that the man is intended to bear rule and authority.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Second reason as the woman was last in being, so she was first in sin indeed the only victim of the Tempter’s deceit."
2. "The woman having been seduced BY DECEIT has become involved in transgression."
3. "The thought [of the woman being involved in transgression] is the present state of transgression in which the woman (and the man too: but that is not treated here) by sin is constituted."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Adam was not deceived—as Eve was deceived by the serpent; but was persuaded by his wife."
2. "Last in being, she was first in sin—indeed, she alone was deceived."
3. "The oldest manuscripts read the compound Greek verb for the simple, 'Having been seduced by deceit': implying how completely Satan succeeded in deceiving her."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is, that in the most important situation in which she was ever placed she had shown that she was not qualified to take the lead."
2. "The temptation as actually applied to her would have been ineffectual on him."
3. "Sin, from the beginning, has been a process of delusion."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "[Eve] did not deceive the man, but persuaded him."

### John Calvin:
1. "Because she had given fatal advice, it was right that she should learn that she was under the power and will of another; and because she had drawn her husband aside from the command of God, it was right that she should be deprived of all liberty and placed under the yoke." 
2. "There is nothing to hinder that the condition of obeying should be natural from the beginning, and that afterwards the accidental condition of serving should come into existence; so that the subjection was now less voluntary and agreeable than it had formerly been."
3. "By these words Paul does not mean that Adam was not entangled by the same deceitfulness of the devil, but that the cause or source of the transgression proceeded from Eve."

1. "Being beguiled (εξαπατηθεισα). First aorist passive participle of εξαπατεω, old compound verb, in N.T. only by Paul." 
2. "Not certain that εξ- here means 'completely deceived' in contrast to simplex (ουκ ηπατηθη) used of Adam, though possible." 
3. "Hath fallen (γεγονεν). Second perfect indicative active, permanent state. See 1 Corinthians 11:7."

### John Gill:
1. "Adam never was deceived at all; neither by the serpent, with whom he never conversed; nor by his wife, he knew what he did."
2. "And therefore she is called by the Jews 'the mother of iniquity and sin'; to which they refer, Psalms 51:5. And they say she was the cause of death to Adam, and to all the world."
3. "Now inasmuch as the serpent did not attack Adam, he being the stronger and more knowing person, and less capable of being managed and seduced; but made his attempt on Eve, in which he succeeded; and since not Adam, but Eve, was deceived, it appears that the man is the more proper person to bear rule and authority."

### John Wesley:
1. "Thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife" - Genesis 3:17. The preceding verse showed why a woman should not "usurp authority over the man."
2. "This shows why she ought not 'to teach.' She is more easily deceived, and more easily deceives."
3. "The serpent deceived her, Genesis 3:13, and she transgressed."
