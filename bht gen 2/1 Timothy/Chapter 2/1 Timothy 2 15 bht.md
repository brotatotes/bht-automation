# 1 Timothy 2:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Women, who were all affected by the consequences of Eve's sin, will be saved. This salvation includes being protected and guided through the pain and risks associated with childbirth, as well as being saved from sin through faith in Christ. However, this salvation is not automatic; it is contingent upon their continued faith, love, and pursuit of holiness. Therefore, women should take courage and find comfort in the knowledge that God provides for their salvation and calls them to a life of faithfulness and godliness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "She shall be saved through her child-bearing...not only exemption from that curse in its worst and heaviest effects: not merely that she shall safely bear children: but the Apostle uses the word σωθήσεται purposely for its higher meaning." 
2. "Just as that man should be saved through, as passing through, fire which is his trial, his hindrance in his way, in spite of which he escapes, so she shall be saved, through, as passing through, her child-bearing, which is her trial, her curse, her hindrance in the way of it."
3. "if they have remained in faith and love and holiness with self-restraint."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In spite of the trial of childbearing which she passes through (as her portion of the curse, 'in sorrow shalt thou bring forth children'), she shall be saved."
2. "Moreover, I think it is implied indirectly that the very curse will be turned into a condition favorable to her salvation, by her faithfully performing her part in doing and suffering what God has assigned to her, namely, child-bearing and home duties, her sphere, as distinguished from public teaching, which is not hers, but man's."
3. "Mental receptivity and activity in family life were recognized in Christianity as the destiny of woman. One reason alleged here by Paul, is the greater danger of self-deception in the weaker sex, and the spread of errors arising from it, especially in a class of addresses in which sober reflectiveness is least in exercise."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "She was not to be regarded as degraded and abandoned. She was not to be overwhelmed by the recollection of what 'the mother of all living' had done."
2. "There were consolations in her case. There was a special divine interposition which she might look for, evincing tender care on the part of God in those deep sorrows which had come upon her in consequence of her transgression."
3. "If she had faith and holiness, even in her condition of sorrow brought on by guilt, she might as well hope for eternal life as man."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "She shall be saved is set over against hath fallen into transgression."

### John Calvin:
1. "The weakness of the sex renders women more suspicious and timid, and the preceding statement might greatly terrify and alarm the strongest minds."
2. "The Spirit of God does not accuse or reproach us, in order to triumph over us, when we are covered with shame, but, when we have been cast down, immediately raises us up."
3. "The very means (so to speak) of procuring salvation are found in the punishment itself."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "She shall be saved by the childbirth, i.e. by the seed of the woman, the incarnate Christ."
2. "We may, I believe, see in this a kind of bold Luther-like way of stating that home life rather than public life, the functions of a mother rather than of a teacher, are appointed for her."
