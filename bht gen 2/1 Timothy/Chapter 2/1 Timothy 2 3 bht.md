# 1 Timothy 2:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Why are not more converted? We do not pray enough. It is crucial for us to remember that God desires the salvation of all, even those who have not yet believed. If we want to see more people transformed by the power of the Gospel, we must fervently pray for their salvation. In fact, it is in accordance with God's will and pleases Him when we intercede for others. We should never doubt the extent of God's grace, for it reaches to all people, regardless of their current state of belief.
