## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Imitate God."
2. "Paul does not say, 'He wishes to save all'; for then he would have saved all in a matter of fact; but 'will have all men to be saved,' implies the possibility of man's accepting it (through God's prevenient grace) or rejecting it (through man's own perversity). Our prayers ought to include all, as God's grace included all."
3. "unto the knowledge—the full knowledge or recognition...the saving truth as it is in, and by, Jesus."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "God wills that all people should be saved... He has made ample provision for it. He uses all proper means to secure their salvation. He uses no positive means to prevent it, and if they are not saved it will be their own fault."
2. "This verse proves... (1) That salvation is provided for all... (2) That salvation should be offered to all people... (3) That people are to blame if they are not saved."
3. "The truth which God has revealed; the 'truth as it is in Jesus.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Prayer to God for all is acceptable to him, because he wills the salvation of all."
2. "Epignwsiv is a favorite Pauline word. It signifies advanced or full knowledge."
3. "The logical relation in the writer's mind between salvation and the knowledge of the truth is not quite clear. Knowledge of the truth may be regarded as the means of salvation, or it may be the ideal goal of the whole saving work."

### John Calvin:
1. "What is more reasonable than that all our prayers should be in conformity with this decree of God?"
2. "They [those who receive the gospel] are admitted by him [God] to possess salvation; because the gospel reveals to us the righteousness of God, which is a sure entrance into life."
3. "It is our duty to consider, not what kind of persons the princes at that time were, but what God wished them to be."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "No assertion of the universal love of God can be more clear than this."
2. "Men were tempted to draw a line of demarcation in their prayers, and could hardly bring themselves to pray for a Nero or a Tigellinus."
3. "The nature of the ‘salvation’ is expressed in the words that stand as in opposition with it. It is found in the ‘knowledge’ mil and deep, more than the mere  gnosis  of the understanding, of the truth which is eternal."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Willeth (θελε). God's wish and will in so far as he can influence men."
2. "To the knowledge (εις επιγνωσιν). 'The full knowledge' as in Colossians 1:6; Ephesians 4:13 (ten times in Paul). See 2 Timothy 3:7 for the whole phrase 'full knowledge of the truth' (αληθεια 14 times in the Pastorals)."

### John Gill:
1. "The will of God, that all men should be saved, is not a conditional will, or what depends on the will of man, or on anything to be performed by him, for then none might be saved; and if any should, it would be of him that willeth, contrary to the express words of Scripture; but it is an absolute and unconditional will respecting their salvation, and which infallibly secures it."
2. "The will of God concerning man's salvation is entirely one, invariable, unalterable, and unchangeable."
3. "Rather therefore all sorts of men, agreeably to the use of the phrase in 1 Timothy 2:1 are here intended, kings and peasants, rich and poor, bond and free, male and female, young and old, greater and lesser sinners; and therefore all are to be prayed for, even all sorts of men, because God will have all men, or all sorts of men, saved."

### John Wesley:
1. "Who willeth seriously all men - Not a part only, much less the smallest part.To be saved — Eternally." 
2. "And, in order thereto, to come - They are not compelled.To the knowledge of the truth — Which brings salvation." 
3. "This is treated of, 1 Timothy 2:6,7."
