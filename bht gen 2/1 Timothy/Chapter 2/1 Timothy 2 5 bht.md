# 1 Timothy 2:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In recognizing the truth that there is one God who is the common Father and Savior of all, we understand the significance of having one Mediator. Through this Mediator, who reconciles us to God and handles the entirety of our salvation, we have access to the Father. His role as the Mediator, being both God and man, signifies his ability to represent and redeem the entire human race. Therefore, we are called to turn to this Mediator, who selflessly gave himself for all.
