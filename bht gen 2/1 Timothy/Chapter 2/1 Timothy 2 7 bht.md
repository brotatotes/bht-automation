## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I am ordained—literally, 'I was set': the same Greek, as 'putting me'... He recurs to himself... a living pattern or announcement of the Gospel..."
2. "The universality of his commission is an appropriate assertion here, where he is arguing to prove that prayers are to be made 'for all men'..."
3. "I speak the truth... and lie not—a strong asseveration of his universal commission, characteristic of the ardor of the apostle..."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I am ordained - Greek, 'I am placed or constituted' - ἐτέθην etethēn. The word 'ordain' has now acquired a technical signification, meaning to set apart solemnly to a sacred office by the imposition of hands; but it has not that meaning here."
2. "I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not - That is, by Christ; or I solemnly appeal to Christ - a form of an oath; notes, Romans 9:1."
3. "A teacher of the Gentiles - Specially appointed to carry the gospel to the Gentiles or the pagan; see the Romans 11:13 note; Galatians 2:7 note."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "I am ordained [ετεθην εγω]. Better, I was appointed."
2. "Paul does not use the noun, but the kindred verb khrussein to proclaim or preach is very common in his writings."
3. "It means that faith and truth are the element or sphere in which the apostolic function is discharged: that he preaches with a sincere faith in the gospel, and with a truthful representation of the gospel which he believes."

### John Calvin:
1. "That it may not be thought that he makes rash assertions — as many are wont to do — on a subject which he did not well understand, he affirms that God had appointed him for this purpose..."
2. "...that he might bring the Gentiles, who had formerly been alienated from the kingdom of God, to have a share in the gospel..."
3. "He employs an oath, or protestation, as in a matter of extraordinary weigh and importance, that he is a teacher of the Gentiles, and that in faith and truth..."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I was appointed a herald."
2. "The necessity for so vindicating his position had formed a habit."
3. "The region in which he was a teacher, that region being the faith in man, answering to the truth revealed in Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For which (εις ο). The testimony of Jesus in his self-surrender."
2. "Preacher and apostle (κηρυξ κα αποστολος). In 2 Timothy 1:10 Paul adds διδασκαλος (herald, apostle, teacher) as he does here with emphasis."
3. "I speak the truth, I lie not (αληθειαν λεγω, ου ψευδομα). A Pauline touch (Romans 9:1). Cf. Galatians 1:20; 2 Corinthians 11:31."

### John Gill:
1. "He was ordained or appointed to be a preacher of the Gospel from all eternity, and was separated or set apart unto it in time, and was put into the ministry of it by Christ himself."
2. "I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not...for the truth of what he said, concerning his ordination to the Gospel."
3. "A teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity...the faith and truth of the Gospel...the whole of it, the faith which was once delivered to the saints, and the truth as it is in Jesus."
