Prayer is a vital aspect of the Christian faith, highlighted by various perspectives. The duty of prayer extends beyond specific locations, demonstrating the importance of offering prayers everywhere. The lifting of holy hands signifies a pure and sinless state, emphasizing the need for an undefiled heart in prayer.

This teaches us to approach prayer with sincerity and peace, recognizing the significance of a clean conscience and a trusting faith.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The main subject of 1Ti 2:1 is carried on, the duty of PRATER, in general not (as Schleierm. objects) one portion merely of it, the allotting it to its proper offerers" 
2. "It is a local command respecting prayer, answering to the temporal command ἀδιαλείπτως προσεύχεσθε, 1 Thessalonians 5:17."
3. "Those hands are holy, which have not surrendered themselves as instruments of evil desire: the contrary are βέβηλοι χεῖρες, 2Ma 5:16; compare, for the expression, Job 17:9, Psalms 23:4, and in the N. T., especially James 4:8, καθαρίσατε χεῖρας καὶ ἁγνίσατε καρδίας."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The early Christians turned up their palms towards heaven, as those craving help do."
2. "The Jews washed their hands before prayer."
3. "This (or at least the contrite desire to be so) is a needful qualification for effectual prayer."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The meaning here is, 'it is my will' - expressing his wish in the case, or giving direction - though using a milder word than that which is commonly employed to denote an act of will. That men pray everywhere - Not merely in the temple, or in other sacred places, but in all places."
2. "Lifting up holy hands - To lift up the hands denotes supplication, as it was a common attitude of prayer to spread abroad the hands toward heaven... 'Holy hands' here, mean hands that are not defiled by sin, and that have not been employed for any purpose of iniquity."
3. "Without wrath - That is, without the intermingling of any evil passion; with a calm, peaceful, benevolent mind... It is impossible for a man to pray with comfort, or to suppose that his prayers will be heard, if he cherishes anger."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "I will [βουλομαι] . Better, I desire. See on Matthew 1:9, and comp. Philippians 1:12. Paul's word is qelw I will." 
2. "The phrase is unique in N. T. o LXX Among Orientals the lifting up of the hands accompanied taking an oath, blessing, and prayer. The custom passed over into the primitive church, as may be seen from the mural paintings in the catacombs."
3. "Prayer, according to our writer, is to be without the element of sceptical criticism, whether of God 's character and dealings, or of the character and behavior of those for whom prayer is offered."

### John Calvin:
1. "God reveals himself to us in his word, that we may call upon him; and this is the chief exercise of faith."
2. "Provided that it be attended by the corresponding truth which is represented by it, namely, that, having been informed that we ought to seek God in heaven, first, we should form no conception of Him that is earthly or carnal; and, secondly, that we should lay aside carnal affections, so that nothing may prevent our hearts from rising above the world."
3. "Paul wishes that debates of this nature should be put down, and that all the children of God of every nation and country should pray with one heart."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The ‘praying’ spoken of is not a mental act, but part of the public worship of the Church, and is therefore limited to the men."
2. "The rule implies, what is indeed obvious throughout the New Testament, that the utterances of prayer were not confined to the Bishop or Elder who presided."
3. "Stress is laid, not, as in James 1:6, on the necessity of faith in prayer, but on the inconsistency of the spirit of strife and debate with true worship."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I desire (βουλομα). So Philippians 1:12."
2. "The men (τους ανδρας). Accusative of general reference with the infinitive προσευχεσθα. The men in contrast to 'women' (γυναικας) in 1 Timothy 2:9."
3. "Lifting up holy hands (επαιροντας οσιους χειρας). Standing to pray. The point here is that only men should lead in public prayer who can lift up 'clean hands' (morally and spiritually clean). See Luke 24:50."

### John Gill:
1. "His will is that prayer should be performed by them everywhere, or in any place, in any part of the world where they lived."
2. "Lifting up of hands was a prayer gesture among the Heathens, and so it was among the Jews."
3. "Without wrath and doubting; or reasoning, or disputation in a contentious way: the former of these, some think, has reference to 'murmuring', as the Ethiopic version renders it, impatience and complaint against God in prayer, and the other to doubt and diffidence about being heard, and having the petitions answered."

### John Wesley:
1. "I will — A word strongly expressing his apostolical authority."
2. "Therefore — This particle connects the eighth with the first verse.
3. "Christianity consists of faith and love, embracing truth and grace: therefore the sum of our wishes should be, to pray, and live, and die, without any wrath or doubt."
