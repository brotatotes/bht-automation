# 1 Timothy 2:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Women are called to exhibit proper deportment in the duties of public worship, by adorning themselves with good works rather than with extravagant attire. The focus should be on the general duties of women, rather than any specific conduct in public worship. The adornment that comes from good works should be displayed through their practice, not by appearance alone. It is important for women to dress modestly and with humility, being mindful not to draw unnecessary attention or promote extravagance. This instruction applies not only to public worship but to all aspects of a woman's life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The public assemblies are doubtless, in 1 Timothy 2:12, still before the Apostle’s mind, but in a very slight degree. It is the general duties of women, rather than any single point in reference to their conduct in public worship, to which he is calling attention."
2. "Καταστολή, originally ‘arrangement,’ ‘putting in order,’ followed in its usage that of its verb καταστέλλω."
3. "The adorning which results from good works is brought about by (διὰ) their practice, not displayed by appearing to be invested with them (ἐν)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Women are apt to love fine dress; and at Ephesus the riches of some would lead them to dress luxuriously."
2. "The well-balanced state of mind arising from habitual self-restraint."
3. "Such gaud is characteristic of the spiritual harlot."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The direction in 1 Timothy 2:9-12, therefore, is to be understood particularly of the proper deportment of females in the duties of public worship."
2. "The apostle by the use of the word “adorn” (κοσμεῖν kosmein), shows that he is not opposed to ornament or adorning, provided it be of the right kind."
3. "The true idea here is, that her attention to her appearance should be such that she will be offensive to no class of persons; such as to show that her mind is supremely fixed on higher and more important things."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The writer's thought is still running upon the public assemblies for worship."
2. "Paul treats this subject 1 Corinthians 11:5 ff."
3. "The words with shamefastness and sobriety may either be taken directly with adorn themselves, or better perhaps, as indicating moral qualities accompanying the modest apparel."

### John Calvin:
1. "There is no profane place, nor any from which both men and women may not draw near to God, provided they are not excluded by their vices."
2. "He wishes therefore that their dress should be regulated by modesty and sobriety; for luxury and immoderate expense arise from a desire to make a display either for the sake of pride or of departure from chastity."
3. "Whatever is opposed to these virtues it will be in vain to excuse. He expressly censures certain kinds of superfluity, such as curled hair, jewels, and golden rings; not that the use of gold or of jewels is expressly forbidden, but that, wherever they are prominently displayed, these things commonly draw along with them the other evils which I have mentioned, and arise from ambition or from want of chastity as their source."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "General as those rules may seem, they have (as 1 Timothy 2:12 is enough to prove) a special reference to the dress and demeanour of women as worshippers."
2. "The ethical habit expressed is that formed by acts of self-control over desire till the effort of control is no longer needed."
3. "The words indicate...that a fashion was growing up of coming to the meetings of the disciples with all the outward tokens of wealth that belonged, as they thought, to their social  status."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In like manner that women... οσαυτως γυναικας. Βουλομα must be repeated from verse 1 Timothy 2:8... involved in οσαυτως (old adverb, as in Romans 8:26)."
2. "Grammatically that is possible (Lock), but it is hardly consonant with verses 1 Timothy 2:11-15 (White)."
3. "Adorn themselves... κοσμειν εαυτας. Present active infinitive after βουλομα understood. Old word from κοσμος (arrangement, ornament, order, world)."

### John Gill:
1. "he would not have them to come to public worship in rags, and in dirty and filthy garments, but that their bodies should be covered with clean and decent raiment"
2. "these are the two general rules by which dress is to be regulated; it is right and proper, when it is consistent with chastity, when it is not immodest and impudent, and more like the attire of an harlot than of a woman professing godliness; and when it is moderate as well as modest, and suitable to a person's age and station"
3. "seeing it might swell the heart of the wearer with pride, so as to forget herself and the business she was come about, and draw the eyes of others upon her; and so cause a general inattention"

### John Wesley:
1. "With sobriety — Which, in St. Paul's sense, is the virtue which governs our whole life according to true wisdom."
2. "Not with curled hair, not with gold — Worn by way of ornament."
3. "Not with pearls — Jewels of any kind: a part is put for the whole. Not with costly raiment — These four are expressly forbidden by name to all women (here is no exception) professing godliness, and no art of man can reconcile with the Christian profession the wilful violation of an express command."
