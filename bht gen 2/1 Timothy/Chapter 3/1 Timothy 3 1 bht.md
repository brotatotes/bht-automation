# 1 Timothy 3:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Faithful is the saying that if anyone desires the role of a bishop or overseer, they are pursuing a noble and commendable work. This statement highlights the importance of recognizing the true nature of this position, which goes beyond a mere inclination to preach. The office of a bishop involves labor, responsibility, and the need for specific qualifications. It is not simply a title or a means of personal ambition. The term bishop denotes the role of an overseer rather than a hierarchical distinction within the clergy. Understanding these truths is essential for those who aspire to this honorable work.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Faithful is the saying: if any man seeks the overseership, he desires a good work."
2. "It behoves then an overseer to be blameless, husband of one wife."
3. "Apt in teaching: not merely given to teaching, but able and skilled in it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Faithful is the saying." A needful preface to what follows: for the office of a bishop or overseer in Paul's day, attended as it was with hardship and often persecution, would not seem to the world generally a desirable and "good work."
2. "Desire‚Äîliterally, 'stretch one's self forward to grasp'; 'aim at': a distinct Greek verb from that for 'desireth.' What one does voluntarily is more esteemed than what he does when asked. This is utterly distinct from ambitious desires after office in the Church."
3. "good work‚Äîliterally, 'honorable work.' Not the honor associated with it, but the work, is the prominent thought. He who aims at the office must remember the high qualifications needed for the due discharge of its functions."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Lord, undoubtedly, by his Spirit, often excites an earnest and irrepressible desire to preach the gospel - a desire so strong, that he in whom it exists can be satisfied in no other calling. In such a case, it should be regarded as one evidence of a call to this work."
2. "The apostle, however, by the statements which follow, intimates that wherever this desire exists, it is of the utmost importance to have just views of the nature of the office, and that there should be other qualifications for the ministry than a mere desire to preach the gospel."
3. "To apply the term ['bishop'] to a pretended superior order of clergy, as designating their special office, is wholly to depart from the use of the word as it occurs in the Bible."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Desire [ŒøœÅŒµŒ≥ŒµœÑŒ±Œπ]. Better, seeketh. Only here...it implies not only desiring but seeking after." 
2. "The office of a bishop [ŒµœÄŒπœÉŒ∫ŒøœÄŒ∑œÇ]. The fundamental idea of the word is overseeing...Its adoption came about in a natural way...almost inevitably, the designation of a superintendent." 
3. "The prevailing O. T. sense of ejpiskoph is visitation for punishment, inquisition, or numbering."

### John Calvin:
1. "Let these words, therefore, be received as a preface intended to point out the importance of the subject."
2. "For the purpose of restraining such rashness in desiring the office of a bishop, Paul states, first, that this is not an indolent rank, but a work; and next, that it is not any kind of work, but excellent, and therefore toilsome and full of difficulty, as it actually is."
3. "The desire of great men does not rest on confidence of their own industry or virtue, but on the assistance of 'God, from whom is our sufficiency,' as Paul says elsewhere."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A true saying. Better as before, ‚Äòfaithful,‚Äô so as to keep the identity of phrase before the English reader."
2. "The office of a bishop, or overseer, was not likely, at the time when St. Paul wrote, to be an object of worldly ambition."
3. "Hence the stimulus of a new motive was needed, and was found in the half-proverbial maxim which named the office, with all its labour and risk, as a goodly and noble work for a man to aim at."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Faithful is the saying."

### John Gill:
1. "This is a doctrine that is true, and to be believed, that there is salvation through the birth of a Son, or through the incarnate Son of God, for men and women that believe in him, and continue in the faith of him, and love to him, joined with works of righteousness and holiness."
2. "The office of a bishop, elder, or pastor of a church, 'is a work', and a very laborious one; wherefore such are called labourers in the word and doctrine: it is not a mere title of honour, and a place of profit, but it is a business of labour and care; yet a good one, a famous and excellent one; it being an employment in things of the greatest excellency in themselves, and of the greatest usefulness for the good of men, and the honour of God."

### John Wesley:
1. He desireth a good work ‚Äî An excellent, but laborious, employment.
