# 1 Timothy 3:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The candidates for the role of deacons should first undergo examination and have their integrity assessed, just like the bishops. Their character should be known and respected among the Christian community, ensuring that they are not tainted by any major sins or accusations. Those who pass this test should then be chosen to serve as deacons, using their gifts and fulfilling their duties in the church.
