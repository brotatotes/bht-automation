# 1 Timothy 3:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The wives of deacons and bishops should possess the same qualities as their husbands, being aids to them in their office. They should not engage in slander or bring disrepute to their husbands or the church. Rather, they should be faithful in all things, demonstrating trustworthiness in their actions and responsibilities. By maintaining good character and fulfilling their roles diligently, they bring honor and credit to their husbands and reflect God's glory.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is alleged against it (a) that thus the return to the διάκονοι, 1 Timothy 3:12, would be harsh, or, as Conyb. 'on that view, the verse is most unnaturally interpolated in the midst of the discussion concerning the deacons.' But the ready answer to this is found in Chrys.’s view of 1 Timothy 3:12, that under διάκονοι, and their household duties, he comprehends in fact both sexes under one."
2. "That these women are deaconesses) (must be) grave, not slanderers...sober...faithful in all things."
3. "διάβολος in this sense (reff.) is peculiar in N. T. to these Epistles), sober (see on 1 Timothy 3:2, corresponding to μὴ οἴνῳ πολλῷ προσέχοντας), faithful in all things (corresponds to μὴ αἰσχροκερδεῖς: trusty in the distribution of the alms committed to them, and in all other ministrations)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For there is no reason that special rules should be laid down as to the wives of the deacons, and not also as to the wives of the bishops or overseers."
2. "Thus it appears he requires the same qualifications in female deacons as in deacons, only with such modifications as the difference of sex suggested."
3. "Faithful in all things—of life as well as faith. Trustworthy in respect to the alms committed to them and their other functions."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "No one can doubt that the character of a woman may be such, that it is not desirable that her husband should be an officer in the church."
2. "It means that they should not be women who were in the habit of calumniating others, or aspersing their character."
3. "Faithful in all things - To their husbands, to their families, to the church, to the Saviour."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A Deacon whose wife is wanting in the qualities required in him, is not to be chosen."
2. "She would sustain an active relation to his office, and by her ministries would increase his efficiency."
3. "By frivolity, slander, or intemperance, would bring him and his office into disrepute."

### John Calvin:
1. "Likewise the wives He means the wives both of deacons and of bishops, for they must be aids to their husbands in their office."


### Philip Schaff:
1. "The obvious parallelism with 1 Timothy 3:8 make it far more probable that St. Paul is speaking of the women who had a like work, the deaconesses of the Apostolic Church." 
2. "The functions of these deaconesses were probably analogous to those of their male colleagues: the distribution of alms to their own sex, caring for the sick, nursing orphan children, instructing female converts, and helping in the administration of their baptism." 
3. "The word so translated is that which commonly appears as the name of the devil, as the great slanderer and accuser of man and God. The Pastoral Epistles are the only part of the New Testament in which it appears in its generic sense."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

1. "Even so must their wives be grave...of an honest report, a good behaviour, and chaste conversation; which will reflect honour and credit to their husbands."
2. "...should they act such a part, and accuse either the poor, or any of the members of the church wrongfully, or on any trifling occasion, as persons addicted to this vice are wont to do, it would be of bad consequence."
3. "...excessive drinking is very scandalous in the female sex; and is the rather mentioned here, because women in the eastern countries were too frequently addicted to it."

### John Wesley:
1. Faithful in all things — Both to God, their husbands, and the poor.
