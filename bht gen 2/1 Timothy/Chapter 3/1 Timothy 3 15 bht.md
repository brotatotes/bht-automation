# 1 Timothy 3:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The purpose of this epistle is to guide you in how to conduct yourself within the church, the house of God. Just as a diligent person would ensure the smooth functioning of a large household, we should strive to maintain order and righteousness within the congregation. The church, as the pillar and foundation of the truth, plays a crucial role in upholding and spreading the word of God. It is through the church's faithful preaching, preservation, and transmission of the truth that it remains a steadfast support for the continued existence of the truth in the world.
