# 1 Timothy 3:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The mystery of godliness, which encompasses the entire scope of Christ's work on earth, can be summed up in six articles. Firstly, God revealed Himself in the form of flesh, taking on the nature of a servant and living as a man. Secondly, He was justified by the Spirit, with His resurrection being a public declaration of His identity as the Son of God. These aspects of the mystery of godliness highlight the extraordinary nature of Christ's incarnation and His ultimate vindication.
