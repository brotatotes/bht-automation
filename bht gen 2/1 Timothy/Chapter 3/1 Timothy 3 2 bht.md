# 1 Timothy 3:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A faithful pastor, who has the oversight of a Christian church, should be blameless, not marked by any infamy that would lessen his authority. It is not necessary for a bishop to be married, but if he is, he should have one wife at a time. His conduct should be characterized by vigilance and prudence, exhibiting a zealous yet calm and wise demeanor.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Episcopacy was adopted in apostolic times as the most expedient form of government, being most nearly in accordance with Jewish institutions, and so offering the less obstruction through Jewish prejudices to the progress of Christianity."
2. "The feeling which prevailed among the Gentiles, as well as the Jews, against a second marriage would, on the ground of expediency and conciliation in matters indifferent and not involving compromise of principle, account for Paul's prohibition here in the case of one in so prominent a sphere as a bishop or a deacon."
3. "The new man bears somewhat of a sacred festival character, incompatible with all confusion, disorder, excess, violence, laxity, assumption, harshness, and meanness."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A bishop - A minister of religion, according to the foregoing remarks, who has the charge or oversight of any Christian church."
2. "The husband of one wife - This need not be understood as requiring that a bishop “should be” a married man... But, while this interpretation is manifestly to be excluded as false, there has been much difference of opinion on the question whether the passage means that a minister should not have more than one wife at the same time, or whether it prohibits the marriage of a second wife after the death of the first."
3. "Sober - Properly, a man of 'a sound mind;' one who follows sound reason, and who is not under the control of passion. The idea is, that he should have his desires and passions well regulated."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Blameless...who gives no ground for accusation."
2. "The motive for marriage, namely protection against incontinency, which is adduced by Paul...is given in 1 Timothy 5:11-14."
3. "The function of teaching pertains to both Bishops and Elders...Bishops and Presbyters are not identical."

### John Calvin:
1. "He wishes a bishop to be blameless, instead of which, in the Epistle to Titus, He has used the word ἀνέγκλητον, meaning by both words, that he must not be marked by any infamy that would lessen his authority."
2. "The only true exposition, therefore, is that of Chrysostom, that in a bishop he expressly condemns polygamy, which at that time the Jews almost reckoned to be lawful."
3. "And yet I do not disapprove of the opinion of those who think that the Holy Spirit intended to guard against the diabolical superstition which afterwards arose; as if he had said, 'So far is it from being right and proper that celibacy should be enforced on bishops, that marriage is a state highly becoming in all believers'."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The emphasis of the numerical adjective shows that the command is restrictive rather than injunctive, but both this verse and 1 Timothy 3:4 appear to take marriage for granted."
2. "In a community much exposed to the suspicions or the slanders of the heathen, [marriage] would be a safeguard against many of the perils to which a celibate clergy have always been exposed."
3. "The most prominent fact in the social life both of Jews and Greeks at this period was the frequency of divorce. This...would at least so far diminish a man’s claim to respect as to disqualify him for office."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The word does not in the N.T. have the monarchical sense found in Ignatius of a bishop over elders."
2. "Without reproach (ανεπιλημπτον). Accusative case of general reference with δε and εινα. Old and common verbal (α privative and επιλαμβανω, not to be taken hold of), irreproachable."
3. "Given to hospitality (φιλοξενον). Old word (see φιλοξενια in Romans 12:13), from φιλος and ξενος, in N.T. only here, Titus 1:8; 1 Peter 4:9."

### John Gill:
1. "A bishop then must be blameless...that he should be one, who is so before men, and has not been guilty of any notorious and flagitious crime."
2. "The husband of one wife...in a literal sense of his conjugal estate; though this rule does not make it necessary that he should have a wife; or that he should not marry, or not have married a second wife, after the death of the first; only if he marries or is married, that he should have but one wife at a time."
3. "An elder or pastor must also be one that is vigilant...diligent in his business, and attends to his care and charge; is watchful over himself, his words, and actions; and watches for the souls of men, to do them all the good he can."

### John Wesley:
1. "A bishop...must be blameless — Without fault or just suspicion."
2. "The husband of one wife — This neither means that a bishop must be married, nor that he may not marry a second wife; which it is just as lawful for him to do as to marry a first, and may in some cases be his bounden duty."
3. "Vigilant, prudent — Lively and zealous, yet calm and wise. Of good behaviour — Naturally flowing from that vigilance and prudence."
