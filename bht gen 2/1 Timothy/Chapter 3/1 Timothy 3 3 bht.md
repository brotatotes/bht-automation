# 1 Timothy 3:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In considering the qualifications of a pastor, it is important to note the warning against excessive wine consumption and the harmful behavior it can lead to. A true pastor should not be driven by a love for money, but should exhibit a gentle and reasonable disposition. It is essential to avoid the mistake of appointing leaders who possess such vices. Instead, a pastor should be known for their self-control, kindness, and lack of greed.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "not a brawler (properly, ‘one in his cups,’ ‘a man rendered petulant by much wine:’ τὸ τοίνυν παρʼ οἶνον λυπεῖν τοὺς παρόντας, τοῦτʼ ἐγὼ κρίνω παροινίαν, Xen. Sympos. vi. 1. And perhaps the literal meaning should not be lost sight of."
2. "not a lover of money ('liberal,' Conyb.: but this is still more objectionable: it is not the positive virtue of liberality but the negative one of abstinence from love of money, which, though it may lead to the other in men who have money, is yet a totally distinct thing."
3. "but (this contrast springs out of the two last, and is set off by them) forbearing (reasonable and gentle: φέρειν εἰδότα τὰ πρὸς αὐτὸν πλημμελήματα, Thdrt. See note on Philippians 4:5, and Trench, N. T. Syn. § xliii.; but correct his derivation, as in that note)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Not given to wine—The Greek includes besides this, not indulging in the brawling, violent conduct towards others, which proceeds from being given to wine."
2. "no striker—with either hand or tongue: not as some teachers pretending a holy zeal."
3. "not covetous—Greek, 'not a lover of money,' whether he have much or little."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It cannot be inferred, from the use of the word here, that wine was absolutely and entirely prohibited; for the word does not properly express that idea."
2. "No man is under any 'obligation' of courtesy or Christian duty to use it; thousands of ministers of the gospel have brought ruin on themselves, and disgrace on the ministry, by its use."
3. "No matter what his talents may be, [a lover of money] has no proper qualification for the office, and will do more harm than good."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Quarrelsome over wine."
2. "Not greedy of filthy lucre."
3. "Not a money-lover."

### John Calvin:
1. "To drink wine excessively is not only very unbecoming in a pastor, but commonly draws along with it many things still worse."
2. "One who is addicted to wine, he contrasts one who is gentle or kind."
3. "He contrasts with 'the striker' the man who is 'not quarrelsome.' Mild — which, we have said, is contrasted with being 'addicted to wine' — is the term applied to him who knows how to bear injuries with a gentle and moderate disposition."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The words imply that in the haste of the early organization of the Church, mistakes had been made which invested even such characters as those described with the office of a bishop or elder."
2. "The history of not a few of the Councils of the Church shows that even in a more advanced stage of Christian culture, it was not altogether needless."
3. "The reasonable temper which does not insist even on actual rights, and still less on satisfaction for real or supposed injuries."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "No brawler (μη παροινον). Later word for the earlier παροινιος, one who sits long at (beside, παρα) his wine." 
2. "Gentle (επιεικη). See on Philippians 4:5 for this interesting word." 
3. "No lover of money (αφιλαργυρον). Late word (α privative and compound φιλ-αργυρος) in inscriptions and papyri (Nageli; also Deissmann, Light, etc., pp. 85f.)."

### John Gill:
1. "One that does not transgress over wine, or go beyond due bounds in the use of it, who is not immoderate in it; [...] who is fierce and furious, often very mischievous and injurious."
2. "Not one who is nimble and ready at [striking]; who no sooner is abused or injured, but he lifts up his hands and strikes; is but a word and a blow."
3. "Not covetous of getting money, of amassing wealth and riches together; or desirous of popular applause and glory from men."
