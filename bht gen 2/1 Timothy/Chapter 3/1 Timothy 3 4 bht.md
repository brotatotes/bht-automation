# 1 Timothy 3:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
One of the qualifications for a leader in the Church is the ability to govern their own household well. This involves not only external control, but also the proper decorum and reverence within the family. A bishop should maintain self-respect and inspire respect in others. The ability to rule over one's own family is seen as a necessary qualification for leading the Church, as it demonstrates the ability to preside properly and maintain order. This qualification is unique to the pastoral context and emphasizes the importance of practical experience in ordinary life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "having children in subjection with all gravity" 
2. "if any man knows not how to preside over his own house, how shall he take charge of the church of God?"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "having his children—rather
	as Greek, 'having children (who are) in subjection'"
	(Titus 1:6).
2. "gravity—propriety:
	reverent modesty on the part of the children [ALFORD]."
3. "The fact that he has children who are in subjection to him
	in all gravity, is the recommendation in his favor as one likely
	to rule well the Church."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A qualification to govern a family well, would be an evidence of a qualification to preside properly in the church."
2. "It is still true that, if he has a family, it is a necessary qualification, and that a man in the ministry 'should be' one who governs his own house well."
3. "He should maintain proper 'dignity' (σεμνότης semnotēs); he should maintain self-respect, and his deportment should be such as to inspire others with respect for him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "That ruleth [προισταμενον]. Mostly in the Pastorals, but also in Romans 12:8; 1 Thessalonians 5:12. The participle means placed in front."
2. "The phrase is unique in N. T. Upotagh subjection is a Pauline word."
3. "It is characteristic of the loose and unsettled ecclesiastical nomenclature of the apostolic age."

### John Calvin:
1. "Whatever may be the admiration commonly entertained for celibacy and a philosophical life altogether removed from ordinary custom, yet wise and thoughtful men are convinced by experience, that they who are not ignorant of ordinary life, but are practiced in the duties of human intercourse, are better trained and adapted for governing the Church."
2. "He who does not know how to rule his family will not be qualified for governing the Church."
3. "It will be a great disgrace to a bishop if he has children who lead a wicked and scandalous life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "One that ruleth well his own house." The qualification seems to presuppose the experience of home life as practically the best, if not the necessary, preparation for the pastoral office.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Ruling (προισταμενον). Present middle participle of προιστημ, old word to place before and (intransitive as here) to stand before."
2. "In subjection (εν υποταγη). See verse 1 Timothy 3:11."

### John Gill:
1. "One that ruleth well his own house,.... His family, wife, children, and servants; and is not to be understood of his body, and of keeping of that under, and of preserving it chaste and temperate..."
2. "having his children in subjection with all gravity; keeping a good decorum in his family; obliging his children to observe his orders, and especially the rules of God's word..."
3. "...and should not only rule well in their families, preside over them, go before them, and set an example to them, and keep their children in obedience and subjection; but this should be 'with all gravity': not only in the master of the family, but in the children..."

### John Wesley:
1. Having his children in subjection with all seriousness — For levity undermines all domestic authority; and this direction, by a parity of reason, belongs to all parents.
