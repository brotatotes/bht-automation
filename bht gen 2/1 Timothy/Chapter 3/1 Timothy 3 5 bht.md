# 1 Timothy 3:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If a man knows not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God? This passage presents the argument from the lesser to the greater, emphasizing the need for one to be able to manage their own household before being entrusted with the responsibility of overseeing the church. It is important for leaders to understand that the authority within a church is not absolute, but rather resembles that of a father in a family. Just as a father governs with care and love, so should those who preside over the church.
