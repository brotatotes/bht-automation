# 1 Timothy 3:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Not a novice, one who has recently embraced and professed the truth, must not be appointed to an important position in the church. The danger lies in the potential for pride to creep in, inflating their sense of self-importance. This sense of pride, if unchecked, may lead them down the same path of condemnation that the devil faced, due to his own pride and desire for greatness. It is therefore necessary to exercise caution and discernment when selecting leaders within the church.

2. "The condemnation of the devil... imply a reference to the Rabbinic view of the history of Satan, how, created in perfect excellence, his first act was to admire himself, and so, fevered with ambition, to aspire after equality with God, and thus to bring upon himself the sentence of condemnation."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Not a novice (μη νεοφυτον). Our 'neophyte.' Vernacular word from Aristophanes on, in LXX, and in papyri in the original sense of 'newly-planted' (νεοσ, φυω). Only here in N.T."

3. "The condemnation of the devil (κριμα του διαβολου). See Romans 3:8 for κριμα. Best to take του διαβολου as objective genitive, though subjective in verse 1 Timothy 3:7, 'the condemnation passed on or received by the devil' (not just 'the slanderer,' any slanderer)."

### John Wesley:
1. Lest being puffed up — With this new honour, or with the applause which frequently follows it.He fall into the condemnation of the devil — The same into which the devil fell.
