# 1 Timothy 3:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A church leader must have a good reputation not only among believers, but also among those outside the church. This is important because even unbelievers should acknowledge them as a person of integrity and uprightness. Without a positive reputation, they may be susceptible to negative judgments, criticism, and even temptation. It is crucial for a leader's character to be beyond reproach, as this not only invites people to listen to their message, but also protects them from the potential snare of their past mistakes.
