# 1 Timothy 3:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the church, deacons were chosen to attend to the temporal affairs and serve those in need. They are seen as servants, with their duties reflecting seriousness and respect. It is important for them to be honest and reliable in their word, as they bridge the gap between the pastor and the congregation. Their motivation should not be personal gain but rather a sincere desire to serve Christ and others. The gain obtained through their ministry should be seen as impure and base. Their commitment to integrity is essential in carrying out their responsibilities.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The ecclesiastical order sprung out of similar necessities, and had for its field of work similar objects."
2. "This particular of the deaconsâ€™ character assumes special importance, if we connect it with the collecting and distributing alms."
3. "That great objective truth which man of himself knows not, but which the Spirit of God reveals to the faithful."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The deacons were chosen by the voice of the people."
2. "Their duty was to read the Scriptures in the Church, to instruct the catechumens in Christian truths, to assist the presbyters at the sacraments, to receive oblations, and to preach and instruct."
3. "All gain is filthy (literally, 'base') which is set before a man as a by-end in his work for God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Likewise must the deacons... denote those who had charge of the temporal affairs of the church, the poor, etc."
2. "Be grave - Serious, sober-minded men... inspire respect."
3. "Not double-tongued... men who can be relied on for the exact truth of what they say."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The terms diakonov and diakonia are, in the Pauline writings, common expressions of servants and service either to Christ or to others."
2. "The appointment of the seven grew out of a special emergency, and was made for a particular service; and the resemblance is not close between the duties and qualifications of deacons in the Pastorals and those of the seven."
3. "Double-tongued [Î´Î¹Î»Î¿Î³Î¿Ï…Ï‚]. N.T. o. o LXX, o Class. Saying one thing and meaning another, and making different representations to different people about the same thing."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is certain that the Apostle speaks of those who hold a public office in the Church; and this refutes the opinion of those who think that domestic servants are here meant."
2. "It remains to be stated that we understand 'the deacons' to be those who are mentioned by Luke, (Acts 6:3), and who had the charge of the poor."
3. "Yet it ought to be carefully observed that he advises them not to be double-tongued; because it is a vice which it is difficult to avoid in the discharge of that office, and yet ought, more than anything else, to be kept at a distance from it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "As the 'bishops' and 'elders' were titles applied to the same persons, expressing different aspects of their relation to the Church, there is, of course, no mention of the 'elders' as an intermediate order."
2. "The absence of that order, as contrasted with the recognition of the three grades in the Ignatian Epistles, is, so far as it goes, evidence of the early date of the Pastoral Epistles."
3. "There is a certain touch of inferiority in the conditions named for the deacons, as compared with those for the Episcopate. No teaching power is required. The danger of intemperance is expressed in stronger terms; the evil of the love of base and fraudulent gain, the special temptation of those who had the charge of the Churchâ€™s alms, is more prominent."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Grave" (ÏƒÎµÎ¼Î½Î¿Ï…Ï‚). See Philippians 4:8.
2. "Not double-tongued" (Î¼Î· Î´Î¹Î»Î¿Î³Î¿Ï…Ï‚). Rare word (Î´Î¹Ïƒ, Î»ÎµÎ³Ï‰) saying same thing twice.

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle proceeds to give the qualifications, and so the rules for choosing another sort of officers in the church, deacons; whose work and business is, not to preach the Gospel, and administer ordinances; but to take care of the secular affairs of the church, and particularly to serve tables..."
2. "Their characters are, that they be 'grave'; in their speech, gesture, and dress; honest, and of good report among men; and chaste in their words and actions..."
3. "...not doubletongued; whose hearts and tongues do not agree together; and who, being a sort of middle persons between the pastor and the members of the church, say one thing to one, and another to the other; which to do is of bad consequence..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Likewise the deacons must be serious - Men of a grave, decent, venerable behaviour."
2. "Not desirous of filthy gain - With what abhorrence does he everywhere speak of this!"
3. "All that is gained (above food and raiment) by ministering in holy things is filthy gain indeed; far more filthy than what is honestly gained by raking kennels, or emptying common sewers."
