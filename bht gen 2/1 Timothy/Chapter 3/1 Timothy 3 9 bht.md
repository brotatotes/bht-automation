# 1 Timothy 3:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The mystery of the faith, the revealed truth that was once concealed, is to be held firmly, with a sincere fear of God, in a conscience untainted by anything impure. It is not enough to have a mere orthodox faith, for true faith is not just a matter of belief, but also one of ethical living and sincere devotion. Deacons, as representatives of the Church, must especially exemplify this characteristic, holding fast to the pure doctrine of the faith and upholding it with integrity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The mystery of the faith - holding the faith, which to the natural man remains a mystery, but which has been revealed by the Spirit to them."
2. "In a pure conscience - in which nothing base or foreign is intermixed."
3. "They especially needed to have this characteristic, which every Christian ought to have."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Holding the mystery of the faith...which had been concealed, or hidden, but which was now revealed."
2. "He should hold firmly the great doctrines of the Christian religion which had been so long concealed from people, but which were now revealed."
3. "A mere orthodox faith was not all that was necessary, for it was possible that a man might be professedly firm in the belief of the truths of revelation, and yet be corrupt at heart."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The mystery of the faith is the subject - matter of the faith; the truth which is its basis, which was kept hidden from the world until revealed at the appointed time, and which is a secret to ordinary eyes, but is made known by divine revelation."
2. "The emphasis of the passage is on these words. They express conscientious purity and sincerity in contrast with those who are described as branded in their own conscience, and thus causing their followers to fall away from the faith."
3. "'Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience' is a significant association of faith with ethics. As Weiss puts it: 'It is as if the pure conscience were the vessel in which the mystery of the faith is preserved.' The idea is sound and valuable."

### John Calvin:
1. "Holding the pure doctrine of religion, and that from the heart, with a sincere fear of God."
2. "He gives to the sum of Christian doctrine the honorable appellation of a mystery; as indeed God, through the gospel, reveals to men on earth a wisdom which angels in heaven behold with admiration."
3. "Thus he wishes that deacons should be well instructed in 'the mystery of faith;' because, although they do not hold the office of teaching, yet it would be exceedingly absurd to hold a public office in the Church, while they were ill informed in the Christian faith."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The mystery of the faith. The truth hidden before, but now revealed to the initiated." 
2. "Guided by the analogy of that passage, and by 1 Timothy 5:8; Jude 1:3, it seems better to take faith here in its objective sense."
3. "but that and what is called its subjective meaning are so blended together in St. Paul’s thoughts that it is scarcely possible to draw a hard and fast line of demarcation between them."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The inner secret of the faith," the revelation given in Christ.
2. "The casket in which the jewel is to be kept" (Lock).

### John Gill:
1. "The doctrine of the Gospel, called the 'faith', because it contains things to be believed; proposes Christ the object of faith; is the means by which faith comes, and is unprofitable without it."
2. "It is called 'the mystery', because it is of divine revelation, and could have never been discovered by human reason; and now it is revealed, the modus of many things contained in it remains a mystery."
3. "This mysterious doctrine of faith is to be held by deacons; they are to profess it, and to hold fast the profession of it and that in a pure conscience; with a conscience sprinkled by the blood of Christ; with a conscience void of offence both towards God and man; with a suitable life and conversation."

### John Wesley:
1. Holding fast the faith in a pure conscience — Steadfast in faith, holy in heart and life.
