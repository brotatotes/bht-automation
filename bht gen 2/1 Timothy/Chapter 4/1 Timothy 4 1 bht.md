# 1 Timothy 4:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Spirit explicitly declares that in the later times, there will be a significant departure from the faith. This departure will be marked by giving heed to seducing spirits who lead astray and inspire false prophets. It is a forewarning of the dangers of being deceived by teachings that do not align with the true faith and the influence of evil spirits in distorting the word of God.
