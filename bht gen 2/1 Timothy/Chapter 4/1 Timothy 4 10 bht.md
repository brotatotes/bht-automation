# 1 Timothy 4:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We endure both labor and reproach, not seeking pleasure or honor in this world. This is because our hope is placed in the living God, who is the Savior of all men. It is through this hope that we are able to withstand the hardships and persecution that come our way. God is not only the preserver of our lives, but also offers eternal salvation to all who trust in Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The reason why 'we both labor and suffer reproach is because we have rested, and do rest our hope, on the living God." 
2. "Their 'labor and reproach' are not inconsistent with their having from the living God, their Saviour, even in this life." 
3. "He is the Saviour of all men potentially; of believers alone effectually."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We labor and suffer reproach, for we have hope in God. Through him we look for salvation. We believe that he has made this known to people, and believing this, we labor earnestly to make it known, even though it be attended with reproaches."
2. "When, therefore, it is said that he 'is the Saviour of ‘all’ people, ‘especially’ of those who believe,' it must mean that there is a sense in which it is true that he may be called the Saviour of all people, while, at the same time, it is 'actually' true that those only are saved who believe."
3. "This is the speciality or the uniqueness in the salvation of those who actually reach heaven, that they are 'believers.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Both words [labor and strive] denote strenuous and painful effort." 
2. "The kai; has an ascensive force: 'we labor, yea struggle.'"
3. "We have set our hope on."

### John Calvin:
1. "The sum is, that believers are not miserable in afflictions, because a good conscience supports them, and a blessed and joyful end awaits them."
2. "Our afflictions are accompanied by hope in the living God, and, what is more, hope may be regarded as the foundation; but it never maketh ashamed, and therefore everything that happens to the godly ought to be reckoned a gain."
3. "If there is no man who does not feel the goodness of God towards him, and who is not a partaker of it, how much more shall it be experienced by the godly, who hope in him? Will he not take peculiar care in them? Will he not more freely pour out his bounty on them? In a word, will he not, in every respect, keep them safe to the end?" 

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Christian too often had nothing for it but reviling and reproach...The train of thought implied in the 'for,' is that the patient endurance of the Christian was a practical proof that the religion which he professed had for him the twofold promise of which the previous verse had spoken."
2. "This hope is not in a dogma or an abstraction, but in a living God, who is the 'Saviour,' in the lower sense of the word as 'preserver,' no less than in the higher, thus including the 'life that now is,' as well as 'that which is to come.'"
3. "As in 1 Timothy 2:4, the purpose of God for a salvation which shall include all is assumed as an unquestionable truth, but those only who believe taste that salvation in the fulness of its power."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "To this end...we labor and strive." 
2. "Because we have set our hope...Savior of all men." 
3. "Specially of them that believe."

### John Gill:
1. "The Alexandrian copy, and another manuscript, read, 'we strive'; or contend even to an agony, combating with sin, Satan, and the world, with profane men, and with false teachers." 
2. "He [God] has life in himself, essentially, originally, and independently, and is the author and giver of life, natural, spiritual, and eternal, unto others."
3. "There is a great deal of reason to believe this, for if he is the Saviour of all men, then much more of them who are of more worth, value, and esteem with him, than all the world beside."
