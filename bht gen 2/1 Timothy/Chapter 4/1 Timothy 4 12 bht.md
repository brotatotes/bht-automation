### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Act so as to be respected in spite of thy youth... He was but a mere youth when he joined Paul... He was, therefore, still young; especially in comparison with Paul, whose place he was filling; also in relation to elderly presbyters whom he should 'entreat as a father', and generally in respect to his duties in rebuking, exhorting, and ordaining, which ordinarily accord best with an elderly person."
2. "Become a pattern, the true way of making men not to despise (slight, or disregard) thy youth."
3. "In all that thou sayest in public and private... in behavior... in charity and faith—the two cardinal principles of the Christian."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Act as becomes a minister of the gospel in all things, and in such a way that people will respect you as such, though you are young."
