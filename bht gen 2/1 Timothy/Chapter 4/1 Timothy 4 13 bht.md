# 1 Timothy 4:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The act of reading Scripture, both publicly and privately, is of utmost importance. It serves as a source of spiritual knowledge, a test of doctrine, and a foundation upon which pastors can draw as they lead and instruct their congregations. Exhortation and teaching go hand in hand, with exhortation stirring believers to exercise grace and fulfill their duties, and teaching providing a systematic and intellectual understanding of the Gospel. As pastors engage in the practice of reading, exhortation, and teaching, they not only enrich their own understanding but also equip themselves to guide and inspire others on their spiritual journey.
