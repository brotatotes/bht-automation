# 1 Timothy 4:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The spiritual gift within you, given by the Holy Spirit, is not to be neglected but used for the edification and teaching of others. The laying on of hands by the presbytery is a symbolic act that signifies the imparting of the Holy Spirit. This gift, bestowed upon you by prophecy, qualifies you for the interpretation of Scriptures and the preaching of the Gospel. So, do not hide or neglect this divine gift, but diligently cultivate and exercise it to its full potential for the benefit of others.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Do not neglect the spiritual gift which is in thee...the spiritual gift is that of teaching and ruling the church."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The gift is represented as a spark of the Spirit lying within him, and sure to smoulder by neglect."
2. "The gift was connected with the symbolical act of laying on hands. But the Greek 'with' implies that the presbyter's laying on hands was the mere accompaniment of the conferring of the gift."
3. "At the ordination of the president of the synagogue there were always three presbyters present to lay on hands, so the early Church canons required three bishops to be present at the consecration of a bishop."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The 'gift' then referred to here was that by which Timothy was qualified for the work of the ministry."
2. "He was to be recognized as its source; and it was not therefore conferred merely by human hands."
3. "The call of God to the work thus recognized by the church, and the approbation of the Presbytery expressed by setting him apart to the office, should be regarded by Timothy as a part of the 'gift' or 'benefit' (charisma) which had been conferred on him, and which he was not to neglect."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The gift that is in thee...The meaning is the special inward endowment which qualified Timothy for exhortation and teaching, and which was directly imparted by the Holy Spirit." 
2. "The Biblical custom rests on the conception of the hand as the organ of mediation and transference...The hand was laid on the head of a son, to indicate the transmission of the hereditary blessing...So Christ (Mark 6:5; Luke 4:40). In the primitive Christian church the laying on of hands signified the imparting of the Holy Spirit."
3. "Of the presbytery...Here of the college or fraternity of Christian elders in the place where Timothy was ordained. The word is frequent in the Epistles of Ignatius. According to this, Timothy was not ordained by a Bishop."

### John Calvin:
1. "God does not wish that talents — which he has bestowed on any one, that they may bring gain — should either be lost, or be hidden in the earth without advantage."

1. "The words point, like the 'rekindle' in 2 Timothy 1:6, to the danger of an ascetic temperament tending to meditative quiescence rather than energetic service."
2. "The context implies that it was the special gift needed for the 'exhortation' and 'teaching' of the previous verse - a gift therefore at once of knowledge and of wisdom, of sympathy and insight."
3. "The scene which the words suggest is that of the young convert kneeling in prayer, the presbytery, or body of elders in the Church of Lystra (or, it may be, Ephesus) laying their hands upon him, in prayer for the gifts he needed, while a prophet, recognising at once his special capacities and the gifts which were required for their full development, told the elders for what gifts to pray."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Neglect not the gift that is in thee."  
2. "By prophecy, accompanied by prophecy, not bestowed by prophecy."
3. "With the laying on of hands of the presbytery."

### John Gill:

2. "This gift is by no means to be neglected; this talent should not be hid in the earth, or wrapped up in a napkin; it should not lie dormant and useless, but should be stirred up, cultivated, and improved."
3. "This gift was given him to qualify him for the interpreting of the Scriptures, the explaining of the prophecies of the Old Testament, and for the preaching of the Gospel; and therefore he should not neglect it, but use it for this purpose."

### John Wesley:
