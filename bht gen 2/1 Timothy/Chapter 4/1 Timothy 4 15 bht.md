# 1 Timothy 4:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Meditation on the word of God is not simply reading, but a deep and heartfelt engagement with the truths it contains. It is a spiritual exercise that requires faith, hope, love, and joy, a blending of the heart and mind through the work of the Holy Spirit. A faithful minister of the Gospel should devote themselves entirely to the study and application of God's word, not becoming entangled in worldly pursuits or distractions. By doing so, they will be enabled to fulfill their calling and avoid being sidetracked by insignificant pursuits that can steal away precious time.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "These things (viz. the things enjoined 1Ti 4:12-14) do thou care for, in these things be (employed) that thy progress may be manifest to all."
2. "To which I may add a more striking parallel, Hor. Sat. i. 9. 2, 'Nescio quid meditans nugarum, et totus in illis', that thy progress (ref.: προκοπή is branded as a 'vox non immerito a grammaticis contemta' by Lobeck, Phryn. p. 85: towards perfection; certainly in the Christian life, as Heydenr., De W.: this is implied."
3. "The more direct meaning is, 'with reference to the duties of thine office: and especially as respects the caution given 1 Timothy 4:12, that no man despise thy youth."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Meditate CAREFULLY upon" - As food would not nourish without digestion, which assimilates the food to the substance of the body, so spiritual food, in order to benefit us, needs to be appropriated by prayerful meditation. 
2. "give thyself wholly to" - Entire self-dedication, as in other pursuits, so especially in religion, is the secret of proficiency. There are changes as to all other studies, fashionable today, out of fashion tomorrow; this study alone is never obsolete, and when made the all-engrossing aim sanctifies all other studies. 
3. "profiting" - Progress towards perfection in the Christian life, and especially towards the fullest realization of the ideal of a Christian minister.

3. "A minister of the gospel ought to make steady improvement in all that pertains to his office...It should be apparent to all persons who attend on the stated preaching of a minister of the gospel, that he is making steady advances in knowledge, wisdom, and piety, and in all things that pertain to the proper performance of the duties of his office."

### Marvin Vincent:

3. "The figure in the word is uncertain, but is supposed to be that of pioneers cutting a way before an army, and so furthering its advance."

### John Calvin:
1. "The greater the difficulty in faithfully discharging the ministry of the Church, so much the more ought a pastor to apply himself earnestly, and with his whole might; and that not only for a short time, but with unfailing perseverance."
2. "He means, that he ought to labor to this purpose, that by his agency the edification of the Church may be more and more advanced, and that corresponding results may be visible; for it is not the work of a single day, and therefore he should strive to make daily progress."
