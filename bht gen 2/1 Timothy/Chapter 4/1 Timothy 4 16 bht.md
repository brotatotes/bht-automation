# 1 Timothy 4:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By taking heed to both his personal conduct and his teaching, a minister ensures that his life aligns with his message. It is not sufficient to merely possess a life of integrity; it is equally important to diligently impart sound doctrine. In doing so, a minister not only secures his own salvation, but also becomes an instrument of salvation for those who hear him. The duty of a minister is to faithfully adhere to these guidelines, thereby preserving himself from any just reproach and safeguarding the spiritual well-being of his congregation.
