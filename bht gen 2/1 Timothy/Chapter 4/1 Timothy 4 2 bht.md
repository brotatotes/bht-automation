# 1 Timothy 4:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These verses warn about the danger of false teachers who promote deceptive doctrines under the guise of truth. They are branded with a consciousness of their own crimes, hardening their consciences and making them senseless. Just as a hot iron leaves a scar, these deceptive teachers are marked by the hypocrisy of their own actions. We must be alert and discerning, holding fast to the genuine teachings of the faith and avoiding the influence of those who would lead us astray.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Through the hypocrisy of lying speakers"; this expresses the means through which "some shall (be led to) depart from the faith," namely, the reigned sanctity of the seducers.
2. "Having their own conscience seared" - not only "speaking lies" to others, but also having their own conscience seared. Professing to lead others to holiness, their own conscience is all the while defiled.
3. "The Greek, however, primarily means 'branded' with the consciousness of crimes committed against their better knowledge and conscience, like so many scars burnt in by a branding iron... They are conscious of the brand within, and yet with a hypocritical show of sanctity, they strive to seduce others."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The apostle meant to say that this grand apostasy would occur under the influence of a hypocritical, hardened, and arbitrary ministry, teaching their own doctrines instead of the divine commands, and forbidding that which God had declared to be lawful."
2. "The entire scheme attempts to palm falsehood upon the world, in the place of the simple teaching of the New Testament."
3. "Having their conscience seared with a hot iron - The allusion here is doubtless to the effect of applying a hot iron to the skin. The cauterized part becomes rigid and hard, and is dead to sensibility. So with the conscience of those referred to."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Through the hypocrisy of men that speak lies."
2. "Branded in their own conscience."
3. "These deceivers... wear the form of godliness, and contradict their profession by their crooked conduct."

### John Calvin:
1. "consigns, that are bad and seared with the hot iron of their crimes, always flee to hypocrisy as a ready refuge; that is, they contrive hypocritical presences, in order to dazzle the eyes of God..."
2. "The word hypocrisy must therefore be explained agreeably to the passage in which it now occurs; for, first, it must relate to doctrine, and, next, it denotes that kind of doctrine which adulterates the spiritual worship of God..."
3. "first, that all who assume a pretended sanctimoniousness are led by the instigation of the devil; because God is never worshipped aright by outward ceremonies..."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In, or by, the hypocrisy of men who speak lies."
2. "The thought of this as the stage to which even conscience may be brought, as of one who has made himself ‘past feeling,’ was already indeed familiar to St. Paul, in Ephesians 4:19."
3. "The other aspect of the word, as pointing to the brand by which criminals were stamped with infamy, is perhaps included."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A good classical word for liars on a large scale" (Parry).
2. "Branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron."
3. "Branded with the mark of Satan as Paul was with the marks of Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle is still speaking of the means by which the apostasy should rise, and get ground; and it should be by the means of persons that should deliver lying or false doctrine under the colour of truth."
2. "This plainly points at the abettors of antichrist, the Romish priests, who deliver out the lying doctrines of merit, purgatory, invocation of saints, fastings, pilgrimages, etc."
3. "Having their conscience seared with a hot iron which exactly describes the above mentioned persons, whose consciences are cauterized and hardened, and past feeling."

### John Wesley:
1. "These will depart from the faith, by the hypocrisy of them that speak lies."
2. "Having their own consciences as senseless and unfeeling."
3. "As flesh that is seared with a hot iron."
