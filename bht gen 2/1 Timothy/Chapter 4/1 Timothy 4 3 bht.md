# 1 Timothy 4:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During the early Christian era, there were groups promoting ascetic practices and false teachings, forbidding marriage and imposing strict dietary regulations on believers. However, these commentaries argue against such teachings, emphasizing that God created everything to be enjoyed and that all foods are clean. They highlight the importance of having knowledge of the truth and a pure conscience, and encourage believers to give thanks to God for His provision. By rejecting these false teachings and embracing God's goodness, believers can experience a deeper understanding and appreciation of His creation.
