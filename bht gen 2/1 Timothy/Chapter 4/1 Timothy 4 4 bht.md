# 1 Timothy 4:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Every created thing, whether it is food or not, is good and should be used without discrimination, as God intended. Nothing should be rejected as unclean or abstained from at certain times. However, it is important to receive these things with gratitude, for ingratitude is unworthy of God's blessings.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Because" (expressing a reason resting on an objective fact; or, as here, a Scripture quotation)—"For" (a reason resting on something subjective in the writer's mind). 
2. A refutation by anticipation of the Gnostic opposition to creation: the seeds of which were now lurking latently in the Church.
3. Meats, though pure in themselves, become impure by being received with an unthankful mind.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "But it should not be inferred that a thing which is poisonous in its nature is good for food, 'because' it is a creation of God. It is good only in its place, and for the ends for which he intended it."
2. "True, they 'are' good - they 'are' to be received with gratitude as he made them, and as applied to the uses for which he designed them."
3. "The sense is, that as God made it, and for the purposes for which he designed it, it is not to be held to be evil; or, which is the same thing, it is not to be prohibited as if there were merit in abstaining from it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Creature [κτισμα] . Not in Paul...A created thing." 
2. "Refused [αποβλητον] . Lit. thrown away...excommunicated."
3. "On the whole verse, comp. Acts 10:15; Romans 11:15; 1 Corinthians 10:25, 1 Corinthians 10:26, 1 Corinthians 10:30, 1 Corinthians 10:31."

### John Calvin:
1. "The goodness of the creatures, which he mentions, has relation to men, and that not with regard to the body or to health, but to the consciences."
2. "Paul means, that those things which come from the hand of God, and are intended for our use, are not unclean or polluted before God, but that we may freely eat them with regard to conscience."
3. "Creatures are not called pure, merely because they are the works of God, but because, through his kindness, they have been given to us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The higher word (καλόν, excellent, not ἀ γαθόν) is used in the Greek, as in the LXX. of Genesis 1:0, and with a manifest reference to that history."
2. "The repetition of the clause ('with thanksgiving') is striking, as showing how the apostle’s mind recognised that it was the spiritual state of the receiver, not the physical characteristics of the thing received, that determined the lawfulness of the reception."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Creature (κτισμα). Late word from κτιζω, result of creating."
2. "To be rejected (αποβλητον). Old verbal adjective in passive sense from αποβαλλω, to throw away, here only in N.T."
3. "If it be received (λαμβανομενον). 'Being received.' Present passive participle of λαμβανω, in conditional sense, 'with thanksgiving.'"

### John Gill:
1. "For every creature of God is good,.... For food; and should be taken and used for that purpose, at all times, without distinction."
2. "and nothing to be refused; or rejected as common and unclean, or to be abstained from at certain times."
3. "if it be received with thanksgiving: if not, persons are very ungrateful, and very unworthy of such favours."
