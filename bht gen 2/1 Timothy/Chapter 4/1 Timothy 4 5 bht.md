# 1 Timothy 4:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The food we eat is sanctified or made holy by the word of God, which created it and gave it to us for sustenance. We, as children of God, are called to pray for the sanctification of all the creatures we partake of. This practice of consecrating our meals through prayer is not limited to Christians, but even the Jews and pagans recognized its importance. Through the word of God and prayer, we acknowledge the divine purpose in bestowing these gifts upon us.
