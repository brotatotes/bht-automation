# 1 Timothy 4:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Ministers have a duty to remind the church of what they have learned and believed, establishing them in truth. A true minister of Jesus Christ is appointed, called, and sent by Him, proclaiming the doctrines of Christ and His salvation. These words of faith and good doctrine are nourishing and beneficial, providing both milk for spiritual infants and solid food for the mature, enabling growth and guarding against the spread of error.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If thou suggest to (bring under the notice of) the brethren these things—namely, the truths stated in 1 Timothy 4:4-5, in opposition to the errors foretold."
2. "Nourished up—continually being nourished in the words of the faith, the good teaching. Explanatory of 'the faith,' in opposition to the 'teachings of demons' which Timothy was to counteract."
3. "Whereunto thou hast attained—the course of which thou hast followed; thou hast begun to follow up. It is an undesigned coincidence that the Greek verb is used only by Paul and Paul's companion, Luke."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is the duty of the ministry to show to the people of their charge what 'is' error and where it may be apprehended, and to caution them to avoid it."
2. "From one who had been thus educated, it was reasonable to expect that he would be a faithful and exemplary minister of the gospel."
3. "No young man should, by neglect, indolence, or folly, disappoint the reasonable expectations of his friends. Their cherished hopes are a proper ground of appeal to him, and it may be properly demanded of every one that he shall carry out to their legitimate results all the principles of his early training, and that he shall be in his profession all that his early advantages make it reasonable to 'expect' that he will be."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Paul 's more usual phrase is servant of God: servant [διακονος] of Christ twice, and diakonov Ihsou Cristou not at all."
2. "The participle indicates the means by which Timothy may become a good minister. Comp. Hebrews 5:12-14."
3. "The words in which the faith - the contents of belief - finds expression."

### John Calvin:
1. "And we ought to make the contrast which is implied; for the doctrine which he commends is here contrasted by him not with false or wicked doctrines, but with useless trifles which do not edify."
2. "Men frequently aim at something else than to approve themselves to Christ; and consequently many are desirous of being applauded for genius, eloquence, and profound knowledge. But Paul enjoins Timothy to be satisfied with this alone, to be a faithful minister of Christ."
3. "As thou hast been, from thy infancy, properly instructed in the faith, and, so to speak, hast sucked along with the milk sound doctrine, and hast made continual progress in it hitherto, endeavor, by faithful ministration, to prove that thou art such."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The use of the word tends to limit ‘these things’ to the immediate context."
2. "Whatever difference there might be between apostles, elders, deacons, all were alike ‘ministers’ of Christ."
3. "The word expresses rather the thought of being ‘reared’ or ‘educated in’ the words of faith, and suggests the half-medical reference to ‘bodily exercise’ that follows."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Suggesting these things to the brethren."
2. "Thou shalt be a good minister of Christ Jesus."
3. "The right diet for babes in Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "It is one part of the business of Gospel ministers to put the churches in mind of what they have received and known, and are established in."
2. "A minister of Jesus Christ is one of his making, qualifying, calling, and sending; and who makes Christ, the doctrines respecting his person and offices, his grace, righteousness, and salvation, the subject of his ministry."
3. "They [the words of faith and good doctrine] are the wholesome and salutary words of Christ; they have in them milk for babes, and meat for strong men; by which both grow and thrive, when error eats as does a canker."
