# 1 Timothy 4:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Bodily exercise may bring some benefits to the health and strength of the body, but it is only of limited value. On the other hand, piety or religion holds much greater value as it is profitable for all things - promoting both physical and spiritual well-being not only in this life, but also in the life to come. It promises not only temporal blessings but also eternal life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The exercise of the body is profitable, but those uses partial only."
2. "Piety is profitable for all things, having promise of the life which is now and which is to come."
3. "The best promise belonging to this life and to that which is to come."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Paul does not deny that fasting and abstinence from conjugal intercourse for a time, with a view to reaching the inward man through the outward, do profit somewhat."
2. "Paul, therefore, while not disapproving of this in its due proportion and place, shows the vast superiority of godliness or piety, as being profitable not merely 'to a small extent,' but unto all things."
3. "He who has piety (which is 'profitable unto all things') wants nothing needed to his well-being, even though he be without those helps which, 'to a small extent,' bodily exercise furnishes."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Bodily exercise" refers to the mortifications of the body by abstinence and penance which the ancient devotees made so important, but such austerities do little to promote holiness, but much to promote superstition.
2. Religion is profitable unto all things. It is favorable to health, clearness and vigor of intellect, peace of conscience, prosperity in business, a good name, and comfort in trial.
3. Religion promises us needful food and raiment, comfort in affliction, support in old age and death, and a good reputation when we are dead. There is nothing which man really "needs" in this life, which is not promised by religion.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The use of the athlete's training extends to only a few things." 
2. "Godliness involves a promise for this life and for the next; but for this life as it reflects the heavenly life, is shaped and controlled by it, and bears its impress." 
3. "Only the life which is in Christ Jesus is life indeed."

### John Calvin:
1. "Though the heart be altogether upright, and the object proper, yet, in outward actions, Paul finds nothing that he can value highly."
2. "Our nature always disposes us strongly to attribute more than we ought to austerity of life; as if it were no ordinary portion of Christian holiness."
3. "When any one shall have labored much and long in those exercises, the profit will be small and inconsiderable; for they are nothing but the rudiments of childish discipline."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The example of St. Paul might well suggest a like discipline with the aim of bringing the body under the control of the higher life." 
2. "From St. Paul's point of view, the training was useful as a means to an end, and that end, godliness." 
3. "The promise that belongs to the present life, and also to the future."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Bodily exercise, also a common old word, here only in N.T." 
2. "Profitable, another old word, in N.T. only here, Titus 3:8; 2 Timothy 3:16."
3. "'For little.' Probably extent in contrast to 'for all things.'"

### John Gill:
1. "For bodily exercise profiteth little.... much less exercise of the body for health or recreation... rather mere formal external worship, as opposed to godliness, or spiritual worship."
2. "godliness is profitable unto all things; to the health of the body, and the welfare of the soul; to the things of this life, and of that which is to come..."
3. "having promise of the life that now is; of the continuance of it, of length of days, of living long in the earth, and of enjoying all necessary temporal good things...and of that which is to come; even of eternal life..."
