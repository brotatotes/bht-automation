# 1 Timothy 5:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do not rebuke an elder in a harsh manner, but rather, approach them with respect and consideration for their age and wisdom. Instead of using severity, gently persuade them to change their ways. Similarly, when dealing with younger individuals, treat them as equals and address their faults with a brotherly love and authority. Remember, as a young person yourself, the importance of honoring and respecting your elders, while also guiding and admonishing those who are younger.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Contrasted with 'the younger men.' As Timothy was admonished so to conduct himself as to give no man reason to despise his youth (1 Timothy 4:12); so here he is told to bear in mind his youth, and to behave with the modesty which becomes a young man in relation to his elders."
2. "Rebuke not—literally, 'Strike not hard upon'; Rebuke not sharply: a different word from 'rebuke' in 1 Timothy 4:12."
3. "Entreat—exhort. As brethren—and therefore equals; not lording it over them (1 Timothy 4:12)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "By the direction not to rebuke, it is not to be supposed that the minister of the gospel is not to admonish the aged, or that he is not to show them their sins when they go astray, but that he is to do this as he would to a father."
2. "One of the things for which the ancients were remarkable above most of the moderns, and for which the Orientals are still distinguished, was respect for age."
3. "Do not consider them as aliens, strangers, or enemies, but entertain toward them, even when they go astray, the kindly feelings of a brother."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Modern critical opinion has largely abandoned the view that the original Christian polity was an imitation of that of the Synagogue."
2. "The testimony of Clement of Rome (Ep. ad Corinth.) goes to show that the Bishops [ηγουμενοι ορ προηγουμενοι] are distinguished from the Presbyters, and that if the Bishops are apparently designated as Presbyters, it is, because they have been chosen from the body of Presbyters, and have retained the name even when they have ceased to hold office."
3. "Presbyters as such are not invested with office. There is no formal act constituting a Presbyter. The Bishops are reckoned among the Elders, but the elders as such are not officers. Thus are to be explained the allusions to appointed Elders, Titus 1:5; Acts 14:23."

### John Calvin:
1. "Correction is a medicine, which has always some bitterness, and consequently is disagreeable."
2. "It is impossible not to be moved with reverence, when we place before our eyes our father or our mother; in consequence of which, instead of harsher vehemence, we are immediately influenced by modesty."
3. "Hence pastors are taught, that they must not only take into account their office, but must also see particularly what is due to the age of individuals; for the same things are not applicable to all."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The question naturally rises whether the word ‘elder’ is to be taken in its official sense or as referring to age only." 
2. "The Greek word implies, more than the English, a certain vehemence and acrimony."
3. "Better perhaps ‘ brothers’ as giving the natural rather than the conventional sense of the word."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Rebuke not an elder (πρεσβυτερω μη επιπληξηις). Respect for age is what is here commanded, an item appropriate to the present time."
2. "The younger men as brethren (νεωτερους ως αδελφους). Wise words for the young minister to know how to conduct himself with old men (reverence) and young men (fellowship, but not stooping to folly with them)."

### John Gill:
1. "Now an ancient man, a member of a church, is not to be rebuked in a sharp and severe way [...] reproof is a smiting, and there is a gentle and a sharp one."
2. "[...] entreat him as a father; as a child should entreat a father, when he is going out of the way; give him honour and respect, fear and reverence, and persuade him to desist."
3. "Timothy was a young man himself; and as he was to consider an elderly man as his father, and use him accordingly; so he was to consider young men as equal with him, at least in age, and take the more freedom with them, in reproving them for their faults, and use somewhat more authority with them; and yet consider them as brethren in Christ, and reprove them in a brotherly way, and with brotherly love."

### John Wesley:
1. Rebuke not — Considering your own youth, with such a severity as would otherwise be proper.
