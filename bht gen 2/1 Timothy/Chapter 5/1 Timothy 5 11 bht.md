# 1 Timothy 5:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Younger widows should be declined in being included on the list of widows, as their desire to marry again can lead them astray from their devotion to Christ. This desire is not merely a mere wish, but a strong and often unruly impulse. The apostle Paul did not intend to prevent widows from remarrying, as there is no mention of any vows or celibacy. Rather, the passage speaks against the luxurious and indulgent lifestyles that some widows may adopt if they marry again, causing them to divert from their commitment to Christ and the church.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "  the younger women decline as widows ,’ refuse to put on the list of widows, for when they shall wax wanton against Christ, they desire to marry, having judgment, because they set at nought their first faith."
2. "Their proper bridegroom: Jerome’s expression, in fact gives the sense well, 'quæ fornicatæ sunt (-cantur?) in injuriam viri sui Christi.'"
3. "Of the later vows of celibacy, and ascetic views with regard to second marriages, there is no trace."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Younger than sixty years old" (1 Timothy 5:9). 
2. "Wax wanton" (1 Timothy 5:9) - literally, "over-strong". 
3. "They will" (1 Timothy 5:9) - their desire is to marry again.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'wanton' then meant 'wandering' or 'roving in gaiety or sport; moving or flying loosely; playing in the wind; then, wandering from moral rectitude, licentious, dissolute, libidinous'." 
2. "The sense here is, that they would not be subordinate to the restraints implied in that situation, they would become impatient, and would marry again."
3. "It is clear, from this, that the apostle did not contemplate any vows which would prevent their marrying again; nor does he say that it would be absolutely wrong for them to marry... This passage, therefore, can never be adduced in favor of that practice of taking the veil in nunneries."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Their unruly desire withdraws them from serving Christ in his church, and is, therefore, against him."
2. "The strong expression wax wanton makes it probable that qelein expresses more than a desire."
3. "Gamein to marry, in the active voice, of the wife, as everywhere in N. T. except 1 Corinthians 7:39."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul, I say, does not allow of abstaining from marriage till they are in extreme old age, and altogether beyond the danger of incontinence."
2. "But they will never succeed in proving, that there is no reason to dread that danger against which Paul guards and commands others to guard."
3. "Accordingly, a more luxurious and abandoned course of life is a sort of wantonness against Christ, to whom they had pledged their fidelity."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Refuse, i.e. decline to place them on the register of those entitled to special privileges."
2. "Wax wanton. Another of the vigorous colloquial phrases of the Epistle, implying partly wilful resistance, partly lascivious desire."
3. "They will marry. The Greek is more emphatic: ‘They will or desire to marry.’"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "But younger widows refuse ... 'Beg off from.' They lack experience as above and they have other ambitions." 
2. "When they have waxed wanton ... to feel the impulse of sexual desire." 
3. "Souter renders it here 'exercise youthful vigour against Christ'."

### John Gill:
1. "partly because they are fit for labour, and so can take care of themselves"
2. "being at ease, and without labour, live a wanton, loose, and licentious life, and in carnal lusts and pleasures, contrary to the commands of Christ"
3. "marriage being the effect of wantonness, would not be so honourable in them, and especially after they had made application to the church for relief, and had declared themselves widows indeed, and desolate, and such as trusted in God, and gave themselves up to supplication and prayer"

### John Wesley:
1. "Refuse — Do not choose."
2. "For when they are waxed wanton against Christ — To whose more immediate service they had addicted themselves."
