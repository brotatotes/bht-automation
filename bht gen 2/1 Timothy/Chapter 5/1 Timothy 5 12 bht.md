# 1 Timothy 5:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Having rejected their first faith, they have turned away from God and acted against their initial conviction that dedicating themselves wholly to His service was the most excellent way. When the Spirit of God first enables us to believe, He often reveals to us the most excellent things and inspires us to live in the highest degree of Christian devotion. How foolish it would be for us to settle for anything less than this!

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Themselves, and so having to bear as a burden (judgment from God)..."
2. "They had pledged 'their first faith' to Christ as presbyteress widows; they now wish to transfer their faith to a husband..."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Having 'condemnation;'" or incurring guilt."
2. "This does not mean of necessity that they would lose their souls;"
3. "The meaning is, that they would contract guilt, if they had been admitted among this class of persons, and then married again."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Damnation is an unfortunate rendering in the light of the present common understanding of the word, as it is also in 1 Corinthians 11:29. Better, judgment or condemnation..."
2. "The meaning is that they carry about with them in their new, married life a condemnation, a continuous reproach."
3. "The whole matter is obscure."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul terrifies them by the damnation of eternal death; as if he reproved them by saying that that excellent order, which ought rather to have united them to Christ, was the very ground of their condemnation."
2. "They entirely 'revolt from the faith' of baptism and from Christianity."
3. "That amplification is exceedingly appropriate; for is there anything more absurd than that they should, through a wish to promote the advantage of persons, open the door to the denial of Christ?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Having damnation." As in 1 Corinthians 11:29, in the general sense of the word, 'coming under condemnation.'
2. "Their first faith." We best understand these words by bearing in mind the teaching of 1 Corinthians 7:34. Marriage was in itself honorable, but it was not compatible with self-consecration to a life of special labor, such as that of the 'registered' widows.
3. "If she again fell back on merely human affections, she was abandoning her 'first faith,' the love of her espousals." The words suggest the thought that the word 'widow' might possibly be conventionally extended to include all women who undertook the duties of the order, whether actually such in the common sense of the word or not.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Condemnation (κριμα). See 1 Timothy 3:6."
2. "They have rejected (ηθετησαν). First aorist passive of αθετεω, late verb (first in LXX and Polybius), to reject, set aside (from αθετος). See 1 Thessalonians 4:8; Galatians 2:21."
3. "Their first faith (την πρωτην πιστιν). 'Their first pledge' (promise, contract) to Christ. It is like breaking the marriage contract."

### John Gill:
1. "Having damnation, [...] this is to be understood not of eternal damnation, which cannot, with propriety, be said to be had now but either of the reproach and scandal cast upon them, and religion, for their wantonness." 
2. "Having sin, and the guilt of sin upon them, in which sense the word is used, Romans 5:16."
3. "Because they have cast off their first faith; or that faith which they first professed, even the doctrine of faith; which they may be said to cast off, because they walked not according to it, their conversation was not becoming their profession of it."

### John Wesley:
1. "They have rejected their first faith - Have deserted their trust in God, and have acted contrary to the first conviction, namely, that wholly to devote themselves to his service was the most excellent way."
2. "When we first receive power to believe, does not the Spirit of God generally point out what are the most excellent things; and at the same time, give us a holy resolution to walk in the highest degree of Christian severity?"
3. "And how unwise are we ever to sink into anything below it!"
