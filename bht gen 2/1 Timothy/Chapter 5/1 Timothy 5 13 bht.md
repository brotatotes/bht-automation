# 1 Timothy 5:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Such young widows, enrolled in the church, often become idle and wander from house to house, engaging in gossip and spreading rumors. This behavior not only corrupts the world, but also goes against the values of modesty and diligence that are expected of women. These women have a tendency to be talkative and inquisitive, often speaking about things they shouldn't, whether true or not. Their idleness and gossip not only harm themselves, but also bring reproach upon the church.
