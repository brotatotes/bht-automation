# 1 Timothy 5:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is better for young widows to marry and focus on family responsibilities rather than succumb to the temptations of an idle life. Marriage is honorable and provides a sense of purpose and stability. By being occupied with the duties and cares of a family, they not only fulfill their own needs but also avoid giving any reason for the enemy of Christianity to criticize or discredit the institution of marriage.
