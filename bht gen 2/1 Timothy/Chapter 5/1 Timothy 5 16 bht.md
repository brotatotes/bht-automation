# 1 Timothy 5:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If any member of a church, whether a man or woman, has widows among their relatives, it is their duty to provide for them and not burden the church with their support. The church should only be responsible for helping those who are truly widows and in need of assistance.
