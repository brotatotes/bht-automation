# 1 Timothy 5:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The elders, those chosen for their wisdom and seniority, are responsible for leading and governing the church. They should be esteemed highly, particularly those who demonstrate faithful stewardship and diligently teach the word of God. It is important to give them the honor and support they deserve for the important work they do in guiding the congregation and ensuring the smooth running of the church.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Preside, viz. over their portion of the Church's work. Chrys. has well expressed the meaning, but not all the meaning; for wisdom and ability must be taken also into account."
2. "Be held worthy of double (not, as compared with the widows..., but as compared with those who have not distinguished themselves by καλῶς προεστάναι; and evidently, as Chrys. 3, it is not to be taken in the mere literal sense of double, but implies increase generally... honor, and honor's fruit, may be both included in it."
3. "Especially those that labor in (the) word and teaching (therefore the preaching of the word, and teaching, was not the office of all the πρεσβύτεροι)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "rule well—literally, 'preside well,' with wisdom, ability, and loving faithfulness, over the flock assigned to them."
2. "be counted worthy of double honour—that is, the honor which is expressed by gifts and otherwise."
3. "specially they who labour in the word and doctrine—Greek, 'teaching'; preaching of the word, and instruction, catechetical or otherwise."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word used - 'elder' or 'presbyter' - properly refers to age, and is then used to denote the officers of the church, probably because the aged were at first entrusted with the administration of the affairs of the church."
2. "The word rendered 'rule' - προεστῶτες proestōtes - is from a verb meaning to be over; to preside over; to have the care of... and is such a word as would apply to any officers to whom the management and government of the church was entrusted."
3. "Those among them who 'labored in the word and doctrine,' and who gave up all their time to the business of their office, would be worthy of special respect, and of a higher compensation."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The phrase is peculiar to the Pastorals."
2. "Double honor, not in a strictly literal sense, but as pleiona timhn more honor."
3. "The meaning is, those who faithfully discharge the arduous duty of teaching."

### John Calvin:
1. "For preserving the good order of the Church, it is likewise highly necessary that elders should not be neglected, but that due regard should be paid to them; for what could be more unfeeling than to have no care about those who have the care of the whole Church?"
2. "Paul had formerly enjoined that honor should be paid to widows; but elders are more worthy of being honored than widows, and, with respect to them, ought therefore to receive double honor."
3. "Yet he prefers those who labor in word and doctrine, that is, those who are diligent in teaching the word; for those two terms, word and doctrine, signify the same thing, namely, the preaching of the word."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The apostle is practical enough to recognise even the value of money - payment as a recognition of higher gifts well used."
2. "The rule implies that the ‘elders’ of the Church were not all equally gifted... and for this there was to be a provision, such as that which we often find made for the dean of a cathedral or the head of a college, to twice the amount of that given to the other elders."
3. "Measured by modern standards, even the ‘double’ stipend was probably such as would only attract one of the artisan class, and for him came as a compensation for the loss of profit involved in his calling."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The elders that rule well...of position in same sense as επισκοπος." 
2. "Let be counted worthy...Of double honour...Liddon proposes 'honorarium' (both honour and pay and so 'double')." 
3. "Especially those who labour in word and teaching...those who work hard or toil in preaching and teaching."

### John Gill:
1. "These are called 'elders', because they are commonly chosen out of the senior members of the churches, though not always, Timothy is an exception to this; and because of their senile gravity and prudence, which were necessary in them."
2. "They may be said to 'rule', because they are set in the highest place in the church, and over others in the Lord, who are to submit themselves to them, and obey them."
3. "Especially they who labour in the word and doctrine; which lies in a constant reading of the Scriptures, the word of God, and diligently searching into them, and comparing them together, in order to find out the mind and will of God in them."

### John Wesley:
1. "Let the elders that rule well - Who approve themselves faithful stewards of all that is committed to their charge - be counted worthy of double honour." 
2. "As it was the most laborious and disinterested men who were put into these offices, so whatever any one had to bestow, in his life or death, was generally lodged in their hands for the poor." 
3. "Especially those - Of them - who labour diligently and painfully - In the word and teaching - In teaching the word."
