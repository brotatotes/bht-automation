# 1 Timothy 5:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Scripture teaches us to treat those who labor for the welfare of the church with due attention and reward, just as God provided for the laboring ox. The laborers are worthy of their hire, as Jesus ordained, and this principle applies not only to ministers but to all who work diligently and faithfully. We must not make a wrong use of others' labor and should recognize the justness of providing fair compensation for the work that is done.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Ground for the above injunction."
2. "It is doubted whether the words ἄξιος ὁ ἐργάτ . κ . τ . λ . are a citation at all."
3. "This verse it is which makes it extremely probable, that τιμή above refers to the honorarium of pecuniary recompense."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The labourer is worthy of his reward—or 'hire'; quoted from 1 Corinthians 9:9- :... If Paul extends the phrase, 'Scripture saith,' to this second clause, as well as to the first, he will be hereby recognizing the Gospel of Luke, his own helper (whence appears the undesigned appositeness of the quotation), as inspired Scripture."
2. "The Gospel according to Luke was probably in circulation then about eight or nine years."
3. "However, it is possible 'Scripture saith' applies only to the passage quoted from Matthew 10:10- :; and then his quotation will be that of a common proverb, quoted also by the Lord, which commends itself to the approval of all, and is approved by the Lord and His apostle."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "As God took care to make provision for the laboring ox, much more should due attention be paid to those who labor for the welfare of the church."
2. "The laborer is worthy of his reward."


### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Scripture [η γραφη] . Comp. 2 Timothy 3:16. To the Jews hJ grafh signified the O. T. canon of Scripture; but in most cases hJ grafh is used of a particular passage of Scripture which is indicated in the context."
2. "Thou shalt not muzzle [ου φιμωσεις] . In N. T. mostly in the metaphorical sense of putting to silence."
3. "The laborer is worthy, etc. A second scriptural quotation would seem to be indicated, but there is no corresponding passage in the O. T. The words are found Luke 10:7, and, with a slight variation, Matthew 10:10."

### John Calvin:
1. "This is a political precept which recommends to us equity and humanity (101) in general; as we have said in expounding the First Epistle to the Corinthians."
2. "The meaning of this statement, therefore, is the same as if it had been said in general terms, that they must not make a wrong use of the labor of others."
3. "He does not quote this as a passage of Scripture, as a proverbial saying, which common sense teaches to all."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "St. Paul had already quoted (in 1 Corinthians 9:9) and reasoned on the verse from Deuteronomy 25:4, going below the letter to the principle on which it rested, and applying that principle as a law of action for men in their dealings with each other."
2. "There seems a strong preponderance of evidence for thinking that the words ['The labourer is worthy of his hire'] are taken from some written account of our Lord’s work and teaching, and that that record was probably at least the groundwork of the Gospel according to St. Luke."
3. "St. Paul quotes an account of the Last Supper which we find in St. Luke (1 Corinthians 11:23; Luke 22:19)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Thou shalt not muzzle" - to show the preacher's right to pay for his work.
2. "The labourer is worthy of his hire" - Jesus ordained this, meaning that Jesus had said it.
3. It is not clear whether Scripture is meant to apply to this quotation from the Lord Jesus.

### John Gill:
1. "The ox, for its strength and labour, is a fit emblem of a Gospel minister; and its treading the corn out of the husk and ear aptly represents the beating out, as it were, of Gospel truths, by the ministers of it, their making the doctrines of the Gospel clear, plain, and evident to the understandings of men."

### John Wesley:
1.  Deuteronomy 25:4
