# 1 Timothy 5:2 Commentary Help Text

The exhortation is to treat the elder women as mothers, showing them great tenderness and respect as they are considered mothers in Israel. Likewise, the younger women should be treated as sisters in Christ, with the same affectionate regard and in a manner that befits such a relationship. When dealing with faults or reproving them, it should be done with all purity, preserving chastity in looks, words, and actions, ensuring a respectful and blameless conduct.
