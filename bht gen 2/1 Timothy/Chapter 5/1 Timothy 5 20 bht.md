# 1 Timothy 5:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who, whether they be elders or not, are living in sin are to receive a public rebuke before the entire church. The purpose of this rebuke is to make clear the nature of the offense and to demonstrate that it is not to be taken lightly. By publicly addressing and censuring the wrongdoing, it serves as a warning to others in the congregation, encouraging them to fear committing the same sins and to uphold the standards of righteousness.
