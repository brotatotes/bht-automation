# 1 Timothy 5:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do not quickly ordain anyone into the ministry without first carefully examining their faith and conduct. Avoid becoming involved in the sins of others by not partaking in or approving of their wrongdoing. Instead, maintain your own purity by exercising caution in admitting individuals into church offices and by ensuring that you do not bear the guilt of others. Keep yourself untainted from the sins of those around you, guarding your own righteousness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Lay hands hastily on no one, nor be partaker in other men’s sins" - being properly held responsible for the consequence of those bad habits of theirs which more care might have ascertained.
2. "Keep THYSELF pure" - whatever thou doest therefore, be sure to maintain, by watchful care and caution, thyself above all stain of blame.
3. "No longer drink water, but use a little wine, on account of thy stomach, and thy frequent illnesses" - If this was so, then it is quite natural that in advising him on this point, St. Paul should throw in a hint, in fatherly kindness, that he must not allow these maladies to interfere with the efficient discharge of his high office.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The way to guard against scandals occurring in the case of presbyters is, be cautious as to the character of the candidate before ordaining him."
2. "The laying on of hands is used of ordination."
3. "Keep THYSELF clear of participation in OTHER men's sin by not failing to rebuke them that sin."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He should take time to give them a fair trial of their piety; he should have satisfactory evidence of their qualifications."
2. "If we ordain a man to the office of the ministry who is known to be living in sin, or to cherish dangerous error, we become the patrons of the sin and of the heresy."
3. "In no way are we to participate in the sins of other people. We are not to be engaged with them in doing wrong; we are not to patronize them in a wicked business; we are not to be known as their companions or friends; and we are not to partake of their unlawful gains."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Lay hands on. Probably with reference to that rite in the formal restoration of those who had been expelled from the church for gross sins."
2. "By a too hasty and inconsiderate restoration, he would condone the sins of the offenders, and would thus make common cause with them."
3. "Keep thyself pure. Enjoining positively what was enjoined negatively in the preceding clause."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul therefore exhorts Timothy not to lay aside judicious caution, and not to suffer himself to be overpowered by improper feelings... for he forbids him to receive too easily any one that has not been fully tried."
2. "He means that he who consents to an unlawful act of ordination is involved in the same guilt as the chief actors in it."
3. "If others do anything that is wrong, beware lest any contagion reach you, either by consent or by approbation. If you cannot hinder them from polluting themselves, it is at least your duty to have your counsels at all times separated from theirs, so that you may keep yourself pure."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The best way to avoid the scandal of a trial was to be cautious at the outset, and to decline the complicity in the guilt of others which might follow on a hasty ordination."
2. "Keep thyself pure. The primary and usual meaning of the word is that of chastity. Here it refers probably to the risk of mental contamination incident to the trial of offenders against purity."
3. "It is probable that then, as in later ages, most of the cases that called for the exercise of discipline were of this nature, and it was hardly possible to hear evidence of the details of such sins without the danger to which St. Paul thus briefly alludes."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The prohibition suits either situation, or both." 
2. "Present active imperative of κοινωνεω (from κοινωνος, partner) with μη in prohibition with associative instrumental case." 
3. ""Keep on keeping thyself pure." Present active imperative of τηρεω."

### John Gill:
1. "Do not hastily and at once admit any person into the sacred work of the ministry... but let him be first proved...sound in faith and of a good life and conversation."
2. "Neither be partaker of other men's sins;... join with them therein... take pleasure in them, as done by others... conniving at them, and not restraining them, nor reproving for them."
3. "Keep thyself pure;... not from his own sins... no man is, or can be pure, from either of these;... keep himself pure from the sins of others, by not rashly and suddenly admitting any into the ministry."

### John Wesley:
1. "Appoint no man to church offices without full trial and examination."
2. "Keep thy self pure - From the blood of all men."
