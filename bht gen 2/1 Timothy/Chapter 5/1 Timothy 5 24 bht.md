# 1 Timothy 5:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When it comes to certain individuals, their sins are evident and require no further investigation. These sins are blatantly apparent, acting as a prelude to any judgment that may follow. On the other hand, there are those whose sins may not be quickly revealed but instead gradually emerge over time. Regardless of the timing, the truth of their transgressions will eventually come into the open and they will be judged accordingly. It is crucial for us to recognize and discern the nature of sin, whether it be openly displayed or concealed, as we navigate our own paths of righteousness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The conservation of himself in health and vigour would ensure his being able to deal ably and firmly with the cases which should come before him for decision."
2. "Of some men the sins are evident, going before them to judgment."
3. "But some men again, their sins follow, after-proof brings out the correctness or otherwise of the judgment."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Two kinds of sins are specified: those palpably manifest (so the Greek for 'open beforehand' ought to be translated; so in :-, it is translated 'evident'; literally, 'before' the eyes, that is, notorious), further explained as 'going before to judgment'; and those which follow after the men ('some men they, that is, their sins, follow after'), namely, not going beforehand, loudly accusing, but hidden till they come to the judgment."
2. "Thus he implies that Timothy can only be responsible if he connive at manifest, or evident sins; not that those that are otherwise shall escape judgment at last."
3. "Both alike 'cannot be hid'; the former class in the case of bad and good are manifest already; the latter class in the case of both are not manifest now, but shall be so at the final judgment."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There was no disguise. It was evident to all what it was, and there could be no danger of mistake respecting it."
2. "Their character is well understood. There is no need of waiting for the day of judgment to know what they are."
3. "They practice deception. They appear different from what they really are. But the character of such people will be developed, and they will be judged according to their works."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The meaning is openly manifested to all eyes."
2. "The meaning here is that these open sins go before their perpetrator to the judgment-seat like heralds, proclaiming their sentence in advance."
3. "The sins follow up the offender to the bar of judgment, and are first made openly manifest there."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul supports Timothy by this consolation, that, when it shall please God, they, will one day be brought to public view."
2. "There is another kind of base conduct that sorely distresses good and holy pastors. When they have most conscientiously discharged their duty, they are provoked by many unfair statements, are loaded with much ill-will, and perceive that those actions which deserved praise are turned into blame."
3. "The meaning may be thus summed up. 'We must bear what cannot be immediately corrected; we must sigh and groan, while the time for the remedy is not fully come; and we must not apply force to diseases, till they are either ripened or laid open."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The ‘other men’s sins’ in which Timothy is not to be a partaker, are of two classes (1) flagrant, notorious, so conspicuous even before the trial, that they scarcely need witnesses, are, indeed, as the accusers who bring the criminal before the judge; (2) those which do not come out at first, but, as it were, creep on, and dog the man’s steps, and at last overtake him."
2. "Receiving the words as applicable chiefly to the precept against hasty laying on of hands, they contain a warning against assuming fitness from the absence of open scandal."
3. "Even in such cases a careful inquiry was not to be neglected. It is obvious that the judgment spoken of is man’s and not God’s, temporal and not eternal in its results."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Evident (προδηλο). 'Openly plain,' 'plain before all.'"
2. "The sins are so plain that they receive instant condemnation."
3. "Not clearly manifest at first, but come out plainly at last. How true that is of secret sins."

### John Gill:
1. "Some men's sins are open beforehand... they even prevent and supersede any formal process about them."
2. "There would be no danger of his laying hands suddenly on such; for the following phrase, going before to judgment, is not to be understood of God's judgment, or of the last and future judgment of the great day, but of human judgment."
3. "The sense of the whole is this, that the characters of some men are so well known, and it is so plain a case, that they are destitute of the grace of God; have not ministerial gifts; or are unsound in the faith; or are men of immoral lives and conversations; so that there can be no dispute about them, whether they are to be admitted into the ministry of the word or rejected."

### John Wesley:
1. "Some men's sins are manifest beforehand — Before any strict inquiry be made."
2. "Going before to judgment — So that you may immediately judge them unworthy of any spiritual office."
3. "And some they — Their sins. Follow after — More covertly."
