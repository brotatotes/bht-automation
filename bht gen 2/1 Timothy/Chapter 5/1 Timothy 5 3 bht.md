# 1 Timothy 5:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For maintaining out of the public stock, it is an honorable duty to provide for widows, showing them external respect and support in action and words. This provision ensures that those who are truly widowed and in need are cared for and honored within the Christian community.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We may fairly interpret it of this particular kind of honour, viz. being inscribed on the Church’s κατάλογος ( 1Ti 5:9 ) as a fit object of charitable sustenance."
2. "Thus without the two qualifications being actually united, the former is insisted on as ordinarily ensuring the latter."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Honour—by setting on the church roll, as fit objects of charitable sustenance"
2. "widows indeed—those really desolate; not like those having children or relations answerable for their support, nor like those 'who live in pleasure'; but such as, from their earthly desolation as to friends, are most likely to trust wholly in God, persevere in continual prayers, and carry out the religious duties"
3. "Care for widows was transferred from the Jewish economy to the Christian"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The particular attention and respect which are enjoined here, seem to refer to the class of widows who were supported by the church, and who were entrusted with the performance of certain duties toward the other female members."
2. "It would seem, therefore, that there was a class of this description, who were entrusted with these duties, and in regard to whose qualifications it was proper that Timothy should be instructed."
3. "What Paul regarded as constituting true widowhood, he specifies in 1 Timothy 5:4-5, 1 Timothy 5:9-10. He connects with it the idea that she had no persons dependent on her; that she was desolate, and evinced true trust in God; that she was so aged that she would not marry again; and that by her life she had given evidence of possessing a heart of true benevolence."
