# 1 Timothy 5:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let these individuals understand the importance of reciprocating the care and support shown to them by their parents. It is their responsibility to provide for their own families, rather than relying on the church for assistance. Neglecting their parents in old age would be an act of ingratitude, while caring for them is a way of showing appreciation for the love and sacrifices bestowed upon them. This act of filial piety is not only commendable but also pleasing and acceptable in the sight of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "What is the subject? (1) The ancient Commentators mostly understand αἱ χῆραι, implied in τίς χήρα..."
2. "Either, ‘first of all duties,’ which seems supported by 1Ti 5:8 below; or first, before applying to the church for sustenance."
3. "Let them, the children or grandchildren, learn first to be piously grateful to (these members of) their own families, and to give back returns (a return in each case) to their progenitors."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "A widow indeed," as having children who ought to support her.
2. "Nephews" in old English meant "grandchildren."
3. "Let them learn," implies that abuses of this kind had crept into the Church, widows claiming Church support though they had children or grandchildren able to support them.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Let them learn first to show piety at home - Margin, 'or kindness.' That is, let the children and grandchildren learn to do this. Let them have an opportunity of performing their duty toward their aged parent or grandparent. Do not receive such a widow among the poor and dependent females of the church, to be maintained at public expense, but let her children support her. Thus they will have an opportunity of evincing Christian kindness, and of requiting her for her care."
2. "And to requite their parents - To repay them, as far as possible, for all their kindness. This debt can never be wholly repaid, but still a child should feel it a matter of sacred obligation to do as much toward it as possible."
3. "For that is good and acceptable before God - It is a duty everywhere enjoined; compare Matthew 15:5-7 notes; Ephesians 6:1-2 notes."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Nephews [εκγονα] . N.T. o. Often in LXX Nephews, in the now obsolete sense of grandsons or other lineal deseendants."
2. "To show piety at home [τον ιδιον οικον ευσεβειν] . More correctly, to show piety toward their own family."
3. "Before [ενωπιον] . Frequent in N. T., especially Luke and Revelation. It occurs 31 times in the phrases ejnwpion tou Qeou in the sight of God, and ejnwpion kuriou in the sight of the Lord."

### John Calvin:
1. "Let them learn, by the pious government of their family, to repay to their successors the education that they received from their ancestors."
2. "For nothing is more natural than the return of filial for parental affection; and it is very unreasonable that it should be excluded from the Church."
3. "To shew piety towards their own house... lest a foolish and silly devotion should divest them of human feelings."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The first group thus excluded from those that answer to the name of 'widow,' are such as have 'children or nephews' (i.e. grandchildren) who are able to support them."
2. "'Let them show their piety' not 'at home,' but 'to their own house or family.' As with the Romans and the Jews, so in some measure even with the Greeks, duty to parents came under the head of piety rather than of legal obligation."
3. "Strictly speaking, 'progenitors' or 'ancestors,' the word being chosen in order to include the grandchildren."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "No 'corban' business here. No acts of 'piety' toward God will make up for impiety towards parents."
2. "Filial piety is primary unless parents interfere with duty to Christ."
3. "Dative case of old and common word προγονος (from προγινομα, to come before), 'ancestor.'"

### John Gill:
1. "Such are not widows indeed; they are not desolate, or alone, or without persons to take care of them" 
2. "They should not suffer them to come to a church for relief, but first take care of them themselves"
3. "To neglect them in old age, when incapable of providing for themselves, would be base ingratitude; whereas to take care of them is but a requital of them, or a repaying them for former benefits had of them"

### John Wesley:
1. Let these learn to requite their parents — For all their former care, trouble, and expense.
