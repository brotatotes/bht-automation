# 1 Timothy 5:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A widow indeed is one who is left alone without a spouse or family to support her. Such widows place their hope and trust in God alone, relying on Him as their source of provision and comfort. They continue in fervent prayers and supplications day and night, demonstrating their unwavering faith and commitment to God. These widows, despite their circumstances, are not only valuable members of the church but also powerful intercessors who pray not only for themselves but for the needs of others within the community of believers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Thus what follows is said more for moral eulogy of such a widow, than as commending her to the charity of the church..."
2. "ἤλπικεν, has set and continues to set her hope on God as its portion and ultimate aim..."
3. "ταῖς δεής κ . ταῖς προσευχ..., the two great divisions of prayer."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "widow indeed, and desolate—contrasted with her who has children or grandchildren to support her"
2. "She must be not one 'that liveth in pleasure,' but one making God her main hope"
3. "Ardor in prayers flows from hoping confidence in God"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A widow indeed, and desolate - The word rendered “desolate” means 'solitary, alone.' It does not necessarily imply the idea of discomfort which we attach to the word desolate. The sense is, that she had no children or other descendants; none on whom she could depend for support."
2. "Trusteth in God - She has no one else to look to but God. She has no earthly reliance, and, destitute of husband, children, and property, she feels her dependence, and steadily looks to God for consolation and support."
3. "And continueth in supplications and prayers night and day - Continually... The apostle regards this as one of the characteristics of those who were “widows indeed,” whom he would have received into the class to be maintained by the church, and to whom the charge of younger members of the church might be entrusted."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Desolate [και μεμονωμενη] . N. T. o. From monov alone. Explanatory of a widow indeed. One entirely bereaved."
2. "Trusteth in God [ηλπικεν επι τον θεον] . Strictly hath directed her hope at God."
3. "Rev. hath her hope set on God implies ejpi with the dative, as 1 John 3:3."

### John Calvin:
1. "He shews that they are really widows who are solitary and have no children. He says that such persons hope in God." 
2. "By this argument he commends them; for, when human aid and every refuge fails them, it is the duty of the Church to stretch forth her hand to render assistance."
3. "At the same time, by these two marks he distinguishes between the worthy and the unworthy; for these words are of the same import as if he enjoined that they only shall be received who look for no aid from men, but rely on God alone, and, laying aside other cares and employments, are earnestly devoted to prayer."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Desolate, i.e. left alone, in contrast with the widow who has children or grandchildren."
2. "Trusteth. Better, 'has set her hope on God.'"
3. "In supplications and prayers night and day. The parallelism with Luke 2:37 suggests the idea that St. Paul may have heard from his companion of the perfect picture of true widowhood presented by Anna the prophetess. The words may point either to personal devotions or to attendance at all meetings of the Church for that purpose."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Desolate (μεμονωμενη). Perfect passive participle of μονοω (from μονος), 'left alone,' old verb, here alone in N.T. Without husband, children, or other close kin." 
2. "Hath her hope set on God (ηλπικεν επ θεον). Perfect active indicative of ελπιζω, 'hath placed her hope (and keeps it) on God.' Text doubtful whether God (θεον) or Lord (Κυριον)."
3. "Continues (προσμενε). See on 1 Timothy 1:3. With dative case here. Night and day (νυκτος κα ημερας). 'By night and by day' (genitive, not accusative). Paul does not say that she should pray 'all night and day.'"

### John Gill:
1. "Such an one as the apostle means, is one that is desolate, or 'alone', who has neither husband to take care of her, nor children or nephews to show kindness to her, nor any worldly substance to subsist upon." 
2. "A widow indeed is one that has no outward dependence, betakes herself to the Lord, puts her confidence in him, and cries to him continually for a daily supply."
3. "Amidst all her poverty and meanness, [a widow indeed] is a living believer, one that lives by faith on the Lord; and is profitable and useful to the church by her prayers and supplications made for them, as well as for herself."

### John Wesley:
1. Widows indeed — Who have no near relations to provide for them; and who are wholly devoted to God.Desolate — Having neither children, nor grandchildren to relieve her.
