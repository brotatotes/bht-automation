# 1 Timothy 5:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
She that liveth in pleasure is one who indulges in luxurious, lavish living, giving herself to pleasure and worldly desires. This kind of widow is not deserving of the charity of the Church and is seen as dead while she physically lives. Such a widow is spiritually dead, alienated from the life of God, and her actions do not contribute any spiritual benefit. It is important to avoid the excesses of worldly pleasures and instead seek fulfillment in a life dedicated to God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This kind of widow is no object for the charity of the Church, as not being at all a partaker of the life unto God."
2. "While alive in the flesh, has no real life in the Spirit."
3. "I cannot help regarding the idea as in the background, 'and, if devoid of spiritual life, then not to be taken into account by the Church.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "She that liveth in pleasure—the opposite of such a widow as is described in [previous verse], and therefore one utterly undeserving of Church charity. The Greek expresses wanton prodigality and excess."
2. "The root expresses weaving at a fast rate, and so lavish excess."
3. "Dead while she liveth—dead in the Spirit while alive in the flesh."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It properly means to live in luxury, voluptuously; to indulge freely in eating and drinking; to yield to the indulgence of the appetites."
2. "It does not indicate grossly criminal pleasures; but the kind of pleasure connected with luxurious living, and with pampering the appetites."
3. "There is great emphasis in this expression, and nothing could convey more forcibly the idea that true happiness is not to be found in the pleasure of sense."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Liveth in pleasure... Is dead while she liveth."
2. "Life in worldly pleasure is only life in appearance."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul (in my opinion) censures those who abuse their widowhood for this purpose, that, being loosed from the marriage yoke, and freed from every annoyance, they may lead a life of pleasant idleness."
2. "I think it more natural to say that a woman 'is dead,' when she is useless, and does no good; for to what purpose do we live, if it be not that our actions may yield some advantage?"
3. "Paul here condemns indolence, when he calls those women dead who are of no use."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "She that plays the wanton comes somewhat nearer, but implies one form of evil too definitely."
2. "Is dead. Spiritually dead, and therefore to be treated as such for the purpose in band, and her name to be struck off the register of those entitled to support."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "She that giveth herself to pleasure."
2. "Present active participle of σπλαταλαω. late verb from σπαταλη (riotous, luxurious living)."
3. "In N.T. only here and James 5:5."

### John Gill:
1. "There is a likeness between a moral and a corporeal death... souls are separated from God, and are alienated from the life of God..."
2. "Death defaces and deforms the man, and a moral death lies in the defacing of the image of God... and in a loss of original righteousness..."
3. "...they can do nothing of, nor for themselves, in matters of a spiritual nature... they are blind, and cannot see and discern the things of the Spirit of God..."

### John Wesley:
1. She that liveth in pleasure — Delicately, voluptuously, in elegant, regular sensuality, though not in the use of any such pleasures as are unlawful in themselves.
