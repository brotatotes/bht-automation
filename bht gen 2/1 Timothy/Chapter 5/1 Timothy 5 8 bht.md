# 1 Timothy 5:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Failure to provide for one's own family is tantamount to denying the faith and is viewed as an abandonment of basic natural duties. While even unbelievers understand the importance of caring for their loved ones, it is inconceivable for a believer to neglect their own relatives. This rejection of familial responsibility is not only incompatible with true faith but also undermines the very essence of piety towards God. Therefore, it is imperative for Christians to uphold their family obligations, as failing to do so is considered a grave departure from the faith.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Faith, in the sense of the Apostle, cannot exist, without including love: for the subject-matter of faith is not mere opinion, but the grace and truth of God, to which he that believes gives up his spirit, as he that loves gives up his heart: the subject-matter of faith is also the object of love. Where therefore Love is not, nor works, there is not, nor works, Faith either..."
2. "For even among heathens the common duties of family piety are recognized: if therefore a Christian repudiates them, he lowers himself beneath the heathen."
3. "According to hypothesis (1) or (2) above, this general statement applies to the widows or to their children and grandchildren: not, as Matthies, to their mutual relations, about which the context contains no hmt."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Faith without love and its works is dead."
2. "If in any case a duty of love is plain, it is in relation to one's own relatives."
3. "The Christian who does not so, is worse than an infidel."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "God thus provides for our needs; that is, he sees beforehand what we shall need, and makes arrangements for those needs by long preparation."
2. "The words ‘his own,’ refer to those who are naturally dependent on him, whether living in his own immediate family or not."
3. "He who neglected his own immediate family would be more guilty than he who neglected a more remote relative."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Faith demands works and fruits. By refusing the natural duties which Christian faith implies, one practically denies his possession of faith. Faith does not abolish natural duties, but perfects and strengthens them." 
2. "Infidel. Better, unbeliever. One who is not a Christian, as 1 Corinthians 6:6; 1 Corinthians 7:12, 1 Corinthians 7:13, etc. Even an unbeliever will perform these duties from natural promptings."

### John Calvin:
1. "He says that they who do not care about any of their relatives, and especially about their own house, have 'denied the faith.' And justly; for there is no piety towards God, when a person can thus lay aside the feelings of humanity."  
2. "This is true for two reasons. First, the further advanced any one is in the knowledge of God, the less is he excused; and therefore, they who shut their eyes against the clear light of God are worse than infidels. Secondly, this is a kind of duty which nature itself teaches; for they are (στοργαὶ φυσικαί) natural affections."  
3. "If it be objected, that, among unbelievers, there are also many parents that are cruel and savage; the explanation is easy, that Paul is not speaking of any parents but those who, by the guidance and instruction of nature, take care of their own offspring..."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The precept is general, and in its terms includes the duty of parents to provide for their children as well as that of the children to provide for the parents."
2. "Practically... the words point to the duty of the widow to ‘provide’ not in the material sense, but... to ‘exercise forethought’ for those connected with her."
3. "Worse than an infidel... worse, as sinning more against light and knowledge."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Condition of first class with ε and present active (or middle προνοειτα) indicative of προνοεω... to think beforehand." 
2. "His act of impiety belies (Titus 1:16) his claim to the faith (Revelation 2:13)."
3. "Ablative case of απιστου after the comparative χειρων. Who makes no profession of piety."

### John Gill:
1. "Not only for his wife and children, but for his parents, when grown old, and cannot help themselves... the tie of nature obliges him to take care of them, yet that of grace makes the obligation still more strong and binding." 
2. "He hath denied the faith... and is to be considered in the same light, and to be dealt with as an apostate from the Christian religion."
3. "For the very Heathens are taught and directed by the light of nature to take care of their poor and aged parents... such should go to the storks and learn of them, of whom it is reported, that the younger ones will feed the old ones when they cannot feed themselves."

### John Wesley:
1. "If any provide not — Food and raiment."
2. "He hath — Virtually. Denied the faith — Which does not destroy, but perfect, natural duties."
3. "One will go to hell for fear of want; another acts like a heathen, lest he should be worse than an infidel."
