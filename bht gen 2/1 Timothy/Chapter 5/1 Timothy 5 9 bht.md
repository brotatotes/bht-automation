# 1 Timothy 5:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In order to be enrolled as a widow, the woman should meet certain criteria. It was expected that a widow be of at least sixty years old, so that they can be financially supported by the church while also being able to take care of themselves. Furthermore, they were to have been married only once, without having divorced or remarried. This requirement aimed to exclude those who had engaged in scandalous practices such as multiple marriages.

3. "Not that he disapproves of a second marriage, or affixes a mark of ignominy to those who have been twice married; (for, on the contrary, he advises younger widows to marry;) but because he wished carefully to guard against laying any females under a necessity of remaining unmarried, who felt it to be necessary to have husbands."
