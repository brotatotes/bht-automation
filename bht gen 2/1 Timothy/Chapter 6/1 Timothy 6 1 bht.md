# 1 Timothy 6:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Servants who are under the authority of unbelieving masters ought to hold them in high esteem and treat them with all honor and respect. This includes showing obedience and reverence in both words and actions. By doing so, servants ensure that the name of God and his teachings are not spoken evil of or blasphemed. It is crucial for believers to live in a way that honors God even in challenging circumstances, such as serving under unbelieving masters.
