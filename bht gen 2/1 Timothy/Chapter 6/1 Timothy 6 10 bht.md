# 1 Timothy 6:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The love of money is the root of all evil, from which various forms of wickedness arise. It is not money itself, but the desire for wealth, that leads people astray. Coveting riches can cause individuals to deviate from the path of faith and inflict upon themselves numerous sorrows and pains. This pursuit of material gain can be seen as a form of idolatry, as individuals prioritize money over God, placing their trust in it rather than in divine providence. Such worldly pursuits ultimately lead to destruction and disillusionment, as individuals sacrifice their spiritual well-being for temporary riches.
