# 1 Timothy 6:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
But thou, O man of God, flee these things—the allurements of wealth and the negative consequences it produces. Instead, pursue righteousness, piety, faith, love, and patience. Make these virtues the grand object of your pursuit, and let meekness be your disposition. Seek to embody these qualities, following the example of Christ, who is the living representative of the man of God. Put your trust in God, and let righteousness guide your actions towards others. By doing so, you will naturally reject the love of wealth and its destructive consequences. Look to Galatians 5:22-23 for a further understanding of these virtues.
