1. "Strive the good strife of the faith...lay hold upon everlasting life, to which thou wast called and didst confess the good confession." 
2. "The confession, which every servant of Christ must make, on taking upon himself His service, or professing it when called upon so to do."
3. "There is some uncertainty, to what occasion the Apostle here refers; whether to the baptism of Timotheus, his ordination as a minister, his appointment over the church at Ephesus, or some confession made by him under persecution."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Fight the good fight...The 'good profession' is connected with the good fight." 
2. "lay hold on eternal life—the crown, or garland, the prize of victory, laid hold of by the winner in the 'good fight'."

1. "Fight the good fight." Not necessarily a metaphor from the gymnasium or arena, although a contest was applied originally to athletic struggles. But it is also used of any struggle, outward or inward.
2. "Lay hold." Frequent in Luke and Acts. Occasionally in this strong sense, but not usually. 
3. "Professed a good profession." Both the verb and the noun in Paul, but this combination only here. Rend. confessed the good confession.

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ calls all his servants to warfare...if earthly soldiers do not hesitate to fight, when the result is doubtful, and when there is a risk of being killed, how much more bravely ought we to do battle under the guidance and banner of Christ, when we are certain of victory?" 
2. "God calls thee to eternal life, and therefore, despising the world, strive to obtain it...nothing has been done, till we have obtained the life to come, to which God invites us."
3. "To Timothy, who had hitherto acted valiantly, and had obtained applause, he addresses this powerful argument, that the latter end should correspond to the beginning...having given such a proof of fidelity, thou canst not, without the greatest shame and disgrace, show thyself to be anything else than a distinguished soldier of Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Fight the good fight of faith...the conflict of the faith' in its definite and objective sense, that to which the profession of the Christian faith pledges us."
2. "Lay hold on eternal life...one vigorous act."
3. "Hast professed a good profession...something analogous to our Lord's good confession before Pilate...Timothy had been brought before the civil power, and had not shrunk from acknowledging his faith in the presence of friends and foes."

2. "Lay hold on." 
3. "The good confession."

### John Gill:
1. "He had many enemies to engage with, as Satan, and his principalities and powers; sin, and the lusts of the flesh; the world, and the men of it, and a great fight of afflictions to endure with them."
2. "This fight is called 'the fight of faith'; partly in opposition to the law, and to the fight of the law the Jews so much talk of; and in which the false teachers, in the apostle's time, were so much engaged, and against whom the apostles set themselves."
3. "This may be called a 'good fight', because it is in a good cause, the cause of God and truth; and under a good Captain, Jesus Christ the Captain of our salvation; for which good weapons are provided, even the whole armour of God, and which are not carnal, but spiritual and mighty."

### John Wesley:
1. "Fight the good fight of faith — Not about words."
2. "Lay hold on eternal life — Just before thee."
3. "Thou hast confessed the good confession before many witnesses — To which they all assented."
