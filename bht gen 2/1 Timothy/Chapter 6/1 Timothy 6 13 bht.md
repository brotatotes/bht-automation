# 1 Timothy 6:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
I charge thee in the presence of the all-powerful God, who has the power to give life to all things, and in the presence of Jesus Christ, who boldly testified before Pontius Pilate. This charge serves as a reminder that God, who has the authority to give and restore life, expects Timothy to faithfully keep His commandments until the return of Jesus Christ. The confession made by Christ before Pilate serves as a model for Timothy's own confession, signifying the truth of Christianity and the importance of holding fast to the faith until the end.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I charge thee...in the presence of God who endues all things with life...and of Christ Jesus, who testified before Pontius Pilate the good confession." 
2. "The fact of a confession having been made in both cases that is put in the foreground and that our Lordâ€™s was made in the midst of danger and with death before him, is a powerful argument to firmness for his servant in his own confession."
3. "That thou keep the commandment without spot and without reproach until the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He urges Timothy to faithfulness here by the present manifestation of
God's power in preserving all things, as in Nehemiah 9:6- :, by the future manifestation of God's power at the appearing
of Christ."
2. "The assurance that 'eternal life,' Nehemiah 9:6- :, will be the result of 'fighting the good fight,'
rests on the fulness and power of Him who is the God of all life,
present and to come."
3. "The confession was His testimony that He was King, and His
kingdom that of the truth. Christ, in attesting, or bearing witness to this truth, attested the truth of the whole of Christianity. Timothy's profession, or confession, included therefore the whole of the Christian truth."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "God is the source of life, and that as he had given life to Timothy - natural and spiritual - he had a right to require that it should be employed in his service."
2. "If, in obedience to this charge and in the performance of his duties, he should be required to lay down his life, he should bear in remembrance that God had power to raise him up again."

### John Calvin:
1. "when he ascribes this to God, that he quickeneth all things, he wishes to meet the offense of the cross, which presents to us nothing but the appearance of death."
2. "we should fix our eyes on God alone, because it is he who restoreth the dead to life."
3. "Christ made his confession before Pilate, not in a multitude of words, but in reality; that is, by undergoing a voluntary death...He ratified it by his blood, and by the sacrifice of his death, better than he could have ratified it by his voice."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The apostle retains to the opening thought of the Epistle, that of the â€˜charge or â€˜injunctionâ€™ which he committed to his disciple, but now that he is drawing to a close, the injunction assumes a more solemn character and is given as in the presence of God and Christ." 
2. "The special attribute of God needed for the encouragement of the faint-hearted. Men may slay the body, but God can both give life to the soul and restore it to the corpse."
3. "The word for â€˜witnessâ€™ seems purposely chosen for the higher form of witness that was consummated by death. The passage becomes important as evidence that the narrative of the Passion was sufficiently familiar to be thus appealed to."

2. "Before Pontius Pilate."

3. "It may also refer to the faithful, plain, and open witness Christ bore to truth throughout the whole of his ministry... mentioned for Timothy's imitation, and to encourage him, and all other saints, to hold fast the profession of their faith to the end."

### John Wesley:
1. I charge thee before God, who quickeneth all things â€” Who hath quickened thee, and will quicken thee at the great day.
