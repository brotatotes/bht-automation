# 1 Timothy 6:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Keep this commandment refers to the instructions and orders Paul had given throughout the epistle concerning both doctrine and discipline. For those who eagerly anticipate the return of Christ, his second appearing will be a display of great glory, accompanied by the glory of the Father and the holy angels. On that day, the true nature and quality of every person's work and ministry will become evident, and all will be required to give an account of themselves and their talents to Christ.
