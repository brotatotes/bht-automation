# 1 Timothy 6:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God alone possesses true and eternal immortality, while all other beings, both mortal and immortal, find their life in Him. The brilliance of His presence and dwelling place is beyond our limited comprehension, as mortal eyes cannot endure the radiance of His light. Heaven, where God resides, is a realm of pure and dazzling light, far surpassing the need for any earthly source of illumination. While we currently experience a veiled understanding of God's glory, those who belong to Him will one day behold Him face to face, seeing Him as He truly is.
