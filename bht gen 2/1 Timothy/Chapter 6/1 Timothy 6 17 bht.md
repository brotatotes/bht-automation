# 1 Timothy 6:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To those who are rich in this present world, the apostle charges them not to be high-minded or place their hope on the uncertainty of riches. Instead, they are encouraged to trust in God, who abundantly provides all things for our enjoyment. They are called to be rich in good works, freely giving and storing up a foundation for the future. By doing so, they will lay hold of the true essence of life and experience the richness that comes from seeking blessings from and in God, rather than placing their trust and hope in earthly wealth.
