# 1 Timothy 6:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Rich men should strive to do good, not just out of obligation, but with the same generosity that God Himself exemplifies. They should not only be rich in material possessions, but also in their commitment to performing good works that stem from their faith. It is important for them to be open-hearted and willing to share what they have, recognizing that their wealth is meant to be used to benefit others. They should be readily willing to distribute their resources and freely participate in acts of kindness, both individually and collectively, without hesitation or regret.
