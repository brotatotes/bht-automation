# 1 Timothy 6:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are encouraged to lay up a spiritual treasure in heaven by generously giving away their earthly riches. This treasure will be for their own eternal enjoyment and serve as a firm foundation against the trials and tribulations of the future. While these acts of charity do not directly earn eternal life, they do come before God as a memorial, displaying our concern for heavenly matters. It is important to understand that our lack of generosity may hinder the grace and salvation God bestows upon us.

2. "But even the most perfect hardly perform the hundredth part of their duty; and therefore our liberality does not deserve to be brought into account before God."
3. "This recompense, therefore, does not depend on considerations of merit, but on God’s gracious acceptance, and is so far from being inconsistent with the righteousness of faith, that it may be viewed as an appendage to it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Laying up in store. Better, ‘as a treasure.’" (1 Timothy 6:19)

3. "To lay up this is no other than to seek those things which are above, to show a concern for them, and to set the affections on them, and live in the comfortable hope and expectation of enjoying them."
