# 1 Timothy 6:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers who are slaves should not despise their masters but should honor and respect them. This applies to both heathen and Christian masters. The Christian slaves must not think of their masters as equals, and the heathen slaves must not treat their masters with disrespect. The idea is that regardless of the master's faith, slaves are to conduct themselves in a manner that upholds the principles of Christianity. They must serve their masters diligently, recognizing that they are all partakers of the same grace and salvation, fostering a relationship of kindness and respect between them.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The slaves who were under heathen masters were positively to regard their masters as deserving of honour; the slaves under Christian masters were, negatively, not to evince any want of respect.

2. "The interchange of service between them in the Christian life being taken for granted, and this word purposely used to express it."
3. "Thus, if we make Œø·º± œÑ·øÜœÇ Œµ·ΩêŒµœÅŒ≥ . ·ºÄŒΩœÑŒπŒª . the subject, as by the article it must be, the sentence will express nothing but a truism."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "It is no small honor, that God has made them equal to earthly lords, in that which is of the highest importance; for they have the same adoption in common with them; and therefore this ought to be no slight inducement to bear slavery with patience."

### John Gill:
1. "And they that have believing masters,.... That believe in one God, in opposition to the Gentiles, that held many gods, and in Jesus Christ, in distinction from the Jews; who believed in him with the heart, and professed him with their mouths, and held the mystery of faith in a pure conscience."
2. "But the apostle teaches another doctrine;let them not despise [them], because they are brethren; of the same family named of Christ, and of the same household of God, and of faith, and have the same father;"
