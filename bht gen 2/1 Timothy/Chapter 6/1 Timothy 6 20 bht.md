# 1 Timothy 6:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As believers, we are entrusted with the true and sound doctrine of the Gospel, which we must guard diligently and faithfully pass on to others. Our focus should be on imparting solid instruction that promotes edification rather than engaging in futile and divisive arguments. Let us be wary of empty and useless talk that does not contribute to the building up of the Church. We should also be cautious of false teachers who boast of their knowledge but lack the genuine understanding of the truth.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The true or sound doctrine to be taught, as opposed to 'the science falsely so called,' which leads to 'error concerning the faith.'"
2. "Let the religion of the soul resemble the growth of the body, which, though it develops its several parts in the progress of years, yet remains the same as it was essentially."
3. "There was true 'knowledge,' a special gift of the Spirit, which was abused by some...This gift was soon counterfeited by false teachers arrogating to themselves pre-eminently the gift."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Keep that which is committed to thy trust - All that is entrusted to you, and to which reference has been particularly made in this Epistle. The honor of the gospel, and the interests of religion, had been specially committed to him; and he was sacredly to guard this holy trust, and not suffer it to be wrested from him."
2. "Avoiding profane and vain babblings - Greek, 'Profane, empty words.' The reference is to such controversies and doctrines as tended only to produce strife, and were not adapted to promote the edification of the church."
3. "And oppositions of science falsely so called - Religion has nothing to fear from true science, and the minister of the gospel is not exhorted to dread that. Real science, in all its advances, contributes to the support of religion."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The meaning here is that teaching which Timothy had received from Paul; the 'sound words' which he was to guard as a sacred trust, and communicate to others." 
2. "Oppositions of the falsely-named knowledge. Gnwsiv knowledge was the characteristic word of the Gnostic school, the most formidable enemy of the church of the second century."
3. "The word gnwsiv cannot therefore be interpreted to mean the Gnostic system; while it may properly be understood as referring to that conceit of knowledge which opposed itself to the Christian faith."

### John Calvin:
1. "Guard diligently what had been given to him, or rather, what had been committed to him in trust; that he may not suffer it to be corrupted or adulterated, or may not deprive or rob himself of it through his own fault."
2. "The object of the admonition is, that he may be diligent in imparting solid instruction; and this cannot be, unless he detest ostentation; for, where an ambitious desire to please prevails, there is no longer any strong desire of edification."
3. "Paul had this principally in view, that the empty doctrine of the sophists, rising aloft into airy speculations and subtleties, not only obscures by its pretensions the simplicity of true doctrine, but also oppresses and renders it contemptible, as the world is usually carried away by outward show."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "That which is committed to thy trust... may refer either (1) to the faith committed to him, (2) to the Church entrusted to his charge, or (3) to the spiritual gifts bestowed on him."
2. "We know from the passages referred to that there were some in St. Paul’s time... who boasted of a gnosis which he did not recognise as worthy of the name."
3. "What precise meaning is to be attached to the ‘oppositions of science,’ it is not so easy to say. Those who deny St. Paul’s authorship refer it to the ‘antitheses’ or ‘contrasts’ which Marcion drew out between the theology of the Old and New Covenants."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Guard that which is committed unto thee" - "Keep (aorist of urgency) the deposit." (την παραθηκην φυλαξον).
2. "Turning away from babblings" - "uttering emptiness." (εκτρεπομενος... κενοφωνιας).
3. "Oppositions of the knowledge which is falsely so called" - "the falsely named knowledge." (αντιθεσεις... της ψευδωνυμου γνωσεως).

### John Gill:
1. "The Gospel...ought to be kept pure and uncorrupt, and faithfully dispensed, and diligently preserved."
2. "Avoiding profane and vain babblings...which were vain, empty, useless, and unprofitable talk."
3. "The false teachers boasted of their science and knowledge, but it was not true, solid, spiritual, and saving."

### John Wesley:
1. "Keep that which is committed to thy trust — The charge I have given thee."
2. "Avoid profane empty babblings — How weary of controversy was this acute disputant!"
3. "And knowledge falsely so called - Most of the ancient heretics were great pretenders to knowledge."
