# 1 Timothy 6:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Ignorant pride leads to arrogance and the rejection of true spiritual knowledge. The individual may possess knowledge of worldly matters, but it is of no use in the realm of the spirit. Engaging in foolish and unlearned debates only leads to strife and contention, which is contrary to the teachings of Christ. It is important to focus on inward, practical religion rather than getting entangled in empty word-strifes and disputes.

### John Gill:

2. "He may have knowledge of natural and civil things, but not of spiritual ones; he may have collected a medley of knowledge together, but what will be of no real use either to himself or others."
