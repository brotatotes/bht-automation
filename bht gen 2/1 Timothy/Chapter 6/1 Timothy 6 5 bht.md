# 1 Timothy 6:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Supposing that gain is godliness, they think the best religion is the getting of money, a far more common case than is usually supposed. These individuals in the passage believe that the pursuit of wealth is the ultimate display of godliness, which is a misconception that is more prevalent than realized. It is important to recognize that true godliness is not measured by material gain, but by a sincere and genuine devotion to God.
