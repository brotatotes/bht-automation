# 1 Timothy 6:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A person who possesses true godliness is truly gaining and thriving, as they hold the genuine, satisfying, durable, and incomprehensible riches of grace. This gain is enhanced by the presence of contentment, which is produced by godliness and is a part of its rewarding nature. Contentment means having a self-sufficiency, where a person is satisfied with what they have, thankful for it, submits to God's will, and endures every challenging circumstance with patience. Together, godliness and contentment bring immeasurable profits both in this life and in eternity.
