# 1 Timothy 6:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
People enter this world with nothing, and when they leave, they can take nothing with them. Our possessions and wealth hold no value beyond this life. Therefore, we should not be consumed by the desire for material gain. Instead, we should focus on the pursuit of godliness, the true and lasting treasure. Our contentment should come from recognizing that what we have is sufficient for our needs and that we will not require worldly possessions beyond our time on earth. Ultimately, our greatest desire should be for a safe and prepared path to our eternal home.
