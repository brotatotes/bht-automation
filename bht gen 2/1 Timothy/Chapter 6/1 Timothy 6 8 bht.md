# 1 Timothy 6:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is important for believers to recognize that their needs are provided for by God. As followers of Christ, we should be content with having food and covering, which includes clothing and shelter. These provisions meet our essential needs and show the love of God towards us. Let us look to the examples of contentment set by the apostle and strive to imitate and follow them in our own lives.

1. "Food" includes all things necessary to be ate and drank, of which there is a great variety... and "raiment" every necessary covering... and includes an habitation, which is a cover and shelter from the inclemencies of the weather.
2. There is very good reason why the saints should be content; since more than these things cannot be enjoyed; and these they have with a blessing, and as a fruit and token of the love of God to them; these were all that Jacob desired, Agur petitioned for, and Christ directs his disciples daily to pray for; and which to have, is to have enough, a proper sufficiency and competency.
3. [The apostle] sets himself, and others, as examples of contentment to be imitated and followed.

### John Wesley:
1. Covering — That is, raiment and an house to cover us. This is all that a Christian needs, and all that his religion allows him to desire.
