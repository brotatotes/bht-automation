# 1 Timothy 6:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who long to have riches unknowingly subject themselves to a dangerous path. The desire itself robs them of contentment and leaves them vulnerable to ruin. It is like falling into a deep pit, caught in the snare of temptation, with no escape. This pursuit of wealth leads to foolish and harmful cravings, which bring about destruction and eternal loss. In the end, the longing for riches proves to be empty and destructive, leaving no room for true fulfillment or hope.
