# 2 Corinthians 1:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Timotheus is described as a brother in the faith, indicating the close bond and relationship between him and the author. This term of endearment is significant, as in another context, the same author refers to Timotheus as his son. It highlights the deep connection and familial affection that exists within the Christian community, where believers are united not only as brothers and sisters in Christ but also as part of the same spiritual family.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This, and the Epistle to the Galatians, were circular letters to all the believers in the respective countries: the variation of expression in the two cases...being accounted for by the circumstance that the matter of this Epistle concerned directly the church at Corinth, and indirectly all the saints in the province, whereas that to the Galatians, being to correct deeprooted Judaizing error, directly concerned all the churches of Galatia."
2. "Achaia comprehended Hellas and Peloponnesus; the province was so named by the Romans because they became possessed of them by subduing the Achæan league."
3. "On his [Timothy] being with Paul at this time, see Prolegg. to this Epistle, § ii. 4."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "When writing to Timothy himself, he calls him 'my son.' Writing of him, 'brother' and 'my beloved son'." 
2. "The Gentiles themselves, and Annæus Gallio, the proconsul, strongly testified their disapproval of the accusation brought by the Jews against Paul."
3. "Hence, the apostle was enabled to labor in the whole province of Achaia with such success as to establish several churches there."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The influence and name of Timothy might be supposed to have weight with the party in the church that had slandered Paul, by accusing him of insincerity or instability in regard to his purposed visit to them. Paul had designed to go to them directly from Ephesus, but he had changed his mind, and the testimony of Timothy might be important to prove that it was done from motives purely conscientious." 
2. "Timothy was doubtless acquainted with the reasons; and his testimony might meet and rebut a part of the charges against him."
3. "Paul doubtless designed that copies of this Epistle should be circulated among them."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Timothy our brother. Lit., the brother. Compare 1 Corinthians 1:1. Well known in the Christian brotherhood."
2. "Timothy appears, not as amanuensis, nor as joint - author, but as joint - sender of the epistle."
3. "Achaia. See on 1 Corinthians 16:15."

### John Calvin:
1. "To secure authority for any one, two things are required — a call, and fidelity on the part of the person who is called, in the execution of his office."
2. "The mere name is not enough, if there be not the reality along with it, so that he who gives himself out as an Apostle must also show himself to be such by his work."
3. "The faults of individuals do not prevent a society that has genuine marks of religion from being recognised as a Church."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Timothy had been sent to Corinth along with the First Epistle and is here associated with the apostle himself in the salutation of a church which he knew so well."
2. "Timothy was in all likelihood the penman of this Epistle, unto the church ... at Corinth, with all the saints ... in the whole of Achaia."
3. "There appear to have been converts scattered up and down this whole province of which Corinth was the capital, in addition to the little 'church at Cenchreæ,' the eastern port of Corinth. These would be affiliated with the mother church at the capital, meeting by themselves in little knots where numerous and near enough to each other, but looking to Corinth as their centre and the headquarters of Christianity in the province."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Timothy is with Paul, having been sent on to Macedonia from Ephesus." 
2. "Achaia was all of Greece south of this (both Attica and the Peloponnesus)." 
3. "His language here would seem to cover the whole (ολη, all) of Achaia in his scope and not merely the environment around Corinth."

### John Gill:
1. "He did not assume that character and office without the call of Christ, and will of God."
2. "He the rather mentions him, because he had sent him to them, to know their state, and was now returned to him with an account of it, and who joined and agreed with him in the substance of this epistle."
3. "The apostle's intention in directing it in this form was, that copies of this letter might be sent to them, who equally, with this church, stood in need of the reproofs, exhortations, and instructions which are in it."

### John Wesley:
1. Timotheus our brother — St. Paul writing to Timotheus styled him his son; writing of him, his brother.
