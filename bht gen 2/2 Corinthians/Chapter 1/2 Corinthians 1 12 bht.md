# 2 Corinthians 1:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle confidently expects the fulfillment of his hope, for he takes pride in his integrity and his ability to rejoice even in the face of adversity. His conscience bears witness to his sincere and godly conduct, and this testimony holds greater value than the opinions of others. His boasting is not rooted in human wisdom, but in the divine wisdom and grace that guide and sustain him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "the Apostle regards the μαρτύριον and the καύχησις as coincident: it is not the testimony, &c., of which he boasts, but in which his boasting itself consists."
2. "which fleshly wisdom is anything but holy and pure, having many windings and insincerities in order to captivate men."
3. "in the grace of God, i.e. in that χάρις which he had received...the grace of his apostleship."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "in holiness...sincerity as in the presence of God"
2. "Sincerity implies the non-admixture of any foreign element."
3. "The prudence which subserves selfish interests, or employs unchristian means, or relies on human means more than on the Divine Spirit, is 'fleshly wisdom.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The ground of his rejoicing, and of his confidence, was that he had lived a holy life. He had not been actuated by 'fleshly wisdom,' but he had been animated and guided by 'the grace of God.'"
2. "An approving conscience is of inestimable value when we are calumniated; and when we draw near to death."
3. "The plans of the world are obscure, deceitful, and dark, as if in the night. But by the grace of God... Paul had been influenced by such sentiments and principles as would be suggested or prompted by the influence of his grace."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Godly sincerity [ειλικρινεια του θεου] . Lit., sincerity of God, as Rev. See on 2 Peter 3:1. We have had our conversation [ανεστραφημεν] . Rev., behaved ourselves. See on 1 Peter 1:15.

### John Calvin:
1. "He deserved, therefore, to be dear to them, and it would have been very unfeeling not to be concerned in reference to such a servant of the Lord, that he might be long preserved for the benefit of the Church."
2. "But how does Paul’s glorying in his integrity comport with that statement, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord?... These three exceptions lay a foundation for every godly person glorying on good grounds in all God’s benefits."
3. "Hence Paul does not reckon it enough to declare that his sincerity was perceived by men, but adds, that he was such in the sight of God."

1. "Our glorying is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in holiness and sincerity of God...not with fleshly wisdom, but with the grace of God...we behaved ourselves in the world." 
2. "It would have been hypocrisy to ask their prayers for him had he been conscious of pursuing a crooked policy." 
3. "Conscious as he was that he had but one object in view throughout his whole apostolic work...he could freely ask them to unite with him in prayer for his deliverance from the perils by which he was then surrounded."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Glorying (καυχησις). Act of glorying, while in verse 2 Corinthians 1:14 καυχημα is the thing boasted of." 
2. "The testimony of our conscience (το μαρτυριον της συνειδησεως ημων). In apposition with καυχησις."
3. "Not in fleshly wisdom (ουκ εν σοφια σαρκικη). See on 1 Corinthians 1:17; 1 Corinthians 2:4; 1 Corinthians 2:13. Paul uses σαρκικος five times and it occurs only twice elsewhere in N.T. See on 1 Corinthians 3:3."

### John Gill:
1. "This rejoicing or glorying of the apostle's in the testimony of their consciences, to the goodness of their hearts, actions, conduct, and behaviour, was... before men, who were ready to accuse their good conversation in Christ."
2. "The conscience of the apostle bore him witness, that he behaved in the simplicity and singleness of his heart; and also in godly sincerity, or 'in the sincerity of God'; that is, such as God requires, gives, and approves of, and which will stand in his sight, will bear his examination, and to which he gives his testimony."
