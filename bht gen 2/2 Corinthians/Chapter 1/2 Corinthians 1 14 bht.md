# 2 Corinthians 1:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Corinthians had partially acknowledged Paul's sincerity and faithfulness as a minister. They had reason to rejoice in having such ministers who sought their conversion and the glory of Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "in part," that is, some of you, not all... The majority at Corinth had shown a willing compliance with Paul's directions in the first Epistle: but some were still refractory. Hence arises the difference of tone in different parts of this Epistle.
2. your rejoicing - your subject of glorying or boast. "Are" (not merely shall be) implies the present recognition of one another as a subject of mutual glorying.
3. that glorying being about to be realized in its fulness "in the day (of the coming) of the Lord Jesus."

### Albert Barnes:

### John Calvin:
