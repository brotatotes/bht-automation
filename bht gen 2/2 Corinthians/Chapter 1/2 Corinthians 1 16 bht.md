# 2 Corinthians 1:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The original plan of the apostle Paul was to visit Corinth first, as an expression of his love and strong desire to see them. However, he changed his mind for personal reasons. This change of plans was known to the Corinthians, which led to their criticism and accusations of him being indecisive. Paul defends himself by reminding them of his previous communication, where he had mentioned his intention to visit them after passing through Macedonia. Despite the change in his plans, it is evident that Paul's actions were guided by his trust in God's timing and unforeseen circumstances.
