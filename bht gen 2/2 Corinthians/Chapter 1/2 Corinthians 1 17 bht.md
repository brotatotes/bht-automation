# 2 Corinthians 1:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Did I act with levity in forming my purpose, or did I plan according to worldly standards, ensuring that my 'yes' always means 'yes' and my 'no' always means 'no'? Paul denies that his plans were made with levity and emphasizes that his intentions were not based on worldly desires, but on the firmness of his word. There was no inconsistency in his purpose; he did not promise one thing and then contradict it. Instead, he remained steadfast in his resolution.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "[...] the levity of purpose which has been laid to my charge."
2. "Or those things which I plan, do I plan according to the flesh, that there may be with me the Yea, yea, and the Nay, nay?"
3. "Or those things which I plan, do I plan after the flesh, so that my yea must be yea, and my nay, nay?"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Did I act with levity, or (on the other hand) do I purpose what I purpose like worldly (fleshly) men, so that my 'yea' must at all costs be yea, and my 'nay' nay?"
2. "The repetition of the 'yea' and 'nay' hardly agrees with ALFORD'S view, 'What I purpose do I purpose according to the changeable purposes of the fleshly (worldly) man, that there may be with me the yea yea, and the nay nay (that is, both affirmation and negation concerning the same thing)?'"
3. "The repetition will thus stand for the single yea and nay, as in Matthew 5:37; James 5:12. But the latter passage implies that the double 'yea' here is not equivalent to the single 'yea': BENGEL'S view, therefore, seems preferable."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "By the interrogative form here, he sharply denies that it was a purpose formed in a light and trifling manner."
2. "Paul denies in a positive manner that he formed such plans; and they should have known enough of his manner of life to be assured that that was not the nature of the schemes which he had devised?"
3. "Paul says that this was not his character. He did not affirm a thing at one time and deny it at another; he did not promise to do a thing one moment and refuse to do it the next."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The change of plan had given rise to the charge of fickleness."
2. "The yea, yea, and the nay, nay."
3. "Promising to come and breaking my promise."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is a sign of changeableness to purpose or promise what you almost immediately afterwards regret."
2. "To purpose, therefore, according to the flesh, is not owning God as our ruler, but, instead of this, being impelled by a rash presumption, which is afterwards justly derided by God, and punished."
3. "that yea should with me be in this instance yea, and on the other hand, when it pleases me, nay, nay"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This shews that his original plan had somehow become known at Corinth either through Timothy (1 Corinthians 4:17), or in the letter referred to in 1 Corinthians 5:9 and that advantage had been taken of the change to his prejudice." 
2. "That with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay? ‘saying yes and no to the same thing as suits the whim of the moment.’"
3. "That this is the meaning is clear from what follows."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Did I show fickleness? An indignant negative answer is called for by μητ. The instrumental case of ελαφρια is regular after εχρησαμην from χραομα, to use." 
2. "Ελαφρια is a late word for levity from the old adjective, ελαφρος, light, agile (2 Corinthians 10:17; Matthew 11:30). Here only in N.T."
3. "That seems to be Paul's meaning here, 'that the Yea may be yea and the Nay may be nay.'"

### John Gill:
1. "Did I promise certainly that I would come, without annexing any condition to it?"
2. "Do I consult myself? My own interest and advantage? Do I seek the gratification of any carnal affection?"
3. "Has there appeared such contradictions in my words, and such inconstancy in my conduct, that my 'yeas' are 'nays', and my 'nays' are 'yeas'?"

### John Wesley:
1. "Did I use levity — Did I lightly change my purpose?"
2. "Do I purpose according to the flesh - Are my purposes grounded on carnal or worldly considerations?"
3. "So that there should be with me yea and nay - Sometimes one, sometimes the other; that is, variableness and inconstancy."
