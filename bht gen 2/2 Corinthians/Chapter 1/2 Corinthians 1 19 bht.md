# 2 Corinthians 1:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The preaching about Jesus Christ is not about an ever-changing, unfaithful figure, but about the consistent, faithful Son of God who is fully capable of accomplishing redemption. This message is not contradictory or uncertain but is firmly grounded in the unchanging nature of Christ. Therefore, those who preach the Gospel should reflect this consistency and truth, imitating the unwavering faithfulness of Jesus.
