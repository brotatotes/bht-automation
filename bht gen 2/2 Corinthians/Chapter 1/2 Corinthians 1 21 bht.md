# 2 Corinthians 1:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God strengthens and establishes believers in their faith in Christ. He confirms their hope and provides grace to be faithful. The anointing of the Holy Spirit symbolizes the empowering influence of divine presence and is given to ministers and believers alike. The Holy Spirit acts as an earnest, sealing the covenant of God and ratifying it on both sides. The work of God in confirming and establishing believers is a firm and settled act of His own, as it is He alone who is able to fulfill His promises and anoint them with the oil of gladness.

### John Calvin:
1. "God, indeed, is always true and steadfast in his promises...such is our vanity, that we do not utter our Amen in return, except when he gives a sure testimony in our hearts by his word." 
2. "God cures our weakness or defect when, by correcting our belief, he confirms us by his Spirit. Thus it comes, that we glorify him by a firm steadfastness of faith."
3. "He introduces a fourth idea — that the Spirit has been given to us as an earnest — a similitude which he frequently makes use of, and is also exceedingly appropriate...it is on good grounds that he is called an earnest because it is owing to him, that the covenant of God is ratified on both sides, which would, but for this, have hung in suspense."

1. "Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ" - Gr. 'into Christ' (the pregnant sense of the Greek preposition) not only inserting us into, but keeping us in Christ.

2. "Their standing is alone in him; the unchangeable love and favour of God, which is their grand security, is in Christ."
