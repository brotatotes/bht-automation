# 2 Corinthians 1:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through the sealing, God claims us as his own, marking and protecting us with his image. He goes even further and gives us the earnest of his Spirit, an assurance that goes beyond a mere pledge. Unlike a pledge, the earnest is not taken away; it is a taste of what is to come. The Spirit serves as the first fruits of the heavenly inheritance, a preview of the fullness to be received in due time.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Sealed us (σφραγισαμενος ημας). From σφραγιζω old verb, common in LXX and papyri for setting a seal to prevent opening... in place of signature... Papyri examples show a wide legal use to give validity to documents, to guarantee genuineness of articles..." 
2. "The earnest of the Spirit (τον αρραβωνα του πνευματος). A word of Semitic origin... It is common in the papyri as earnest money in a purchase for a cow or for a wife (a dowry). In N.T. only here... It is part payment on the total obligation... It is God, says Paul, who has done all this for us and God is Paul's pledge that he is sincere."

1. "The sealing of his people...expressive of the grace of God to his people, in claiming a property in them, distinguishing them from the rest of the world, setting his affections on them, securing and protecting their persons, and hiding them under the shadow of his wings."
2. "The sealing...intends that assurance which God gives his people of their interest in his love, and the covenant of grace; of their election of God, and redemption by Christ; of their interest in Christ, and union with him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Who also hath sealed us — Stamping his image on our hearts, thus marking and sealing us as his own property."
