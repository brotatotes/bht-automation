# 2 Corinthians 1:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle, speaking by the Spirit, calls God as a witness upon his soul, making a solemn oath that his reason for not coming to Corinth earlier was out of consideration for them. He wanted to avoid the need for severe discipline and to not be burdensome upon them. This illustrates that an oath, when made in important matters, is a solemn appeal to God, and it is clear that Christ's intention was not to forbid all forms of oaths. The apostle's purpose was to spare them and show his authority in bringing about repentance.

1. "He spared them in this respect, that if he had come he would have been constrained to reprove them more severely, while he wished rather that they should of their own accord repent previously to his arrival, that there might be no occasion for a harsher remedy, which is a signal evidence of more than paternal lenity."
2. "For how much forbearance there was in shunning this necessity, when he had just ground of provocation!"
3. "The disposition I refer to is, where there is not so much regard had to private advantage, as concern felt for the glory of God, and the advantage of the brethren: For this end must always be kept in view, that our oaths may promote the honor of God, and promote also the advantage of our neighbors in a matter that is befitting."

2. "Little would they expect such an explanation, and evidently he would fain have concealed it from them; but since he must be plain with them, with such suspicions attaching to him, he uses the most solemn of all asseverations in doing it, and the 'I' is emphatic: 'Let enemies say what they will, I protest it before God.'"
