# 2 Corinthians 1:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Ministers do not have dominion over the faith of believers, for that is the exclusive realm of God. Instead, their role is to assist and support the joy of the believers, aiding them in their journey of faith and holiness. This understanding of their role is crucial because it highlights the amiable and friendly nature of their office which is ultimately directed towards the happiness of mankind.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Faith" is here emphatic. He had "dominion" or a right to control them in matters of discipline, but in matters of "faith" he was only a "fellow helper of their joy."
2. "Not that we lord it over your faith." This he adds to soften the magisterial tone of Philippians 1:25. His desire is to cause them not sorrow, but "joy."
3. "By faith ye stand"; therefore it is that I bestow such pains in "helping" your faith, which is the source of all true "joy".

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Had the former been our object, had we wished to set up a lordship or dominion over you, we should have come to you with our apostolical authority, and in the severity of apostolic discipline."
2. "While the apostles had the right to prescribe the articles of belief, and to propound the doctrines of God, yet they would not do even that in such a manner as to seem to 'lord it over God’s heritage'; they did not set up absolute authority, or prescribe the things to be believed in a lordly and imperative manner."
3. "God is the only true and real Source of comfort in times of trial...there is no true comfort except in Him...He is the 'Father of mercies,' and He is 'the God of all consolation.'"
4. "...all that ought to be done could be accomplished by straightforward and simple-hearted purposes; and that a cause which depended on the carnal and crooked policy of the world was a bad cause; and that such policy would ultimately ruin the best of causes."
5. "How happy would it have been if these views had always prevailed in the church!"

### John Calvin:
1. "Such were not the gravity of a Christian pastor, but the cruelty of a savage tyrant."
2. "For faith ought to be altogether exempt, and to the utmost extent free, from the yoke of men."
3. "For if the nature and effect of faith be such that we lean, in order that we may stand, it is absurd to speak of faith as being subject to men."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Not that we have lordship over your faith, not domineering over you in things spiritual."
2. "But (on the contrary) are helpers of your joy; for by faith ye stand."
3. "Ye stand, not on us, but each to his own Master on the footing of his own faith; nor can anyone, not even an apostle of Jesus Christ, come in between him and God, the Judge of all."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "We have lordship over (κυριευομεν)."
2. "Co-workers (1 Corinthians 3:8) in your joy."
3. "A delicate correction to present misapprehension (επανορθωσις)."

### John Gill:
1. "They cannot give or produce in the heart the grace of faith; that is the gift of God; of which Christ is not only the object, but the author..."
2. "Ministers have no power to make and impose new articles of faith, though they may require and insist upon an assent to those truths which they deliver, according to the word of God."
3. "By faith ye stand; and so are not subject to men, nor to any tyrannical government of ours... by which they rely on the power and faithfulness of God, lean upon Christ, and walk on in him, live upon him, continually receive from him, and in his strength stand against the temptations of Satan, and snares of the world."

### John Wesley:
1. "Not that we have dominion over your faith — This is the prerogative of God alone."
2. "But as helpers of their joy, by helping them forward in faith and holiness."
3. "In this view, how amiable does their office appear! and how friendly to the happiness of mankind!"
