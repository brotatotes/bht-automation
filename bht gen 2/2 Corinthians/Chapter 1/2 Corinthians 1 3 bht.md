Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is worthy of praise and glory. He is the compassionate Father, the source of all mercies and the provider of comfort. It is through the Lord Jesus Christ that we receive every mercy and comfort. There is no lasting comfort to be found in the world or its creatures, only in God. He is the one who shows mercy in our afflictions and brings comfort in and after our trials. Let us give thanks and praise to the God who works all possible comfort, the God of hope.
