# 2 Corinthians 1:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In facing tribulation and hardships, we are not left alone or without comfort, for God Himself provides us with divine help and support. This comfort that we receive is not just for our own benefit, but also for the purpose of ministering to others. By experiencing various forms of affliction, we become equipped to offer support and comfort to those undergoing similar trials. Through our own personal experiences, we gain the ability to empathize and provide solace to others.
