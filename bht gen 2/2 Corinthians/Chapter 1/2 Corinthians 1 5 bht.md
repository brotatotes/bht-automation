# 2 Corinthians 1:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The sufferings endured on behalf of Christ and his gospel are seen as the sufferings of Christ himself. As believers, we are conformed to Christ and bear his sufferings in our bodies, knowing that one day the life of Christ will be revealed in us. We find comfort in knowing that God is always present with us in our tribulations, sustaining us with the consolations of Christ. Just as Christ suffered, so we too may suffer for his sake, but we can take heart because our comfort abounds through Christ, who has overcome the world.
