# 2 Corinthians 1:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When faced with trials, it is crucial to remember that they serve a greater purpose. Just as Paul endured afflictions and received consolation for the sake of the Corinthians' comfort and salvation, our sufferings can bring about comfort for others. This shared experience strengthens our faith and provides solidarity with fellow believers. Through the effectual power of God's comfort, we can patiently endure and find solace in knowing that we are not alone. Our trials are not in vain; they have the potential to bring comfort, salvation, and a deeper sense of faith to ourselves and those around us.
