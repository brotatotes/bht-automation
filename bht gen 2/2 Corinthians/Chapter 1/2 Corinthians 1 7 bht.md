Grounded on your patience in suffering for Christ's sake, our hope concerning you is steadfast. This confidence is not based on wishful thinking but on the firm foundation of your unwavering faith and endurance in the face of afflictions. Just as you are united in the experience of suffering, you are also united in the comfort and consolation that comes from God. The Corinthians, even though they had not encountered the same sufferings as Paul, are included as partners in his experience of hardship and consolation.
