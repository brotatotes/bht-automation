# 2 Corinthians 1:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle wanted the Corinthians to be fully aware of the recent trouble he and his companions experienced, not only to express his gratitude to God but also to inspire them to trust in God even in the most desperate times. The affliction they faced was overwhelming, like a burden too heavy to bear, surpassing human strength. This trouble, possibly the same one mentioned in the book of Acts, served as a testimony to the Corinthians, demonstrating the magnitude and impact of their trials.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The expressions here used do not seem to me to find their justification in anything which we know of that tumult or its consequences."
2. "These expressions seem rather to regard a deadly sickness, than a persecution."
3. "So that we utterly despaired even of life."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The words, 'we had the sentence of death in ourselves,' mean, that he looked upon himself as a man condemned to die." 
2. "There is little doubt that, had Paul been found by the mob in the excitement, he would have been torn in pieces."
3. "His weak state of health at the time combined with all this to make him regard himself as all but dead."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The object of Paul here is to give a full explanation of the nature of his trials, to which he had referred in 2 Corinthians 1:4."
2. "By these trials, his life had been endangered, perhaps, more than once, and he had been called to look death calmly in the face, and to anticipate the probability that he might soon die."
3. "And this was one of the many cases in which Paul was called on to contemplate death as near. It was doubtless one cause of his fidelity, and of his great success in his work."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "The probability, however, is that he refers here to the history, which Luke relates in Acts 19:23, though in that passage he does not so distinctly intimate the extent of the danger."
2. "I have already observed, that Paul does not measure his strength in connection with help from God, but according to his own personal feeling of his ability...Farther, it is necessary that even saints themselves should be in danger of an entire failure of strength, that, being put in mind of their own weakness, they may learn, agreeably to what follows, to place their entire dependence on God alone."
3. "Paul had no more power to stand under it."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "No wonder that under a continuance of this impression his strength got worn down, and he was at times ready to sink under the pressure."
3. "But it drove him to the one Source of courage and strength to hold on, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul has laid down his philosophy of afflictions and now he cites a specific illustration in his own recent experience."
2. "He had a trial so great that 'we were weighed down exceedingly beyond our power.'"
3. "There seemed no way out."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle was very desirous that the Corinthians might be thoroughly acquainted with the trouble that had lately befallen them; partly because it would clearly appear from hence what reason he had to give thanks to God as he had done; and partly, that they might be encouraged to trust in God, when in the utmost extremity."
2. "The greatness of this trouble is set forth in very strong expressions, as that we were pressed out of measure. The affliction was as a heavy burden upon them, too heavy to bear; it was exceeding heavy, even to an 'hyperbole', beyond expression; and above strength, that is, above human strength, the strength of nature."

### John Wesley:
1. "We would not have you ignorant, brethren, of the trouble which befell us in Asia — Probably the same which is described in the nineteenth chapter of the Acts." 
2. "The Corinthians knew before that he had been in trouble: he now declares the greatness and the fruit of it."
3. "We were exceedingly pressed, above our strength — Above the ordinary strength even of an apostle."
