## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We had in ourselves the response of death, i.e. our answer within ourselves to the question, ‘Life or Death?’ was, ‘Death.’" 
2. "Our thoughts were weaned from all hope of surviving in this life, and fixed on that better deliverance which God shall work when He raises us from the dead." 
3. "Understanding it literally as above, I cannot see how it can be spoken with reference to the Ephesian tumult."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Yea."
2. "in God which raiseth the dead"
3. "his hope of the resurrection was what buoyed him up"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He felt that he must die; and that human aid was vain. According to every probability he would die; and all that he could do was to cast himself on the protection of that God who had power to save him even then, if he chose, and who, if he did it, would exert power similar to that which is put forth when the dead are raised."
2. "The effect, therefore, of the near prospect of death was to lead him to put increased confidence in God. He felt that God only could save him; or that God only could sustain him if he should die."
3. "A true Christian in such circumstances will rush to His arms and feel that there he is safe."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Sentence of death... The sense is well given by Stanley: 'When I have asked myself what would be the issue of this struggle, the answer has been, 'death.'" 
2. "Doth deliver... The correct reading is will deliver."

### John Calvin:
1. "I had already laid my account with dying, or had regarded it as a thing fixed."
2. "We must, however, take notice, chiefly, of what he adds as to the design — that he had been reduced to this extremity, that he might not trust in himself."
3. "As we must first die, in order that, renouncing confidence in ourselves, and conscious of our own weakness, we may claim no honor to ourselves, so even that were not sufficient, if we did not proceed a step farther."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The answer of death (το αποκριμα του θανατου) This late word from αποκρινομα, to reply, occurs nowhere else in N.T., but is in Josephus, Polybius, inscriptions and papyri . . . and always in the sense of decision or judgment rendered."
2. "We ourselves have had within ourselves (αυτο εν εαυτοις εσχηκαμεν). Regular perfect of εχω, to have. And still have the vivid recollection of that experience."
3. "That we should not trust in ourselves (ινα μη πεποιθοτες ωμεν εφ' εαυτοις). A further purpose of God in affliction beyond that in verse 2 Corinthians 1:4."

### John Gill:
1. "By the sentence of death is meant...an opinion or persuasion in their own breasts, that they should die; so far were they from any hopes of life..."
2. "To learn to lay aside all self-trust and confidence..."
3. "To teach and encourage them to trust in God alone, and depend on his arm, on his almighty power."

### John Wesley:
1. Yea, we had the sentence of death in ourselves — We ourselves expected nothing but death.
