# 2 Corinthians 10:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul's physical presence was not imposing and his speech lacked the eloquence and power commonly associated with influential leaders. His letters, on the other hand, were weighty and filled with sharp reproofs and threats, reflecting his authority and strength. His detractors used his unimpressive appearance to ridicule him, considering him weak and inconsequential. However, the Corinthians who valued eloquent orators like Apollos failed to recognize the profound impact and depth of Paul's teachings. Despite his physical shortcomings, his letters conveyed a power and authority that left a lasting impression on the Christian world.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "No countenance is given by these words to the idea that Paul was of weak physical constitution, or short in stature."
2. "His own explanation of them is sufficient as given in 1 Corinthians 2:1 ff. It is, that when he was present among them, he brought, not the strength of presence or words of the carnal teachers, but abjured all such influence and in fear and trembling preached Christ crucified."
3. "At the same time, the contrast being between his epistles and his word of mouth, his authority as unaccompanied or accompanied by his presence, it must be assumed, that there was something (see on ch. 2Co 12:7) which discommended his appearance and delivery."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Lettersâ€”implying that there had been already more letters of Paul received by the Corinthians than the one we have, namely, First Corinthians; and that they contained strong reproofs."
2. "There was nothing of majesty or authority in his manner; he bore himself tremblingly among them, whereas the false teachers spoke with authoritative bearing and language."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They abounded with strong argument, manly appeals, and impressive reproof."
2. "Paulâ€™s letters have done more to give shape to the theological doctrines of the Christian world than any other cause whatever."
3. "No man has left the impress of his own mind on more other minds than Paul."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "No one can even cursorily read St. Paul's epistles without observing that he was aware of something in his aspect or his personality which distressed him with an agony of humiliation... It is as though he felt that his appearance was against him." 
2. "All the traditions as to Paul's personal appearance are late. A bronze medal discovered in the cemetery of St. Domitilla at Rome represents the apostle with a bald, round, well-developed head; rather long, curling beard; high forehead; prominent nose; and open, staring eye."
3. "In the 'Acts of Paul and Thekla,' a third-century romance, [Paul] is described as 'short, bald, bowlegged, with meeting eyebrows, hook-nosed, full of grace.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "His letters, they say, are weighty and strong, but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech of no account."
 
2. "The weakness here ascribed to his 'bodily presence' refers to his physical weakness, which Plumptre thinks obvious, is far from clear to critics quite as acute and impartial."
3. "The context shows the contrast between his tone and manner when present with the Corinthians, and when merely writing to them."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "These adjectives can be uncomplimentary and mean 'severe and violent' instead of 'impressive and vigorous.'" 
2. "It seems clear that Paul did not have a commanding appearance... his accusers sneered at his personal appearance as 'weak.'"
3. "The Corinthians (some of them) cared more for the brilliant eloquence of Apollos and did not find Paul a trained rhetorician."

### John Gill:
1. "For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful.... laden with sharp reproofs and severe menaces... filled with great swelling words, with boasts of power and authority, and with threatenings what he would do..." 
2. "His bodily presence is weak... his speech contemptible... he made a mean figure... a man of a mean spirit, very abject and servile... his words without weight, his language vulgar, and style neglected..."

### John Wesley:
1. His bodily presence is weak â€” His stature, says St. Chrysostom, was low, his body crooked, and his head bald.
