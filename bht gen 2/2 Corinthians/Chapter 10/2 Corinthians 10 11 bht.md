# 2 Corinthians 10:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Apostle Paul addresses those who question the consistency between his words in his letters and his actions in person, emphasizing that there will be no discrepancy. His purpose is not to make idle threats but to display his true character in both word and deed. He warns those who malign him that they will witness the same unwavering character in person as they have experienced through his correspondence. Although Paul's approach might not be as gentle and tender as it was when he first preached the Gospel, his intent remains to bring about necessary correction.
