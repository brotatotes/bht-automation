# 2 Corinthians 10:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle and his fellow ministers rejected the notion of putting themselves on the same level as those who boasted and commended themselves. They did not dare to measure themselves against them, as it would go against their modesty and humility. The proud individuals, on the other hand, lacked self-awareness and failed to recognize their own limitations. Instead of comparing themselves with others and seeking validation, the apostle and his companions focused on their divine calling and sought to serve diligently in their ministry.
