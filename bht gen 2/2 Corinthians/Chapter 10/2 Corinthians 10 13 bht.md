# 2 Corinthians 10:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul emphasizes the importance of not boasting beyond one's measure. He distinguishes himself from those who compare themselves among themselves, recognizing that his apostolic authority should not be proven by self-evaluation alone. Instead, Paul boasts within the measure or limit of his God-given rule. He acknowledges the role of God in apportioning his ministry and measures his boasting according to the extent of his labors. His intention is not to overextend or exaggerate his accomplishments, but rather to faithfully fulfill the calling and authority God has assigned to him.
