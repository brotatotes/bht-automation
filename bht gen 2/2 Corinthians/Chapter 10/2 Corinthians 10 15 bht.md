# 2 Corinthians 10:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Corinthians had previously boasted about their own accomplishments, without relying on the work of others. However, now that their faith has grown stronger, Paul hopes that he can be supported by them so that he can reach even more people with the Gospel. It is important for the Corinthians to understand that their increased faith will enable Paul to carry out his ministry more abundantly, as they will provide the necessary support for him to go further in spreading the Good News.

### Henry Alford:
1. "Not boasting without measure in other men's labours, but having a hope if your faith grows, to be enlarged among you..."
2. "According to our rule, unto abundance."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Not boasting to unmeasured bounds (that is, not exceeding our own bounds by boasting) of (literally, 'in') other men's labors."
2. "Our success in your case will give us an important step towards further progress beyond you."
3. "We stretch not ourselves beyond our measure."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Not boasting of things without our measure... That required a species of boldness to which he could lay no claim; and he did not assume honor to himself like that." 
2. "So far from this; so far from a desire to enter into the labors of others and quietly enjoying the avails of their industry... I desire to penetrate other untrodden regions; to encounter new dangers; to go where the gospel has not been planted, and to rear other churches there."
3. "When your faith is increased... That we shall be enlarged... he wished them to enlarge or magnify him by introducing him to larger fields of action; by giving him a wider sphere of labor."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Paul means that, as the faith of the Corinthians increases, he hopes that his apostolic efficiency will increase, so that Corinth shall become the basis of larger efforts, extending into other regions."
2. "The verb megalunw also means to praise or celebrate, as Luke 1:46; Acts 5:13; Acts 10:46, and is so explained by some interpreters here. But this would be inconsistent with the figure, to which Paul adheres."
3. "His wider labors will still be regulated by God's measuring - line."

### John Calvin:
1. "Those persons afterwards come forward, and find the road made and the gate open. That they may appear persons of consequence, they impudently claim for themselves what did not of right belong to them, and disparage Paul’s labors."
2. "He again indirectly reproves the Corinthians, because they had stood in the way of his making greater progress in advancing the gospel. For when he says that he hopes that, when their faith is increased the boundaries of his glowing will be enlarged, he intimates, that the weakness of faith under which they labored was the reason, why his career had been somewhat retarded."
3. "To glory in things that have been prepared is equivalent to glorying in the labors of others; for, while Paul had fought the battle, they enjoyed the triumph."

3. "preach the gospel even unto the parts beyond you, and not to glory in another’s line of things made ready to our hand."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In other men's labours (εν αλλοτριοις κοποις). Αλλοτριος means belonging to another as in Luke 16:12. Paul founded the church in Corinth."
2. "As your faith groweth (αυξανομενης της πιστεως). Genitive absolute of the present passive participle of αυξανω, to grow."
3. "We shall be magnified (μεγαλυνθηνα). First aorist passive infinitive of μεγαλυνω, old verb (Luke 1:46) to make great (cf. Philippians 1:20 of Christ). Indirect discourse after ελπιδα (hope) with the construction of ελπιζω, to hope."

### John Gill:
1. "When they boasted of the Corinthians as their converts and children... they did not boast of other men's labours." 
2. "The apostle hoped, for he could not be sure, this lying in the secret will of God, that when the faith of the Corinthians was grown stronger... they should be enlarged through their means." 
3. "The weakness of their faith, and the disorders and divisions that were among them, were a hinderance to the spread of the Gospel."
