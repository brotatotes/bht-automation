# 2 Corinthians 10:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul had a desire to preach the Gospel in areas beyond where it had already been proclaimed. He did not want to boast in someone else's work, but was eager to share the message of Christ in places where it had not yet been heard. His intention was to go to regions where the Gospel had not yet been preached, where there were people who had not yet had the opportunity to know Christ.
