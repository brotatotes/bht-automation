# 2 Corinthians 10:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul reminds us to refrain from boasting in ourselves, our own achievements, or the accomplishments of others. Instead, our only legitimate source of boasting is in the Lord, who is the ultimate provider of grace, strength, and success in all aspects of our lives. This admonition reflects the biblical teaching that our true glory should be found in our knowledge and understanding of God, who exercises loving-kindness, judgment, and righteousness in the earth. Therefore, let us humbly acknowledge that it is only through the Lord's wisdom and power that we can truly find satisfaction and fulfillment in life.
