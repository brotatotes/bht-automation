# 2 Corinthians 10:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who commend themselves are not truly approved by God or good men. Their self-praise is not accepted by God or others, but rather can be repulsive. On the other hand, those who are commended by the Lord are truly approved and honored by Him. He counts them faithful, qualifies them for His service, and makes them fruitful in their ministry. God's testimony and approval of them will be evident, and they will receive the ultimate reward of entering into the joy of the Lord.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Not the self-commender but he whom the Lord commends."
2. "The reason of this being, that not the self-commender but he whom the Lord commends, by selecting him as His instrument...is approved, i.e. really and in the end abiding the test of trial."
3. "ἐκεῖνος brings out the distinction of the man who is δόκιμος."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Whom the Lord commendeth—to whom the Lord has given as His 'Epistle of commendation,' the believers whom he has been the instrument of converting."
2. "Is approved—can stand the test of the final trial. A metaphor from testing metals."
3. "So on the other hand, those finally rejected by the Lord are termed 'reprobate silver.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Is approved - By God. It is no evidence that we shall be saved that we are prone to commend ourselves; see Romans 16:10."
2. "All Christians and all Christian ministers are engaged in a warfare; 2 Corinthians 10:3. They are at war with sin in their own hearts, and with sin wherever it exists on earth, and with the powers of darkness."
3. "The weapons of the Christian are not to be carnal, but are to be spiritual; 2 Corinthians 10:4. He is not to make his way by the exhibition of human passion; in bloody strife; and by acting under the influence of ambitious feelings."

### John Calvin:
1. "For not he that commendeth himself is approved... Let us... aim exclusively at this — that we may be approved by God."
2. "We may be satisfied to have his approbation alone... of more value than all the applauses of the whole world."
3. "The question here is not as to the judgment of mankind, but as to the sentence of God himself, who has it in his power to overturn all the decisions that men have pronounced."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "No wonder that this chapter begins with an apology for indulging in self-commendation, since the former one ended with a condemnation of those who dealt with it."
2. "Feeling it to be in the last degree distasteful, the apostle proceeds to state why it had been forced upon him, and in doing so he is led into such details of his personal history as are of extreme interest, and nowhere else even alluded to such as to make us glad of the unwelcome necessity of self-praise."


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Is approved  (δοκιμος). Accepted (from δεχομα) by the Lord. The Lord accepts his own recommendation (συνιστησιν, see on 2 Corinthians 3:1). 

### John Gill:
1. "Such persons are neither approved by God, nor good men; for their own self-commendation stands for nothing, and is so far from being acceptable to God or men, that it must be nauseous and disagreeable."
2. "They are approved by God and men, and they are such whom he highly honours, as he did Paul, by counting them faithful; and putting them into the ministry, by qualifying them for his service, by assisting them in it, and making them abundantly useful for the good of souls, and the glory of his name."
3. "By all which he bears a testimony to them, and shows his approbation of them, and at last will say, well done, good and faithful servant, enter into the joy of thy Lord."
