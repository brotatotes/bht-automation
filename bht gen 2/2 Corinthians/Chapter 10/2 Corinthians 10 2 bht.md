# 2 Corinthians 10:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In his letter, the writer pleads with the recipients to behave in such a way that he would not have to assert his authority boldly when he is with them. He asks them not to force him into a position where he has to be strong and decisive. Some of the people he is writing to falsely accuse him of being weak and guided by worldly motives. They do not understand that the writer's intentions are rooted in the meekness and gentleness of Christ.
