# 2 Corinthians 10:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As believers, we live in this physical world, subject to its limitations and weaknesses. However, our battle is not fought on earthly terms. The weapons we wield as followers of Christ are not of this world. Our struggle is against the spiritual forces of darkness and sin, which seek to destroy us. The apostle Paul, in particular, emphasizes this truth. Though he also lived in the physical realm, his warfare was in the realm of the spirit. His authority and experiences are the basis for his teaching, which challenges the false accusations of his opponents.

2. "Moreover, though we WALK in it, we do not WAR according to it."
3. "They who accuse us of walking after the flesh, shall find [to their cost] that we do not war after the flesh; therefore compel us not to use our weapons."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Though we walk in the flesh...the best of people are subject to these needs and frailties; the best of people are liable to err."
2. "We do not war after the flesh...the warfare in which Paul was himself engaged as an apostle; and the idea is, that he went forth as a soldier under the great Captain of his salvation to fight his battles and to make conquests for him."
3. "The warfare of Christians relates to the following points: ...with the powers of darkness; the mighty spirits of evil that seek to destroy us...with sin in all forms; with idolatry, sensuality, corruption, intemperance, profaneness, wherever they may exist."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "Walking in the flesh means here — living in the world; or, as he expresses it elsewhere, being at home in the body."
2. "There is here again a kind of concession, which, at the same time, is of no service to his adversaries. Those war according to the flesh, who attempt nothing but in dependence upon worldly resources, in which alone, too, they glory. They have not their confidence placed in the government and guidance of the Holy Spirit. Paul declares that he is not one of this class, inasmuch as he is furnished with other weapons than those of the flesh and the world."

3. "Which is not done 'after the flesh'; in such a manner as the men of the world wage war with one another...but in a spiritual way, with all simplicity and disinterested views, with great courage and intrepidity of mind."

### John Wesley:
1. "Though we walk in the flesh...Yet we do not war...After the flesh."
