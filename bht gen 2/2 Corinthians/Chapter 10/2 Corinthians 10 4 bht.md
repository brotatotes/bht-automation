# 2 Corinthians 10:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The power of the weapons in our Christian warfare does not come from our own strength, but from God alone. These spiritual weapons, such as the Scriptures and the word of God, are mighty and effective, capable of dismantling the strongholds of sin and Satan. Through faith and prayer, we can engage in this battle and rely on the power of God's word to tear down the walls that separate us from Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

2. "The efficacy of the Christian religion proves its truth."
3. "The inspired servants of God inherit the commission of the Old Testament prophets."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The weapons of our warfare...are not carnal...They are not such as derive advantage from any power inherent in themselves." 
2. "Their strength is derived from God alone...They are rendered mighty or powerful by the agency of God...The sense is, that God is the author of the doctrines which we preach, and that he attends them with the agency of his Spirit, and accompanies them to the hearts of people."
3. "All those obstacles are strongly fortified...The sins of his heart...the wickedness of the world...the idolatry of the world...the opinions of the world...The whole world is fortified against Christianity...the warfare is to be waged against every strongly fortified place of error and of sin. These strong fortifications of error and of sin are to be battered down and laid in ruins by our spiritual weapons."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The idea of weakness attaches to that of fleshliness."

### John Calvin:
1. "The life of a Christian, it is true, is a perpetual warfare, for whoever gives himself to the service of God will have no truce from Satan at any time, but will be harassed with incessant disquietude."
2. "For we must take this into account, that the gospel is like a fire, by which the fury of Satan is en-kindled. Hence it cannot but be that he will arm himself for a contest, whenever he sees that it is advanced."
3. "There is nothing in the world so strongly fortified as to be beyond his power to overthrow...A servant of Christ should dread nothing, however formidable, that may stand up in opposition to his doctrine. Let him, in spite of it, persevere, and he will scatter to the winds every machination of whatever sort."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The weapons of our warfare is campaign and not army as some MSS. have."
2. "This dative of personal interest (ethical dative) can be like αστειος τω θεω, in God's eyes, as it looks to God."
3. "Καθαιρεσις is old word from καθαιρεω, to take down, to tear down walls and buildings. Carries on the military metaphor."

### John Gill:
1. "The 'weapons' with which this warfare is managed are the Scriptures of truth, the sword of the Spirit, the word of God."
2. "Now these weapons are not carnal; such as the men of the world fight with, not the temporal sword; but mighty through God: powerful and effectual through the blessing of God, and the influences of his grace and Spirit."
3. "By strong holds are meant, the strong holds of sin and Satan; such as unbelief, pride, hardness of heart, with which the heart of man is walled against God and Christ, and the Gospel of the grace of God."

### John Wesley:
1. "For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but spiritual, and therefore mighty to the throwing down of strong holds."
2. "Though faith and prayer belong also to the Christian armour, yet the word of God seems to be here chiefly intended."
