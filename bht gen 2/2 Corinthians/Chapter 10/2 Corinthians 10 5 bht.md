# 2 Corinthians 10:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The preaching of the word disproves and silences every false understanding of the Gospel and demolishes all lofty structures of human reasoning that oppose the knowledge of God. It brings every aspect of our thinking and understanding into submission and obedience to Christ. As a result, our minds are no longer governed by our own wisdom and self-confidence, but by the divine light that helps us see Christ as the only true Savior. We willingly surrender our own authority and wholly devote ourselves to carrying out the obedience of faith to Christ.

2. "And every lofty edifice (fortress or tower) which is being raised (or, raising itself) against the knowledge of God, and leading captive every intent of the mind into subjection to Christ."

2. "Hence we must set out with this, that he who is wise must become a fool, that is, we must give up our own understanding, and renounce the wisdom of the flesh, and thus we must present our minds to Christ empty that he may fill them."
3. "Now the form of expression must be observed, when he says, that he brings every thought into captivity, for it is as though he had said, that the liberty of the human mind must be restrained and bridled, that it may not be wise, apart from the doctrine of Christ."
