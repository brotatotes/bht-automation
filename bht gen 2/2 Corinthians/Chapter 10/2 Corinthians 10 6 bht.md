# 2 Corinthians 10:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle Paul emphasizes his preparedness to take action against those who have disobeyed the teachings of Christ, ready to exercise both spiritual censure and even miraculous punishments if necessary. He clarifies that this is not an immediate response but will happen once the majority of the church has shown their obedience. The intention is not to punish the innocent along with the guilty, but rather to ensure that the sound and faithful members of the church are distinguished from those who require discipline.

2. "He does not mention any persons not the disobedient, but every (case of) disobedience, and throws out ὑμεῖς into strong relief, as charitably embracing all, or nearly all, those to whom he was writing."
3. "More complete ignorance of the Apostle’s style, and non-appreciation of the fine edge of his hortatory irony, can hardly be evinced, than this."
