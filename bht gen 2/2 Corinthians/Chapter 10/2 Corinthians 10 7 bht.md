# 2 Corinthians 10:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do not make judgments based solely on outward appearances. Consider that just as someone claims to belong to Christ, so do we. Instead of boasting about ourselves, let us reflect on our own actions and motivations before passing judgment on others.
