# 2 Corinthians 10:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If I were to boast even more of our authority, I would have no reason to be ashamed, as I would be able to back up my claims. This authority, given by the Lord himself, was not meant to tear down but to build up the church. It is a power conferred for the purpose of edifying and preserving the community of believers. I can confidently say that I will not be put to shame, for I have faithfully exercised this divine commission.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Even more boasting than he had ever yet made of his apostolic power, would not disgrace him, but would be borne out by the fact."
2. "somewhat more abundantly concerning our power which the Lord has given for building you up and not for pulling you down."
3. "I shall not be put to shame."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For even if I were to boast somewhat more exceedingly (than I do, :-) of our (apostolic) authority... I should not be put to shame." 
2. "For building up...not for casting down...though we 'cast down reasonings,' this is not in order to destroy, but really to build up ('edify'), by removing those things which are hindrances to edification, and testing what is unsound, and putting together all that is true in the building."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If I should make even higher claims than I have done to a divine commission. I could urge higher evidence that I am sent by the Lord Jesus."
2. "A power primarily conferred to build up his people and save them and not to destroy."
3. "A power that has in fact been employed in extending religion and edifying the church."

### John Calvin:
1. "He anticipates an objection, because he does not fail to speak of his own glory, while at the same time he refrains from making farther mention of it, that the Corinthians may understand, that, if he boasts, it is against his will, as in truth the false Apostles constrained him to it; otherwise he would not have done so."
2. "In the mean time, there is an implied contrast between his power, and that in which the false apostles gloried — which was of such a nature that the Corinthians received no advantage from it, and experienced no edification."
3. "It is well known, who they are, on whom God has conferred this power, and in what way he has limited the power he has given. Those exercise it in a proper manner, who faithfully obey his commandment."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For though I should glory somewhat more abundantly of our authority, which the Lord gave for building you up, and not for casting you down..." 
2. "Two reasons are given for this: it was an authority gifted by the Lord of the Church, and it was given for rearing up the Church."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Somewhat abundantly (περισσοτερον τ). Comparative, 'somewhat more abundantly' than I have, in order to show that he is as true a minister of Christ as his accusers are."
2. "Concessive (conditional) clause of third class. For εαν τε see Romans 14:8."
3. "I shall not be put to shame (ουκ αισχυνθησομα). As a convicted impostor or pretentious boaster (Plummer). First future passive, singular number (not literary plural as in verse 2 Corinthians 10:7)."

### John Gill:
1. "For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority...should he boast of a greater authority than the false apostles, or even than the true ministers of the Gospel...he should not exceed the bounds of truth and modesty."
2. "a power which no mere man, no creature, though ever so exalted, could have given...none but Christ, who is Lord of heaven and earth, and who has all power in his hands, could clothe with such authority as this."
3. "this authority was exercised...for the edification of the one, or the other, and the preservation of the whole...he should be able to make good such an assertion, should he think fit to mention it."

### John Wesley:
1. I should not be ashamed — As having said more than I could make good.
