# 2 Corinthians 10:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul is careful to clarify that his purpose in boasting of his apostolic power is not to intimidate the Corinthians with empty threats. Instead, he wants to assure them that his power is real and that he is capable of following through with his actions. He chooses to refrain from boasting excessively in order to avoid coming across as intimidating or threatening. Paul seeks to strike a balance between asserting his authority and maintaining a gentle and nurturing approach towards the Corinthians.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "To suppose the purpose of Paul’s boast of apostolic power being borne out, to be merely ἵνα μὴ δόξω, &c., would be out of keeping with the importance of the fact. So that ἵνα μὴ δόξω is much better taken subjectively I say this, because I wish not to seem, &c." 
2. "ὡς ἄν in later Greek, has the sense of ‘quasi, tanquam,’ ἄν losing its proper force, in a commonly current expression; and the sense is much the same as that of ὡς alone." 
3. "διὰ τῶν ἐπιστολῶν] He had written two before this, see 1 Corinthians 5:9; but this is not necessarily here implied: for he may reckon this which he is now writing. Still less can we infer hence that a third had been written before this (Bleek)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "I do not threaten more than I can perform. I have it in my power to execute all that I have threatened, and to strike an awe not only by my letters, but by the infliction of extraordinary miraculous punishments."
3. "And if I should boast that I had done this, and could do it again, I should have no reason to be ashamed. It would not be vain and empty boasting; not boasting which is not well-founded."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. That I may not seem. The construction is abrupt. Probably something is to be supplied, as I say this in order that I may not seem, etc.

### John Calvin:
1. "No objection is advanced against him that should either destroy or weaken his credit, and that of his doctrine, for deeds were not to be less valued than words."
