# 2 Corinthians 11:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle earnestly wishes that the Corinthians would patiently listen to his self-defense, understanding that it is necessary for the sake of God's honor and the well-being of the church. He asks for their patience because he is compelled to speak about himself, which may seem vain and foolish. However, he emphasizes that if he does not defend himself, his reputation and the church itself would be greatly endangered. Thus, his plea is not to be seen as folly, but as a vital act of guarding the truth and the glory of Christ.
