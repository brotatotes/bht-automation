# 2 Corinthians 11:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Apostle Paul is being questioned about his decision to not accept anything from the Corinthians, and some may accuse him of not loving them as the reason behind it. However, the truth is that Paul affirms that he does indeed love them, and he appeals to God as a witness to his genuine affection for them. His refusal to accept anything is not out of a lack of love, but for a different reason altogether.
