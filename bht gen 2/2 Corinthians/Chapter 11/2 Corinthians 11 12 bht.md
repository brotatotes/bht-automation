# 2 Corinthians 11:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By continuing to do what I do, I am cutting off any opportunity for those who want to criticize me and misrepresent my motives. My intention is to remove any reason for them to accuse me. They boast in their self-sufficiency, but they need to be found in the same position as me, not relying on others and boasting only in the Lord. Their boasting is empty, unlike the apostle's reliance on God.
