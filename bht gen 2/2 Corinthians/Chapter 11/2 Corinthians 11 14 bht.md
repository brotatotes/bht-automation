# 2 Corinthians 11:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Satan, the prince of darkness, has the ability to transform himself into an angel of light. He disguises himself as a good angel who dwells in the realms of light and possesses divine understanding. Satan's deceptive nature is revealed through the way he presents himself as a friend, while his true intentions are to cause destruction. He cunningly leads others astray by presenting evil deeds as good, using the guise of truth to introduce falsehoods and religious practices that are contrary to God's will.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "transforms himself" (compare  :-); habitually;
2. "Himself" is emphatical: If their master
	himself, who is the "prince of darkness," the most
	alien to light, does so, it is less marvellous in the case of them
	who are his servants (Luke 22:54;
	Ephesians 6:12).

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Since Satan himself is capable of appearing to be an angel of light, it is not to be deemed strange that those who are in his service also should resemble him."

3. "It is also to be observed that in the Septuagint the usage is limited to the enemy of man, as is that of diabolov devil by which Satan is translated."

### John Calvin:
1. "If Satan, who is the basest of all beings, nay, the head and chief of all wicked persons, transforms himself, what will his ministers do?"
