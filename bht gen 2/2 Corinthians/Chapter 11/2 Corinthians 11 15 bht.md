# 2 Corinthians 11:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It should come as no surprise that false teachers disguise themselves as ministers of righteousness, since even Satan himself can appear as an angel of light. These deceivers imitate faithful preachers of the Gospel, mixing their corrupt teachings with the true message of God's righteousness. Despite their facade of righteousness, these individuals are actually serving Satan's interests and spreading his kingdom of darkness. However, their end will ultimately be determined by their works, and not by their outward appearances.
