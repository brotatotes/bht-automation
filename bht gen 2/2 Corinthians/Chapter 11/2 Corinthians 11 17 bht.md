# 2 Corinthians 11:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul acknowledges that he did not speak as an apostle or by the explicit authority of the Lord in this matter. However, he reveals that his intention was not to boast by his own accord, but rather to contrast himself with the false apostles in order to humble them. Despite the departure from the example of the Lord, Paul's actions were necessitated by the circumstances at hand, and he acknowledges that this boasting may appear foolish to some.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In pursuance, i.e. in this case, of θεοπνευστία from above: not as in 1 Corinthians 7:10; 1 Corinthians 7:25; 1 Corinthians 7:40.".
2. "As it were in folly, i.e. ‘putting myself into the situation, and speaking the words of a foolish man vaunting of himself.’".
3. "In this present confidence, not as Chrys. ‘subject,’ ‘this subject of boasting,’ ἵνα μὴ νομίσῃς πανταχοῦ ἀνοηταίνειν αὐτόν, (Hom. xxiv. p. 607) and so al.: but the sense would be insipid in the last degree: nor could such a meaning well be expressed without γε, ἐν ταύτῃ γε τῇ ὑπ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Even this boasting, though undesirable in itself, was permitted by the Spirit, taking into account its aim, namely, to draw off the Corinthians from their false teachers to the apostle."
2. "Therefore this passage gives no proof that any portion of Scripture is uninspired."
3. "It merely guards against his boasting being made a justification of boasting in general, which is not ordinarily 'after the Lord,' that is, consistent with Christian humility."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I do not speak this imitating the example of the Lord Jesus or strictly as becomes his follower."
2. "I admit that it is a departure from his pure example in this respect."
3. "Paul admitted that what he said was not in exact accordance with the spirit of the Lord Jesus; and in admitting this he designed probably to administer a delicate hint that all their boasting was a wide departure from that spirit."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Confidence [υποστασει] . See on ch. 2 Corinthians 9:4.

### John Calvin:
1. "At the same time, the things that Paul confesses respecting himself, he, on the other hand, condemns in the false Apostles."
2. "For it was not his intention to praise himself, but simply to contrast himself with them, with the view of humbling them."
3. "Hence he transfers to his own person what belonged to them, that he may thus open the eyes of the Corinthians."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Not after the Lord (ου κατα Κυριον). Not after the example of the Lord."
2. "He had appealed to the example of Christ in 2 Corinthians 10:1 (the meekness and gentleness of Christ)."
3. "Paul's conduct here, he admits, is not in keeping with that. But circumstances force him on."

### John Gill:
1. "This he declares he spoke not as from the Lord, but of himself... I speak it not after the Lord... his sense is, that he did not then speak as an apostle, or one sent by Christ; he put off this character for the present, and took that of a fool upon him." 
2. "He did not pretend to any express command from Christ for so doing, or that he acted in imitation of him, who was meek and lowly... but was obliged to it, through the boasts of the false apostles; which though it was not criminal and unlawful, but necessary, right, and proper, considering the reasons of it."
3. "Yet viewing the form and manner of this boasting, without attending to the circumstances of it, it had the appearance of folly."

### John Wesley:
1. "I speak not after the Lord — Not by an express command from Him."
2. "Not by an express command from Him; though still under the direction of His Spirit."
3. "But as it were foolishly — In such a manner as many may think foolish."
