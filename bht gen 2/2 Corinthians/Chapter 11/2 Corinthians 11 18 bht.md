# 2 Corinthians 11:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Many people boast in their fleshly accomplishments and external advantages, just as the false teachers in Corinth did. In response, the Apostle Paul also chooses to boast in these things, not because he finds value in them, but to demonstrate that he is not inferior to them in these areas. However, Paul's true boasting lies in his endurance and sufferings for the sake of Christ, rather than in worldly achievements.
