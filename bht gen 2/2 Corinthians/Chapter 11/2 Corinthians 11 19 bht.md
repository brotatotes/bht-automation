# 2 Corinthians 11:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is a beautiful irony that the Corinthians, who prided themselves on their wisdom, were able to bear with fools gladly. They not only tolerated foolishness but actually took pleasure in it. This was surprising, as true wisdom would not derive delight from the company of fools. Yet, in their arrogance, they indulged in such folly and found joy in it.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
