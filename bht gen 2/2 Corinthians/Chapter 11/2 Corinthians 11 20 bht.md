## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "That such violence might literally be expected from the rulers of the early Christian society, is also implied in the command in 1 Timothy 3:3, Titus 1:7, that the ‘bishop’ is not to be ‘a striker.’"
2. "Even so late as the seventh century the council of Braga (c. 7), A.D. 675, orders that no bishop at his will and pleasure shall strike his clergy, lest he lose the respect which they owe him."
3. "This is put as the climax of forbearance."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Ye may well 'bear with' fools; for ye even 'bear with' oppressors."
2. "Take of you... catches you."
3. "Smite you on the face... the height of insolence on their part, and of servile endurance on yours."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If a man bring you into bondage - [...] The idea is, doubtless, that the false teachers set up a lordship over their consciences; destroyed their freedom of opinion; and made them subservient to their will. They really took away their Christian freedom as much as if they had been slaves."
2. "If a man devour you - [...] False teachers are always rapacious. They seek the property, not the souls of those to whom they minister. Not satisfied with a maintenance, they aim to obtain all, and their plans are formed to secure as much as possible of those to whom they minister."
3. "If a man smite you on the face - [...] The idea here is, if anyone treats you with contumely and scorn - since there can be no higher expression of it than to strike a man on the face."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Bringeth you into bondage [καταδουλοι] . Only here and Galatians 2:4, where it is used of the efforts of the Jewish party to bring the christian Church under the ceremonial law." 
2. "Take [λαμβανει] . A. V. supplies of you, evidently with reference to property, which has already been touched upon in devour. The meaning is to take as a prey, as Luke 5:5." 
3. "Exalteth himself [επαιρεται] . As ch. 10 5. It is noticeable that these are the only two instances out of nineteen in the New Testament where the word is used figuratively."

### John Calvin:
1. "You bear with every thing from others, if they oppress you, if they demand what belongs to you, if they treat you disdainfully. Why then will you not bear with me, as they are in no respect superior to me?"
2. "For as to his saying that he is not weak, he means that he had been endowed by God with such excellent graces, that he ought not to be looked upon as of the common order."
3. "Those very persons are all at once in an uproar, in opposition to the fatherly and truly salutary reproofs of their pastors, who, on the other hand, had formerly swallowed down quietly every kind of insult, even the most atrocious, from the monks."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The five things here said to be borne with are clearly just the things which the Corinthians had suffered those deceitful workers to do against himself..."
2. "...if he bringeth you into bondage tyrannizing over them, if he devoureth you alluding to their mercenary ministrations, if he taketh you captive making slaves of you to do their bidding, if he exalteth himself in his pride..."
3. "...if he smiteth you on the face a figurative way of saying ‘treats you insolently.’ All this rude and injurious treatment of one to whom they owed their conversion to Christ they were quietly putting up with."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "You tolerate tyranny, extortion, craftiness, arrogance, violence, and insult" (Plummer).
2. "Sarcasm that cut to the bone."
3. "The climax of insult, smiting on the face."

### John Gill:
1. "They not only suffered and tolerated the foolish boasting of these men with pleasure, but patiently and stupidly bore their oppressions, injuries, and insults..."
2. "They were voluntarily led captive, and brought into bondage... to the yoke of the ceremonial law, to the observance of circumcision, meats and drinks, days, months, times and years..."
3. "Though they devoured their houses, as the Pharisees did; ate up their substance, were insatiable in their covetousness; were greedy dogs that could never have enough, could not satisfy their voracious appetites..."
