# 2 Corinthians 11:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Paul addresses the Corinthians, he expresses his irony towards those who criticize him for not engaging in self-exaltation like the false teachers who oppressed them. He acknowledges the reproach and contempt thrown at him, sarcastically admitting his weakness, suggesting that he is not as qualified or talented as they claim. However, he asserts that these accusations are unjust, emphasizing that he possesses every qualification and honor that these false teachers boast of. Despite the irony, Paul brings a message of strength and boldness, ready to show that he is equal to them in every way.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "An ironical reminiscence of his own abstinence when among them from all these acts of self-exaltation at their expense, q. d. (ironically), ‘I feel that I am much letting myself down by the confession that  I was too weak ever to do any of these things among you.’ This I believe with Schrader, De Wette, and Meyer, to be the only satisfactory rendering."
2. "But (1) can hardly be, seeing that λέγω below and λαλῶ 2Co 11:23 have a forward reference."
3. "It may be doubted whether ὡς ὅτι ever can mean 'as though,' even in ref. 2 Thess."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "An ironical reminiscence of his own abstinence when among them from all these acts of self-exaltation at their expense" (as if such abstinence was weakness) [ALFORD].
2. The "we" is emphatically contrasted with the false teachers who so oppressively displayed their power. I speak so as though WE had been weak when with you, because we did not show our power this way.
3. Howbeit (we are not really weak; for), whereinsoever any is bold . . . I am bold also.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I have been speaking of reproach or disgrace as if I was weak, that is, as if I was disposed to admit as true all that has been said of me as reproachful or disgraceful; all that has been said of my lack of qualifications for the office, of my lack of talent, or elevated rank, or honorable birth, etc."
2. "But it is not so. Whatever they have I have. Whatever they can boast of, I can boast of in a more eminent degree."
3. "I am ready to compare myself with them. Whatever they have to boast of I am prepared also to show that I am equal to them."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Yes, you have borne with these enslavers and devourers and smiters. I could never ask you to extend such toleration to me."
2. "I speak as one without position or authority, having shown myself weak as you know."
3. "Yet, even speaking in this foolish way, I possess every qualification on which they plume themselves."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul had asked, why the Corinthians showed more respect to others than to him, while he had not been by any means weak, that is, contemptible."
2. "He now confirms this, because, if a comparison had been entered upon, he would not have been inferior to any one in any department of honor."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I refer now to the reproach cast upon me, as a 'weak' preacher, because, forsooth, I showed none of that proud and insolent bearing which they do. But I can be as bold as they, and with better reason too."
2. "Now follows that incomparable burst of indignant eloquence, embodying particulars of his history or rather bare allusions to facts in his apostolic history extending over some twelve or fourteen years, without any of those details which we should so gladly have had."

2. "...if possible their eyes might be opened to see through them, and discard them..."
3. "...to the full confutation of all the pride, vanity, blind boasting of the false apostles."

### John Wesley:
1. "I speak with regard to reproach, as though we had been weak — I say, 'Bear with me,' even on supposition that the weakness be real which they reproach me with."
