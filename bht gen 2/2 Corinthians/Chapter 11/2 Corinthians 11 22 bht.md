# 2 Corinthians 11:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The adversaries in question took pride in their heritage, claiming to be Hebrews, Israelites, and the seed of Abraham. In response, the apostle Paul asserts that he too shares in these esteemed titles, highlighting his equal standing in terms of nationality and lineage. His confident declaration challenges their boasting and establishes his own credibility in the discussion at hand.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The three honourable appellations with which the adversaries magnified themselves, resting on their Jewish extraction, are arranged so as to form a climax." 
2. "·ºôŒ≤œÅŒ±·øñŒøŒπ refers to the nationality, ·º∏œÉœÅŒ±Œ∑Œª·øñœÑŒ±Œπ to the theocracy, and œÉœÄŒ≠œÅŒºŒ± ·ºàŒ≤œÅ to the claim to a part in the Messiah."
3. "The interrogative form of the sentence is much more lively and consistent with the spirit of the context than the affirmative."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Hebrews," referring to the language and nationality; "Israelites," to the theocracy and descent from Israel, the "prince who prevailed with God." 
2. "The seed of Abraham," to the claim to a share in the Messiah.
3. "An Hebrew of the Hebrews," not an Hellenist or Greek-speaking Jew, but a Hebrew in tongue, and sprung from Hebrews.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Their boast would probably be that they were the descendants of the patriarchs; that the land of the prophets was theirs; that they spake the language in which the oracles of God were given; that the true religion had proceeded from them, etc."
2. "Paul had all their advantages of birth. He was an Israelite; of rite honored tribe of Benjamin; a Pharisee, circumcised at the usual time..."
3. "Paul in the passage before us means to say that he had as good a claim to the honor of being a native-born descendant of Israel as could be urged by any of them."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Hebrews. See on Acts 6:1. Israelites. See on Acts 3:12, and compare Philippians 3:5, and the phrase Israel of God, Galatians 6:16, and an Israelite indeed, John 1:48."
2. "Seed of Abraham. Compare Matthew 3:9; John 8:33; Romans 9:7; Romans 11:1; Galatians 3:16; Hebrews 2:16."
3. "The three names are arranged climactically, Hebrews pointing to the nationality; Israelites to the special relation to God's covenant; seed of Abraham to the messianic privilege. Compare with the whole, Philippians 3:4, Philippians 3:5."

### John Calvin:
1. "If they boast of illustrious descent, I shall be on a level with them, for I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham." 
2. "This is a silly and empty boast, and yet Paul makes use of three terms to express it; nay more, he specifies, as it were, three different marks of excellence." 
3. "By this repetition, in my opinion, he indirectly reproves their folly, inasmuch as they placed the sum-total of their excellence in a thing that was so trivial, and this boasting was incessantly in their mouth, so as to be absolutely disgusting, as vain men are accustomed to pour forth empty bravadoes as to a mere nothing."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Are they Hebrews?... so am I." 
2. "Are they Israelites?... so am I."
3. "Are they the seed of Abraham and heirs of the great Abrahamic promise?... so am I."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  So am I  (Œ∫Œ±Œ≥œâ). This is his triumphant refrain with each challenge. 

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle in this verse makes mention of being the seed of Abraham, as a distinct character from that of Hebrews."
2. "This is to be understood here in a natural sense, and of being of Abraham's seed in the line of Jacob, for otherwise the Ishmaelites and Idumeans were of the seed of Abraham; but they were his seed in that line in which the promised seed, the Messiah, was to come."
3. "However, the apostle was equal to them in this respect; he was of the seed of Abraham according to the flesh, and above them in another, in that he was of Abraham's spiritual seed by faith in Christ Jesus."

### John Wesley:
1. Are they Hebrews, Israelites, the seed of Abraham ‚Äî These were the heads on which they boasted.
