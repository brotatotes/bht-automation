# 2 Corinthians 11:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul proclaims his superiority over others in terms of his ministry, declaring that he is more faithful, self-denying, and rich in tokens of God's recognition. He substantiates his claim by highlighting the intensity of his labors, sufferings, and near-death experiences. Such accomplishments place him in a higher degree of ministerial excellence, surpassing even the apostles themselves. Despite the audacity of his assertion, Paul's extraordinary dedication and sacrifice for the cause of Christ are undeniable.
