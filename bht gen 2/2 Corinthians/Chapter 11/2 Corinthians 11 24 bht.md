# 2 Corinthians 11:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle endured great suffering, being subjected to Jewish floggings multiple times. These floggings were severe, as the Jews followed the law strictly and gave him the maximum punishment of forty stripes save one. This showed their cruelty and malice towards him. Despite his Roman privilege, he didn't escape mistreatment from the Jews.
