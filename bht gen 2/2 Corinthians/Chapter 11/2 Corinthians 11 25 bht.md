# 2 Corinthians 11:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Thrice I have been shipwrecked, experiences that are not mentioned in detail in the Acts of the Apostles. These shipwrecks occurred prior to Paul's journey to Rome. Additionally, he mentions spending a night and a day in the deep, which likely refers to the time he spent adrift, either swimming or floating on some part of the vessel.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The beating by Roman magistrates at Philippi (Acts 16:23) is the only one recorded in Acts, which does not profess to give a complete journal of his life, but only a sketch of it in connection with the design of the book, namely, to give an outline of the history of the Gospel Church from its foundation at Jerusalem, to the period of its reaching Rome, the capital of the Gentile world."
2. "Once was I stoned— (Acts 16:23- :). Thrice . . . shipwreck—before the shipwreck at Melita (Acts 16:23- :). Probably in some of his voyages from Tarsus, where he stayed for some time after his conversion, and from which, as being a seafaring place, he was likely to make missionary voyages to adjoining places (Acts 9:30; Acts 11:25; Galatians 1:21)."
3. "A night and a day . . . in the deep—probably in part swimming or in an open boat."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Thrice was I beaten with rods - In the Acts of the Apostles there is mention made of his being beaten in this manner but once before the time when this Epistle was written."
2. "Once I was stoned - This was the usual mode of punishment among the Jews for blasphemy."
3. "Thrice I suffered shipwreck - On what occasions, or where, is now unknown, as these instances are not referred to in the Acts of the Apostles."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Thrice I suffered shipwreck. The shipwreck at Malta, being later, is, of course, not referred to; so that no one of these three is on record."
2. "A night and a day [νυχθημερον]. A compound term occurring only here in the New Testament, and rarely in later Greek."
3. "Lit., I have made (spent) a night and a day in the deep. For a similar use of poiew to make, see Acts 14:33; Acts 18:23; Acts 20:3; James 4:13. buqov bottom or depth occurs only here. Of the event itself there is no record."

### John Calvin:
1. "Thrice was I beaten with rods... the Apostle suffered many things, of which no mention is made by Luke; for he makes mention of only one stoning, one scourging, and one shipwreck."
2. "While the narrative contained in the Acts of the Apostles gives an account of only one instance in which Paul was actually stoned, there was, previously to that, 'an assault' made upon Paul and Barnabas at Iconium, 'both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews, with their rulers, to use them despitefully, and to stone them, but they were ware of it, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe."
3. "Truth is necessarily consistent; but it is scarcely possible that independent accounts, not having truth to guide them, should thus advance to the very brink of contradiction without falling into it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Thrice was I beaten with rods. This was the Roman mode of scourging, and this also sometimes issued in death."
2. "Once was I stoned. This was at Lystra (Acts 14:19), when he was 'supposed to be dead.'"
3. "Thrice I suffered shipwreck. How often he went from place to place by sea we cannot tell, but as five times are mentioned in Acts, there were probably several more sea voyages, at some of which this no doubt took place, a night and a day have I been in the deep (or, the length of a full day) clinging to some plank and escaping with difficulty."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Thrice was I beaten with rods (τρις ερραβδισθην). Roman (Gentile) punishment. It was forbidden to Roman citizens by the Lex Porcia, but Paul endured it in Philippi."
2. "Once was I stoned (απαξ ελιθασθην). Once for all απαξ means. At Lystra."
3. "Have I been in the deep (εν τω βυθω πεποιηκα). Vivid dramatic perfect active indicative of ποιεω, 'I have done a night and day in the deep.' The memory of it survives like a nightmare."

### John Gill:
1. "Thrice was I beaten with rods...by the Romans; for this was a Roman punishment, distinct from scourging with cords used by the Jews."
2. "Thrice I suffered shipwreck; neither of which are mentioned by Luke in the Acts of the Apostles."
3. "A night and a day I have been in the deep; some understand this of a well, called 'Bythos', or 'the deep', which was near Lystra, where the apostle was hid for such a space of time after his deliverance there."

### John Wesley:
1. Thrice I have been shipwrecked — Before his voyage to Rome.In the deep — Probably floating on some part of the vessel.
