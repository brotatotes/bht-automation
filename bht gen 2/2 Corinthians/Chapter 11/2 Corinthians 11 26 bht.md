# 2 Corinthians 11:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In his many journeys, the apostle Paul encountered various perils. These included dangers from rivers with their violent floods that could pose a threat to his life. Additionally, he faced perils from his own countrymen, the Jews, who harbored hatred towards him. Furthermore, he experienced perils in the cities he visited, often from false brethren who claimed to be believers but were actually opponents. It is evident that Paul’s ministry involved not only physical risks but also challenges from his own people and deceitful individuals who sought to hinder his work.
