# 2 Corinthians 11:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle faced weariness and painfulness as his laborious efforts were often troublesome and burdensome. He endured many sleepless nights, whether from preaching, praying, or singing psalms. In addition, he experienced the discomfort of cold and nakedness during his travels in harsh winter conditions. Despite these hardships, he remained steadfast and unashamed, fearlessly appearing before noblemen, governors, and even kings. He had no place to call home, and his clothing often left him lacking. But through it all, he carried himself with dignity and without shame.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "By labour and weariness, by watchings frequently, by hunger and thirst, by fastings frequently."
2. "Voluntary fastings, 'ad purificandam mentem et edomandam carnem.'"
3. "In cold and nakedness, insufficient clothing."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The context refers solely to hardships, not to self-imposed devotional mortification."
2. "'Hunger and thirst' are not synonymous with 'foodlessness' (as the Greek of 'fasting' means), but are its consequences."
3. "When we remember that he who endured all this was a man constantly suffering from infirm health, such heroic self-devotion seems almost superhuman."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In weariness - Resulting from traveling, exposure, labor, and want."
2. "And painfulness - This word is a stronger term than the former. It implies painful effort; labor producing sorrow."
3. "In watchings often - In loss of sleep, arising from abundant toils and from danger."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Watchings. See on ch. 2 Corinthians 6:5.

### John Calvin:
1. "By fastings I understand those that are voluntary, as he has spoken previously of hunger and want. Such were the tokens by which he showed himself, and on good grounds, to be an eminent servant of Christ."
2. "That man, therefore, who will be signalized by so many marks of distinction, will not despise those that are less illustrious, and less thoroughly tried, nor will he on that account be elated with pride; but still, whenever there is occasion for it, he will be prepared, after Paul's example, to exult with a holy triumph, in opposition to pretenders and worthless persons, provided he has an eye to Christ, not to himself."
3. "For the main thing is - that we serve Christ with a pure conscience. All other things are, as it were, additional."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "in labour and travail, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst"
2. "in fastings often not voluntary fastings, which he would not mention as a privation he had endured, but in the sense of the next clause"
3. "in cold and nakedness such as he would doubtless often experience in his travels through inhospitable regions"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In labour and travail (κοπω κα μοχθω). Both old words for severe work, combined here as in 1 Thessalonians 2:9; 2 Thessalonians 3:8, 'by toil and moil' (Plummer)."
2. "The rest of the list is like the items in 2 Corinthians 6:4."
3. "See the picture of the aged Paul later in the Roman dungeon (2 Timothy 4:9-18)."

### John Gill:
1. "In weariness and painfulness...the labours of the apostle were painful and troublesome to the flesh." 
2. "In watchings often; being sometimes engaged at midnight, either in preaching, or praying, or staging psalms."
3. "In cold and nakedness; when travelling in the winter season, and but poorly clothed to keep him from the inclemencies of the weather."

1. "Having no place where to lay my head; no convenient raiment to cover me."
2. "Yet appearing before noble-men, governors, kings; and not being ashamed."
