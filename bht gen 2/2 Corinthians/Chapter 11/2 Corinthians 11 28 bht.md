# 2 Corinthians 11:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul expresses his burden for the churches, acknowledging that his responsibilities extend beyond external trials. He shares the weight of his daily cares and anxieties, which arise from the well-being of all the churches under his care. This immense responsibility is not to be taken lightly, as Paul was personally involved in the establishment and nurturing of many of these churches. It is evident that his heartfelt concern for the spiritual welfare of the believers compelled him to face the difficulties and challenges that came with his role as an apostle.
