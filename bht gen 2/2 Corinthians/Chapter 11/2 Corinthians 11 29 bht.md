# 2 Corinthians 11:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Who is weak? Who is offended? Paul deeply cares for the well-being of every individual in the church, not just collectively but personally. His sympathy and condescension guide his actions, as he seeks to avoid causing offense or defiling the conscience of others. His compassion burns within him, as if he carries a flame in his heart, passionately longing for the removal of all obstacles and the restoration of peace for those who are hurt.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Who is weak, if I am not weak?" 
2. "The ἀσθένεια of the τις may be in various ways; in faith, as Rom 14:1 al., or in purpose, or in courage: that of the Apostle, see 1 Corinthians 9:22, was a sympathetic weakness, a leaning to the same infirmity for the weak brother’s sake, but also a veritable θορυβοῦμαι κ. ταράσσομαι (as Chrys., p. 614) in himself, on the weak brother’s account." 
3. "Non priore, sed hac versiculi parte addit ego: nam illic infirmo se accommodat: hic dissimilem se scandalizantis fatetur, partes a scandalizante neglectas scandalizati causa ipse suscipiens. Partes a scandalizante neglectæ sunt amor, prudentia, &c. Idem tamen Paulus etiam partes scandalizati, sive incommodum quod scandalizatus sentit, in se suscipit."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
