# 2 Corinthians 11:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
I fear that just as the serpent deceived Eve in his cunning, your minds may be led astray from the single-minded devotion to Christ. Love is filled with these fears, as God warns us to stay joined to Him and guards against any deviation from His will. Let us remain in the pure simplicity of the gospel, for it is in Christ that our connection to God is established. May we be guileless, like children, and avoid corrupting our minds by turning away even slightly from the pure teachings of Christ.

### John Calvin:
1. "God, indeed, everywhere requires from us, that we be joined with him in body and in spirit, and he warns us that he is a jealous God, to avenge with the utmost severity the wrong done to him, in the event of any one’s drawing back from him."

2. "There is here taken for granted, as a historical fact, both the narrative of the fall and the agency of Satan, in serpent form, in that transaction; while his continued agency in the seduction of men from the paths of truth and safety, through the instrumentality of his ministers, is certainly implied, especially in the light of 2 Corinthians 11:13-15."
