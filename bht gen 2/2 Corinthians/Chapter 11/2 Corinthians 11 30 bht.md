# 2 Corinthians 11:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul chooses to boast about his weaknesses and infirmities, which may seem contemptible to his adversaries but actually serve as a testament to his true apostleship. He is not interested in boasting about his own strength, as his opponents do, but rather in acknowledging his dependence on God and the power of Christ. His ability to endure trials and suffering with patience and joy is a powerful display of God's grace and proves him to be a faithful minister of the Gospel.
