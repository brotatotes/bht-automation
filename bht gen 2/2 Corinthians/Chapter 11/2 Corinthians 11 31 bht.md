# 2 Corinthians 11:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The sincerity of these words is emphasized by Paul's invocation of God, who intimately knows the depths of his heart and affirms the truth of his testimony. Paul, in his humility, calls upon the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ as a witness to the veracity of his claims. This invocation acknowledges God's unique role as both his personal God and Father, as well as the eternal source of blessings for all. It is a profound testament to Paul's unwavering faith and deep reverence for God.
