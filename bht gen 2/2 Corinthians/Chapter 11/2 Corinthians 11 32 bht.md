# 2 Corinthians 11:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Damascus, the governor under Aretas, the king of that region, ruled over the city and ensured its protection with a constant watch. This was a significant change from when the city was under Roman rule, as it now fell into the hands of Aretas. Despite the governor's efforts, however, the Jews plotted to take away Paul's life, as his preaching had greatly perplexed and frustrated them. They coordinated with the guards stationed by Aretas in their bid to capture and harm Paul, who had become their sworn enemy because of his unwavering dedication to spreading the Gospel.
