# 2 Corinthians 11:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If someone were able to present to you a different Saviour, a Spirit with more power, or a superior gospel, then perhaps you could entertain the thought of bearing with them. However, this is an impossibility, as there is no other Saviour, Spirit, or gospel that surpasses what has already been presented to you. Thus, there is no reason for you to tolerate those who falsely claim to bring something greater.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "There can be no new Gospel there is but the one which I first preached; therefore it ought not to be 'borne' by you, that the false teachers should attempt to supersede me."
2. "Another implies a distinct individual of the same kind; different implies one quite distinct in kind."
3. "The false teachers do not even pretend they have 'another Jesus' and a 'different Gospel' to bring before you; they merely try to supplant me, your accredited Teacher."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If the false teacher could recommend a better Saviour than I have done, or a Spirit better able to sanctify and save, then there would be a propriety in your receiving him and tolerating his doctrines."
2. "The main idea doubtless is, that the gospel which he preached was as perfect as it could be, and that any change would be for the worse."
3. "Let us never forsake the gospel which we have until we are sure we can get a better. Let us adhere to the simple doctrines of the New Testament until some one can furnish better and clearer doctrines."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Another denies the identity; a different denies the similarity of nature."
2. "Ye might well bear."
3. "You gladly endure these false teachers, why do you not endure me?"

### John Calvin:
1. "Had they brought you another Christ, or another gospel, or another Spirit, different from what you received through my hands, I would assuredly approve of your regard for them, for they would be deserving of such honor."
2. "But as they have conferred upon you nothing, that I had not given you previously, what sort of gratitude do you show in all but adoring those, to whom you are indebted for nothing, while you despise me, through whom God has bestowed upon you so many and so distinguished benefits?"
3. "Such is the reverence that is shown even at this day by Papists towards their pretended Bishops. For while they are oppressed by their excessively harsh tyranny, they submit to it without difficulty; but, at the same time, do not hesitate to treat Christ himself with contempt." (150 words)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I may well be jealous over you; for ye seem ready to drink in the teaching of men who come to you preaching another Jesus, and a different gospel, and claiming a ‘spirit’ very different from that which we brought to you and ye received." 
2. "What follows seems to shew that this is what is intended, though the suppressed irony is very keen."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Not necessarily a different Jesus, but any other 'Jesus' is a rival and so wrong. That would deny the identity."
2. "This is the obvious meaning of ετερον in distinction from αλλον as seen in Acts 4:12; Galatians 1:6. But this distinction in nature or kind is not always to be insisted on."
3. "Similar use of ετερον."

### John Gill:
1. "If he proposes and recommends in his ministry, a better Saviour and Redeemer than had been preached by the apostles..."
2. "if this other apostle taught the doctrine of salvation by Christ, in another and better method and in a clearer manner..."
3. "since another and a better Saviour than Jesus of Nazareth could not be proposed, or the doctrine of salvation by him be preached in another and better manner than it was; nor had they received, nor could they receive, another and a better spirit..."


### John Wesley:
1. If indeed — Any could show you another Saviour, a more powerful Spirit, a better gospel.Ye might well bear with him — But this is impossible.
