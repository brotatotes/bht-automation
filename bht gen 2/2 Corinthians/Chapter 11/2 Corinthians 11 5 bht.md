# 2 Corinthians 11:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Corinthians should have esteemed Paul more highly, considering his evidence of being commissioned by God. They should not have allowed the false teachers to replace him. These false teachers were ironically referred to as the very chiefest apostles by Paul, but they were not the genuine apostles. The Corinthians were ungrateful for not valuing Paul's gifts. Paul's use of the term very chiefest apostles may seem strong, but it is comparable to his language in previous letters. Ultimately, Paul was not inferior to these false apostles and their self-proclaimed superiority.
