# 2 Corinthians 11:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul is acknowledging that he may not be eloquent in his speech, lacking the rhetorical finesse and polished words of others. However, he asserts that he is not lacking in true knowledge. He is well-versed in the teachings of the Gospel and has made them plain and manifest for all to understand. Paul's faith and doctrine are not hidden, but have been openly and widely declared among all.

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul maintains that he understands, what should be taught, and what is necessary to be known, though he is not an eloquent orator, so as to know how to set off his doctrine by a polished and eloquent manner of expression."

### John Gill:
1. "he did not indeed, in his public ministry, dress his sermons with the flowers of rhetoric, or adorn his discourses with the words of human wisdom, with bombast, and great swelling words of vanity; he chose a plainer and easier style, more accommodated to the vulgar..."
2. "he was not rude in knowledge, or unskilful in the mysteries of the Gospel; he was well learned in the knowledge of Christ, and in the doctrines of grace..."
3. "his faith and doctrine, as well as manner of life, were well known unto them; he had not shunned to declare the whole counsel of God unto them..."
