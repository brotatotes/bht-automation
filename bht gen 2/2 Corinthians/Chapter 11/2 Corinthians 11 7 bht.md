# 2 Corinthians 11:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul challenges anyone who might criticize his humble lifestyle, asking if they consider it a fault. He willingly worked with his hands to provide for himself and not be a burden to others. His aim was not to undermine his apostolic authority but to remove obstacles that could hinder the Corinthians from embracing the Gospel. By humbling himself, Paul sought to uplift them, enabling them to experience the exalted status of becoming children of God. In doing so, he demonstrated his deep commitment to preaching the Gospel freely and selflessly, solely motivated by the desire for their spiritual well-being.
