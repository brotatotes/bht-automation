# 2 Corinthians 11:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul, in 2 Corinthians 11:8, confesses that he took from other churches, like the Macedonian church, in order to spare the Corinthians from contributing more to his maintenance. He clarifies that the word robbed does not imply that he obtained anything unlawfully or violently. Rather, it signifies that he received voluntarily given support from other churches. He describes it as taking wages or pay from them, likening it to a soldier receiving compensation for their service. Paul's intention was to continue serving the Corinthians gratuitously, as he had done with other churches.

### Henry Alford:
1. "The 'other churches' were the Macedonian, among them the Philippians were probably conspicuous, retaining as doubtless they did, their former affection to him." 
2. "The word is found nowhere else in Greek. ἀποναρκάω occurs in Plutarch, de Liber. Educatione, p. 8, F (Wetst.), ἀποναρκῶσι κ . φρίττουσι πρὸς τοὺς πόνους." 
3. "Theophylact and Œcum. mention a rendering, οὐκ ἠμέλησα, ἢ ῥᾳθυμοτέρως πρὸς τὸ κήρυγμα γέγονα: and Beza, following the etymology; interprets οὐκ ἐνάρκησα κατʼ οὐδενός, 'cum cujusquam incommodo.'"

1. "I robbed—that is, took from them in order to spare you more than what was their fair share of contribution to my maintenance."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "The word (ἐσύλησα esulēsa) means properly, 'I spoiled, plundered, robbed,' but the idea of Paul here is, that he, as it were, robbed them, because he did not render an equivalent for what they gave him."
3. "The supply from other churches rendered it unnecessary in a great measure that his time should be taken off from the ministry in order to obtain a support."
