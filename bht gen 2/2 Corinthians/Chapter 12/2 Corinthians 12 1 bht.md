# 2 Corinthians 12:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Though it may not be beneficial to boast, particularly for the apostle Paul, he still believes it is important to mention the visions and revelations he has received. These visions are visual experiences while revelations are messages directly spoken to him. However, it is crucial to exercise caution when discussing such extraordinary encounters.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "To boast, verily, is not to my advantage: for (i.e. it will be shown to be so, by the following fact of a correction administered to me ἵνα μὴ ὑπεραίρωμαι)" 
2. "And the instances I will select are just of that kind in which, if boasting ever were good, it might be allowed." 
3. "No particular polemical reason, as the practice of particular parties at Corinth to allege visions, &c. (Baur), need be sought for the narration of this vision: Paul’s object is general, and the means taken to attain it are simply subordinate to it, viz. the vindication of his apostolic character."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He proceeds to illustrate the 'glorying in infirmities'... the infirmity which followed it, as displaying Christ's power."
2. "...in 'revelations' there was always an unveiling of truths before hidden."
3. "All parts of Scripture alike are matter of inspiration; but not all of revelation. There are degrees of revelation; but not of inspiration."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Such a man as I am ought not to boast... I will turn to another matter, and inquire whether the same thing may not be said about visions and revelations."
2. "To glory - To boast... Such a man has nothing to boast of."
3. "Since it is not fit that I should glory, then I will refer to visions... The vision which Paul here refers to was that which he was permitted to have of the heavenly world."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Revelations [αποκαλυψεις] . See on Revelation 1:1.

### John Calvin:
1. "For such a thought is exceedingly dangerous, because, like one entering into a labyrinth, the person is immediately dazzled, so as to be too quick-sighted in discerning his gifts, while in the mean time he is ignorant of himself."
2. "And certainly, if Paul had gloried ambitiously, he would have fallen headlong from a lofty eminence; for it is humility alone that can give stability to our greatness in the sight of God."
3. "Between visions and revelations there is this distinction — that a revelation is often made either in a dream, or by an oracle, without any thing being presented to the eye, while a vision is scarcely ever afforded without a revelation, or in other words, without the Lord’s discovering what is meant by it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I must needs glory, though it is not expedient; but I will come to visions and revelations."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He must go on with the glorying already begun, foolish as it is, though it is not expedient."
2. "Visions: Late word from οπταζω."
3. "Paul had both repeated visions of Christ and revelations. He claimed to speak by direct revelation."

### John Gill:
1. "Though it was lawful for him to glory... yet it was not expedient on some other accounts... he chose to drop it... or rather though it was not expedient to proceed, yet, before he entirely quitted it, he thought it proper to say something of the extraordinary appearances of God unto him."
2. "The apostle might very well speak of 'visions' or heavenly appearances, since he was favoured with many; his conversion was owing to a vision or appearance of Christ to him, whom he saw with his bodily eyes."
3. "And as for revelations, besides what are ordinary and common to all believers, he had extraordinary ones... the knowledge of the several particular doctrines of it, were not attained to by him in the common way, but he had them by the revelation of Jesus Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. It is not expedient — Unless on so pressing occasion. Visions are seen; revelations, heard.
