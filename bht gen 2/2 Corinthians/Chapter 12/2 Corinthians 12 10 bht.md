# 2 Corinthians 12:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the face of challenges and persecutions, I find contentment and pleasure. These trials reveal my weakness and dependence on Christ's strength. They serve as exercises to develop my faith and draw me closer to Him. As I face infirmities, insults, and necessities, I am reminded that my joy surpasses any wealth or honor the world can offer. In my weakness, Christ's power is made perfect, sustaining and empowering me to endure whatever comes my way.
