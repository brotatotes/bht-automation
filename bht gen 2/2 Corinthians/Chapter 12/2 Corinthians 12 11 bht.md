# 2 Corinthians 12:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Despite acknowledging his own insufficiency and insignificance, Paul found himself compelled to defend himself against the false apostles who sought to discredit him. His humility was evident as he recognized his own unworthiness compared to the greatness of God. Nonetheless, he understood the necessity of addressing the false accusations and standing up for the truth. In doing so, Paul exemplified the delicate balance between acknowledging one's limitations while also advocating for oneself when faced with falsehoods.
