# 2 Corinthians 12:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Truly, the signs of an apostle were clearly manifested among you. These signs were not only evident in the power and success of his preaching, but also in the wonders and miracles that accompanied it. Paul, in all patience, endured hardships and persecution for the sake of Christ and the Gospel. It is worth noting that he is referring specifically to the signs witnessed by the Corinthians themselves, emphasizing their responsibility to defend him based on their firsthand experience. This passage serves as a reminder of the authenticity and authority of Paul's apostleship.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "His mode of expression is modest, putting himself, the worker, in the background, 'were wrought,' not 'I wrought.'"

### John Calvin:

2. "The first sign he makes mention of is patience — either because he had remained invincible by nobly withstanding all the assaults of Satan and his enemies, and on no occasion giving way; or because, regardless of his own distinction, he suffered all injuries patiently, endured in silence countless grievances, and, by patience, overcame indignities."
3. "He assigns the second place to miracles, for while he makes mention of signs and wonders and mighty deeds, he makes use of three terms, as he does elsewhere, for expressing one and the same thing."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, by signs, and wonders, and mighty works." (2 Corinthians 12:12) - In Hebrews 2:4, these are given as evidences of apostleship, as in Acts 2:22, of the Divine mission of Christ Himself.
