# 2 Corinthians 12:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Corinthians had no reason to complain because they were not lacking in any spiritual gift compared to other churches. They had received the same Gospel, the same Spirit, and the same graces. The only difference, if one could call it that, was that the apostle Paul did not burden them with financial support. This irony highlights their ingratitude and indifference. Paul sarcastically asks for forgiveness for this supposed wrong, pointing out their ignorance and ingratitude.
