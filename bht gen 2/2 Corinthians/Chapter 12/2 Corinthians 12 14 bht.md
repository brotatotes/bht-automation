# 2 Corinthians 12:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul states that he is ready to come to them for the third time, clarifying that his previous visits were not counted as such. He emphasizes that his main objective is not to obtain material possessions from them, but rather to care for their spiritual well-being. As a loving father, he seeks to provide and enrich them with spiritual treasures, rather than asking them to provide for him. His intention is not to burden them, but to freely preach the Gospel and take nothing from them.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I am coming to you a third time, and I will not burden you this time, any more than I did at my two previous visits."
2. "Our business in such cases is, not to wrest plain words to fit our preconceived chronology, but to adapt our confessedly uncertain and imperfect history of the Apostle’s life, to the data furnished by the plain honest sense of his Epistles."
3. "Paul was the spiritual father of the Corinthian Church, he does not therefore want to be enriched by them, his children, but rather to lay up riches for them, seeking to have them as his treasure, and thus to enrich them, as a loving father does his children."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "His second visit was probably a short one and attended with humiliation through the scandalous conduct of some of his converts."
2. "I am coming, and the third time, and will not burden you this time any more than I did at my two previous visits."
3. "He does not, therefore, seek earthly treasure from them, but lays up the best treasure (namely, spiritual) 'for their souls'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "His main purpose should not be to obtain such a support. It should be the higher and nobler object of winning souls to the Redeemer."
2. "In return, I do not ask you to provide for me, any more than a father ordinarily expects his children to provide for him. I am willing to labor as he does, content with doing my duty, and promoting the welfare of those under me."
3. "The duty of doing that was slight and unusual compared with the duty of a parent to provide for his children."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is the part of a genuine and upright pastor, not to seek to derive gain from his sheep, but to endeavor to promote their welfare."
2. "Paul means that he is not greedy of hire, but is concerned only for the welfare of souls."
3. "Hence, those are not necessarily unworthy of the honor due to fathers, who live at the expense of the Church; but Paul simply wished to show from the common law of nature, that what he had done proceeded from fatherly affection."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Behold, this is the third time I am ready to come to you... 'I am ready to come the third time.' The former sense is forced on those who think the apostle paid but two visits to Corinth; but besides that this puts an unnatural sense upon the words, the apostle’s argument would thus have little point."
2. "As your spiritual parent allow me a parent's privilege, not to be provided for by you, but to make provision for you, my children."
3. "The delicacy and tenderness of this touch are surpassing."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "They need not be apprehensive. He will be as financially independent of them as before."
3. "The motto of every real preacher."

### John Gill:
1. "Not that he had been twice at Corinth, and was now about to come a third time... and now a third time he had purposed it in his mind, and had prepared for it, and was just ready to come unto them..."
2. "he signifies he would preach the Gospel freely to them, and take nothing of them... for I seek not yours; their money and substance, as did the false apostles..."
3. "for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children... this is neither usual nor necessary, for however, as the case may be, children may be obliged to maintain their parents when grown old and in want, yet not to lay up substance for them for futurity..."

### John Wesley:
1. The third time — Having been disappointed twice.I seek not yours — Your goods.But you — Your souls.
