# 2 Corinthians 12:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul's selflessness shines as he gladly declares his willingness to spend and be spent for others. He not only determined to take nothing from them, but also communicated his resources and was willing to spend them in their service. This commitment extended to using his entire substance, expending his strength in laborious preaching, and even laying down his life for their benefit. Despite facing challenges and being loved less in return, Paul's unwavering love and sacrificial spirit serve as a remarkable example for all to follow.
