# 2 Corinthians 12:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, Paul humbly recalls an extraordinary revelation he received from God. While uncertain whether it occurred in the body or in the spirit, he refrains from boasting about the specifics. Instead, he highlights the greatness and mystery of his experience, being caught up to the third heaven, a realm beyond the known heavens. Some suggest that this encounter may have informed Paul's mission to the gentiles. However, it is more important for us to focus on the essential truths and teachings of the Bible, rather than indulging in speculations about Paul's remarkable encounter.

2. "His spiritual self was his highest and truest self: the flesh with its infirmity merely his temporary self."
3. "He had long been intimate with the Corinthians, yet had never mentioned this revelation before: it was not a matter lightly to be spoken of."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Those who have been most favored with spiritual enjoyments will not be the most ready to proclaim it."
2. "God often gives to his people some clear and elevated spiritual comforts before they enter into trials as well as while in them; he prepares them for them before they come."

2. "Caught up. The verb suits the swift, resistless, impetuous seizure of spiritual ecstasy."
3. "Third heaven. It is quite useless to attempt to explain this expression according to any scheme of celestial gradation."

### John Calvin:
1. "He expresses thereby the more distinctly the greatness of the revelation. For he means, that God dealt with him in such a way, (881) that he did not himself understand the manner of it. Nor should this appear to us incredible, inasmuch as he sometimes manifests himself to us in such a way, that the manner of his doing so is, nevertheless, hid from our view."
2. "Let us learn from this, that we must seek the knowledge of those things only that are necessary to be known, and leave other things to God."
3. "To reach the third heavens has been granted to very few."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The obvious answer is, that he could not bear extolling himself so nakedly as the use of the first person would express."
2. "At the same time, as the event was probably the most marvellous that ever occurred to him since his conversion, he is careful to specify the precise time of its occurrence."
3. "Enough to understand it of a height of translation towards 'the secret place of the Most High,' to which he was through life an utter stranger save at this time."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul singles out one incident of ecstasy in his own experience that he declines to describe."
2. "The date was probably while Paul was at Tarsus (Acts 9:30; Acts 11:25). We have no details of that period."
3. "He seems to mean the highest heaven where God is."

### John Gill:
1. "The reason why he here speaks in the third [person], is to show his modesty and humility, and how much he declined vain glory and popular applause."
2. "Moreover, the full and certain knowledge he had of this man, of the place he was caught up to, and of the things he there heard, best agrees with him."
3. "The phrase 'in Christ', is [...] to denote his being in Christ, and that either [...] in an ecstasy; and so here this man was in the Spirit of Christ, and transported by him to see visions, and have revelations; or rather it intends a spiritual being in Christ, union to him, the effect of which is communion with him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Whether in the body or out of the body I know not... it would be vain curiosity for us to attempt determining it."
2. "The third heaven... far above the aerial and the starry heaven."
3. "Some suppose it was here the apostle was let into the mystery of the future state of the church; and received his orders to turn from the Jews and go to the gentiles."
