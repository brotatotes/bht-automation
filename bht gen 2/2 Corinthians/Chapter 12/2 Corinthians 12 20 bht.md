# 2 Corinthians 12:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
I fear that when I come, I may not find you as I desire, for there is a risk of finding debates and arguments that are unproductive and unnecessary. These disputes can lead to hostility and anger, which goes against the spirit of the Gospel and hinders the growth of the community. Let us strive to foster unity and peace instead.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "'Edification, of which you stand in need, for, &c.' He here completely and finally throws off the apologist and puts on the Apostle, leaving on their minds a very different impression from that which would have been produced had he concluded with the apology." 
2. "What follows, viz. μή πως … ἔπραξαν, is an epexegesis of the last sentence, but in it, the definiteness is on the side of the οὐχ οἵους θέλω, the indefiniteness on that of οἷον οὐ θέλετε, which latter is only hinted at by the mild expressions of being humbled and lamenting the case of the impenitent."
3. "ἐριθεῖαι, self-seekings, see note on ref. Rom. ψιθ., secret malignings, καταλ., open slanders. ἀκαταστ., see reff. and note."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Debates—Greek, 'strifes,' 'contentions.'"
2. "Envying—The oldest manuscripts read 'envying,' singular."
3. "Swellings—arrogant elation; puffing up of yourselves."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "His desire was that all these disorders might be removed, and that he might be saved from the necessity of exercising severe discipline when he should come among them."
2. "For this reason he wished all disorder corrected, and all offences removed; that everything might be pleasant when he should come."
3. "Paul, deeply sensible of the evil of all this, had endeavored in this correspondence to suppress it, that all things might be pleasant when he should come among them."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Wraths [θυμοι]...Excitements or outbursts of wrath." 
2. "Whisperings [ψιθυρισμοι]...Secret slanders."
3. "Swellings [φυσιωσεις]...Conceited inflation."

### John Calvin:
1. "This fear proceeded from love, for, unless he had been concerned as to their welfare, he would very readily have overlooked all this, from which he sought to obtain no personal advantage."
2. "It is a token not merely of love, but even of indulgence, to shun severity, and have recourse to milder measures."
3. "He teaches, accordingly, by his example, that mild remedies must always be resorted to by Pastors, for the correction of faults, before they have recourse to extreme severity."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The list of things here specified seems to shew that the old cancer which festered in the Greek republics had found its way into the Christian community of this Greek city."
2. "That such a state of things should be apprehended reveals a condition in the Church of Corinth which might well justify the severest language which he employs in dealing with it."
3. "For I fear, lest by any means, when I come, I should find you not such as I would, and should myself be found of you such as ye would not lest my visit should be pleasant to neither party, lest there should be strife, jealousy, wraths, factions, backbitings, whisperings, tumults."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "With graphic pen pictures Paul describes what had been going on against him during his long absence." 
2. "An idiomatic construction after the verb of fearing with μη πως as the conjunction and with ουχ as the negative of the verb ευρω."
3. "Neat change in voice just before and position of the negative here."

### John Gill:
1. "I fear lest when I come...I shall not find you such as I would"
2. "Lest there be debates...about words to no profit"
3. "Wraths; breaking out into words and actions, which discover hatred of mind, a malignant spirit, quite contrary to that of the Gospel"
