# 2 Corinthians 12:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Many who had sinned before my last visit to Corinth, were caught up in the sins of uncleanness, particularly among married individuals. There was also a general indulgence in lasciviousness that went against the natural order established by God. Such behavior was truly grievous and required repentance and restoration.

2. "'Nihil erat quo magis exultaret apostolus, quam prospero suae praedicationis successu.'"
3. "The perf. προημαρτηκότων denotes the permanence of the state from the time of the committal of the sin: Whereas the aor. μετανοησάντων has the sense of the 'futurum exactum,' 'and who at my coming shall not have repented.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The infliction of punishment on members of the church is a sort of punishment to him who inflicts it as well as to him who is punished. Members of the church should walk uprightly, lest they overwhelm the ministry in shame."
2. "If they continued in their sin until he came, it would be to him a source of deep lamentation."

### John Calvin:
1. "He does not, indeed, charge them all with this crime, but only a few, who had impudently despised all his admonitions."
2. "The meaning, then, is this: 'They think contemptuously of me, because I appear contemptible. Let them, then, give me no occasion of abasement: nay more, let them, on the contrary, laying aside their forwardness, begin to feel shame; and let them, confounded at their iniquities, prostrate themselves on the ground, instead of looking down upon others with disdain.'"
3. "In the mean time, he lets us know the disposition of a true and genuine Pastor, when he says that he will look upon the sins of others with grief."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "So bound up was his comfort in this and all his churches with their spiritual prosperity, that the prospect of finding the church which of all others lay most at his heart in the deplorable condition here described, sickened him at the thought of it, and held out to him only humiliation, in place of delight, in visiting them."
2. "Missionaries who have been the happy instruments of rescuing sensual heathens from such vices as these, but find to their grief the same tendency, after a   time, to return upon them, can best enter into the apostle’s feelings as here expressed, and will be the best expositors of them."

3. "The conduct of the church had been a real humiliation."

3. "Gracious souls may be suffered to fall into great sins; and that when they are truly brought to repentance, they ought to be restored to communion with the church."
