# 2 Corinthians 12:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The encounter described revealed extraordinary words that could not be expressed fully or communicated to others. These words were beyond the capacity of human language to convey. The limitations of human knowledge were evident in the mystery surrounding these unspeakable words. The timing of the encounter alludes to the speaker's impending trials, and the remembrance of the joy that awaited them served as a source of strength.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "unspeakable‚Äînot in themselves, otherwise Paul could not have heard them; but as the explanation states, 'which it is not lawful . . . to utter'" 
2. "They were designed for Paul's own consolation, and not for communication to others."
3. "Some heavenly words are communicable (Exodus 34:6; Isaiah 6:3). These were not so."


### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'paradise' occurs but three times in the New Testament... and in the New Testament is applied to the abodes of the blessed after death, the dwelling-place of God and of happy spirits; or to heaven as a place of blessedness."
2. "Paul meant to say that he could not attempt by words to do justice to what he saw and heard... there were truths imparted to his mind which he could not hope to convey in any language spoken by people."
3. "There are great truths which it is not the design of God to reveal to human beings... In eternity there must be boundless truths and glories which are not needful for us to know now, and which, on many accounts, it would not be proper to be revealed to man." (149 words)

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Paradise. See on Luke 23:43. Unspeakable words [Œ±œÅœÅŒ∑œÑŒ± œÅŒ∑ŒºŒ±œÑŒ±] . An oxymoron, speaking which may not be spoken.

### John Calvin:
1. "It came from this to be customary among the Greeks to employ the term paradise to denote the heavenly glory."
 
2. "Let us consider for a little, how many adversaries his doctrine had, and of what sort they were; and farther, with what a variety of artifices it was assailed, and then we shall wonder no longer, why he heard more than it was lawful for him to utter."
 
3. "From this, too, we may gather a most useful admonition as to setting bounds to knowledge. We are naturally prone to curiosity. Hence, neglecting altogether, or tasting but slightly, and carelessly, doctrine that tends to edification, we are hurried on to frivolous questions."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul apparently uses paradise as the equivalent of the third heaven." 
2. "We need not commit Paul to any 'celestial gradation' (Vincent)."
3. "Not lawful (ŒøœÖŒ∫ ŒµŒæŒøŒΩ). Copula ŒµœÉœÑŒπŒΩ omitted. Hence Paul does not give these words."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle had two separate raptures...He was caught up unto the third heaven, and so again from thence into paradise."
2. "He heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter...they were such as before had never been spoken to any mortal man, and so could never have been spoken by any."
3. "The things were unspeakable, never yet related, and so not to be known‚Ä¶they were such things which the apostle himself‚Ä¶was not able to put into proper words and language to be understood by others."

### John Wesley:
1. "He was caught up into paradise ‚Äî The seat of happy spirits in their separate state, between death and the resurrection."
2. "Things which it is not possible for man to utter ‚Äî Human language being incapable of expressing them."
3. "Here he anticipated the joyous rest of the righteous that die in the Lord. But this rapture did not precede, but follow after, his being caught up to the third heaven: a strong intimation that he must first discharge his mission, and then enter into glory. And beyond all doubt, such a foretaste of it served to strengthen him in all his after trials, when he could call to mind the very joy that was prepared for him."
