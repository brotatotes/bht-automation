# 2 Corinthians 12:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle Paul, in his humility, speaks as if there were two versions of himself: one who had experienced extraordinary visions and revelations, and another who had weaknesses and infirmities. He acknowledges that while he could boast in the Lord for the great things that had been done for him, he would not take credit for these experiences as if they were from his own merit or worthiness. Instead, if he were to boast, it would be in his weaknesses and limitations, recognizing that his true strength lies in God alone.
