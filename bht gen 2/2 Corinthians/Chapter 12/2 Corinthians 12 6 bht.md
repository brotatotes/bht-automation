# 2 Corinthians 12:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If I were to boast, I would have legitimate reasons to do so, holding onto my credible experiences and revelations. It would not be foolish, as it would be the plain truth. However, I refrain from such boasting, choosing to be evaluated based on my actions and teachings. This humility is admirable, as it avoids unnecessary extravagance. It is a shame that such modesty is rarely found among others today.
