# 2 Corinthians 12:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In order to prevent himself from being too prideful, the Apostle Paul was given a painful and humbling challenge. The specific nature of this challenge is unknown and subject to conjecture, but it was likely a physical ailment that caused him great discomfort. Some suggest it was a particular and severe temptation from Satan. Whatever it was, it served to keep Paul humble and dependent on God's grace. This affliction was like a messenger of Satan, continually causing him distress and anguish. Paul was constantly aware of the potential for these trials, which prompted him to restrain his boasting.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And that I might not, by the abundant excess of revelations (made to me), be uplifted, there was given me a thorn in my flesh." 
2. "The expression used Gal 4:14 of this same affliction, 'the persecution in my flesh,' seems decisive for rendering the dative thus, and not as a dativus incommodi." 
3. "On the whole, putting together the figure here used, that of a thorn, occasioning pain, and the buffeting or putting to shame, it seems quite necessary to infer that the Apostle alludes to some painful and tedious bodily malady."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "How dangerous must self-exaltation be, when even the apostle required so much restraint!"
2. "A thorn in the flesh... something personal, affecting him individually, causing acute pain and shame."
3. "The chastisement from hell follows soon upon the revelation from heaven."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If Paul was in danger of spiritual pride, who is not? If it was necessary for God to adopt some special measures to keep him humble, we are not to be surprised that the same thing should occur in other cases."
2. "There is no danger that more constantly besets Christians, and even eminent Christians, than pride. There is no sin that is more subtile, insinuating, deceptive; none that lurks more constantly around the heart and that finds a more ready entrance, than pride."
3. "The general truth taught in this verse is, that God will take care that his people shall not be unduly exalted by the manifestations of his favor, and by the spiritual privileges which he bestows on them. He will take measures to humble them; and a large part of his dealings with his people is designed to accomplish this."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The figure is that of the impaling stake."
2. "Messenger is the word commonly rendered angel in the New Testament, though sometimes used of human messengers."
3. "Buffet with messenger, which better suits depart; not with thorn, which would be a confusion of metaphor, a stake buffeting."

### John Calvin:
1. "There was given to me a goad that my flesh might be spurred up by it, for I am not yet so spiritual, as not to be exposed to temptations according to the flesh."
2. "At every apprehension of temptation, it becomes us to arouse ourselves, and arm ourselves with promptitude for repelling Satan’s assaults."
3. "Let us carefully consider, who it is that here speaks — He had overcome so many dangers, tortures, and other evils — had triumphed over all the enemies of Christ — had driven away the fear of death — had, in fine, renounced the world; and yet he had not altogether subdued pride."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "What this 'thorn in the flesh' was has exercised expositors sorely, and every solution must be conjectural." 
2. "Beyond all doubt it was something physical, and something involving acute pain."
3. "The one thing about it which is certain is its galling, humiliating effect, to express which he calls it 'a messenger of Satan to buffet him.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "By reason of the exceeding greatness...But...that I should not be exalted overmuch."
2. "A thorn in the flesh...Certainly it was some physical malady that persisted."
3. "Messenger of Satan...The affliction personified...kept slapping Paul in the face."

### John Gill:
1. "Pride is naturally in every man's heart; converted persons are not without it; knowledge, gifts, and revelations are apt to puff up with spiritual pride, unless counterbalanced and over poised by the grace of God."
2. "Others are of opinion that the temptations of Satan are designed, which, as they are called 'fiery darts',...may be here called, especially some very particular, eminent, and sore temptation, a 'thorn in the flesh', very pungent, and giving a great deal of pain and uneasiness."
3. "This sore exercise befell the apostle for his good, to keep down the pride of his nature; lest, adds he again, I should be exalted above measure; for such ends and purposes does the Lord, in his infinite wisdom, deal with his people."

### John Wesley:
1. "A thorn in the flesh — A visitation more painful than any thorn sticking in the flesh."
2. "A messenger or angel of Satan to buffet me - Perhaps both visibly and invisibly; and the word in the original expresses the present, as well as the past, time."
3. "St. Paul seems to have had a fresh fear of these buffetings every moment, when he so frequently represses himself in his boasting, though it was extorted from him by the utmost necessity."
