# 2 Corinthians 12:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In his humbling acknowledgment of his own limitations, Paul sought the Lord's intervention thrice, reflecting the fervent entreaties of Jesus to his Heavenly Father. This repeated plea displayed both Paul's recognition of his weakness and his firm belief in the power of divine intervention. By beseeching the Lord for relief, Paul exemplified the importance of turning to God in times of struggle and surrendering to His will, knowing that true strength and deliverance come from Him alone.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In respect of this (angel of Satan, not σκόλοψ, see below) I thrice (τρίς, not indefinite as Chrys., Hom. xxvi. p. 621, τουτέστι, πολλάκις. Meyer well observes, ‘At his first and second request, no answer was given to him: on the third occasion, it came; and his faithful resignation to the Lord’s will prevented his asking again’)."
2. "I thrice besought the Lord (Christ, see 2Co 12:9) that he might depart from me (the angel of Satan, see Luke 4:13 [Act 22:29])."
3. "His faithful resignation to the Lord’s will prevented his asking again."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "To his third the answer came, which satisfied his faith and led him to bow his will to God's will."
2. "The thorn seems to have continued with Paul when he wrote, lest still he should be 'overmuch lifted up.'"
3. "Escape from the cross is not to be sought even indirectly from Satan."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The answer was that his grace was sufficient for him; and Paul consoled himself by saying that it was a sufficient support if the power of Christ implied in that answer, should rest on him. He would glory in trials if such was their result."
2. "But if this refers to the Lord Jesus, then it proves that it is right to go to him in times of trouble, and that it is right to worship him."
3. "The passage proves that it is right to pray earnestly and repeatedly for the removal of any calamity. The Saviour so prayed in the garden; and Paul so prayed here. Yet it also proves that there should be a limit to such prayers...we should not be over-anxious, and that when it is plain from any cause that the calamity will not be removed, we should submit to it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. For this thing [υπερ τουτου] . Rev., concerning this thing. But it is better to refer this to messenger : concerning this or whom. For, of A. V., is ambiguous.

### John Calvin:
1. "He means, however, to intimate, that this annoyance had been felt by him distressing, inasmuch as he had so frequently prayed to be exempted from it."
2. "He confirms... that he had, by means of this bridle, been held back from being haughty; for if relief from it had been for his advantage, he would never have met with a refusal."
3. "By this we are admonished not to give way to despondency, as if our prayers had been lost labor, when God does not gratify or comply with our wishes, but that we must be satisfied with his grace, that is, in respect of our not being forsaken by him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Note. Those who doubt whether the New Testament warrants prayer to Christ should have their doubts set at rest by this passage."
2. "A poor attempt has been made to set aside the argument here, by urging that the word beseech here used is never employed to express prayer to God, and that it means not to invocate but rather to advocate."
3. "If this, then, was what Paul did to Christ, and Christ so answered him as implied His right to be so addressed, and to give the fitting answer, then the New Testament warrant to pray to Christ is conclusively settled, and with it His supreme Personal Divinity."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Concerning this thing (υπερ τουτου). More likely, 'concerning this messenger of Satan.'"
2. "That it might depart from me (ινα αποστη αφ' εμου). Second aorist active (intransitive) subjunctive of αφιστημ in final clause, 'that he stand off from me for good.'"

### John Gill:
1. "This request greatly confirms the above sense, for it can hardly be thought the apostle would be so importunate about the removal of a common bodily affliction."
2. "He knew that the corruption of his nature would remain with him as long as he was in the body; and as for afflictions, reproaches, and persecutions for the Gospel's sake, he was well apprized they would abide him wherever he went."
3. "But that so troublesome an adversary might depart, as it must be greatly desirable, so it was a very proper request: and it is made to a very proper person, to the 'Lord' Jesus Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. Concerning this — He had now forgot his being lifted up.I besought the Lord thrice — As our Lord besought his Father.
