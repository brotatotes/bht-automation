# 2 Corinthians 12:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage reminds us that God's grace is always sufficient, even when our trials seem overwhelming. His grace may not remove the trial, but it will endure and never fail us. It is in our weakness that His power is made perfect, as our strengthlessness becomes the very element for His power to manifest itself more completely. Therefore, we should gladly boast in our weaknesses, for it is in our vulnerabilities that the power of Christ finds its residence in us. His grace is our support and His strength is more fully displayed through our human weaknesses.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is one of the instances in which the fervent prayer of a good man, offered undoubtedly in faith, was not answered in the form in which he desired, though substantially answered in the assurance of grace sufficient to support him."
2. "The material fact here is, that the request was not granted in the exact form in which he presented it, but that he received assurance of grace to support him in his trial."
3. "That is, the strength which I impart to my people is more commonly and more completely manifested when my people feel that they are weak. It is not imparted to those who feel that they are strong and who do not realize their need of divine aid. It is not so completely manifested to those who are vigorous and strong as to the feeble."
