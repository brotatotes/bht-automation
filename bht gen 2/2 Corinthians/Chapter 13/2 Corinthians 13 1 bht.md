# 2 Corinthians 13:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul had previously planned to visit Corinth twice, but circumstances had prevented him from doing so. Now, he declares his intention to make a third visit. The use of the phrase this third time emphasizes the certainty and importance of his upcoming visit. By stating this, Paul is also reminding the Corinthians of his original plans, which had been disrupted. This repetition serves as a solemn warning, urging the Corinthians to take his words seriously and prepare themselves for his arrival.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Apostle wishes to impress on them the certainty of this coming, and to prepare them for it by solemn self-examination; and in order to this, he uses an expression which would only remind them of the charge of ἐλαφρία which had been brought against him, and tend to diminish the solemnity of the warning."
2. "I will not now, as before, be with you ἐν πάσῃ ὑπομονῇ as regards the offenders: but will come to a regular process, and establish the truth in a legal manner."
3. "Another view, connected with the rendering of ἔρχομαι 'am intending to come,' is given by Wetstein: 'Spero jam denique mihi successurum, ut vobis demonstrem, serio me desiderasse ad vos venire: sicut ea quæ trium hominum testimonio probantur, in judicio fidem faciunt.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This is the third time I am coming to you—not merely preparing to come to you. This proves an intermediate visit between the two recorded in Acts 18:1; Acts 20:2."
2. "In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established—Quoted from Acts 20:2- :, Septuagint. 'I will judge not without examination, nor will I abstain from punishing upon due evidence' [CONYBEARE and HOWSON]."
3. "I will no longer be among you 'in all patience' towards offenders (2 Corinthians 12:12). The apostle in this case, where ordinary testimony was to be had, does not look for an immediate revelation, nor does he order the culprits to be cast out of the church before his arrival."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is evident that Paul had been to Corinth but once before this, but he had resolved to go before a second time, but had been disappointed."
2. "No one should be condemned or punished where there was not at least two or three witnesses to prove the offence. But where there were, discipline would be administered according to the nature of the crime."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The great mass of modern expositors hold that Paul made three visits to Corinth, of the second of which there is no record."
2. "I am coming. The third visit which I am about to pay."
3. "Those who deny the second visit explain: this is the third time that I have been intending to come."

### John Calvin:
1. "He goes on to reprove still farther the insolence of those of whom he had been speaking, some of whom living in profligacy and licentiousness, and others, carrying on contentions and strifes among themselves, cared nothing for his reproof."
2. "Hence he now, with greater freedom, uses sharpness, because he has to do with particular individuals, not with the whole body of the people, and besides this, it was with persons of such a stamp, that he perceived, that he would do them no good by kindness, and mild remedies."
3. "For the threefold effort that was made for their welfare, and perseverance, as made trial of on three different occasions, might, with good reason, be held equivalent to three persons."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is surprising that in the face of so explicit a statement, repeated at 2 Corinthians 13:2, and of the one at 2 Corinthians 12:14, Paley and other excellent critics should maintain that the apostle paid only two visits to Corinth."
2. "At the mouth (on the testimony) of two witnesses or three shall every word be established."
3. "The Jewish law in judicial cases was very strict, requiring at least two witnesses for the condemnation of anyone."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  The third time I am coming  (τριτον ερχομα). Either the third that he had planned to come or that he had been twice. The warning is made by quoting Deuteronomy 19:15. 

### John Gill:
1. "He had been 'once' with them when he first preached the Gospel to them, and was the means of their conversion, and laid the foundation of their church state."
2. "He desired to be considered by them, as though he was present with them."
3. "He proceeded in a judicial way, according to due form of law, and in such a manner as Christ had directed."

### John Wesley:
1. I am coming this third time — He had been coming twice before, though he did not actually come.
