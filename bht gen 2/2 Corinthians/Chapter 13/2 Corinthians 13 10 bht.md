# 2 Corinthians 13:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The author writes with sharpness in his letters, aiming for the perfection and edification of the readers. He did not want to act too harshly in his absence, for he desired to exercise his power for their benefit, not their destruction. The purpose of his severe words was to prevent the need for even stronger measures when he would be present, so that he could build them up instead of tearing them down.
