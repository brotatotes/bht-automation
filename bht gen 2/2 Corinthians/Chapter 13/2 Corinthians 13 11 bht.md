## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Rejoice, in the Lord, as Philippians 3:1; Philippians 4:4." 
2. "Take comfort; a recurrence in the end of the Epistle to the spirit with which it began." 
3. "This is better than 'comfort (or 'exhort') one another,' which would more naturally be expressed by παρακαλεῖτε ἀλλήλους, or ἑαυτούς."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "farewell—meaning in Greek also 'rejoice'; thus in bidding farewell he returns to the point with which he set out, 'we are helpers of your joy'"
2. "Be perfect—Become perfect by filling up what is lacking in your Christian character"
3. "be of good comfort"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is generally agreed, however, that it is here to be understood in the sense of farewell, as a parting salutation, though it may be admitted that there is included in the word an expression of a wish for their happiness."
2. "A command to be perfect, however, does not prove that it has ever in fact been obeyed: and an earnest wish on the part of an apostle that others might be perfect, does not demonstrate that they were."
3. "To promote the restoration of peace had been the main design of these epistles."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Finally [λοιπον] . Lit., as for the rest. Sometimes rendered now, as Matthew 26:45. 'Sleep on now,' for the time that remains. Besides, as 1 Corinthians 1:16. It remaineth, 1 Corinthians 7:29. Henceforth, 2 Timothy 4:8; Hebrews 10:13. Often as here, finally. In every case the idea of something left over is at the bottom of the translation."
2. "Farewell [χαιρετε] . In the classics used both at meeting and at parting. Lit., hail! See on James 1:1. Rev., in margin, has rejoice. It is somewhat doubtful whether it ever has the meaning farewell in the New Testament."
3. "Be perfect [καταρτιζεσθε] . Rev., be perfected. See on Luke 6:40; 1 Peter 5:10. Paul speaks both of individual perfection and of the perfection of the Church through the right adjustment of all its members in Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "For then only are reproofs beneficial, when they are in a manner seasoned with honey, that the hearer may, if possible, receive them in an agreeable spirit."
2. "To be of one mind, and to live in peace, are expressions which mean two different things; for the one takes its rise from the other."
3. "He intimates that God will be with us, if we cultivate peace among ourselves; but that those that are at variance with each other are at a distance from him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Be perfect ('perfected')."
2. "Be of one mind, the want of which was the first thing he complained of in his First Epistle."
3. "Live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you."

### John Gill:
1. "be perfect; seek after perfection in knowledge, grace, and holiness, and in the performance of good works"
2. "be of one mind; in religious sentiments, in the doctrines and principles of grace, and ordinances of the Gospel"
3. "Live in peace both with them that are without, and them that are within, with all men, and with the members of the church"

### John Wesley:
1. "Be perfect — Aspire to the highest degree of holiness."
2. "Be of good comfort — Filled with divine consolation."
3. "Be of one mind — Desire, labour, pray for it, to the utmost degree that is possible."
