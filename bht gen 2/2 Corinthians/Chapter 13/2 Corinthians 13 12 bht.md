# 2 Corinthians 13:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The practice of greeting one another with a holy kiss was a common Eastern practice, demonstrating a symbol of unity and oneness in Christ. This form of salutation was observed in the Jewish synagogues, where men kissed men and women kissed women due to the separation of sexes. It is worth noting that this practice still continues in the Coptic and Russian churches. However, as social customs and perceptions changed over time, the significance and observance of the holy kiss diminished. Nonetheless, the intention behind this greeting remains a powerful reminder of the unity that believers share in Christ.
