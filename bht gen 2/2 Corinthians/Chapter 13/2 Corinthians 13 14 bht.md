# 2 Corinthians 13:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be upon you, for it is through His unending love that He has done and endured all things for His people. It is His grace that should be the object of our trust and dependence. May you also experience the never-changing, sovereign love of God, which is eternally dispensed and remains forever. Pray that you are directed into this love, have it shed abroad in your heart, and are rooted and grounded in it.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The grace of Christ" comes first, for it is only by it we come to "the love of God" the Father.
2. The variety in the order of Persons proves that "in this Trinity none is afore or after other" [Athanasian Creed].
3. Whoever has "the fellowship of the Holy Ghost," has also "the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ," and "the love of God"; and vice versa. For the three are inseparable, as the three Persons of the Trinity itself [CHRYSOSTOM].

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ - see the note, Romans 16:20. This verse contains what is usually called the apostolic benediction - the form which has been so long, and which is almost so universally used, in dismissing religious assemblies."
2. "It is a prayer; and if it is a prayer addressed to God, it is no less so to the Lord Jesus and to the Holy Spirit. If so, it is right to offer worship to the Lord Jesus and to the Holy Spirit."
3. "The passage, therefore, furnishes a proof of the doctrine of the Trinity that has not yet been answered, and, it is believed, cannot be. On the supposition that there are three persons in the adorable Trinity, united in essence and yet distinct in some respects, all is plain and clear."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The most complete benediction of the Pauline epistles."
2. "In most of the epistles the introductory benedictions are confined to grace and peace."
3. "In the closing benedictions uniformly grace."

### John Calvin:
1. "The term grace does not here mean unmerited favor, but is taken by metonymy, to denote the whole benefit of redemption."
2. "For God, viewed in himself, loved us before the creation of the world, and redeemed us for no other reason than this — because he loved us. As for us, on the other hand, as we see in ourselves nothing but occasion of wrath, that is, sin, we cannot apprehend any love of God towards us without a Mediator. Hence it is that, with respect to us, the beginning of love is from the grace of Christ."
3. "The fellowship of the Holy Spirit is added, because it is only under his guidance, that we come to possess Christ, and all his benefits."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Remarkable it is that an Epistle written under a tempest of conflicting emotions, breathing in some places indignation, reproach, and sadness, at being driven to self-vindication against worthless detractors...precisely this Epistle is the one that closes with the richest and most comprehensive of all the benedictions in the New Testament..."
2. "Observe the characteristic features in the agency of each of the Persons in the Godhead as here assigned them."
3. "From this subjective character of the Spirit’s agency in the economy of grace, it probably arises that the objective departments in that economy, which are assigned by Divine arrangement to the Father and the Son, have almost exclusive prominence in the statements of the New Testament..."

### John Gill:
1. "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ.... Meaning either the love of Christ... and which, as it is without beginning, will be without end. This is the ground and foundation of all he has done and underwent for his people."
2. "By the grace of Christ is meant the fulness of grace that is in him as Mediator; which is desired to be with the saints as the object of their trust and dependence."
3. "The love of God... is dispensed in a sovereign way, is unchangeable, abides for ever... the apostle prays... that they might be directed into it, have it shed abroad in their hearts, and they be rooted and grounded in it."
