# 2 Corinthians 13:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The writer gives a clear forewarning to the recipients, both in person and while absent, implying the seriousness of the matter. This warning applies to those who have sinned before and those at risk of sinning. It is evident that the writer had been unyielding during his past visit, having not spared the offenders. Their continued disobedience has prompted the need for a second warning. The writer's resolve to punish them indicates the gravity of their actions and the importance of heeding this admonition.

1. "As when I was present the second time... It is a natural way to take the Greek œâœÇ œÄŒ±œÅœâŒΩ."
2. "The use of œÄŒ±ŒªŒπŒΩ of itself suits the idea that Paul had not yet made the second visit... but it is not decisive."

### John Gill:
1. "He means, that he had in his former epistle faithfully told them of their evils, and admonished them for them; and now he sends to them a second time before his coming, and again admonishes them, as if he was upon the spot with them."
2. "That might since be drawn into a compliance with sinful practices, through their example; or as the Arabic version renders it, 'to the rest of the congregation'; who would be witnesses for him, and against them, that he had admonished them a first, and a second time."

### John Wesley:
1. All the rest ‚Äî Who have since then sinned in any of these kinds.I will not spare ‚Äî I will severely punish them.
