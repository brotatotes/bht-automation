# 2 Corinthians 13:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ's authority and power were evident in the signs, wonders, and gifts of the Holy Spirit that accompanied Paul's preaching. While some questioned his apostolic authority, he assured them that he would provide a proof of the Christ who speaks in him. He would demonstrate this through the execution of just punishments and the manifestation of Christ's power among them. Ultimately, the Corinthians themselves were the seal and evidence of Paul's apostleship, as they had witnessed the transformative power of the Gospel in their lives.
