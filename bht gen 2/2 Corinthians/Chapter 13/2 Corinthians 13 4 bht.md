# 2 Corinthians 13:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Crucifixion might seem like a sign of weakness, but it was actually through the weakness of human nature that Christ was able to be crucified. In the same way, when we suffer for His sake, we may appear weak, but we are actually united with Christ and will live with Him. This life is not just a future hope, but a present reality, as we are strengthened by the power of God.
