# 2 Corinthians 13:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul urges the Corinthians to examine their own faith and determine if they can withstand the test. This examination is crucial due to the disorders and ignorance prevalent in the Corinthian church. It is essential for them to ascertain if they have been deceived. By testing themselves, they can determine if their faith is genuine, as it will result in sincere Christian conduct. This introspection will reveal whether they truly have Christ dwelling within them through faith, or if they are mere pretenders.

### Albert Barnes:
1.

Let him go and try to do good; to endure affliction in a proper manner; to combat the errors and follies of life; to admonish sinners of the error of their ways; and to urge forward the great work of the conversion of the world, and he will soon see there what his religion is worth - as easily as a man can test the qualities of an axe."

1. "For, in the first place, it shows the relation, which subsists between the faith of the people, and the preaching of the minister — that the one is the mother, that produces and brings forth, and the other is the daughter, that ought not to forget her origin."
2. "He declares, that all are reprobates, who doubt whether they profess Christ and are a part of His body. Let us, therefore, reckon that alone to be right faith, which leads us to repose in safety in the favor of God, with no wavering opinion, but with a firm and steadfast assurance."
3. "He gives them in a manner their choice, whether they would rather be reprobates, than give due testimony to his ministry; for he leaves them no alternative, but either to show respect to his Apostleship, or to allow that they are reprobates."

3. "The word means 'disapproved' on trial, 'rejected,' and so, Christians only in name, of whom Christ will say, 'I never knew you.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul challenged his opposers in Corinth to try (πειραζετε) themselves, to test (δοκιμαζετε) themselves, whether they were 'in the faith' (εν τη πιστε), a much more vital matter for them than trying to prove Paul a heretic."
2. "Such tests can be made unless, alas, they are 'reprobate' (αδοκιμο, the very adjective that Paul held up before himself as a dreadful outcome to be avoided, 1 Corinthians 9:27)."

### John Gill:
1. "He advises them to examine the state of their own souls, and see whether they were in the faith... if things were right, they would find a proof of Christ's speaking in him." 
2. "Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you... if they took a survey of things in their own souls, it would appear that Christ was in them."
3. "If they were not in the doctrine of faith, then they were reprobate concerning it, or void of judgment in it; and if they had not the grace of faith, and Christ was not in them, then they were not genuine, but nominal professors."

### John Wesley:
1. "Prove yourselves — Whether ye are such as can, or such as cannot, bear the test - This is the proper meaning of the word which we translate, reprobates."
2. "Know ye not yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you - All Christian believers know this, by the witness and by the fruit of his Spirit."
3. "Some translate the words, Jesus Christ is among you; that is, in the church of Corinth; and understand them of the miraculous gifts and the power of Christ which attended the censures of the apostle."
