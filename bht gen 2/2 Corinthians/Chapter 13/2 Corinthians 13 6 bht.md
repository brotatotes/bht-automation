# 2 Corinthians 13:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By examining and evaluating yourselves, I am confident that you will come to recognize that we, the apostles, are not worthless or false. Rather than relying solely on my claims and authority, I encourage you to test yourselves and see the evidence of our sincerity and truthfulness. As you do so, may you discover the fruits of our labor and the impact of our ministry on your lives and the lives of others.
