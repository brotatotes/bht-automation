# 2 Corinthians 13:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostles find joy in their apparent weakness when the church is strong in their Christian graces. They do not seek to exercise their power in punishment but instead desire that the believers would be perfected in all good things. This perfection involves the restoration and repairing of what is dislocated, an order that the apostles have diligently labored for in the epistles.
