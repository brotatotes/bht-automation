## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἐμαυτῷ, not = παρʼἐμαυτῷ (as most Commentators and E. V.), but ‘dat. commodi,’ for my own sake, as is evident by the consideration in the next verse."
2. "τὸ μὴ πάλιν ἐν λύπῃ πρὸς ὑμᾶς ἐλθεῖν] not again to come to you in grief. This is the only fair rendering of the words; implying, that some former visit had been in grief."
3. "ἐν λύπῃ is explained in 2Co 2:2-3 to mean (so Estius, Bengel, Rückert, Olsh., De Wette, al.) in mutual grief: 'I grieving you (2Co 2:2), and you grieving me' (2Co 2:3): not, as Chrys., al., Paul’s grief alone, nor, as Meyer, al., grief inflicted on them by Paul."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "sorrow"; implying that he had already paid them one visit in sorrow since his coming for the first time to Corinth.
2. At that visit he had warned them "he would not spare if he should come again."
3. The "in heaviness" implies mutual pain; they grieving him, and he them.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I resolved, therefore, to endeavor to remove these evils before I came, that when I did come, my visit might be mutually agreeable to us both."
2. "For that reason I changed my purpose about visiting you, when I heard of those disorders, and resolved to send an epistle."
3. "It was really from no fickleness, but it was from love to them, and a desire that his visit should be mutually agreeable."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Paul, with affectionate tact, puts it as if he had taken this resolution for his own pleasure." 
2. "He refers to the sorrow which his coming would bring to the Church."
3. "Referring to a former unrecorded visit."

### John Calvin:
1. "But I had determined not to come to you any more in sorrow... For he chose rather to give them longer time for repentance." 
2. "The word ἔκρινα (I determined) must be rendered in the pluperfect tense, for, when assigning a reason for the delay that had occurred, he explains what had been his intention previously." 
3. "And indeed we must necessarily render it - I had determined: not I have determined."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But I determined this for myself, that I would not come again to you with sorrow." - This is so plainly a continuance of his explanation of the delay of his expected visit to Corinth.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Either interpretation is possible as the Greek stands and scholars disagree."
2. "There is absolutely no way to tell clearly whether Paul had already made a second visit."
3. "If he had done so, it is a bit odd that he did not plainly say so in 2 Corinthians 1:15 when he is apologizing for not having made the proposed visit ('a second benefit')."

### John Gill:
1. "he would not come with sorrow and heaviness, bewailing their sins not repented of, and by sharp reproofs and censures, which in such a case would be necessary, be the cause of grief and trouble to them"
2. "in his former epistle, which was a sort of coming to them, he made them heavy and sorry, by sharply rebuking them for some disorders that were among them"
3. "as his first coming among them was to the joy of their souls, so it was a determined case with him, that his second coming should not be with grief, either to them or himself, or both"

### John Wesley:
1. In grief — Either on account of the particular offender, or of the church in general.
