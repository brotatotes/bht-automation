# 2 Corinthians 2:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To prevent Satan from robbing us of a penitent believer and causing them to despair and fall away from the faith, we must not let harshness and repulsiveness drive them away. It is crucial that we restore and forgive those who have repented, for the loss of even one soul is a loss for the entire church. We must be aware of Satan's cunning plots and not allow ourselves to be overreached by his attempts to destroy believers. Through knowledge of his devices and vigilance, we can safeguard against his deceitful tactics.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To overreach the victorious servants of Christ in 'destroying the works of the devil,' [Satan] is incessantly devising."
2. "If he cannot prevent the expulsion from all Christian society of one by whose continuance in its fellowship he had hoped to succeed in corrupting it, he will try to persuade you that the case is too bad for pardon and restoration, and thus, driving the man to desperation or recklessness, accomplish his purpose in another way."
3. "Preservation of the openly corrupt in the fellowship of the Church serves his purpose by contaminating the rest and lowering the standard of church purity; but when this fails, the hopelessness of all restoration to the fellowship of the Church and Christian society, even of the manifestly penitent, will equally serve his purpose by either hardening the offender or driving him to despair."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "That no advantage may be gained over us" (ινα μη πλεονεκτηθωμεν). First aorist passive subjunctive after ινα μη (negative purpose) of πλεονεκτεω, old verb from πλεονεκτης, a covetous man (1 Corinthians 5:10), to take advantage of, to gain, to overreach. In N.T. only in 1 Thessalonians 4:6; 2 Corinthians 2:11; 2 Corinthians 7:2; 2 Corinthians 12:17.

"Since the incestuous person had true repentance for his sin, he ought to be forgiven, comforted, and received into the church; lest by too great severity, and a too long continuance of the censure on him, he should be either plunged into despair, or be drawn into a denial of the faith, or into an open scandalous course of wickedness."
3. "This particularly, that he sometimes transforms himself into an angel of light, and under pretense of showing a just indignation against sin, and keeping up a strict and righteous discipline, destroys souls, ruins churches, and brings religion into contempt."

### John Wesley:
