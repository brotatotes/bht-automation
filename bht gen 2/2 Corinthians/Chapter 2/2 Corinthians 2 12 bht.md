# 2 Corinthians 2:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Paul arrived in Troas, he found himself in a favorable situation. There was an open door for him to freely share the Gospel, and people were receptive to his message. The opportunity to preach the good news of Jesus Christ was not to be taken lightly, as it was a work and a duty that Paul delighted in wherever he went. The opening of this door was not a mere coincidence, but a providential act of the Lord, who grants opportunities for His Word to enter and transform hearts.
