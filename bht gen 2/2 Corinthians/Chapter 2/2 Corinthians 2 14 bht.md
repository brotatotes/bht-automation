# 2 Corinthians 2:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God causes us, His ministers of the Gospel, to triumph in Christ, over men, devils, and the world. It is not only a victory, but a public display of His power and glory. Like in a triumphal procession, where incense and perfumes were burned, we spread the sweet aroma of the knowledge of God in every place. Just as strong perfumes have different effects on different people, the fragrance of Christ's victory affects each person in a unique way.

3. "The idea of the Roman triumph is still preserved in this figure. On these occasions the temples were all thrown open, garlands of flowers decorated every shrine and image, and incense smoked on every altar, so that the victor was greeted with a cloud of perfume."

### John Calvin:
1. "He desires from his heart, that whatever is worthy of praise, be recognised as the work of God alone, that his power alone may be extolled."
2. "He sets this holy boasting in opposition to the revilings of the wicked."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Though as good soldiers of Jesus Christ we seemed to be almost everywhere victorious, we feared greatly that Corinth, apparently our most wonderful triumph, was to prove a sad exception; but, blessed be God, it has not been so, but “in every place” even there He makes the sweet savour of the knowledge of Him in Christ, diffused through us, to go up as that of the offering up of an acceptable sacrifice."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
