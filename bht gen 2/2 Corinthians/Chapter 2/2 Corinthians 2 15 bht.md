The preachers of the gospel are a sweet fragrance of Christ to God. God is pleased by this aroma that is spread by them, bringing salvation to those who believe and are saved.

### Henry Alford:

2. "κἂν σώζωνταί τινες, κἂν ἀπολλύωνται, τὸ εὐαγγέλιον μένει ἔχον τὴν οἰκείαν ἀρετήν, κ. ἡμεῖς μένομεν τοῦτο ὄντες ὅπερ ἐσμέν."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "We not only scatter the savor; but 'we are the sweet savor' itself."

3. "As some of the conquered foes led in triumph were put to death when the procession reached the capitol, and to them the smell of the incense was the 'savor of death unto death,' while to those saved alive, it was the 'savor of life,' so the Gospel was to the different classes respectively."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A sweet savor - Like the smell of pleasant incense, or of grateful aromatics...Their labors were acceptable to God; he was pleased with them, and would bestow on them the smiles and proofs of his approbation."
2. "Their desire was to bring all to heaven - and this was acceptable to God...They would be approved by God in proportion to the amount of labor, zeal, and fidelity which they evinced."

2. "Whatever may be the issue of our preaching, it is well-pleasing to God if the Gospel is preached, and it does not detract from the dignity of the Gospel that it does not do good to all. God is glorified even in this, that the Gospel becomes an occasion of ruin to the wicked."
3. "We must always distinguish between the proper office of the Gospel and the accidental one which must be imputed to the depravity of mankind. The Gospel is preached for salvation, but its being an occasion of condemnation to unbelievers arises from their own fault."
