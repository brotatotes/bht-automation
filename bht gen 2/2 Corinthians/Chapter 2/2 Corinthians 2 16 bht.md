3. "Just as the procession was ascending the Capitoline Hill, some of the captive chiefs were taken into the adjoining prison and put to death.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "the one class, already 'dead in trespasses and sins,' sinking deeper, and approaching nearer, by every successive resistance of the truth, to 'the second death;' the other, already 'alive unto God through Jesus Christ,' and through faith in His name, having that 'life' invigorated and developed by every successive welcome given to the word of life ministered by us, towards that goal where, as 'life eternal,' it shall need no more of our help."
2. "The idea here expressed, though indicated in 2 Corinthians 7:10 ('Godly sorrow worketh repentance unto salvation') and in 1 Corinthians 1:18 and other places, is nowhere so explicitly and solemnly expressed as here."

2. "The ill report of the Gospel from men dead in sin, brings death to those who give credit to it; and the good report of it from God, the author of life, to which may be added from ministers, who are alive in a spiritual sense, is the means of life to others."
