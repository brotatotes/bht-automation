# 2 Corinthians 2:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul contrasts himself with those who corrupt or dilute the word of God.

In doing so, he acknowledges that although he speaks with his own tongue, the power behind his words comes from God.

1. "Paul had such a deep sense of the responsibility of the ministerial office, and of its necessary influence on the eternal destiny of man, that it led him to preach the simple gospel, the pure word of God."
2. "The gospel has been usually corrupted in these ways: attempting to attach a philosophical explanation to the facts of revelation, trying to explain away the offensive points of revelation by the aid of philosophy, and applying a mode of interpretation to the Bible which would fritter away its meaning."
3. "There is no joy on earth of a higher and purer character than that which the ministers of the gospel have in the success of their work. In the evidence that God accepts their labors, and that to many his message is a savor of life unto life, there is a joy which no other pursuit can furnish."

### Marvin Vincent:

1. "But many on false grounds arrogate the same thing to themselves, who will be found to have nothing in common with me. For they adulterate the word of the Lord, which I dispense with the greatest faithfulness and sincerity for the edification of the Church."
2. "For the doctrine of God is corrupted in two ways. It is corrupted in a direct way, when it is mixed up with falsehood and lies, so as to be no longer the pure and genuine doctrine of God, but is falsely commended under that title. It is corrupted indirectly, when, although retaining its purity, it is turned hither and thither to please men, and is disfigured by unseemly disguises, by way of hunting after favor."
