# 2 Corinthians 2:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle expresses his concern over causing sorrow in the Corinthians, understanding that his own joy is intertwined with their spiritual well-being. He desires their happiness and comfort after any necessary discipline. He seeks their repentance and obedience, as their obedience would bring him joy. He acknowledges that if his rebuke brings sorrow, their repentance and restoration would be the source of his gladness. Ultimately, his joy is contingent on the spiritual prosperity of the church.
