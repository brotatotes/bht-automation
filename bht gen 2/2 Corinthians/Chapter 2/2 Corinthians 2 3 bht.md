# 2 Corinthians 2:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In my previous letter, I made known to you my decision not to come to you in sorrow, but to address the issue in writing. This was done with the intention of giving you an opportunity to repent and make the necessary changes before my arrival, so that our meeting would be a source of joy rather than sorrow. My aim was not to cause you grief, but to demonstrate the depth of my love and affection for you.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The words 'this same'...refer to what he had written to them in the former Epistle, particularly to what he had written in regard to the incestuous person, requiring them to excommunicate him."
