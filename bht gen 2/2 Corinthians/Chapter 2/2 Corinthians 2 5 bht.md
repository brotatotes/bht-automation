## BHT:
He hath grieved me, but not completely—only partially. I still rejoice over the majority of you. If I were to place the blame on all of you, it would burden you.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "He hath not grieved me (alone and principally) but only in part (having grieved you also), that I may not lay the fault on all of you."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "that I may not overcharge—that I may not unduly lay the weight of the charge on you all" - ALFORD
2. "He hath not made sorry me, but in part (that I press not too heavily; namely, on him) you all" - ALFORD

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He did not harshly charge him with sin; he did not use any abusive or severe epithets; but he gently insinuates that he 'had caused grief;' he had pained the hearts of his brethren."
2. "He has grieved me only in common with others, and as a part of the church of Christ. All have common cause of grief; and I have no interest in it which is not common to you all."
3. "But I would not charge the whole church with it; or seem to bear hard on them, or overcharge them with lack of zeal for their purity, or unwillingness to remove the evil."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Not that Paul did not grieve over the offender; but he desires to emphasize the fact that the injury caused by the sin was not to him personally, but to the Church."
2. "Overcharge, however, is not incorrect, though possibly ambiguous in the light of the various uses of charge. Charge is from the Latin carrus a wagon. Compare the low Latin carricare to load a wagon, and carica a freight - ship. Hence charge is a load; compare the interchange of charge and load applied to the contents of a gun."
3. "Thus you all depends upon he hath caused sorrow, not upon that I press not too heavily upon. Render, as Rev., He hath caused sorrow, not to me, but in part (that I press not too heavily) to you all."

### John Calvin:
1. "He hath not grieved me alone, but almost all of you. And as to my saying in part, I do so in order that I may not bear too hard upon him."
2. "But if any one (meaning the incestuous person) have occasioned sorrow, he hath not so much grieved me, as, in some measure (that I may not bear too hard upon him) all of you."
3. "'That I may not say anything too severe,' i.e., 'that I may not say - us alone.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But if any hath caused sorrow, he hath caused sorrow, not to me, but in part to you all."
2. "This is somewhat obscurely expressed, but the emphatic 'me' seems to give the meaning thus."
3. "The wrong has been done, not to me, but to some extent to you all."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In both cases Paul shows delicacy of feeling by not mentioning the name." 
2. "The whole Corinthian Church has been injured in part by this man's wrongdoing." 
3. "He does not wish to give pain by too severe language."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle now rejoiced, that he was truly humbled for his sin, and sincerely, and in an evangelical manner, repented of it; his grief was over, and it was as if it was not; and the offence he took was now wholly removed."
2. "They also greatly added to it by their unconcernedness of him, and negligence in reproving him, though he takes notice only of this single man."
3. "He hath not grieved me, but in part, or in some measure... almost all of you."
