# 2 Corinthians 2:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
With great compassion, Paul addresses the offender, refusing to mention their name or the specific sin. He emphasizes the effectiveness of the punishment inflicted, which was intended to bring about repentance. Now that signs of genuine remorse have been shown, it is time to remove the punishment and restore the individual to the fellowship of believers. Paul's approach shows his desire for the restoration and redemption of those who have fallen, rather than simply condemning and casting them aside.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This punishment (= ἐπιτίμιον, see reff.): what it was, we are unable with certainty to say; but 1 Corinthians 5:0 seems to point to excommunication as forming at least a part of it."
2. "But it was not a formal and public, only a voluntary individual abstinence from communion with him, as is shown by ὑπὸ τῶν πλειόνων: the anti-pauline party probably refusing compliance with the Apostle’s command."
3. "ἱκανόν] enough, not in duration, though that would be the case, but in magnitude: sufficient, as having produced its desired effect, penitence."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Sufficient—without increasing it, which would only drive him to despair, whereas the object of the punishment was, 'that (his) spirit might be saved' in the last day." 
2. "Rather, it expresses estrangement from such a one who had caused such grief to the Church, and scandal to religion."
3. "Not by an individual priest, as in the Church of Rome, nor by the bishops and clergy alone, but by the whole body of the Church."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The punishment which they had inflicted on him was 'sufficient.'"
2. "Paul conducts this subject here with very great tenderness and delicacy."
3. "The expression proves beyond a doubt that the whole body of the society was concerned in the act of the excommunication, and that is a proper way of administering discipline."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Many [των πλειονων] . Rev., correctly, the many : the majority of the Church.

### John Calvin:
1. "He now extends kindness even to the man who had sinned more grievously than the others, and on whose account his anger had been kindled against them all."
2. "In his showing indulgence even to one who was deserving of severer punishment, the Corinthians have a striking instance to convince them, how much he disliked excessive harshness."
3. "There is need of strictness, in order that the wicked may not be rendered more daring by impunity, which is justly pronounced an allurement to vice. But on the other hand, as there is a danger of the person, who is chastised, becoming dispirited, moderation must be used as to this — so that the Church shall be prepared to extend forgiveness, so soon as she is fully satisfied as to his penitence."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Sufficient to such a man is this punishment inflicted by the many."
2. "In presence of the gathered congregation, as directed expressly in 1 Corinthians 5:4."

3. "If Paul refers to the case in 2 Corinthians 2:1, they had taken his advice and expelled the offender."

### John Gill:
1. "Sufficient to such a man is this punishment... inasmuch as there appeared signs of true repentance, it was sufficient, it had answered the purpose for which it was inflicted, and therefore it was high time to remove it."
2. "From whence we learn, that in case of gross enormities, there ought to be a public excommunication; and that this is to be done by the vote, and with the consent of the whole church, or the major part of it."
3. "In process of time, when the person thus dealt with has given the church satisfaction as to the truth and genuineness of his repentance, the censure ought to be taken off and he be cordially received into the communion of the church again."

### John Wesley:
