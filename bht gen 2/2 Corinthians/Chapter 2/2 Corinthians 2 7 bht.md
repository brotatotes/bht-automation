# 2 Corinthians 2:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
So, rather than continuing to punish and hold grudges against the offender, the apostle suggests that they should instead forgive and comfort him. They should restore him to the communion of the church, allowing him to fully participate in the privileges and ordinances of the house of God. By doing so, they prevent the dangerous consequences of excessive sorrow and despair, and they fulfill their duty as the communities of Christ to bring people to a sense of sin and amendment of life.
