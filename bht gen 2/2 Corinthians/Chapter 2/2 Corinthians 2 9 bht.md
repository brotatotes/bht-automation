# 2 Corinthians 2:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In writing, the author desired to test the obedience of the recipients, to see whether they would be obedient in all matters. The purpose was to make an experiment of their fidelity and to give them the opportunity to demonstrate their proof. The main intention was to ascertain whether they were disposed to be obedient in every aspect, thus revealing their tried quality. Ultimately, their obedience to spiritual authority was crucial, and their careful attention and adherence to God's word was of utmost importance.
