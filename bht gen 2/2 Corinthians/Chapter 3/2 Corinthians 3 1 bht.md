# 2 Corinthians 3:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do we really need to speak in our own praise and commend ourselves to you again? Some people may have doubted us and asked for letters of recommendation, but we are not like those who rely on human commendation. Our character, ministry, and the power of God's grace working through us are well known. We do not need to boast about ourselves, for our lives and actions speak for themselves.

2. "Paul convicts them of a greedy desire for glory, inasmuch as they endeavored to acquire favor through the suffrages of men."
3. "Two things, however, are required here — first, that it be not a recommendation that is elicited by flattery, but an altogether unbiassed testimony; and secondly, that it be not given for the purpose of procuring advancement for the individual, but simply that it may be the means of promoting the advancement of Christ’s kingdom."
