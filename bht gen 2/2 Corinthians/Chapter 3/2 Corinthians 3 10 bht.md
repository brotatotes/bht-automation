# 2 Corinthians 3:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The glory of the law, though real and significant, is eclipsed by the surpassing glory of the Gospel. The Gospel excels in every aspect, from its author, the Lord Jesus Christ, to the love, grace, and mercy of God revealed through it. In comparison, the law pales in significance, as the greater light of the Gospel swallows up the lesser light of the law.
