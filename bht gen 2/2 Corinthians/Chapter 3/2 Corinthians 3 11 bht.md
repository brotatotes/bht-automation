# 2 Corinthians 3:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For if the temporary glory of the old ministry was magnificent, then surely the abiding glory of the new ministry surpasses it by far. The old ministry, represented by the transitory and fading glory, has been brought to an end, making way for the permanent and glorious ministry of the Spirit. The contrast between the two ministries reveals the superiority and permanence of the Gospel, which is designed to remain unchanged throughout all ages.
