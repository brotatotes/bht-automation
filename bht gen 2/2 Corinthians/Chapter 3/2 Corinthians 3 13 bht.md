# 2 Corinthians 3:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Moses, after speaking with God, would put a veil over his face. This act, along with his commandments to the people, made it difficult to look intently upon him. The purpose of the veil was not to hide or conceal the radiance but to prevent the Israelites from seeing it fade away. It symbolized the obscurity of the law and the veiled economy under which the Israelites lived. The glory of the gospel, like the shining of Moses' face, remained hidden to unbelievers until the Spirit came to take away the veil and reveal the surpassing glory of Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The opposition is twofold: (1) between the vailed and the unvailed ministry, quoad the mere fact of concealment in the one case, and openness in the other: (2) between the ministry which was suspended by the vailing, that its τέλος might not be seen, and that which proceeds ἀπὸ δόξης εἰς δόξαν, having no termination."
2. "On the common interpretation, Commentators have found an almost insuperable difficulty in πρὸς τὸ μὴ ἀτ. The usual escape from it has been to render it, 'so that the Israelities could not,' as in 2 Corinthians 3:7."
3. "In the τέλος τοῦ καταργ . we must not think, as some Commentators have done, of Christ (Rom 10:4), any further than it may be hinted in the background that when the law came to an end, He appeared."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The veil was the symbol of concealment, put on directly after Moses' speaking; so that God's revelations by him were interrupted by intervals of concealment."
2. "Paul here passes from the literal fact to the truth symbolized by it, the blindness of Jews and Judaizers to the ultimate end of the law."
3. "The evangelical glory of the law, like the shining of Moses' face, cannot be borne by a carnal people, and therefore remains veiled to them until the Spirit comes to take away the veil."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Our conduct is not like that of Moses. We make no attempt to conceal anything in regard to the nature, design, and duration of the gospel. We leave nothing designedly in mystery."
2. "He put off this veil whenever he went to speak with God, but put on again when he delivered his commands to the people...which made it difficult to look intently upon him."
3. "There was a splendor and a glory in the gospel which the Mosaic institutions were designed to typify, which was so great that the children of Israel were not fully prepared to see it, and that he designedly threw over that glory the veil of obscure types and figures."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The true sense of the Hebrew is given by the Sept. : 'When he ceased speaking he put a veil on his face;' not because the Israelites could not endure the radiance, but that they should not see it fade away."
2. "The end of this, which the veil prevented the Israelites from seeing, was the disappearance of the glory - the type of the termination of Moses ' ministry."
3. "Paul 's comparison is between the ministry of Moses, interrupted by intervals of concealment, and the gospel ministry, which is marked by frank and full proclamation."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul is not reasoning as to the intention of Moses... the fault was on the part of the people."
2. "Nothing, therefore, is said here to the dishonor of Moses, for he was not required to do more than the commission that was assigned to him called for."
3. "That bluntness, or that weak and obtuse vision, of which Paul is now speaking, is confined to unbelievers exclusively, because the law though wrapped up in figures, did nevertheless impart wisdom to babes."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "No one would naturally read the passage so, and it is far from natural; nor does the apostle say this." 
2. "He says that Moses veiled his face that they 'might not look stedfastly unto the end (τ ὸ τέλος) of that which was passing away;'"
3. "To them it behoved to be a veiled economy, like the veiled face of the lawgiver while giving it forth to them."

3. "The Authorized Version had a wrong translation here as if to hide the glory on his face" - The Authorized Version had a wrong translation here.

### John Gill:
1. "It was an emblem of the Gospel being veiled under the law, and of the darkness and obscurity of the law in the business of life and salvation."
2. "And also of the future blindness of the Jews, when the glory of the Gospel should break forth in the times of Christ and his apostles."
3. "To him they could not look, nor could they see him to be the fulfilling end of the law for righteousness; which being fulfilled, is done away by him."

### John Wesley:
1. "And we do not act as Moses did, who put a veil over his face - Which is to be understood with regard to his writings also."
2. "The whole Mosaic dispensation tended to, and terminated in, him; but the Israelites had only a dim, wavering sight of him, of whom Moses spake in an obscure, covert manner."
3. "So that the children of Israel could not look steadfastly to the end of that dispensation which is now abolished - The end of this was Christ."
