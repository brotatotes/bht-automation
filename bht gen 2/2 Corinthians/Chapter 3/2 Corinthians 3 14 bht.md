# 2 Corinthians 3:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jews' minds were hardened and veiled, preventing them from understanding the true meaning of the Old Testament. This veil of ignorance remained on their understanding, not allowing even a glimmer of light. It was not the physical veil on Moses' face, but the veil on the reading of the Old Testament and the hearts of unbelievers. However, this veil is done away in Christ, and is lifted from the hearts of those who truly believe in Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Not only was there a veil on Moses’s face, to prevent more being known, but also their understandings were darkened: there was, besides, a veil on their hearts." 
2. "The book is the same to all: the difference between those who understand and those who do not understand is now a subjective difference - the veil is no longer on the face of the speaker, but on the heart of the reader." 
3. "The present day the same veil remains at the reading of the Old Testament, the discovery not being made that it is done away in Christ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The veil on Moses' face is further typical of the veil that is on their hearts."
2. "The same veil . . . remaineth untaken away, so that they do not see THAT it is done away in Christ."
3. "The veil therefore remains untaken away from them, because they will not come to Christ, who does away with the law as a mere letter."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Paul refers here to the fact that the understandings of the Jews were stupid, dull, and insensible, so that they did not see clearly the design and end of their own institutions."
2. "Even to the time when Paul wrote, it was a characteristic of the great mass of the Jewish people, that they did not understand the true sense of their own Scriptures."
3. "In the manifestation, or appearance of Jesus the Messiah, the veil is removed. The obscurity which rested on the prophecies and types of the former dispensation is withdrawn; and as the face of Moses could have been distinctly seen if the veil on his face had been removed, so it is in regard to the true meaning of the Old Testament by the coming of the Messiah."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word occurs but once outside of this epistle, Philippians 4:7."
2. "There is a veil over their minds when the law is read, as there was over Moses' face."
3. "The veil remains on their hearts, since it is not revealed to them that the Mosaic economy is done away in Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "That veil with which Moses covered his face, when publishing the law, was the emblem of a stupidity, that would come upon that people, and would continue upon them for a long period."
2. "The Jews turn away their eyes as much as they can from Christ. It is not therefore to be wondered, if they see nothing, refusing as they do to behold the sun."
3. "Let, however, the reason of this blindness deter us from contempt of Christ, which God so grievously punishes. In the mean time, let us learn, that without Christ, the Sun of righteousness, there is no light even in the law, or in the whole word of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Their minds were hardened, they were of blunted spiritual perception." 
2. "Until this very day at the reading of the old covenant, the same veil remaineth unlifted." 
3. "Which veil is done away in Christ, He being 'the end of the law,' the key to all its enigmas, the substance of all its shadows."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "But their minds were hardened." (Their thoughts literally. Petrify, to cover with thick skin.)
2. "Of the old covenant." (The Old Testament. Ancient, in contrast to fresh.)
3. "The same veil. Not that identical veil, but one that has the same effect, that blinds their eyes to the light in Christ." (This is the tragedy of modern Judaism.)

### John Gill:
1. "The Jews in the times of the Gospel had their minds so blinded, that they could not behold the glory of the Gospel, nor Christ the end of the law." 
2. "The veil of blindness, darkness, and ignorance, upon the hearts of the Jews...in the reading of the Old Testament...they understood not."
3. "The veil is done away in Christ; can only be removed by Christ, by his Spirit and grace, and through the light of the Gospel of Christ, shining into the heart."

### John Wesley:
1. "The same veil remaineth on their understanding unremoved - Not so much as folded back, (so the word implies,) so as to admit a little, glimmering light."
2. "On the public reading of the Old Testament - The veil is not now on the face of Moses or of his writings, but on the reading of them, and on the heart of them that believe not."
3. "Which is taken away in Christ — That is, from the heart of them that truly believe on him."
