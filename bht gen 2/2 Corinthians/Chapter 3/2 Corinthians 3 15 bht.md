# 2 Corinthians 3:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The veil still remains over their understanding when they read Moses, the Old Testament scriptures. This veil represents their spiritual blindness and ignorance of Christ and the Gospel. They are unable to see the true meaning and beauty of their own scriptures, and instead, they prioritize their traditions over the written law of Moses. This description accurately applies to the Jews both in Paul's time and even in the present day. They have chosen to remain in darkness, rejecting the truth that is revealed in Jesus Christ.
