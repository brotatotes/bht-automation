# 2 Corinthians 3:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When their hearts turn to the Lord Jesus Christ, the veil that obscures their understanding of the Scriptures is taken away. In that moment, they see the true meaning of the prophecies and the institutions of Israel. The removal of the veil is not merely a physical act; it is a spiritual transformation that allows for a correct interpretation of the Bible. By turning to God and communing with His Spirit, they can experience a deeper understanding of the Scriptures, no longer bound by the dead letter but embracing the Spirit of the old covenant.
