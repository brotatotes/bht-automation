# 2 Corinthians 3:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As believers in Christ, we have the privilege of beholding His glory in the mirror of the gospel. This mirror reflects not just the outward appearance of the Lord, but the radiance of His glorious love. As we fix our eyes on His glory displayed in the gospel, our own faces begin to shine, and we do not need to veil them. Instead, we reflect His glory as we continually grow in our understanding and appreciation of His presence and grace.

	image—namely, the image of Christ's glory, spiritually now
	(Romans 8:29; 1 John 3:3);

	image of Christ more or less: a proof of the truth of Christianity."
