# 2 Corinthians 3:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Corinthians, as converted subjects of Paul's ministry, are an Epistle of Christ. Through the work of Christ, their hearts have been transformed and now bear witness to the faith within them. This testimony, written not with ink but by the Spirit of God, holds more value than any inscription on stone. It is a living, permanent testament to the work of God in their lives, a fulfillment of the promises made in the Old Testament. All those who see them can read Christ in them, as their conversion is a tangible proclamation of His power and grace.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "an Epistle of Christ (i.e. written by Christ, not, as Chrys. al., concerning Christ: He is the Recommender of us, the Head of the church and Sender of us His ministers)"
2. "the Corinthian converts, on whose hearts Christ had written it by His Spirit"
3. "On the tables of stone and of flesh, see Exod. as above; Proverbs 3:3; Proverbs 7:3; Jeremiah 31:31-34, and on the contrast, also here hinted at in the background, between the heart of stone and the heart of flesh, Ezekiel 11:19; Ezekiel 36:26."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Being manifestly shown to be an Epistle of Christ"; a letter coming manifestly from Christ, and "ministered by us," that is, carried about and presented by us as its (ministering) bearers to those (the world) for whom it is intended: Christ is the Writer and the Recommender, ye are the letter recommending us.
2. Christ's Epistle (His believing members converted by Paul) is better still: it is written not merely with the finger, but with the "Spirit of the living God"; it is not the "ministration of death" as the law, but of the "living Spirit" that "giveth life".
3. "On [your] hearts [which are] tables of flesh." Once your hearts were spiritually what the tables of the law were physically, tables of stone, but God has "taken away the stony heart out of your flesh, given you a heart of flesh".

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Your conversion is his work, and it is his public attestation to our fidelity in his cause."
2. "By the Spirit of God moving on the heart, and producing that variety of graces which constitute so striking and so beautiful an evidence of your conversion."
3. "This testimonial was of more value than an inscription on stone, because: (1) No hand but that of God could reach the heart, and inscribe these truths there. (2) Because it would be attended with a life-giving and living influence. It was not a mere dead letter. (3) Because it would be permanent."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "you, as the converted subjects of our ministry, are an epistle of Christ."
2. "The Spirit. Instead of ink."
3. "tables which are hearts of flesh."

### John Calvin:
1. "He says that the Epistle of which he speaks was written by Christ, inasmuch as the faith of the Corinthians was his work."
2. "The antitheses here employed — ink and Spirit, stones and heart — give no small degree of weight to his statements, by way of amplification."
3. "Paul says, that this blessing was accomplished through means of his preaching. Hence it abundantly appears, that he is a faithful minister of the New Covenant — which is a legitimate testimony in favor of his apostleship."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "All who see you may read Christ in you."
2. "By the change wrought through us, 'We wrote Christ on your character.'"
3. "The contrast between this and the same laws as written on the heart is precisely that which both Jeremiah and Ezekiel had predicted as the grand point of contrast between the old and the new economy."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "An epistle of Christ (επιστολη Χριστου). He turns the metaphor round and round. They are Christ's letter to men as well as Paul's."
2. "Not with ink (ου μελαν). Instrumental case of μελας, black. Plato uses το μελαν for ink as here. See also 2 John 1:12; 3 John 1:13."
3. "Of flesh (σαρκιναις). 'Fleshen' as in 1 Corinthians 3:1; Romans 7:14."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ was the author and dictator; yea, he himself is the very matter, sum, substance, and subject of the epistle."
2. "They are made use of to show the sinner the black characters which are written upon him, and that what is written in him, and to be read by him, by the light of nature is not sufficient for salvation."
3. "These epistles are not written with ink; of nature's power, or of rhetorical eloquence and moral persuasion; but with the Spirit of the living God."

### John Wesley:
1. "Manifestly declared to be the letter of Christ - which he has formed and published to the world."
2. "Written not in tables of stone - like the ten commandments. But in the tender, living tables of their hearts - God having taken away the hearts of stone and given them hearts of flesh."
