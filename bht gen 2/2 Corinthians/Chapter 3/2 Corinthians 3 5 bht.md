# 2 Corinthians 3:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We do not possess within ourselves the ability or power to think or accomplish anything of value. Our sufficiency comes solely from God, who is the source of all our abilities and capacities. Every good thought, word, and action is dependent on Him, and without His grace and enabling, we are utterly incapable. We must humbly acknowledge our dependency on God and recognize that it is through His power that anything good can be achieved.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We are not able to think anything of ourselves, as if from ourselves."
2. "Our ability is from God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Not that we are (even yet after so long experience as ministers) sufficient to think anything OF ourselves as (coming) FROM ourselves; but our sufficiency is (derived) FROM God."
2. "We cannot expect too little from man, or too much from God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He well knew that he had no such self-sufficiency; and he would not insinuate, in the slightest manner, that he believed himself to be invested with any such power."
2. "Paul did not feel that he was sufficient of himself to have reasoned or thought out the truths of the gospel. They were communicated by God."
3. "All our sufficiency in [clear thinking] is from God; and that we owe to him every clear idea on the subjects of common life, and on scientific subjects, no less certainly than we do in the truths of religion."

### John Calvin:
1. "Now we see, that he leaves man nothing. For the smallest part, in a manner, of a good work is thought...he does not allow us even this."
2. "Paul, on the other hand, declares that man is in want, not merely of sufficiency of himself, but also of competency which would be equivalent to fitness if such a term were in use among the Latins. He could not, therefore, more effectually strip man bare of everything good."
3. "How can we oblige him by any act, since, in every part of it, it is from him, not from ourselves? For as thinking is the first requisite, so it is perpetually requisite to the progress of any rational act, so that every thought in any act, and the whole progress, wherein there must be a whole flood of thoughts, is from the sufficiency of God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Starting from ourselves...He has no originating power for such confidence."
2. "As from ourselves...He says it over again with preposition εξ (out of)."
3. "He has no originating power for such confidence."

### John Gill:
1. "We do not ascribe anything to ourselves, to any power of ours, to any self-sufficiency in us."
2. "We are not sufficient of ourselves neither for the work of the ministry, nor for the conversion of sinners, nor for faith and hope in God, nor for any spiritual work whatever."
3. "Our sufficiency is of God; to think, to speak, and to act for his glory."

### John Wesley:
1. Not that we are sufficient of ourselves — So much as to think one good thought; much less, to convert sinners.
