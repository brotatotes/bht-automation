# 2 Corinthians 3:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The sufficiency and fitness for ministry are not of our own making but are from God. The difference between the old and new covenants is stark, with the former being marked by the mere letter and the latter by the life-giving Spirit. The law, when taken in its literal sense, produces condemnation and death, while the gospel brings spiritual and eternal life. Our reliance should be on God's grace rather than our own efforts to fulfill the law.
