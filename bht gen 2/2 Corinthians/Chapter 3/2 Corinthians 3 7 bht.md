# 2 Corinthians 3:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Mosaic Law, represented by the engraven stones, was a ministration of death and condemnation. Its glory was manifested in the miraculous events and the radiant face of Moses, yet this glory was temporary. In contrast, the Gospel, ministered by the Spirit, is an eternal and glorious covenant. By pointing out the contrast between the transitory glory of the law and the permanent glory of the Gospel, we understand the superior and enduring nature of God's redemptive plan.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The ministration of death in the letter...engraven on stones...was constituted in glory...so that the sons of Israel could not fix their eyes on...the face of Moses, on account of the glory of his face, which was transitory."
2. "The ministration of the Spirit...be...in glory."
3. "The Spirit is the principle of life, whereas the Law only led to death."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The ministration of deathâ€”the legal dispensation, summed up in the Decalogue, which denounces death against man for transgression."
2. "The literal precepts of the law as only bringing us the knowledge of sin and 'death,' in contrast to 'the Spirit' in the Gospel bringing us 'life'."
3. "The 'glory of Moses' countenance' on Sinai passed away when the occasion was over: a type of the transitory character of the dispensation which he represented, as contrasted with the permanency of the Christian dispensation."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The design of the whole is, to illustrate the nature, and to show the importance of the ministerial office; and the manner in which the duties of that office were to be performed."
2. "It is called the 'ministration of death,' because it tended to condemnation; it did not speak of pardon; it was suited only to deepen the sense of sin, and to produce alarm and dread."
3. "Paul certainly means to say, that the glory of Moses, and of his dispensation, was a fading glory; but that the glory of the gospel would be permanent, and increasing forever."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The ministration of death is that of Moses, and does not apply to his entire career as Israel's lawgiver, but to his particular ministry in receiving on Sinai and transmitting to the people the law of God."
2. "The ministration may be said to have been graven on stones, since the whole purport of that economy which he represented was contained in the tables, and he was its minister in being the agent through whom God delivered it to the people."
3. "A glory passed from God to Moses, so that his face became shining."

### John Calvin:
1. "The law was rendered illustrious by many miracles... that splendour was a token of the glory of the law."
2. "The gospel, therefore, is a holy and inviolable covenant, because it was contracted by the Spirit of God, acting as security."
3. "The law was engraven on stones, and hence it was a literal doctrine... The gospel, on the other hand, by which men are regenerated, and are reconciled to God, through the free remission of their sins, is the ministry of righteousness, and, consequently, of life also."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The ministration of death...becomes to us a ministration of death." 
2. "The glory...expressive of the righteous claims of Jehovah on His reasonable creatures."
3. "The glory of his face...expressive only of what was transitory."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The letter kills."

### John Gill:
1. "This law, though thus written and engraven, and glorious, it was 'the ministration of death'." 
2. "There were many things which made it so; but what the apostle here particularly takes notice of is the glory that was upon the face of Moses, when he received it and brought it from the Lord, which was very great."
3. "This glory was put there to bear a testimony to the divine authority of the law, that it came from God, and was to be received at the hands of Moses, with awful reverence as from God."

### John Wesley:
1. "The Mosaic dispensation...was attended with so great glory."
