# 2 Corinthians 3:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Christian dispensation, also known as the ministration of the Spirit, is a glorious ministry that surpasses the ministration of death brought by the law. Through the preaching of the Gospel, the Holy Spirit is imparted to believers, bringing spiritual blessings and transforming hearts. This ministry is marked by the power of the Spirit, who not only imparts truth but also dwells within believers, enlightening, comforting, and building them up in faith. As a result, the Christian dispensation is more glorious and life-giving than the Old Testament law.
