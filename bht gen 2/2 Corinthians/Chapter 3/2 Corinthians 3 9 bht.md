# 2 Corinthians 3:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The ministration of condemnation, represented by the Mosaic law, was glorious in its own right. However, it fell short of salvation, serving to condemn rather than save. The law exposed sin and pronounced guilt but offered no means of pardon. In contrast, the ministration of righteousness in the Gospel reveals and imparts God's righteousness to believers through faith in Christ. This is the surpassing glory of the Gospel, which justifies and saves lost sinners. The law condemns, but the Gospel brings forth righteousness and life. This stark contrast highlights the superiority of the Gospel over the law.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For if the ministration of condemnation was glory, much more does the ministration of righteousness abound in glory."
2. "The ministration of condemnation, because the Law detects and condemns sin: the ministration of righteousness, because therein the righteousness of God is revealed and imparted by faith."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The law regarded in the 'letter' which 'killeth.'" 
2. "The Gospel, which especially reveals the righteousness of God and imputes righteousness to men through faith in Christ."
3. "Imparts righteousness by the Spirit."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Law condemns the guilty; it does not save them. It denounces punishment; it contains no provisions of pardon."
2. "The tendency of the Mosaic institutions, therefore, was to produce a sense of condemnation. And so it will be found by all who attempt to be justified by the Law. It will tend to, and result in, their condemnation."
3. "The superior glory of the gospel, therefore, consists in the fact that it is a scheme to justify and save lost sinners. And this glory consists...in the effects, or results. The one condemns; the other justifies and saves."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Ministration of condemnation. Because Moses was the minister of the law. For the relation of the law to sin and condemnation, see Romans 5:20; Romans 7:7-13.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For if the ministration of condemnation is glory the law is glorious, even though in our case its effect is condemnation, much rather doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory."
2. "Mark how the true sense of the important word 'righteousness' here fixes itself by the contrast in the verse; for just as the one economy is first said to be that of 'death,' the other that of 'life,' so here the same contrast is presented as that of 'condemnation' by the law and 'righteousness' by the Gospel, which obviously means 'justifying righteousness.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul freely admits the glory for the old dispensation." 
2. "Marked by and leading to righteousness."
3. "Instrumental case, by much more."

### John Gill:
1. "The law is 'the ministration of condemnation'; as sin is a transgression of the law, it accuses for it, convinces of it, pronounces guilty, and adjudges to death on account of it; which is the condemnation it ministers."
2. "The Gospel is the ministration of righteousness; not of a legal one, or a man's own, but of the righteousness of Christ, by which the law is honoured, justice is satisfied, and God's elect justified from all sin and condemnation."
3. "Now as much more as righteousness exceeds condemnation, and a justified state a condemned one, so much more does the Gospel exceed the law in glory."

### John Wesley:
1. "The ministration of condemnation â€” Such the Mosaic dispensation proved to all the Jews who rejected the gospel whereas through the gospel (hence called the ministration of righteousness) God both imputed and imparted righteousness to all believers."
2. "But how can the moral law (which alone was engraven on stone) be the ministration of condemnation, if it requires no more than a sincere obedience, such as is proportioned to our infirm state?"
3. "If this is sufficient to justify us, then the law ceases to be a ministration of condemnation. It becomes (flatly contrary to the apostle's doctrine) the ministration of righteousness."
