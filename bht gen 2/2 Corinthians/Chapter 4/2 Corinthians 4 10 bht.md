# 2 Corinthians 4:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Always bearing in our mortal bodies the sufferings and trials we endure for the sake of Jesus. We are united with Christ, so whatever harm or persecution we face, it is as if it is happening to him. Through our sufferings, we show that Jesus, though he died, is now risen and lives on, interceding on our behalf. In our trials, we manifest the life of Jesus and the hope of our own resurrection.
