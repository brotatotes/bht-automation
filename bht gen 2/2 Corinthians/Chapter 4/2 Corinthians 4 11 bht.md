# 2 Corinthians 4:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For we who are still alive constantly face the threat of death, always on the brink of destruction. Yet, we willingly embrace this vulnerability in order to bear witness to Jesus and to reveal His life in our mortal bodies. It is through this paradoxical experience of being delivered unto death that we hope to attain a greater resurrection.
