# 2 Corinthians 4:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Death works in us, but life in you. We, as believers, experience the sufferings for the sake of Christ, while you, as a church, experience the abundant spiritual life through Him. We may face trials and even death in our faith, but we are compelled to share the message of the Gospel, whether in life or in death, because of our unwavering belief.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "the trials by which the dying of Jesus is exhibited in us, are exclusively and peculiarly OUR OWN, whereas the life, whereof we are to be witnesses, extends beyond ourselves, nay finds its field of action and energizing IN YOU."
2. "LIFE, in both places, being the higher and spiritual life, including the lower and natural."
3. "And, in our relative positions, of this life, YE are the examples, a church of believers, alive to God through Christ in your various vocations, and not called on to be θεατριζόμενοι as WE are, who are (not indeed excluded from that life, nay it flows from us to you, but are) more especially examples of conformity to the death of our common Lord: in whom DEATH WORKS."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The 'death' of Christ manifested in the continual 'perishing of our outward man' works peculiarly in us." 
2. "The life whereof we witness in our bodily dying, extends beyond ourselves, and is brought by our very dying to you."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The preaching of the gospel exposes us to trials which may be regarded as death working in us."
2. "You reap the advantage of all our exposure to trials, and of all our sufferings."
3. "The sufferings and self-denials of the apostles were for the good of others, and would result in their benefit and salvation."

### John Calvin:
1. "It was also necessary that the folly of the Corinthians should be reproved...held in contempt the servants of Christ, because they were not so effeminate."
2. "Now as death denotes all afflictions, or a life full of vexations, so also life denotes a condition that is prosperous and agreeable."
3. "Life is - not to live, but to be well."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Death worketh in us (ο θανατος εν ημιν ενεργειτα)." 
2. "Physical death works in him while spiritual life (paradox) works in them."

### John Gill:

2. "Our flesh, our bodies are mortal, dying off apace; death has already attacked us, is working on our constitutions gradually, and unpinning our tabernacles."
3. "What we get by preaching the Gospel are reproach, persecution, and death; but this Gospel we preach at such expense is the savour of life unto life to you, and is the means of maintaining spiritual life in your souls, and of nourishing you up unto eternal life."
