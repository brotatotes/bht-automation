# 2 Corinthians 4:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As believers, we share the same spirit of faith that the saints of old possessed. Just like David, who trusted in God and proclaimed his faith, we also boldly speak out of our conviction. In the face of affliction and even death, we preach the gospel, knowing that God will raise us up and present us blameless before Him. This reminds us of Psalm 116:10, where it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken.
