Knowing that just as the Lord Jesus was raised from the dead, He will also raise us up. This confidence in our future resurrection brings hope and comforts us in the midst of afflictions. We can have full assurance that God's love and grace will sustain us and that the end result of our trials is eternal glory. The resurrection of Christ serves as both a model and a guarantee of our own resurrection. This doctrine was deeply ingrained in the apostles, providing them with strength and endurance during their persecution.
