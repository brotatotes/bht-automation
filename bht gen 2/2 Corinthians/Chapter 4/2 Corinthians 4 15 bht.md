# 2 Corinthians 4:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
All the trials and blessings we experience, both in times of adversity and prosperity, are designed to promote our salvation and the salvation of others who believe. God's grace, displayed through the labor, suffering, and triumph of the apostles, is multiplied as more people partake in it, resulting in an abundance of thanksgiving. By recognizing the significance of these experiences and offering heartfelt gratitude, we invite even greater measures of God's grace into our lives and bring glory to His name.
