# 2 Corinthians 4:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Apostle Paul's words in this passage truly capture the incomparable nature of heavenly glory in contrast to the temporary afflictions we face in this life. These expressions go beyond human imagination and convey the overwhelming beauty and sublimity of that glory. They remind us that our present afflictions, though they may feel heavy, are fleeting in comparison to the eternal weight of glory that awaits us. This perspective can inspire us to endure with patience and hope, knowing that the surpassing greatness of the glory to come far outweighs our momentary hardships.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The contrast, however, between this and the 'ETERNAL weight of glory' requires, I think, the translation, 'Which is but for the present passing moment.'" 
2. "The lightness of affliction contrasts beautifully with the 'weight of the glory.'"
3. "The glory exceeds beyond all measure the affliction."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The trials which Paul endured, to many persons would have seemed to be anything else but light. Yet these trials, though continued through many years, and constituting, as it were, his very life, he speaks of as the lightest conceivable thing when compared with that eternal glory which awaited him."
2. "The apostle evidently wished to express two ideas in as emphatic a manner as possible; first, that the affliction was light, and, secondly, that it was transient, momentary, and soon passing away."
3. "The expression means that it is 'exceeding exceedingly' glorious; glorious in the highest possible degree - Robinson. It is infinite and boundless. Nothing can describe the uppermost height of that glory; nothing can express its infinitude."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Our light affliction which is but for a moment...works out a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory." 
2. "An expression after the form of Hebrew superlatives, in which the emphatic word is twice repeated. Lit., exceedingly unto excess." 
3. "Note how the words are offset: for a moment, eternal; light, weight; affliction, glory."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul...draws a comparison between present miseries and future felicity...this comparison is of itself abundantly sufficient for imbuing the minds of the pious with patience and moderation, that they may not give way, borne down by the burden of the cross."
2. "For this comparison makes that light which previously seemed heavy, and makes that brief and momentary which seemed of boundless duration."
3. "We do not deny that afflictions are the path by which the heavenly kingdom is arrived at, but we deny that by afflictions we merit the inheritance, which comes to us in no other way than through means of Godâ€™s gracious adoption."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For our light affliction, which is but for the moment only temporary and but momentary, worketh for us more and more exceedingly an eternal weight of glory."
2. "Looking as we do, not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal."
3. "But looking on them, as we do, in the light of 'the things that are unseen and eternal,' their character is entirely changed, and instead of heavy, they seem to be 'light;' far from tedious and protracted, they seem but 'for the moment,' and in place of doing us any real harm, we find them 'working for us more and exceedingly an eternal weight of glory.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Our light affliction which is for the moment."
2. "Like piling Pelion on Ossa, 'according to excess unto excess.'"
3. "Eternal weight of glory."

### John Gill:
1. "The present state is a state of 'affliction'. Affliction is the common lot of the children of men, but more especially of the children of God." 
2. "Their affliction is represented as 'light' which though it is not in itself, but often very grievous and heavy to be borne, especially when any soul trouble is added to it; yet is light, when the saint is supported by the arm of the Lord, indulged with his presence, and favoured with the discoveries of his love."
3. "The afflictions of the children of God are said to be for a moment; they are but for a while, and that a little while; at most they are but for the present time of life, and that is but as a vapour which appears for a little while, and then vanishes away; it is but as a moment, a point of time, in comparison of eternity."

### John Wesley:
1. "The beauty and sublimity of St. Paul's expressions here, as descriptive of heavenly glory, opposed to temporal afflictions, surpass all imagination."
