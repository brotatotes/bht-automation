# 2 Corinthians 4:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are called to fix their gaze not on the visible things of this world, like human beings and material possessions, which are temporary and fleeting. Instead, they are encouraged to focus on the unseen realities of God's presence, His abundant grace, and the eternal glory of heaven. By shifting their attention from the temporary to the eternal, believers are able to navigate through the trials and joys of life with a perspective that transcends earthly circumstances.
