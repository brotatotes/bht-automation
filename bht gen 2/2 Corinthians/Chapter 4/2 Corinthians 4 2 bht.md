# 2 Corinthians 4:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Gospel of Christ is not something to be hidden or ashamed of, but rather something to be boldly proclaimed. It is a message that requires honesty and sincerity, without any deceit or trickery. The servants of Christ should not seek to corrupt or alter the truth for personal gain, but rather present it plainly and clearly, appealing to the consciences of all who hear it. Our only safety lies in uncompromisingly standing against the forces of darkness, refusing to be entangled in their snares.
