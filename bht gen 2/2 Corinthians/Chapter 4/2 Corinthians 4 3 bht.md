# 2 Corinthians 4:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If our gospel is veiled and hidden, it is not because of any lack of clarity in the message itself, but rather it is among those who are perishing that it remains hidden. The gospel is like a sun that shines brightly, regardless of the blindness of some who cannot perceive its light. Just as the sun's light is not diminished by the inability of the blind to see it, the gospel is a clear and full revelation of God and his grace.
