# 2 Corinthians 4:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The unbelievers are blinded by the god of this world, who has great influence over them. Satan's purpose is to prevent them from seeing the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, the image of God. Their minds are veiled to the truth, and they are unable to comprehend the beauty and splendor of the gospel. The devil, called the god of this world, seeks to hide the truth from them, lest they come to know the fullness of God's glory.
