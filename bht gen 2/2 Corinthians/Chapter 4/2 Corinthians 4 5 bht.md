# 2 Corinthians 4:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The preachers did not seek their own glory, but rather proclaimed the truths about Jesus Christ. They presented themselves as servants of the believers, assisting and guiding them in matters of faith. Their preaching was not based on their own abilities or accomplishments, but on the power and grace of Jesus Christ. They humbly recognized that they were not capable of bringing enlightenment, forgiveness, or holiness to others, but only Christ could provide these things. They were willing to serve in whatever capacity was needed, no matter how menial.
