# 2 Corinthians 4:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God, the source and creator of light, shines into our hearts, illuminating our minds and enabling us to see the glory of Christ. This divine light not only exposes our own weaknesses and sinfulness, but also compels us to share the word of light and life with others. As we gaze upon the face of Jesus, we are enlightened with the knowledge of God's glorious love and image. Through Christ, we have a clearer and more profound understanding of the divine glory, surpassing even that which was seen on the face of Moses.
