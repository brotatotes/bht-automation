# 2 Corinthians 4:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We, as believers, have the incredible privilege of carrying within us a treasure - the divine light, love, and glory of the Gospel. This treasure is not preserved in majestic and impressive vessels, but rather in frail and mortal bodies. In fact, it is in our weaknesses and afflictions that the power of God is all the more evident. By placing this precious treasure in ordinary and imperfect individuals, God demonstrates that the power and effectiveness of the Gospel is not dependent on human strength, but on His divine power at work within us.

2. "A treasure is not the less valuable, that the vessel, in which it is deposited, is not a precious one."

1. "The Gospel is called a 'treasure', for... it contains rich truths, and an abundance of them;... rich blessings, spiritual ones, the blessings of the new covenant... and a fulness of them... it exhibits and shows forth to us the riches of God and of Christ, of grace and of glory."
2. "The repository, or cabinet, in which this treasure is, are 'earthen vessels'; by which are meant, ministers of the word... men of no figure in the world, for birth, learning, or outward grandeur... attended with sinful infirmities also... labouring under reproaches, afflictions, and persecutions."
3. "The reason why it pleased God to put such a rich and valuable treasure into the hands of persons so mean and contemptible was, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us."

### John Wesley:
1. "But we — Not only the apostles, but all true believers. Have this treasure — Of divine light, love, glory."
2. "In earthen vessels — In frail, feeble, perishing bodies."
3. "He proceeds to show, that afflictions, yea, death itself, are so far from hindering the ministration of the Spirit, that they even further it, sharpen the ministers, and increase the fruit. That the excellence of the power, which works these in us, may undeniably appear to be of God."
