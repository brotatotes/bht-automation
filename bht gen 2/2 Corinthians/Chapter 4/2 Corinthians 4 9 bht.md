# 2 Corinthians 4:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We may face persecution, but we are never forsaken by God. Although we may be cast down and defeated by the trials and challenges of life, we remain safe and secure in the loving hands of Christ. Our struggles do not mean that God has abandoned us; rather, we are continually protected and preserved by His powerful presence.
