# 2 Corinthians 5:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our earthly house, our physical body, is likened to a temporary dwelling, a tent that is not meant to be a permanent habitation. It serves as a reminder of the transient nature of our earthly existence and the impermanence of our physical form.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The whole passage is expressed through the double figure of a house or tent, and a garment. The explanation of this abrupt transition from one to the other may be found in the image which, both from his occupation and his birthplace, would naturally occur to the Apostle, the tent of Cilician hair-cloth, which might almost equally suggest the idea of a habitation and of a vesture." Stanley.
2. "But even then the dead have it not in actual possession, but only prepared by God for them against the appearing of the Lord: and therefore they are said to have it in the heavens."
3. "Thus the intermediate state, though lightly passed over, as not belonging to the subject, is evidently in the mind of St. Paul."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If this daily delivering unto death should end in actual death."
2. "Such is the relation between the 'earthly' body and the resurrection body."
3. "Our body stands in contrast to 'from God.' For though our present body be also from God, yet it is not fresh and perfect from His hands, as our resurrection body shall be."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "And it proves that there may be the assurance of eternal life; or such evidence of acceptance with God as to leave no doubt of a final admission into heaven."
2. "The idea is a beautiful one, that the body is a mere unfixed, movable dwelling; liable to be taken down at any moment, and not designed, anymore than a tent is, to be a permanent habitation."
3. "The future body shall never be taken down or dissolved by death. It is eternal, of course, only in respect to the future, and not in respect to the past."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The figure of the tent suits the contrast with the building and would naturally suggest itself to the tent-maker."
2. "The phrase earthly house of the tabernacle expresses a single conception - the dwelling which is, or consists in the tabernacle, the tent-house. The transient character of the body is thus indicated."
3. "The building from God is an actual possession in virtue of the believer's union with Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "On the one hand, he shows the miserable condition of mankind in this life, and on the other hand, the supreme and perfect blessedness, which awaits believers in heaven after death."
2. "Believers alone can affirm this, to whom it has been testified of by the word and Spirit of God."
3. "The body, such as we now have it, he calls a house of tabernacle [...] so the mortal body is given to men as a frail hut, to be inhabited by them for a few days."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For we know that if the earthly house of our tabernacle be dissolved or 'our earthly tent-house be taken down,'"
2. "we have a building from God meaning the resurrection-body, called 'a building' in contrast with the tent-house of our present frame,"
3. "a house not made with hands (like the buildings we erect), eternal in the heavens."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The very word used (ÎºÎ±Ï„Î±Î»Ï…Ï‰) for striking down a tent." 
2. "We possess the title to it now by faith." 
3. "This Î¿Î¹ÎºÎ¿Î´Î¿Î¼Î·... is more substantial than the ÏƒÎºÎ·Î½Î¿Ï‚."

### John Gill:
1. "By this house is meant the body, so called from its being like a well built house, a curious piece of architecture."
2. "It is said to be an 'earthly' house because it is from the earth; is supported by earthly things; has its present abode on the earth, and will quickly return to it."
3. "Now it is the saints' comfort whilst they are in it, and in a view of the dissolution of it, that they have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens."

### John Wesley:
1. Our earthly house â€” Which is only a tabernacle, or tent, not designed for a lasting habitation.
