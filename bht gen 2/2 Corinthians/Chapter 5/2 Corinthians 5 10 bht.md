# 2 Corinthians 5:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We all, including the Apostles and all mankind, whether present or absent from the body, must be made manifest. This manifestation will reveal all hidden things, even the sins of the faithful that were forgiven long ago. At this judgment, each person will be recompensed according to their actions done in the body, whether good or evil.

V., giving to the reader merely the idea of “appearing before” as when summoned to a magistrate], but ‘appear in our true light,’ appear as we have never done before, as in reff., where the word is used of our Lord Himself)."
