# 2 Corinthians 5:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Knowing the fear of the Lord and the terror of facing judgment before Him, we, as ministers of the Word, understand the urgency and importance of persuading others to seek His favor. With sincerity and integrity, we appeal to both the goodness and gravity of God, for His glory and the ultimate good of souls. And as God knows our motivations, we trust that others, including you, will also recognize and affirm them within their own consciences.

3. "The true effect is, to produce tenderness, deep feeling, and love; to prompt to the language of persuasion and of tender entreaty; to lead people to weep over dying sinners rather than to denounce them; to pray to God to have mercy on them rather than to use the language of severity, or to assume tones as if they would be pleased to execute the awful wrath of God."
