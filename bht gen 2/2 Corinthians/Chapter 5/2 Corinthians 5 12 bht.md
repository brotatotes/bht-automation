# 2 Corinthians 5:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We do not say this, as if we thought there was any need of again recommending ourselves to you. Our purpose in speaking this way is to give you an occasion of rejoicing and praising God for the work that He has accomplished through us. And furthermore, it is to furnish you with an answer to those false apostles who glory in appearance, but not in heart, being condemned by their own conscience.
