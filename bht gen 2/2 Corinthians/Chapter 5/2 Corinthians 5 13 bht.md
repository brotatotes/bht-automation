# 2 Corinthians 5:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Sometimes, others may view us as mad or beside ourselves when we passionately speak or write with great intensity. However, in these moments, we act not for our own glory, but for the glory of God. It is God who understands the emotions that He inspires within us. Ultimately, our passionate expressions are meant to benefit others, for we choose this approach in order to edify and advantage those we teach.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "whether we have been mad... it was to God... whether we be of sound mind, it is for you." 
2. "if you will ascribe to us madness, it is a holy madness, for God; if you maintain and are convinced of our sobriety, it is a soundness in your service."
3. "μαίνεσθαί τις ἡμᾶς φησί ; διὰ τὸν θεὸν τοιαῦτα μαινόμεθα."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "The holy enthusiasm with which he spake of what God effected by His apostolic ministry, seemed to many to be boasting madness."
3. "The glorifying of his office was not for his own, but for God's glory. The abasing of himself was in adaptation to their infirmity, to gain them to Christ."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It has not been uncommon, by any means, for the cold and the prudent; for formal professors and for hypocrites to regard the warm-hearted and zealous friends of religion as maniacs."
2. "The object of Paul here is to show, whatever might be the appearance or the estimate which they affixed to his conduct, what were the real principles which actuated him."
3. "The doctrine here is, that there may be such a zeal for the glory of God, such an active and ardent desire to promote his honor, as to lead others to charge us with derangement."

3. "Let men take it as they will, that I speak so much of my integrity, I do it not upon my own account, but have respect to God and the Church in speaking of it; for I am as ready to be silent as to speak, when my silence may glorify God and advantage the Church as much as my speech."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If tarried away by the glory of the message with which we are burdened, we at times seem beside ourselves, it is our zeal for God that urges us on."
