# 2 Corinthians 5:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For the love of Christ, which is displayed in His death, greatly influences us and compels us to love Him in return. This love of Christ restricts and directs our affections to Him alone, preventing us from being swayed by other competing interests. It is through His death that we find new life in Him, dying to ourselves and living for Christ. This love is not limited to a select few, but extends to all mankind, demonstrating the vastness of His love and the sufficiency of His sacrifice for the redemption of all.
