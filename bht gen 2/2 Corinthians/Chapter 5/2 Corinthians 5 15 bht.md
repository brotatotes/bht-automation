# 2 Corinthians 5:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ's death was an absolute, objective fact, dying on behalf of all and suffering death in their place. In His death, those for whom He died also died, being planted in the likeness of His death. Those who live should no longer live for themselves, but for Him who died and rose again for them. This sacrificial living involves rejecting selfishness and living unto Him who died and rose again. Believers are called to devote their entire lives to His service, honoring and living for Him in all righteousness and true holiness.
