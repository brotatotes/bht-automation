# 2 Corinthians 5:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Since the death and resurrection of Christ, our perspective on people has completely changed. We no longer judge others based on their worldly status or external appearances. We have become new creatures, letting go of our old principles of judgment. Even our knowledge of Christ has been transformed. Previously, we may have known Him only based on earthly standards, but now we seek to know Him spiritually and have a deeper understanding of His true nature. Our aim is to view everyone and everything in a new light, free from worldly thoughts and prejudices.
