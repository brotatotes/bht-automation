# 2 Corinthians 5:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Whoever claims to be in the kingdom or church of Christ should be transformed into a new person. This transformation is not something that can be achieved by human effort alone, but requires the power of the Creator Himself. Just as the snow melts away in spring, the old things of the past are left behind and replaced with a fresh start. In this new state, the believer experiences a complete overhaul - a new life, new understanding, and a new perspective on everything.
