# 2 Corinthians 5:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God, specifically God the Father, initiated the process of reconciling the world through Christ. The world, which was once in a state of enmity with God, now has the opportunity to be restored to a peaceful relationship with Him. This restoration was made possible through the sacrificial death of Christ, which served to remove the enmity that had separated humanity from God.
