# 2 Corinthians 5:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In our current state, we groan, longing for the heavenly glory and the transformation of our earthly bodies. The groanings of the saints are not in vain, for they reflect the earnest desire for the heavenly dwelling that awaits us. This heavenly house will be a perfect, spiritual abode, where we will be clothed with incorruptibility and immortality. It is in this new body, free from the limitations of our flesh and blood, that we long to be invested, attaining the fullness of the resurrection-life that resides in the Lord from heaven.
