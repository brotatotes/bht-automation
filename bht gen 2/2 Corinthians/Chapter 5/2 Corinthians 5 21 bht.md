# 2 Corinthians 5:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The reconciliation brought about by the unspeakable gift of God is achieved through Christ, who became the representative of sin on the cross. He took upon Himself the sin of the world, being made sin for us, while remaining personally righteous. By transferring our guilt to Him, He made it possible for us to be made righteous in the sight of God. Through this imputed righteousness, we are reconciled to God and can be viewed as examples of His righteousness. Christ's sacrifice on the cross is the ultimate atonement for our sins, allowing us to obtain God's righteousness.

2. "The sin of the world is one, therefore the singular, not the plural, is used; though its manifestations are manifold."
3. "As our sin is made over to Him, so His righteousness to us... The innocent was punished voluntarily as if guilty, that the guilty might be gratuitously rewarded as if innocent."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is the most affecting of all arguments; it is the one that is likely to prove most effectual."
2. "The strongest argument, and that which is most adapted to melt the soul, is the fact that the Son of God has become incarnate for our sins, and has suffered and died in our stead."

### John Calvin:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "So far from God requiring to be moved by the death of Christ to compassionate and provide salvation for a sinful world, it was God Himself who spontaneously sent His Son on this errand into our world."
2. "To be 'made sin' cannot mean to be made personally sinful, either in act or inclination... the guilt which through His death was to be removed from men was transferred to Him, and so the justification of men is imputative."

### John Wesley:
1. "He made him a sin offering, who knew no sin" - A commendation peculiar to Christ.
