# 2 Corinthians 5:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers, when Christ returns, will not be found stripped of their bodies. On the contrary, they will be clothed with a glorious spiritual body, signifying their future habitation in heaven. The Apostle expresses his earnest desire to be clothed with this imperishable body. In this future state, their souls will not be without a covering, but instead, they will be adorned with the righteousness and sanctification of Christ. This new robe of immortality is provided by God, both in this life and after death, demonstrating His love and care for His people.
