# 2 Corinthians 5:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The believers in the tabernacle of their bodies find themselves groaning and burdened, not due to the sufferings and trials they face, but because they desire something greater - to be clothed upon with a heavenly body. Their groaning stems from their longing for a transformation, not a desire to be completely rid of their current bodies. Faith recognizes the value and purpose of the physical body, and thus, there is no disdain for it. Rather, believers eagerly anticipate being gloriously adorned with an immortal, incorruptible, and spiritual body.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We who are in the tabernacle...groan, being burdened...because we are not willing to divest ourselves (of it), but to put on (that other) over it, that our mortal part may (not, die, but) be swallowed up by life." 
2. "The feeling expressed in these verses was one most natural to those who...conceived the possibility of their living to behold it...a natural reluctance to undergo the mere act of death as such when it was within possibility that this mortal body might be superseded by the immortal one, without it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For we do not desire to have ourselves unclothed (of our present body), but clothed upon (with our heavenly body)."
2. "Believers shrink from, not the consequences, but the mere act of dying, especially as believing in the possibility of their being found alive at the Lord's coming, and so of having their mortal body absorbed into the immortal without death."
3. "Faith does not divest us of all natural feeling, but subordinates it to higher feeling. Scripture gives no sanction to the contempt for the body expressed by philosophers."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We do not desire to die and depart merely because we suffer much, and because the body here is subjected to great trials. This is not the ground of our wish to depart."
2. "The anxiety of Paul to enter the eternal world was from a higher motive than a mere desire to get away from trouble."
3. "It was not, therefore, a mere desire to be released from sufferings; it was an earnest wish to be admitted to the glories of the future world, and partake of the happiness which we would enjoy there."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The oppression of soul (groan) is not from pains and afflictions of the body, nor from the fear of death, but from the natural shrinking from death, especially if death is to deprive him of the body (unclothe) only to leave him without a new and higher organism." 
2. "Therefore he desires, instead of dying, to have the new being come down upon him while still alive, investing him with the new spiritual organism (clothed upon), as a new garment is thrown over an old one, and absorbing (swallowed up) the old, sensuous life."
3. "For who, to dumb forgetfulness a prey, This pleading anxious being e'er resigned, Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day, Nor cast one longing, lingering look behind?" - GRAY, "Elegy."

### John Calvin:
1. "We groan, being burdened, because we desire not to be unclothed."
2. "The groaning of believers...arises from this...that they know they are here in a state of exile...and that they know they are here shut up in the body as in a prison."
3. "The natural horror of death is overcome by confidence...as an individual will throw away a coarse, dirty, threadbare garment...with the view of being arrayed in an elegant, handsome, new, and durable one."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We long that the mortality with which [the body] is smitten, with all the ills which that carries with it, may pass away, and we may find ourselves wearing a form instinct with a life that cannot die."
2. "The sublime expression 'swallowed up' was doubtless suggested by Isaiah 25:8, quoted in the former Epistle, where the same word is used."
3. "...We may find ourselves wearing a form instinct with a life that cannot die."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For that (εφ' ω) we do not wish to put off the clothing, but to put it on"
2. "Paul does not wish to be a mere disembodied spirit without his spiritual garment."
3. "Only what is mortal perishes; the personality, consisting of soul and body, survives."

### John Gill:
1. "The saints who are in the tabernacle of the body, in an unsettled state, groan, being in the midst of tribulation, and not yet in the enjoyment of that happiness they are wishing for."
2. "The reason of their groaning is, because they are burdened with the body itself, which is a clog and incumbrance to the soul in its spiritual exercises."
3. "The saints are mostly burdened with the body of sin and death they carry about with them; the filth of it is nauseous, grievous, and intolerable."

### John Wesley:
1. "We groan being burdened...burdened with numberless afflictions, infirmities, temptations." 
2. "Not that we would be unclothed...Faith does not understand that philosophical contempt of what the wise Creator has given." 
3. "But clothed upon...with the glorious, immortal, incorruptible, spiritual body."
