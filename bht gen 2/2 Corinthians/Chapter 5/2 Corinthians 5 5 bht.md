# 2 Corinthians 5:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The desire for immortality, which God Himself has worked within us, is the very thing that He has prepared us for. It is not simply a natural feeling, but a deep instinct of the new nature that begins eternal life in the souls of all who believe. God has destined us for this change, and He has given us the Holy Spirit as a pledge and confirmation of the promise. This longing for the heavenly dwelling is not in vain, for through God's work in us, we are being transformed and prepared for the glorious inheritance that awaits us.

### Henry Alford:
1. "This great end, the καταποθῆναι τὸ θνητὸν ὑπὸ τῆς ζωῆς, is justified as the object of the Apostle’s fervent wish, seeing that it is for this very end, that this may ultimately be accomplished, that God has wrought us and given us the pledge of the Spirit."
2. "He who wrought us out unto this very purpose is God, who gave unto us the earnest of the Spirit."
3. "The end itself, which he individually, or in common with others then living, wishes accomplished in this particular form of ἐπενδύσασθαι, is, under whatever form brought about, that for which all the preparation, by grace, of Christians, is carried on, and to which the earnest of the Spirit points forward."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Wrought us—framed us by redemption, justification, and sanctification."
2. "For the selfsame thing—'unto' it; namely, unto what is mortal of us being swallowed up in life."
3. "It is the Spirit (as 'the first-fruits') who creates in us the groaning desire for our coming deliverance and glory."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The phrase 'self-same thing' here means this very thing, that is, the thing to which he had referred - the preparation for heaven, or the heavenly dwelling."

### John Calvin:
1. "Mere natural feeling will not lead us forward to this, for it does not comprehend that hundredfold recompense which springs from the dying of a single grain." 
2. "We must, therefore, be fitted for it by God. The manner of it is at the same time subjoined — that he confirms us by his Spirit, who is as it were an earnest."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This 'groaning' is not the mere feeling which nature forces out from many a weary spirit, especially under the manifold ills of life; it is that instinct of the new nature, 'wrought of God,' which is eternal life itself begun in the souls of all that believe."
2. "The earnest of all that this will yet be we have in the Spirit given unto us."
3. "This last thought is one the apostle often dwells on (see Ephesians 1:13-14; Romans 8:23)."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'the selfsame thing' is meant, either the cross, the burden of sorrows and afflictions, under which the saints groan whilst here, which God has appointed them unto, and therefore to be bore patiently by them."
2. "Seeing he 'is God', and not man, who hath wrought them for this, either by his secret purposes and preparations of grace in eternity, or by his open works of creation and regeneration in time; there is no doubt but they shall certainly enjoy it, since his counsels are immutable, and he is a rock, and his work is perfect; whatever he begins he finishes, nor is he ever frustrated of his end."
3. "Who also hath given us the earnest of the Spirit; and therefore may be assured of possessing the inheritance, of which he is the earnest."

### John Wesley:
1. Now he that hath wrought us to this very thing — This longing for immortality.Is God — For none but God, none less than the Almighty, could have wrought this in us.
