# 2 Corinthians 5:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this life, our faith serves as our guiding force, allowing us to confidently anticipate things that are yet to come and believe in the existence of unseen realities. We are not governed by the external appearance of things, but rather by the influence of faith within us. Our actions are guided by the knowledge that our Savior sees us and that the rewards of our faith will be revealed in due time. Faith is not a mere endorsement of the visible, but rather a deep-rooted belief in the unseen, giving substance and meaning to our existence.
