# 2 Corinthians 5:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We can find great comfort and confidence in knowing that our present state is not the end. Instead, our ultimate happiness is assured even after death. The time between our earthly existence and the resurrection is not one of inactivity or sleep, but rather a period of joy and glory. This is because being present with the Lord is not only a future promise, but something we can experience even now. It is this assurance of being with Christ that sustains us and allows us to face death with peace and contentment.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "We should prefer to be found alive at the Lord's coming, and to be clothed upon with our heavenly body." 
2. "But feeling, as we do, the sojourn in the body to be a separation from our true home 'with the Lord,' we prefer even dissolution by death, so that in the intermediate disembodied state we may go to be 'with the Lord'."
3. "'To be with Christ' (the disembodied state) is distinguished from Christ's coming to take us to be with Him in soul and body."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We are confident - 2 Corinthians 5:6. We are cheerful, and courageous, and ready to bear our trial."
2. "To be present with the Lord - The Lord Jesus; see the note on Acts 1:24; compare Philippians 1:23. The idea of Paul is, that the Lord Jesus would constitute the main glory of heaven, and that to be with him was equivalent to being in a place of perfect bliss."
3. "That world where the Redeemer is, is heaven. This also proves that the spirits of the saints, when they depart, are with the Redeemer; that is, are at once taken to heaven."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "We are well-pleased." 
2. "To be absent - present." 
3. "To be from home, at home."

### John Calvin:
1. "Nothing can befall us, that can shake our confidence and courage, since death (which others so much dread) is to us great gain."
2. "True faith begets not merely a contempt of death, but even a desire for it, and that it is, accordingly, on the other hand, a token of unbelief, when dread of death predominates in us above the joy and consolation of hope."
3. "The desire, however, of which Paul speaks, is the disposition of a well-regulated mind."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Since the apostle tells us that while he lived he was in daily communion with Christ about his work with its difficulties, triumphs, and prospects how could he say that 'to depart and be with Christ was far better' if this was all to be extinguished, and he was to be unconscious even of his own existence?"
2. "This word 'at home,' when applied to such a case, conveys to the heart what language cannot express."
3. "Yet even this is but the entrance-gate, the threshold, of resurrection-glory; when that organ which was originally formed to be the inlet of all that the soul receives from without, and the outlet of all that it gives out from within, shall be restored, with capacities suited to the higher sphere which it will then occupy."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "We are of good courage."
2. "Are willing rather, 'We are well-pleased, we prefer' if left to ourselves."
3. "To be at home with the Lord, to attain that goal is bliss for Paul."

### John Gill:
1. "We are cheerful in our present state, being assured of future happiness..."
2. "The interval between death, and the resurrection, is a state of absence from the body, during which time the soul is disembodied, and exists in a separate state; not in a state of inactivity and sleep, for that would not be desirable, but of happiness and glory..."
3. "This was promised to Christ in the everlasting covenant, that all his spiritual seed and offspring should be with him... It is this which supports and comforts the saints under all their sorrows here, and which makes them meet death with pleasure..."

### John Wesley:
1. Present with the Lord — This demonstrates that the happiness of the saints is not deferred till the resurrection.
