# 2 Corinthians 5:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Christians, our ambition is not driven by earthly desires, but rather by our desire to please the Lord. Whether we are physically present in the body or absent from it, we strive to live in a way that is pleasing to Him. This ambition stems from our faith and love for the Lord, and it is this faith that enables us to please Him in all things.
