# 2 Corinthians 6:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As co-laborers with God in the ministry, it is crucial not to let the grace of God be in vain. We must continually and diligently proclaim the message of reconciliation and the offers of mercy, urging others to turn to God's gracious provision. Let us not resist or take lightly the yearning desire of God for our reconciliation, but rather receive the grace of God and ensure that it is not received in vain. The grace of God is meant to bring about a true transformation and produce a work of conversion in our lives.
