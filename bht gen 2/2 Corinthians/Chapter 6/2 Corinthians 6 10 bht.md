# 2 Corinthians 6:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As believers, we may experience sorrow for our own shortcomings and the suffering of others, yet we can find true joy in the Lord's presence, His love, and the hope of our future glory. Though we may feel lacking in worldly possessions, as followers of Christ, we possess the abundance of all things, for all things belong to us through our union with Him. What a truly magnificent thought to contemplate!

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "However παιδευόμενος might be wrested to signify 'a man under the chastisement of God' as a ground of reproach, λυπούμενος will surely not bear the meaning solcher der nach gemohnlicher menschlicher Unsicht traurig sehn mußte, 'one in such a situation, that according to ordinary human estimation he must be wretched,' as De Wette, but must point to the matter of fact, that he is really 'afflicted.'" 
2. "πτωχοί again can hardly have been a reproach, but sets forth the fact as poor men, but enriching...many: as having nothing...but possessing all things."
3. "But possessing (finally and as our own, our inheritance never to be taken away; in that sense of the word 'to possess' which this world's buyers are not to use οἱ ἀγοράζοντες, ὡς μὴ κατέχοντες, 1Co 7:30) all things."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "making many rich—Spiritually (1 Corinthians 1:5), after the example of our Lord, who 'by His poverty made many rich.'"
2. "having nothing—Whatever of earthly goods we have, and these are few, we have as though we had not; as tenants removable at will, not owners (1 Corinthians 1:5- :)."
3. "possessing all things—The Greek implies firm possession, holding fast in possession (compare 1 Corinthians 3:21; 1 Corinthians 3:22)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Religion had a power not only to sustain the soul in trial, but to fill it with positive joy."
2. "And there is much in the Christian character and feelings unseen or unappreciated by the world."
3. "He that has God for his portion, may be said to have all things, for he is 'all in all.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Having - possessing [εχοντες - κατεχοντες] . The contrast is twofold : between having and not having, and between temporary and permanent having, or having and keeping. Compare Luke 8:15; 1 Corinthians 14:2; 1 Thessalonians 5:21; Hebrews 3:6.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "sowing in tears, yet reaping in joy;” a paradox to which no true servant of Christ, who “watches for souls as one that shall give account,” is quite a stranger"
2. "as poor in this world’s goods, yet making many rich putting them in possession of “the true riches”"
3. "as having nothing (earthly), and yet possessing all things for 'all things are ours'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Always rejoicing." (αε χαιροντες). Even in sorrow.
2. "Yet making many rich." (πολλους δε πλουτιζοντες). Spiritual riches Paul has in mind.
3. "As having nothing and yet possessing all things." (ως μηδεν εχοντες κα παντα κατεχοντες). Contrast between having nothing and possessing all things.

### John Gill:
1. "As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing...in the Lord, in the person, blood, and righteousness of Christ, and salvation by him." 
2. "As poor, yet making many rich...by showing them their spiritual poverty, stripping them of what they trusted in, and valued themselves upon; directing them where true riches are." 
3. "As having nothing, and yet possessing all things...they enjoyed all spiritual good things; they had not only a right unto them, but were possessed of them; they had all things pertaining to life and godliness; they had Christ, and all things with him."

### John Wesley:
1. "As sorrowing — For our own manifold imperfections, and for the sins and sufferings of our brethren."
2. "Yet always rejoicing — In present peace, love, power, and a sure hope of future glory."
3. "As having nothing, yet possessing all things — For all things are ours, if we are Christ's. What a magnificence of thought is this!"
