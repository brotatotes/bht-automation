# 2 Corinthians 6:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do not have close associations with unbelievers, whether it be in acts of idolatry or in conversation, warns the passage. While the prohibition specifically applies to marriage, the reasons against having intimate relationships with unbelievers are equally relevant in other areas of life. For what fellowship can there be between light and darkness? The apostle Paul's questions serve as arguments to dissuade believers from entering into any kind of partnership or fellowship with those who do not share their faith.

3. "The main reason ... is that there can be no fellowship, no communion, nothing in common between them; and that therefore they should be separate ... What is there in common between light and darkness? What common principle is there of which they both partake? There is none."

### Marvin Vincent:
