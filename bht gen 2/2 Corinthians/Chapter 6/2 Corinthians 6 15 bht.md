# 2 Corinthians 6:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Belial, in this context, represents the devil and all that is opposed to Christ. There is no agreement or harmony between Christ and Belial, as they are fundamentally opposed to one another. Similarly, there is no compatibility between believers and unbelievers, as their values, beliefs, and interests are fundamentally different. Believers find their portion and inheritance in God and Christ, while unbelievers face the consequences of their unbelief. The contrast between Christ and Belial, and between believers and unbelievers, is stark and unbridgeable.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And what concord hath Christ with Belial?" From the use of this proper name, and the antithesis with Christ, it evidently is meant (like Beelzebub in Matthew 12:24) as a synonym for Satan.
  
2. "or what portion hath a believer with an unbeliever? It is not their having different speculative opinions about religion that makes intimate fellowship between them impracticable; it is that a 'believer' is supposed to breathe a different atmosphere, to live for fundamentally different ends, and to have entirely different interests and tastes and modes of action, from an 'unbeliever.'"
  
3. (See on chap. 2 Corinthians 5:16-17.)

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul graphically sums up the contrast between Christ and Belial (Satan), the heads of the contending forces of good and evil."
2. "Here by 'unbeliever' (απιστου) Paul means 'disbeliever,' not just an unconverted man who yet approves Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "What concord hath Christ with Belial?.... [Belial] signifies one that is unprofitable, does no good, and is good for nothing...between whom and Christ there is no concord, but a perpetual enmity."
2. "As there is no concord between Christ personal, and Belial the devil, so what can there be between Christ mystical the church...and wicked men, the sons of Belial?"
3. "What part hath he that believeth with an infidel?...the believer's part and portion are God, Christ, and an eternal inheritance; the unbeliever's part and portion will be in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone."

### John Wesley:
