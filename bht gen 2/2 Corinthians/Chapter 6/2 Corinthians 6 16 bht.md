# 2 Corinthians 6:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
What connection can the temple, the dwelling place of God, have with idols? As the saints are the true temple of the living God, there is no agreement or association between them and false gods. This truth is confirmed in Scripture, for God has said this to His ancient church, and through them to all believers. The promise is that God will not just dwell in them, but also walk in them, signifying His continuous presence and active work within His people.
