# 2 Corinthians 6:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are not only promised blessings for separating from the world, but also the privilege of being adopted into God's family. The honor of being called sons and daughters of God is unmatched by any earthly title. This adoption signifies the mercy and compassion of God, who is willing to rescue us from ruin and extend His grace to save us. It carries the responsibility of living separate from the world and upholding the eternal principles of the gospel. As adopted children, we have a unique connection with the Almighty, who lovingly supports and guides us.
