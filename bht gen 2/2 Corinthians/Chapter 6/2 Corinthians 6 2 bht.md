## BHT:
At the appointed moment, God graciously hears our prayers and extends His help. This is a time when God is ready to show compassion, hear our pleas for salvation, and bestow His favor upon us. The fulfillment of the prophecy in Isaiah highlights the role of Jesus as the restorer and gatherer of His people, bringing forth a period of acceptance and grace. Now, in the present, is the well-received time when God is eager to extend His mercy and answer our prayers for salvation.

### Henry Alford:
1. "In an accepted time (Heb. ×‘Ö¼Ö°×¢Öµ×ª ×¨Ö¸×¦×•Ö¹×Ÿ, 'in a season of grace') I heard thee, and in the day of salvation I helped thee: behold (inserted for solemnity to mark the importance of what follows), NOW is the favourably accepted time." 
2. "NOW is the day of salvation." 
3. "The prophecy is one directly of the Lord Jesus, as the restorer and gatherer of his people; and the time of acceptance is the interval of the offer of the covenant to men, conceded to Him by the Father."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "God's own promise is the ground of our exhortation."
2. "In the eternal purposes of my love, I have hearkened to thy prayer for the salvation of thy people."
3. "What was 'an accepted time' in the prophecy becomes 'the well-accepted time' in the fulfillment."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Under the Messiah, it is said by Isaiah, God would be willing to show mercy."
2. "The promise to the Messiah was, that the pagan world should be given to him; but it was a promise that it should be in answer to his prayers and intercessions."
3. "The meaning of this passage is, 'the Messiah is come. The time referred to by Isaiah has arrived. It is now a time when God is ready to show compassion, to hear prayer, and to have mercy on mankind.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Paul, taking the words in their messianic sense, urges that now is the time when God thus dispenses His favor to Christ, and through Him to men."
2. "The application turns on the words acceptable time; a time in which God receives. As He receives, receive ye Him."
3. "Paul uses for the simple adjective of the Septuagint a compound 'well-received,' which is stronger, and which occurs mostly in his own writings."

### John Calvin:
1. "As God specifies a particular time for the exhibition of his grace, it follows that all times are not suitable for that. As a particular day of salvation is named, it follows that a free offer of salvation is not made every day."
2. "We must not seek the cause in ourselves, as if we by means of our own works moved God to assign to us his favor, for whence comes the day of salvation? It is because it is the acceptable time, that is, the time which God has in his free favor appointed."
3. "While the gospel is preached to us, we know assuredly that the way is opened up for us into the kingdom of God, and that there is a signal of divine benevolence raised aloft, to invite us to receive salvation, for the opportunity of obtaining it must be judged of by the call."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The whole strain of prophecy from which these words are quoted is brightly Messianic, and the words quoted were addressed by Jehovah to â€˜His Servantâ€™ the Messiah, assuring Him that He is fully alive to His rightful claims, that He â€˜hearkens to Him at the choice timeâ€™..."
2. "Well, says our apostle here, behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation): â€˜Do ye, Gentile converts, therefore, make this good in your own case, showing, by what the Gospel has made you to be, that this is no name but a glorious reality.â€™"
3. "The connexion is with the opening words of the chapter, As â€˜working together with God,â€™ and . . . giving no occasion of stumbling in anything, that our ministration be not blamed. How far the opposite of this was the uniform procedure of the apostle, he protests in the remarkable and glowing verses that follow."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Behold, now is the acceptable time."
2. "Here is another 'Pauline parenthesis' by the quotation from Isaiah 49:8."
3. "Paul employs the double compound, well-received."

### John Gill:
1. "This was good will to men, and not to angels, to such as were ungodly, enemies, sinners, and the worst of sinners: it was a time very grateful to him; it was 'the accepted year of the Lord'; the sufferings, sacrifice, satisfaction, and righteousness of his Son were well pleasing to him."
2. "And in the day of salvation have I succoured thee...an indication of the Father's regard to the human nature of Christ, and of his concern for the salvation of men; and also shows what power and strength were necessary to accomplish it."
3. "Now is the day of salvation: now is salvation preached, as being done, already obtained by Christ for sinners, the chief of sinners...now they are made to submit to Christ, to be saved by him, and him alone, are encouraged to believe in him, and are by him actually possessed of it."

### John Wesley:
1. "As of old there was a particular time wherein God was pleased to pour out his peculiar blessing, so there is now."
