# 2 Corinthians 6:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Take great care not to give any offense that could hinder the spread of the Gospel or bring reproach upon the ministry. There are always people waiting for the opportunity to criticize and slander the work of the Gospel, and if they find any grounds for reproach, it would greatly hinder the effectiveness of the ministry. Therefore, it is crucial for us to conduct ourselves in a manner that brings honor and respect to the ministry and avoids giving any occasion for blame.
