## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He may have been imprisoned at Antioch in Pisidia, Acts 13:50, and at Lystra, Act 14:19 and at Corinth, Acts 18:12; Acts 18:14; and we cannot tell what may have befallen him during his journeys, Acts 15:41; Acts 16:6; Acts 18:23." 
2. "The sense given by Chrys. (p. 522), al., τὸ μηδαμοῦ δύνασθαι στῆναι ἐλαυνόμενον, is philologically allowable." 
3. "But I would rather believe the ἀγρυπνίαι to have been watchings through anxiety for the churches."

2. "The context here refers to his trials, rather than devotional exercises."
3. "The apostles combine the highest offices with the humblest exterior: as everything in the Church was to be cast in the mould of death and resurrection, the cardinal principle throughout Christianity."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In stripes - In this verse, Paul proceeds to specifications of what he had been called to endure."
2. "In imprisonments - As at Philippi; Acts 16:24 ff."

2. "And, unquestionably, two things are required on the part of ministers of the Gospel — that they should endeavor to the utmost of their power to maintain peace, and yet on the other hand go forward, undaunted, through the midst of commotions, so as not to turn aside from the right course..."
3. "He does not mean — hunger arising from destitution, but a voluntary exercise of abstinence."
