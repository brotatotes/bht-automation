# 2 Corinthians 6:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By living in purity, having a deep knowledge of the Gospel, and showing kindness towards others, we can truly embody the spiritual graces bestowed upon us by the Holy Spirit. It is through a pure and holy life that our preaching and labor become fruitful. By imparting true knowledge, not mere rhetoric, we commend the Gospel to others. And it is by showing love unfeigned, sincere and genuine, that we reflect the prominent characteristic of the life of the Redeemer. When we exhibit these graces, we manifest the power of the Holy Spirit and fulfill our purpose as believers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "in purity: which is variously explained: of bodily chastity, unselfishness, as an alternative, general purity of character, unblamableness of life, and singleness of purpose."
2. "knowledge of the Gospel, in a high and singular degree"
3. "kindness: a kind and considerate demeanour."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "knowledge—spiritual: in Gospel mysteries, unattainable by mere reason."
2. "long-suffering . . . kindness—associated with 'charity' or 'love' (1 Corinthians 13:4), as here."
3. "by the Holy Ghost—in virtue of His influences which produce these graces, and other gifts, 'love unfeigned' being the foremost of them."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He begins by stating that it was by pureness, that is, by integrity, sanctity, a holy and pure life. All preaching, and all labors would have been in vain without this..."
2. "Probably the idea is a very simple one. Paul is showing how he endeavored to commend the gospel to others...He says, therefore, that one way was by communicating knowledge, true knowledge...in opposition to those who would substitute declamation for argument, and the mere ornaments of rhetoric for truth."
3. "By love unfeigned - Sincere, true, ardent love to all. By undissembled, pure, and genuine affection for the souls of people. What good can a minister do if he does not love his people, and the souls of people? The prominent characteristic in the life of the Redeemer was love - love to all."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Spirit is taken by metonymy, to denote spiritual graces."
2. "Frivolous, however, is the cavil of Chrysostom, who infers from this, that the other excellences are peculiar to the Apostle, because he makes mention of the Spirit separately."
3. "The power of God showed itself in many things — in magnanimity, in efficacy in the maintaining of the truth, in the propagation of the Gospel, in victory over enemies, and the like."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "in pureness... in the Holy Ghost probably such manifestations of the power of the truth as left no room for doubt that it was the Holy Ghost ‘giving testimony to the word of His grace.’"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  In love unfeigned  (εν αγαπη ανυποκριτω). Late and rare word (α privative and υποκριτος, from υποκρινομα) This is the only love that is worth while (Romans 12:9). 

### John Gill:
1. "By pureness...chastity of body and mind, sincerity of heart, and integrity of life."
2. "By longsuffering...not easily provoked to wrath, but bearing with patience every indignity and affront."
3. "By love unfeigned...without dissimulation, being not in word only, but in deed and in truth towards the brethren, and to all men."

### John Wesley:
1. "By prudence — Spiritual divine; not what the world terms so."
2. "Worldly prudence is the practical use of worldly wisdom: divine prudence is the due exercise of grace, making spiritual understanding go as far as possible."
3. "By love unfeigned — The chief fruit of the Spirit."
