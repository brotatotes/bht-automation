# 2 Corinthians 6:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The word of truth, which comes from the God of truth, reveals Christ, who is the truth itself. Through the power of God, this truth brings about the conversion and salvation of many souls. As believers, we are equipped with the armor of righteousness, consisting of uprightness of conscience and holiness of life, to defend ourselves on every side. It is by this complete armor that we are able to stand firm and overcome the challenges and temptations that come our way.
