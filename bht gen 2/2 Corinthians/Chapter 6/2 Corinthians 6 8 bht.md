# 2 Corinthians 6:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As ministers of God, we are called to bear both honor and dishonor, praise and slander, as we proclaim the gospel. We strive to commend ourselves faithfully, not allowing the opinions of the world to hinder our ministry. In the midst of being falsely represented as deceivers, we remain steadfast and true in the sight of God. It is through this unwavering commitment that we continue to fulfill our calling to bring the message of Christ to the world.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "By glory and dishonour. Here δια is no longer instrument, but state or condition. Δοξα here is glory. See Romans 9:21; 2 Timothy 2:20 for contrast between honour and dishonour."
2. "By evil report and good report. Play on the words with prefixes δυσ- and ευ- and φημη. Δυσφημια is a late word, only here in N.T. Ευφημια, old and common word, only here in N.T."
3. "As deceivers and yet true. Paul takes up ως now in place of δια which succeeded εν. Note use of κα in sense of 'and yet' (adversative). Πλανος is late word for wandering, vagabond, impostor. Such slander from one's enemies is praise."
