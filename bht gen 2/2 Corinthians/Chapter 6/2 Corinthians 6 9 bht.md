# 2 Corinthians 6:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As children of God, we often live a life that is misunderstood and unknown by the world. Our inward struggles and spiritual joys go unnoticed. However, we find solace in the fact that while the world may not recognize us, we are well-known to God the Father. He has chosen us, loved us, and made a covenant with us. Additionally, Jesus Christ is intimately acquainted with us, knowing us perfectly and showing us his affectionate care. Despite the world's ignorance, God intercedes on our behalf, allowing us to continue to live and thrive.
