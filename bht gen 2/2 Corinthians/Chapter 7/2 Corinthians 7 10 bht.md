# 2 Corinthians 7:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The sorrow according to God, however, is not a result of human effort or fear of punishment, but a gift of God's grace. It is a sorrow that is in accordance with His will and pleases Him. In contrast, the sorrow of the world is rooted in worldly desires and leads to death in all its forms.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For grief according to God works (brings about, promotes) repentance unto salvation never to be regretted." 
2. "Salvation which none will ever regret having attained, however difficult it may have been to reach, however dearly it may have been bought."
3. "The grief which contemplates nothing but the blow given, and not the God who chastens, can produce nothing but more and more alienation from Him, and result in eternal banishment from His presence."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Sorrow" is not repentance, but, where it is "godly," "worketh" it; that is, contributes or tends to it.
2. "Repentance" implies a coming to a right mind; "regret" implies merely uneasiness of feeling at the past or present, and is applied even to the remorse of Judas.
3. "The sorrow of the world" is not at the sin itself, but at its penal consequences: so that the tears of pain are no sooner dried up, than the pleasures of ungodliness are renewed.

### Albert Barnes:

2. "Such sorrow as shall be exercised toward God in view of sin; which shall arise from a view of the evil of sin as committed against a holy God."
3. "A heart truly contrite and penitent seeks God, and implores pardon from him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Paul's words strike effectively at the popular identification of sorrow with repentance."
2. "The distinction between repentance and the sentiment of misgiving or regret should be carefully observed."
3. "Sorrow of the world...grief for the consequences rather than for the sin as sin."

### John Calvin:
1. "The joy of the world is, when men foolishly, and without the fear of the Lord, exult in vanity... The joy that is according to God is, when men place all their happiness in God, and take satisfaction in His grace, and show this by contempt of the world, using earthly prosperity as if they used it not, and joyful in the midst of adversity." 
2. "Sorrow according to God is that which has an eye to God... when, impressed with fear of His judgment, they mourn over their sins. This sorrow Paul makes the cause and origin of repentance."
3. "In like manner, although repentance contains in it some degree of bitterness, if, is spoken of as not to be repented of on account of the precious and pleasant fruit which it produces."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "The kind of sorrow that the world has, grief 'for failure, not for sin', works out death in the end."

### John Gill:
