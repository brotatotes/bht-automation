# 2 Corinthians 7:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
What earnest care in contrast with former indifference! It is evident that their sorrowing according to God brought about a diligent effort to correct what was amiss. They diligently cleared themselves, not by denying or defending the sin, but by acknowledging their neglect and praying for forgiveness. Their zeal was directed towards God's glory, restoring church discipline, upholding the teachings of the Gospel, and supporting the apostle and other ministers against false teachers. They took holy revenge upon themselves, expressing deep remorse and a determination to sin no more.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Nay, not σπουδήν merely, that is saying too little; but..." 
2. "The context is brought out well by Chrys. and Theophyl. The latter says, on ἐπιπόθησιν, πρὸς ἐμέ. εἰπὼν δὲ φόβον, ἵνα μὴ δόξῃ αὐθεντεῖν, συντόμως διωρθώσατο, ἐπιπόθησιν εἰπών · ὅπερ ἐνδεικτικὸν ἀγάπης, οὐκ ἐξουσίας."
3. "ζῆλον on God’s behalf, to punish the offender; ἐκδίκησιν being the infliction of justice itself."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Their 'carefulness' was exhibited in the six points just specified: 'clearing of themselves,' and 'indignation' in relation to themselves; 'fear' and 'vehement desire' in respect to the apostle; 'zeal' and 'revenge' in respect to the offender." 
2. "Whatever suspicion of complicity rested on you through your former remissness, you have cleared off by your present strenuousness in reprobating the deed."
3. "'Desire' for the presence of Paul, as he had given them the hope of it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "For behold this self-same thing...your sorrowing after a godly manner, wrought carefulness, clearing of yourselves." 
2. "When people are thoroughly convinced of sin, they will set about removing it with the utmost diligence." 
3. "One effect of true repentance is to produce decided hatred of sin. It is not mere regret, or sorrow, it is positive hatred. There is a deep indignation against it as an evil and a bitter thing."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Sorrowed [λυπηθηναι] . Rev., correctly, were made sorry. The verb is in the passive voice, and is so rendered by the A. V. in ver. 9, but, inconsistently, sorrowed in the next clause."
2. "Indignation [αγανακτησιν] . Only here in the New Testament. Compare the kindred verb ajganaktew to be indignant, Matthew 20:24; Mark 10:14, etc."
3. "Revenge [εκδικησιν] . An unfortunate rendering, because of the personal feeling of vindictiveness which attaches to the popular usage. Rev. avenging is little, if any, better. It is rather meting out of justice; doing justice to all parties."

### John Calvin:
1. "Earnest desire means simply an eager and active assiduity in the correcting of what is amiss, and in the amendment of life."
2. "This disposition, also, is attendant on sacred sorrow — that the sinner is indignant against his vices, and even against himself."
3. "Zeal is intensity of desire."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "What earnest care in contrast with former indifference"
2. "What clearing of yourselves from all real connivance at the deed"
3. "What zeal in the cause of church purity, too long neglected"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This very thing," "the being made sorry according to God."
2. "Diligence, from σπευδω, to hasten."
3. "In the old notion of απολογια (self-vindication, self-defence) as in 1 Peter 3:15."

### John Gill:
1. "What carefulness it wrought in you; to remove the incestuous person from communion with them, which they were very negligent of before; to sin no more after this sort; to keep up, for the future, a more strict and regular discipline in the church; to perform good works in general, and not to offend God."
2. "Yea, what clearing of yourselves; not by denying the fact, or lessening, or defending it; but by acknowledging their neglect, praying it might be overlooked, declaring that they were not partakers of the sin; nor did they approve of it, but disliked and abhorred it."
3. "Yea, what zeal; for God and his glory; for restoring the discipline of the church; for the doctrines of the Gospel; for the ordinances of Christ's house; for the supporting the character of the apostle, and other ministers of the word, against the false apostles."

### John Wesley:
1. "Clearing of yourselves — From either sharing in, or approving of, his sin."
2. "Fear — Of God's displeasure, or lest I should come with a rod."
3. "Yea, revenge — Ye took a kind of holy revenge upon yourselves, being scarce able to forgive yourselves."
