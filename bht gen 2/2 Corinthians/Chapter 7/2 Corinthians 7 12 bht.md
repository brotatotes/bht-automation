# 2 Corinthians 7:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In writing to them, the main motive of the apostle Paul was to bring out their zeal and care for him, the church, and God's commandments. He wanted to make it evident to themselves and in the sight of God that their faithfulness and passion were genuine. Paul's concern was not primarily for individual offenses or personal interests but for the overall welfare of the church at large. His aim was to manifest their deep interest in the church and their commitment to obeying God's commands.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But the true reading, when narrowly looked at, will be found to suit the context best that he wrote in order that by executing the order which he gave them, trying and peremptory as it was, ‘their regard for his apostolic authority and himself too might be manifest to themselves before God.'"
