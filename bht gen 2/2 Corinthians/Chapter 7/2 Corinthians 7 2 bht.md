### Henry Alford:
1. "We (when he dwelt among them, the aorists refer to a set time, not to his course hitherto) wronged no man, we ruined no man, we cheated no man." 
2. "To understand, with Rückert, these verbs as applying to the contents of the former Epistle, is very forced."
3. "In how many ways of which history says nothing, may such ruining of others have been laid to the charge of Paul? How easily might his severe visitation of sin, his zeal for eleemosynary collections, his habit of lodging with members of the churches, and the like, have been thus unfavourably characterized!"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This is the ground on which he asks their reception of (making room for) him in their hearts."

3. "We have corrupted none, namely, by beguilements and flatteries, while preaching 'another Gospel,' as the false teachers did."

1. "The meaning here is make room for us. Rev., open your hearts to us, which is felicitous in view of the reference to ch. 6 12." 
2. "It is equivalent to saying enlarge your hearts to take us in, as our heart is enlarged (ch. 6 11)."

### John Calvin:
1. "Be ye enlarged, that is, 'Do not allow corrupt affections, or unfavorable apprehensions, to prevent this doctrine from making its way into your minds, and obtaining a place within you.'"
2. "He declares that there is no reason why they should have their minds alienated, inasmuch as he had not given them occasion of offense in any thing."
3. "These are three things by which, for the most part, pastors are wont to alienate the minds of the people from them — when they conduct themselves in an overbearing manner, and, making their authority their pretext, break forth into tyrannical cruelty or unreasonableness, — or when they draw aside from the right path those to whom they ought to have been guides, and infect them with the corruption of false doctrine, — or when they manifest an insatiable covetousness, by eagerly desiring what belongs to another."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Open your hearts to us (χωρησατε ημας). Old verb (from χωρος, place), to leave a space, to make a space for, and transitive here as in Matthew 19:11. He wishes no further στενοχωρια, tightness of heart, in them (2 Corinthians 6:12). 'Make room for us in your hearts.' He makes this plea to all, even the stubborn minority."
2. "We wronged no man (ουδενα ηδικησαμεν). A thing that every preacher ought to be able to say. Cf. 2 Corinthians 4:2; 1 Thessalonians 2:3; Acts 20:26."
3. "We took advantage of no man (ουδενα επλεονεκτησαμεν). That charge was made in Thessalonica (1 Thessalonians 4:6) which see for this late verb and also on 2 Corinthians 2:11. He got the best of (note πλεον more in the root) no one in any evil way."

2. "We have hurt no man — In his person."
3. "We have corrupted no man — In his principles."
