# 2 Corinthians 7:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Amidst their efforts in Macedonia, the apostles found themselves in a constant state of distress and agitation, with no respite for their weary bodies. They faced fierce opposition and external conflicts from adversaries who sought to hinder their ministry. Internally, they carried the burden of fears, anxiously concerned for the well-being of their converts and the reception of their letters. Yet, even in the midst of these trials, they remained steadfast in their mission, seeking to overcome these challenges through the strength of Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For also, after our coming to Macedonia, our flesh had no rest; without, fightings, within, fears." 
2. "No further distinction must be drawn for ἔσωθεν φόβοι evidently shews that σάρξ must be taken in a wide sense."
3. "But it is better, as Paul speaks of ἡ σὰρξ ἡμῶν, to understand  ἔξωθεν of the  state of things without him [personally], contentions with adversaries either within or without the church, and  ἔσωθεν of  that within [  him personally], fears, for ourselves, for others, or for  you , how you might have received our letter."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "When I came to Troas, I had no rest in my spirit" (2 Corinthians 2:13).
2. "My flesh had no rest from fightings with adversaries 'without' and from fears for the Corinthian believers 'within' the Church" (2 Corinthians 2:13).
3. "He, by the term 'flesh,' excepts his spiritual consolations" (2 Corinthians 2:13).

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Our flesh had no rest - We were exceedingly distressed and agitated. We had no rest."
2. "Without were fightings - Probably he here refers to fierce opposition, which he met with in prosecuting his work of preaching the gospel."
3. "Within were fears - Referring probably to the anxiety which he had in regard to the success of the Epistle which he had sent to the church at Corinth. He felt great solicitude on the subject."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Rest [ανεσιν] . Rev., relief. See on liberty, Acts 24:23.

### John Calvin:
1. "I was pressed on every side by afflictions both internal and external. All this, however, has not prevented the joy that you have afforded me from prevailing over it, and even overflowing."
2. "He endured much distress in consequence of domestic evils. For he saw how great was the infirmity of many, nay of almost all, and in the mean time what, and how diversified, were the machinations, by which Satan attempted to throw everything into confusion."
3. "Faithful pastors openly set themselves in opposition to those enemies that avowedly attack Christ's kingdom, but they are inwardly tormented, and endure secret tortures, when they see the Church afflicted with internal evils, for the exterminating of which they dare not openly sound the trumpet."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For even when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no relief, but we were troubled on every side." 
2. "Without were fightings, from enemies."
3. "Within were fears for his work, his converts, his reputation."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Had no relief (ημων ηκεκληκεν ανεσιν). Perfect active indicative precisely as in 2 Corinthians 2:13 which see, 'has had no relief' (dramatic perfect)."
2. "Afflicted (θλιβομενο). Present passive participle of θλιβω as in 2 Corinthians 4:8, but with anacoluthon, for the nominative case agrees not with the genitive ημων nor with the accusative ημας in verse 2 Corinthians 7:6."
3. "Without were fightings (εξωθεν μαχα). Asyndeton and no copula, a parenthesis also in structure. Perhaps pagan adversaries in Macedonia (cf. 1 Corinthians 15:32). Within were fears (εσωθεν φοβο). Same construction. 'Mental perturbations' (Augustine) as in 2 Corinthians 11:28."

### John Gill:
1. "Our flesh had no rest; that is, their outward man, their bodies; they were continually fatigued with preaching, disputing, fighting."
2. "Without were fightings, within were fears; there seems to be an allusion to Deuteronomy 32:25."
3. "Their outward conversation in this life is a warfare; partly with false teachers, with whom they fight the "good fight of faith", contend for the doctrine of faith, using the spiritual weapons of the Scriptures of truth; and partly with the men of the world, to whose rage and contempt they are exposed, and among whom they endure a great fight of afflictions, with patience, and in the exercise of faith, whereby they gain the victory over the world and partly with Satan, their avowed adversary, and implacable enemy, against whom they wrestle in the strength of Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "Our flesh — That is, we ourselves."
2. "Had no rest from without — From the heathens."
3. "Were fears — Lest they should be seduced."
