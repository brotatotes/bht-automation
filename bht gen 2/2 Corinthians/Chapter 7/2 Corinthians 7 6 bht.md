# 2 Corinthians 7:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God is the ultimate comforter for those who are cast down and in need of solace. His characteristic is to offer consolation to those who are anxious and depressed, filling their hearts with comfort. This comfort is not dependent on the character of the individual, but rather on the circumstances that have brought them low. It is through the presence of individuals like Titus that God often chooses to bring this comfort, assuring them that they are not alone. The comfort offered by God is a powerful reminder of His love and care for those who are in need.
