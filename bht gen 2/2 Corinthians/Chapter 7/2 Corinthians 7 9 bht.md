# 2 Corinthians 7:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The sorrow experienced by the Corinthians was not just a feeling of regret or remorse but resulted in true repentance and a change of heart. The apostle rejoiced not in their grief but in the fact that it led them to turn away from their sins and turn back to God. It was a godly sorrow that brought about this transformation. What brought even more joy to the apostle was that his letter and its impact had not caused any harm to the Corinthians. In fact, it had proved beneficial to them, allowing their souls to be healed and strengthened.
