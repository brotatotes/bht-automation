# 2 Corinthians 8:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia was a remarkable display of God's favor and generosity. It was not something that they earned or deserved, but it was freely given to them by God. This grace enabled them to have a spirit of benevolence and a disposition to do good to others. Their act of liberality was not of themselves, but it was a manifestation of God's grace working in and through them. It serves as an example and an inspiration for us to likewise extend love and kindness to those around us.
