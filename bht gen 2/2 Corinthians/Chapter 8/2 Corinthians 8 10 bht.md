# 2 Corinthians 8:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Acts of beneficence bring both temporal and eternal benefits. God blesses those who give with material blessings, and this is often promised. Additionally, acts of beneficence are a result of God's grace and will be rewarded with eternal grace. It is not only important for the Corinthians to complete what they started for their own reputation, but they should do it willingly and cheerfully, as this is what it means to be truly forward in their giving.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And I give my opinion [not ‘judgment,’ as rendered in the Version of the Five Clergymen, which is objectionable here, as conveying the very idea which the Apostle wishes to negative, that of an authoritative decision] in this matter, the stress being on γνώμην, as distinguished from ἐπιταγήν." 
2. "For this (viz. ‘my giving my opinion, and not commanding,’ as Billroth and Meyer. De Wette controverts this, and would make τοῦτο refer to the proof of their love in the act of charity,... my opinion, rather than commanding, is expedient for you, who have already shown yourselves so willing." (35 words)

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is his 'opinion' or 'judgment,' not a command, that so their offering might be free and spontaneous."
2. "There were three steps: (1) the forwardness, more literally, 'the will'; (2) the setting about it, literally, 'doing it'; (3) completion of it."
3. "Ye began already a year ago, not only to do, but also to be forward."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Advice will go much further than commands on the subject of charities."
2. "It became them; it was proper, and was demanded; and there would have been manifest disadvantages if it had not been done."
3. "They were voluntary in this, and they set about it with vigorous and determined zeal and courage."

### John Calvin:
1. "The advantage, however, arises from this — that 'He that giveth to the poor (as Solomon says in Proverbs 19:17) lendeth to the Lord,' whose blessing, of itself, is to be regarded as a hundredfold more precious than all the treasures of the world."
2. "The word useful, however, is taken here to mean honorable, or at least Paul measures what is useful by what is honorable, because it would have been disgraceful to the Corinthians to draw back, or to stop short in the middle of the course, when they had already advanced so far."
3. "Such cheerfulness of anticipation is better than the actual performance of the deed."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And herein I give my judgment or 'opinion;'" 
2. "Not only to do, but to will a strange expression; but the meaning clearly is, 'Since ye not only began to make this collection last year, before ever the Macedonian churches were addressed upon the subject, but set yourselves to it with a will (as we should say), it would only be becoming in you not to fall behind the Macedonians in the completion of it.'" 
3. "That this is the meaning, seems plain from the next verse."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Judgment (γνωμην). Deliberate opinion, but not a 'command' (επιταγη verse 2 Corinthians 8:8). Cf. 1 Corinthians 7:25."
2. "A year ago (απο περυσ) From last year."
3. "Not only to do, but also to will (ου μονον το ποιησαι, αλλα κα το θελειν). Articular infinitives the objects of προενηρξασθε on which verb see verse 2 Corinthians 8:6). That is to say, the Corinthians promised before any others."

### John Gill:
1. "Doing acts of beneficence is profitable to persons, as to things temporal, God usually blessing such with a greater affluence of the things of life, and which indeed is often promised." 
2. "Such a conduct is profitable in relation to things eternal; for as it springs from the grace of God, and men are assisted therein by it, and is exercised towards persons that have received it, it will be rewarded with a reward of grace."
3. "To save their own credit, it was expedient for them to finish what they had begun; for otherwise, as their boasting of them would be in vain, so they would expose themselves to contempt and incur disgrace; and it was not only proper that they should do this, but do it willingly, and with much cheerfulness, for that is meant by being 'forward' or 'willing.'"
