# 2 Corinthians 8:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let us remember that just as it is important to have the readiness to do good, we must also follow through with action. Our giving should be in proportion to what we are able to give, as God has blessed us individually. We should not be discouraged by the size of our offering, but rather give with a willing heart and from what we have, whether it be small or large.

2. "The completion also (κα το επιτελεσα). The finishing also (articular first aorist active infinitive)."
3. "Out of your ability (εκ του εχειν). 'Out of the having,' literally, and so, 'out of what you can give' (verse 2 Corinthians 8:12)."
