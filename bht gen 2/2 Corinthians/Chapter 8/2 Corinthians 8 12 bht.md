# 2 Corinthians 8:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Every believer, regardless of their past sins, is accepted by God. This acceptance is not based on our own merits, but solely on our faith in Christ's sacrifice. When someone acknowledges their own sinfulness and seeks refuge in the wounds of Jesus, they can personally apply this assurance of acceptance. Salvation is not achieved through our own efforts, but through relying on the merits of Christ alone.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "[T]he construction of the sentence is simple enough: προθυμία being the subject throughout, quasi-personified: readiness in God’s service is accepted, if its exertion be commensurate with its means, and is not measured by an unreasonable requirement of what it has not."
2. "Explanation of ἐκ τοῦ ἔχειν, that on it, προθυμία being presupposed, and not on absolute quantity, acceptability depends."
3. "For if a willing mind is present, according to what it may happen to possess, it is acceptable, not according to what it possesseth not."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "According to whatsoever it have"; the willing mind, or "readiness" to will, is personified [ALFORD].
2. "He is accepted according to whatsoever he have"; so 2 Corinthians 8:11- :, The Lord loveth a cheerful giver." Compare as to David, 1 Kings 8:18. God accepts the will for the deed.
3. He judges not according to what a man has the opportunity to do, but according to what he would do if he had the opportunity (compare Mark 14:8; and the widow's mite, Luke 21:3; Luke 21:4).

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A willing mind is the first consideration. No donation, however large, can be acceptable where that does not exist; none, however small, can be otherwise than acceptable where that is found."
2. "His obligation is proportioned to his ability. His offering is acceptable to God according to the largeness and willingness of his heart, and not according to the narrowness of his fortune."
3. "If there is any service rendered to God, according to the ability, it is accepted of him. It may not be as much or as valuable as may be rendered by beings of higher powers; it may not be as much as we would desire to render, but it is all that God demands, and is acceptable to him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "If there be first a willing mind [ει η προθυμια προκειται]. The error of the A. V. consists in regarding pro in prokeitai as indicating priority in time; be first; whereas it signifies position, before one."
2. "Hence Rev., correctly, if the readiness is there."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The acceptability of all our offerings depends not on the amount given, but on the proportion which it bears to our means."
2. "The readiness to give is a delightful principle, worthy of Him who 'loveth a cheerful giver'."
3. "For if the readiness is there, it is acceptable."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Acceptable (ευπροσδεκτος)."
2. "According as a man hath (καθο εαν εχη)."
3. "Clearly God does not expect us to give what we do not have."

### John Gill:
1. "If what is done springs from a truly noble, generous spirit, a spirit of bountifulness and liberality; and is given cheerfully and freely, and according to a man's ability; the quantity matters not, whether it be more or less."
2. "It is accepted; both of God and man: according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not."
3. "The widow's mite was as acceptable, and more so, than all the rich men cast into the treasury."

### John Wesley:
1. "Every believer... is accepted with God."
2. "Whoever acknowledges himself to be a vile, guilty sinner... flies for refuge to the wounds of a crucified Saviour... may... apply this indulgent declaration to himself."
3. "Relies on his merits alone for salvation."
