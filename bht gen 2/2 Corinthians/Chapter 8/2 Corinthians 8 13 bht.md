# 2 Corinthians 8:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle Paul's message in 2 Corinthians 8:13 is not to burden some individuals while others are exempt from contributing. He emphasizes the importance of each person giving according to their ability, ensuring fairness and shared responsibility. The goal is not to place the burden solely on a few, but for everyone to contribute according to their means. Paul's intention is not for the Jewish brethren in Jerusalem to live in abundance at the expense of those who generously assist them, but rather for all to share the load and provide help to those in need.
