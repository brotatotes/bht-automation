# 2 Corinthians 8:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible teaches that there should be equality among Christians. This means that those who have an abundance should share with those who are in need. In doing so, we are demonstrating the love of Christ and showing unity within the body of believers. As we give and receive, we are participating in the system of proportional right in the Church, which creates a befitting symmetry, even though gifts and resources are distributed unequally. Ultimately, this mutual contribution benefits the entire body and brings glory to God.

### Henry Alford:
1. "But the passage has been curiously misunderstood to mean, 'that their (the Jewish Christians') abundance in spiritual things may be imparted to you to supply your deficiency."
2. "The reference is still, as is evident from the next verse, to the supply of temporal wants, in respect of which there should be a mutual relieving and sharing among Christians."
3. "Thus Chrys., al., the ancients regarding this imparting as the Gospel-benefit received from them by the Gentiles (which however was past, not future, and is urged as a motive for gratitude, see Rom 15:27)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "by the rule of equality" [ALFORD]: literally, "Out of equality."

### Albert Barnes:

### John Calvin:

2. "This participation, which Christ has established among the members of his body, should animate you to be more forward, and more active in doing good."
3. "The system of proportional right in the Church is this — that while they communicate to each other mutually according to the measure of gifts and of necessity, this mutual contribution produces a befitting symmetry, though some have more, and some less, and gifts are distributed unequally."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "By equality (εξ ισοτητος). Old word from ισος, fair, equal. In N.T. only here and Colossians 4:1."

### John Gill:
1. "All that he meant was, that there might be an equality both in givers and receivers, proportioned to their several circumstances and stations of life."
2. "That their abundance also may be a supply for your want; which respects either the different abilities of givers at different times."
3. "That should they ever change circumstances, as it was not impossible that they that were now rich should become poor, and they that were poor become rich; then as their abundance had been a supply to the wants of others, the abundance of others in their turn would be a supply to their wants."

### John Wesley:
1. "That their abundance may be a supply to your want: that there may be an equality." 
2. "That as the temporal bounty of the Corinthians did now supply the temporal wants of their poor brethren in Judea, so the prayers of these might be a means of bringing down many spiritual blessings on their benefactors." 
3. "So that all the spiritual wants of the one might be amply supplied; all the temporal of the other."
