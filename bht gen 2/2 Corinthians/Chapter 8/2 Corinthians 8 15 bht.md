### Henry Alford:
1. "That there may be equality, as it is written... He that (gathered) much, did not exceed (the measure prescribed by God): and he that (gathered) little, did not fall short (of it)."
2. "The fact of equality being the only point brought into comparison as between the Israelites of old and Christians now, it is superfluous to enquire minutely how this equality was wrought among the Israelites."
3. "The context supplies ÏƒÏ…Î»Î»Î­Î¾Î±Ï‚ from the ÏƒÏ…Î½Î­Î»ÎµÎ¾Î±Î½ in the preceding verse, and is presumed by the Apostle to be familiar to his readers."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "As God gave an equal portion of manna to all the Israelites, whether they could gather much or little."
2. "Christians should promote by liberality an equality, so that none should need the necessaries of life while others have superfluities."
3. "Our luxuries should yield to our neighbor's comforts; and our comforts to his necessities."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They who had gathered more than an omer, therefore, would in this way contribute to the needs of others, and would be constantly manifesting a spirit of benevolence."
2. "Paul applies this passage, therefore, in the very spirit in which it was originally penned. He means to say that the rich Christians at Corinth should impart freely to their poorer brethren."
3. "Wealth, like manna, is the gift of God. It is like that spread by his hand around us every day. Some are able to gather much more than others. By their skill, their health, their diligence, or by providential arrangements, they are eminently successful."

### John Calvin:
1. "He would have this to serve as a never-failing proof, that men do not live by bread alone, but are Divinely supported, by the secret influence of His will."
2. "The Lord has not prescribed to us an homer, or any other measure, according to which the food of each day is to be regulated, but he has enjoined upon us frugality and temperance, and has forbidden, that any one should go to excess, taking advantage of his abundance."
3. "For whatever we have is manna, from whatever quarter it comes, provided it be really ours...we need not doubt that the riches, that are heaped up at the expense of our brethren, are accursed, and will soon perish, and that too, in connection with the ruin of the owner."

### John Gill:
1. "Many useful instructions may be learned from this history, as that as there was a general provision made by God for the Israelites...so there is an universal providence of God which reaches to all creatures...though to the latter it is more special." 
2. "And as that provision was daily, so is that providential supply which all creatures have from God; he is to be trusted to, and depended on daily; application is to be made to him every day for daily bread; nor should there be any anxious concern for the morrow."
3. "Moreover, as the Israelites, though the manna was prepared for them, were to rise in the morning and gather it before the sun waxed hot; so notwithstanding the providence of God, and the daily care he takes of men, yet diligence, industry, and the use of means are highly commendable."

### John Wesley:
1. As it is written, He that had gathered the most had nothing over; and he that had gathered the least did not lack â€” That is, in which that scripture is in another sense fulfilled. Exodus 16:18
