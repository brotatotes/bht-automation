# 2 Corinthians 8:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Thanks be to God, who put the same great diligence and concern for you into the heart of Titus. By this diligent care, it is meant that Titus showed great dedication, solicitude, and effort in urging the Corinthians to be generous in their giving. It is important to recognize that acts of kindness and generosity ultimately benefit the giver more than the receiver. Moreover, we must acknowledge that these noble inclinations in the heart of Titus were not merely human in origin, but were a result of God's grace at work in him.
