# 2 Corinthians 8:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Titus, after receiving Paul's exhortation to visit them, eagerly embraced the opportunity. He went forth to Corinth not only willingly but even more earnestly than the need of the exhortation itself required. Titus' willingness to go was not influenced by the advice of others, but rather by his own disposition. His readiness to engage in this work demonstrated his care and love for the Corinthians, showing that he had already determined in his heart to complete the unfinished task.
