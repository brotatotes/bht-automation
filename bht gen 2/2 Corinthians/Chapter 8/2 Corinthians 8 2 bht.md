# 2 Corinthians 8:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Macedonians experienced a great trial of affliction, as they were constantly being persecuted and subjected to various hardships. This is all the more remarkable because, in such a period of affliction, it would have been expected for their joy to be diminished. However, their joy not only remained, but it abounded. Their deep poverty did not prevent them from being generous and showing liberality to others, demonstrating the richness of their willingness to give, despite their limited resources.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The trial to which the apostle here refers was doubtless some persecution which was excited against them, probably by the Jews."

3. "If a people have the joys of the gospel; if they have the consolations of religion themselves, they will somehow or other find means to contribute to the welfare of others."

2. "Believers, on the other hand, seek occasions of joy in the affliction itself."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The 'abundance of their joy' abounded; their joy in a great trial of affliction; 'their deep poverty' overflowed into 'the riches of their liberality.'" 
2. "Such poverty might well have been thought to exempt them from contributing to the relief of others, probably no poorer than themselves. But, as is often seen in such cases, instead of taking advantage of this excuse, the 'joy' of a new-found salvation not only overpowered all sense of their 'poverty,' 'deep' as that was, but rose into 'rich liberality.'"

### John Gill:
1. "Now for persons in prosperity, when all things go well with them, to be liberal is no such great matter but for persons in adversity, under trying dispensations of Providence, amidst many afflictive ones to communicate generously to the relief of others, is something very remarkable, and worthy of notice and imitation."
2. "The allusion seems to be to the words of David, in 1 Chronicles 22:14 now behold, בעניי which the Septuagint render by κατα πτωχειαν μου, 'according to my poverty, I have prepared for the house of the Lord an hundred thousand talents of gold', c."
3. "Though their poverty was great, their liberality was rich and large; though it might be but little they gave in quantity, it was much in quality, much in liberality; like the poor widow, who, of her want and penury, cast in more than all the rich besides, not in quantity, but in liberality."

### John Wesley:
1. In a great trial of affliction — Being continually persecuted, harassed, and plundered.
