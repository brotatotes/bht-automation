# 2 Corinthians 8:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In order to avoid any blame or criticism regarding the management of the abundant contributions, the apostle takes precautions and arranges the situation carefully. He is aware of the dangers involved in handling financial matters and strives to maintain his integrity. His actions serve as an important example for ministers in dealing with the financial generosity of the church. The term abundance describes the richness and largeness of the contribution and should not be misunderstood as merely a gift. The apostle navigates through these challenges with prudence and concern, taking measures to protect his reputation and prevent any stumbling blocks.
