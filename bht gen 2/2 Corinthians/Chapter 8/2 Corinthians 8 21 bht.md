# 2 Corinthians 8:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is crucial for believers, especially ministers, to not only have a good relationship with God but also to maintain a good reputation among people. Losing the trust of others can greatly undermine the effectiveness of their ministry. The apostle Paul emphasized the importance of conducting oneself in a manner that is not only pleasing to God but also commendable in the eyes of others. This does not mean seeking superficial popularity, but rather ensuring that one's actions do not cause weaker believers to stumble or hinder the edification of others.
