# 2 Corinthians 8:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our brother, who may refer to Apollos, was chosen by Paul to accompany Titus and Luke. This decision was in accordance with Jewish customs, as the distribution of alms was often carried out by a group of three individuals. In selecting this diligent and industrious man, Paul had the assurance of his previous faithful service and his eagerness to fulfill this task. This brother's zeal was further kindled by Paul's expressed confidence in the Corinthians' generosity and willingness to help.
