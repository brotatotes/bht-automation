# 2 Corinthians 8:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Macedonians demonstrated an exceptional level of generosity. Not only did they give beyond their means, but they did so willingly and selflessly. They were eager to provide for others and showed a remarkable desire to alleviate the needs of those around them. Their actions exemplify the characteristics of a cheerful giver, someone who gives freely and wholeheartedly without being asked. This self-motivated generosity is truly commendable and serves as an inspiration for us all.
