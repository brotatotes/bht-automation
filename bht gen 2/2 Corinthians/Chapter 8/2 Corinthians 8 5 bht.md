# 2 Corinthians 8:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The believers went above and beyond what was expected of them in their generosity. They not only gave financially, but they also gave themselves completely to the Lord and to the apostles. This self-surrender was the motivation behind their giving. It was clear that their actions were guided by God's will, as He moved them to dedicate themselves fully to Him and His purposes. Their willingness to give everything they had, both materially and spiritually, is a testament to their trust in God's provision and their commitment to His work.
