# 2 Corinthians 8:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Encouraged by the eagerness and generosity displayed by the Macedonians in their giving, we felt compelled to urge Titus to follow through and bring to completion in the Corinthians the same act of grace. Being aware that the Corinthians could not afford to be surpassed in their generosity by the less affluent Macedonian believers, we were motivated to ensure that Titus fulfills this task. It is crucial to note that Titus did not embark upon this mission on his own accord, but rather at the request of the Macedonians, representing their desire for unity and shared benevolence among the believers.

### Henry Alford:

2. "The construction is pregnant ἔλθῃ εἰς ὑμᾶς καὶ ἐπιτελέσῃ." 
3. "It does not belong to ταύτην, 'this grace also, as well as other graces,' but to τὴν χάριν ταύτην altogether."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "As we saw the Macedonians' alacrity in giving, we could not but exhort Titus, that as we collected in Macedonia, so he in Corinth should complete the work of collecting which he had already begun there, lest ye, the wealthy people of Corinth, should be outdone in liberality by the poor Macedonians."
2. "Finish in you the same grace—complete among you this act of grace or beneficence on your part."
3. "Also—as well as other things which he had to do among them."

### Albert Barnes:

### John Calvin:
1. "That we should exhort Titus. Now this is an exhortation that is of greater force, when they learn that they are expressly summoned to duty." (667)
2. "Nor was it offensive to the Macedonians, that he was desirous to have the Corinthians as partners in beneficence. In the mean time an apology is made for Titus, that the Corinthians may not think that he pressed too hard upon them, as if he had not confidence in their good disposition." (667)

### John Gill:
1. "Observing the very great readiness, cheerfulness, and liberality of the poor Macedonians in this matter, the apostles could do no other than desire Titus to forward, hasten, and accomplish a like liberal contribution among the Corinthians"
2. "That as he had already moved this affair to the Corinthians while he was with them, and had made some progress in it, though what, through one thing or another, it had been retarded, and lay in some measure neglected; that he might be desired to go again, on purpose to complete so good a work, so acceptable to God, and so useful to the poor saints"
3. "This carries in it a new and strong argument to stir up the Corinthians to this service; since they had not only the example of the Macedonian churches, but it was even at their request that Titus was desired to go upon this errand"

### John Wesley:
1. As he had begun — When he was with you before.
