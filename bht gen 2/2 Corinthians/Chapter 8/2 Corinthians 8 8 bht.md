# 2 Corinthians 8:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle did not compel or impose a command on the Corinthians to give, recognizing that true giving must be voluntary and cheerful. He was moved to address this matter by the example of the Macedonians, who gave generously despite their own poverty, and their passionate desire for others to follow suit. Paul sent Titus not as a display of authority, but out of the bountiful encouragement and urging from others, as well as his own deep compassion and care for the needy believers.
