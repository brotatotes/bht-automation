# 2 Corinthians 8:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For you are aware of the immense love that Christ displayed by willingly humbling Himself and taking on the form of a human, living a life of poverty and ultimately sacrificing Himself on the cross. This incredible act of selflessness and grace exemplifies the depth of His love for us. Through His poverty, He made it possible for us to be enriched in ways that go far beyond material possessions, but rather in the favor and likeness of God Himself. This knowledge of His great love should compel us to show love and generosity towards others.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He, being rich, became poor: not, as De W., merely by His renunciation of human riches during His life on earth, but by His exinanition of His glory."
2. "The stress is on διʼ ὑμᾶς, to raise the motive of gratitude the more effectually in them."
3. "That by His poverty (as the efficient cause) ye might become rich: viz. with the same wealth in which He was rich, the kingdom and glory of Heaven."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Ye know the grace—the act of gratuitous love whereby the Lord emptied Himself of His previous heavenly glory for your sakes."
2. "If the Lord did so much more, and at so much heavier a cost, for your sakes; much more may you do an act of love to your brethren at so little a sacrifice of self."
3. "Might be rich—in the heavenly glory which constitutes His riches, and all other things, so far as is really good for us."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The design of this verse is apparent. It is, to show the duty of giving liberally to the objects of benevolence, from the fact that the Lord Jesus was willing to become poor in order that he might benefit others."
2. "The most absolute right which can exist is that acquired by the act of creation; and this right the Son of God possessed over all gold, and silver, and diamonds, and pearls; over all earth and lands; over all the treasures of the ocean, and over all worlds."
3. "He made no will in regard to his property, for he had none to dispose of. He intended that his disciples should never be turned away from the great work to which he called them by any wealth which he would leave them; and he left them not even a keepsake as a memorial of his name."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Became poor" is correct, though some render "was poor," and explain that Christ was both rich and poor simultaneously; combining divine power and excellence with human weakness and suffering.
2. The aorist tense denotes the entrance into the condition of poverty, and the whole accords with the magnificent passage, Philippians 2:6-8.
3. Stanley has some interesting remarks on the influence of this passage in giving rise to the orders of mendicant friars.

### John Calvin:
1. "He does not afterwards state for what purpose he makes mention of this, but leaves it to be considered by them; for no one can but perceive, that we are by this example stirred up to beneficence, that we may not spare ourselves, when help is to be afforded to our brethren."
2. "Christ was rich...he became poor, because he refrained from possessing, and thus he gave up his right for a time."
3. "By his poverty he has enriched us all for this purpose — that we may not feel it hard to take from our abundance what we may lay out upon our brethren."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We have here an example of the apostle’s beautiful practice of connecting the most familiar duties and incidents of life with the grandest and most affecting truths of the Gospel."
2. "Every word here must be weighed."
3. "How do we measure the 'grace' or goodwill of any one towards others? By four things: By the height from which he looks down on his objects; by the depth in which he finds them lying beneath him; by the sacrifices to which he submits, for their good; and by the benefits which at much cost to himself he confers upon them."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Though he was rich (πλουσιος ων). Concessive present participle ων from ειμ, to be."
2. "He became poor (επτωχευσεν). Ingressive aorist active indicative of πτωχευω (see verse 2 Corinthians 8:2 on πτωχεια)."
3. "Through his poverty (τη εκεινου πτωχεια). Instrumental case, by means of."

### John Gill:
1. "This is a new argument, and a very forcible one to engage to liberality, taken from the wonderful grace and love of Christ, displayed in his state of humiliation towards his people."
2. "He endured in it a great deal of reproach and shame, and at last death itself; not that by becoming man he ceased to be God, or lost his divine perfections, though these were much hid and covered from the view of man."
3. "The end for which he became poor for them was, that they through his poverty might be rich; not in temporals, but in spirituals; and by his obedience, sufferings, and death in his low estate, he has paid all their debts, wrought out a robe of righteousness, rich and adorned with jewels, with which he clothes them."

### John Wesley:
1. "For ye know — And this knowledge is the true source of love."
