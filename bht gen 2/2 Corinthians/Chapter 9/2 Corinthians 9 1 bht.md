# 2 Corinthians 9:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is abundantly clear that the duty of ministering to the saints is well-known and acknowledged by the Corinthians. Therefore, it is unnecessary for me to use further arguments to convince you of this obligation. However, out of an abundance of caution, I will offer some suggestions on how this duty can be accomplished.

### John Gill:
1. "By 'ministering to the saints', he does not mean the ministry of the Gospel to them; nor that mutual assistance members of churches are to give each other; but either the fellowship of ministering to the saints, which the churches had entreated him, and his fellow ministers, to take upon them, namely, to take the charge of their collections, and distribute them to the poor saints at Jerusalem." 
2. "He thought it unnecessary to say any more upon that head, because he had used so many arguments already to engage them in it, in the foregoing chapter; and because he had sent three brethren to them, who well understood the nature of this service, and were very capable of speaking to it, and of enforcing the reasonings already used."

### John Wesley:
1. To write to you — Largely.
