# 2 Corinthians 9:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The administration of this public service not only supplies the needs of the saints, but also overflows with many thanksgivings to God. By adding to what the saints lack, the service fills up their deficiencies and relieves their sorrows. It is not merely an act of humanity, but a religious duty, and it presents a sacrifice to God. Through this act of Christian beneficence, the Corinthians fulfill their obligation to love their neighbors and generate a sense of thankfulness, as many souls are moved to give thanks to God for the contributions made on their behalf.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The ministration of this public service not only serves the end of supplying by its help the wants of the saints, but of abounding by means of many thanksgivings to God."
2. "The emphasis is on προσαναπλ . and περισσεύουσα, causing to overflow what were ὑστερήματα."
3. "The objectionable one of περισσεύει μοί τι."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The ministration of this public service (on your part) is not only still further supplying the wants of the saints (besides the supplies from other quarters), but is abounding also (namely, in respect to relieving the necessities of others in poverty) through many thanksgivings to God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'service' here, says Doddridge, intimates that this was to be regarded not merely as an act of humanity, but religion."
2. "The result will be that it will produce abundant thanksgiving in their hearts to God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Supplieth [εστιν προσαναπληρουσα] . Lit., fills up by adding to. Only here and ch. 11 9. Supplementing what the saints lack." 
2. "Through many thanksgivings. The need of the poor is filled, like an empty vessel, to the brim, and the supply overflows in the thanksgiving which it calls out."
3. "Thus christian beneficence does a double work, in giving relief and in generating thankfulness."

### John Calvin:
1. "By the term administration, he means what he had undertaken at the request of the Churches." 
2. "The Corinthians, therefore, and others, by assisting the brethren at Jerusalem, presented a sacrifice to God, or they discharged a service that was proper, and one which they were bound to fulfill."
3. "So in the Church, imparting to others consists in every one’s discharging to his neighbours, what he owes them, in love."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Service (λειτουργιας). Old word from λεως (people, λαος), λειτος like δημοσιος, public, and εργον, work. So public service either in worship to God (Luke 1:23) or benefaction to others (2 Corinthians 9:12; Philippians 2:30). Our word liturgy is this word." 
2. "Filleth up (εστιν προσαναπληρουσα). Present active periphrastic indicative of double compound verb προσαναπληροω, Koine word, here and 2 Corinthians 11:9 only in N.T., to fill up by adding to. The Corinthians simply added to the total from others."
3. "Unto God (τω θεω). Dative case and with a certain suddenness as at close of verse 2 Corinthians 9:11, really a parenthesis between in the somewhat tangled sentence."

### John Gill:
1. "For it not only supplieth the wants of the saints; makes up their deficiencies, relieves their necessities, and furnishes them with what is comfortable and refreshing to them under their many sorrowful circumstances, which is answering a very valuable end."
2. "But it is abundant also by many thanksgivings to God; it has over and above this excellency in it, or its excellent use is enhanced, and abundantly appears by this consideration."
3. "Many precious souls are sent hereby to the throne of grace to give thanks to God, who put it into the hearts of the apostles to move the churches on their behalf, and who worked upon them so cheerfully and largely to contribute to their necessities."
