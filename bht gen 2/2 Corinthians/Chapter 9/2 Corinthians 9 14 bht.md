## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In the midst of these difficulties I see no way but this: the datives preceding, ὑποταγῇ and ἁπλότητι, have occasioned this also to be expressed in the dative, as though it depended on ἐπί, whereas it is in reality parallel with διὰ πολλῶν εὐχαριστιῶν and dependent on περισσεύουσα."
2. "Again, the words in another point of view are parallel with τῇ ὑποταγῇ and ἁπλότητι, inasmuch as these are ὑμῶν, and this δέησις is αὐτῶν."
3. "Amidst such complicated antitheses and attracted constructions, it may suffice if we discover the clue to the original formation of the sentence: the meaning is obvious enough, viz. that glory also accrues to God by the prayers of the recipients, who are moved with the desire of Christian love (reff.) to you, on account of the grace of God which abounds eminently towards (over) you."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Themselves also with prayer for you, longing after you on account of the exceeding grace of God (resting) upon you."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The sentiment is, that charity should be shown to poor and afflicted Christians because it will lead them to pray for us and to desire our welfare."
2. "The prayers of the poorest Christian for us are worth more than all we usually bestow on them in charity; and he who has secured the pleadings of a child of God, however humble, in his behalf, has made a good use of his money."
3. "The apostle supposes that the exercise of a charitable disposition is to be traced entirely to God. God is the author of all grace; he alone excites in us a disposition to do good to others."

### John Calvin:
1. "Nay more, he has said that this would be a confession, which would manifest to all their unanimous concurrence in faith, and in pious obedience."
