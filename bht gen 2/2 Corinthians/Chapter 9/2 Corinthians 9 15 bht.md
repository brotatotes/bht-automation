# 2 Corinthians 9:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
None can measure the magnitude of God's unspeakable gift, His immeasurable blessings that surpass our understanding. This gift encompasses not only His Son, the ultimate expression of His love, but also countless other gifts that enrich our lives. In light of this, our gratitude should be unfeigned and overflowing, acknowledging the incomparable generosity of our heavenly Father. We are called to cherish this gift, to exalt Christ who is the embodiment of it, and to live in a manner worthy of His sacrifice, upholding His cause and aiding those in need.
