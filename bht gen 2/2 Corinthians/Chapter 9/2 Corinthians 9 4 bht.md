# 2 Corinthians 9:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle, in his foresight, decided to send brethren ahead of time to ensure that if the Macedonians were to come, they would not find the Corinthians unprepared. This precaution was deemed necessary due to the solid foundation and substantial ground Paul's boasting about the Corinthians had set. If their collection were to prove inadequate, it would be a cause of shame for both Paul and the Corinthians. The word used for hope in the Septuagint is the same as the one used here, emphasizing the confident expectation and assurance held in Paul's message.
