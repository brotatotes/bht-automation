# 2 Corinthians 9:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When giving gifts, it is important to approach it with a generous spirit rather than with a desire to keep for oneself. The Apostle encourages the Corinthians to prepare their gifts beforehand, ensuring that they are ready to give freely and generously when he arrives. This contrasts with the attitude of being niggardly or covetous, where gifts are given sparingly or with reluctance. By giving willingly and generously, the Corinthians would not only bless those in need but also demonstrate a noble and bountiful disposition.
