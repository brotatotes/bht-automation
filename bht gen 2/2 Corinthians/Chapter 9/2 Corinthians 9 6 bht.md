# 2 Corinthians 9:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Sow sparingly and reap sparingly, sow bountifully and reap bountifully. This principle applies not only to agricultural endeavors but also to acts of kindness and generosity. God, who sees the heart and motives behind our actions, will appropriately reward our efforts. So let us give wholeheartedly, knowing that the more we sow in generosity, the more abundant the harvest will be in blessings and rewards from God.
