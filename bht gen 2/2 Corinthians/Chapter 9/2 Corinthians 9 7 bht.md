# 2 Corinthians 9:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Every man should give according to his own heart's conviction and not out of any sense of obligation or reluctance. Giving should be a voluntary act, done with a cheerful and willing heart. It is important not to give grudgingly or out of sorrow, but to give joyfully and generously. God desires our offering to be a sincere and cheerful expression of gratitude and love.
