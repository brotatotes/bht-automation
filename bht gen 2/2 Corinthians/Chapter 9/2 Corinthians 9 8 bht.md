# 2 Corinthians 9:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's gifts are given to us not for our own self-sufficiency, but for the purpose of abounding in good works towards others. This sufficiency implies that we have enough to meet our own needs and to spare for the needs of others. By being generous and giving liberally, we can expect God to provide us with the means to continue abounding in acts of charity. Our blessings are meant to be shared, as we participate in mutual support and assistance. By using our gifts in this way, we not only provide for others but also experience the divine blessing that comes with generosity.
