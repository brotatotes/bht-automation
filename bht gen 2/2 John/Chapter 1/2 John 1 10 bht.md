# 2 John 10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
False teachers should be avoided both publicly and privately. They try to infiltrate households and spread their harmful doctrines, so it is important to not entertain them or give them any encouragement. Do not welcome them into your house or bid them God speed, for their teachings can lead others astray and stumble weak Christians. Be cautious and discerning when it comes to those who seek to deceive and subvert the true doctrine.
