# 2 John 11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By wishing a false brother or teacher well, you imply that he is capable of good speed and joy, and that you wish him success while opposing Christ. In doing so, you identify yourself with his evil deeds. Therefore, it is important not to support or encourage those who teach false doctrines or oppose the truth.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "By wishing a false brother or teacher 'God (or 'good') speed,' you imply that he is capable as such of good speed and joy, and that you wish him it while opposing Christ; so you identify yourself with 'his evil deeds.'"
