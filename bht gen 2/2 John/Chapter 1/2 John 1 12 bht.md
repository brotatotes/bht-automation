# 2 John 12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Having many things to write, the author decides to prioritize the most urgent matters and postpones the rest. It is clear that face-to-face communication is preferred over written communication, as it allows for more personal and intimate conversation. The author eagerly anticipates the joy of sharing the gospel in person, knowing that the experience will be more fulfilling than writing about it. Overall, the purpose of writing is to express love and communicate important truths, while recognizing that personal interaction is often more effective.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "A heart full of love pours itself out more freely face to face, than by letter."
2. "Your joy will be complete in hearing from me in person the joyful Gospel truths which I now defer communicating till I see you."
3. "On other occasions his writing the glad truths was for the same purpose."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Having many things to write unto you - That I would wish to say. This language is such as would be used by one who was hurried, or who was in feeble health, or who hoped soon to see the person written to." 
2. "I would not write with paper - The word 'paper' here conveys an idea which is not strictly correct. 'Paper,' as that term is now understood, was not invented until long after this period. The material designated by the word used by John (χάρτης chartēs) was the Egyptian papyrus, and the particular thing denoted was a leaf made out of that plant."
3. "But I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face - Margin, as in Greek, 'mouth to mouth.' The phrase is a common one, to denote conversation with any one, especially free and confidential conversation."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "John wrote this little letter with his own hand."
2. "So in 3 John 1:14; Numbers 12:8. 'Face to face' (προσωπον προς προσωπον) we have in 1 Corinthians 13:12."
3. "That may be fulfilled  (ινα πεπληρωμενη η). Purpose clause with ινα and the periphrastic perfect passive subjunctive of πληροω, as in 1 John 1:4, which see."

### John Gill:
1. "This makes nothing for the unwritten traditions of the Papists, and as if the Scriptures did not contain the whole of doctrine and of the will of God."
2. "Speak face to face; that is, freely and familiarly converse together about things omitted in this epistle."
3. "Fulness, or a large measure of spiritual joy, may be here intended."

### John Wesley:
1. Having many things to write, I was not minded to write now — Only of these, which were then peculiarly needful.
