# 2 John 13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The absence of the lady's mention in this passage suggests that it is likely referring to a church community rather than an individual. This interpretation is supported by the idea that the children mentioned may actually be the children of a sister in the Christian faith. It is crucial for us to be discerning and cautious of false teachings, while still maintaining relationships with our loved ones who may hold differing beliefs. Our focus should be on rejoicing when children are brought to the knowledge of truth and dedicating themselves to God from an early age.
