# 2 John 2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers have a deep love for one another because they recognize that they all belong to Christ. The truth of Christ dwells within them, shaping their hearts and minds. This truth is not temporary, but a permanent dwelling in the lives of believers, as the truth abides and remains with them. It is like an incorruptible seed and a well of living water that springs up into eternal life.
