# 2 John 3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Grace, mercy, and peace are the blessings bestowed upon believers in the Lord Jesus Christ. Grace removes guilt, mercy relieves misery, and peace comes from abiding in grace and mercy. These blessings come from the Father and the Son, emphasizing their equal roles. The Fatherhood of God is revealed through Jesus, His beloved Son, who shares the same nature and perfections. This salutation confirms the deity of Christ and highlights our twofold relation to both the Father and Son. Through these blessings, we experience God's love and find peace as a foretaste of heavenly perfection.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Grace covers the sins of men; 'mercy,' their miseries. Grace must first do away with man's guilt before his misery can be relieved by mercy. Therefore grace stands before mercy." 
2. "Casting all our care on the Lord, with thanksgiving, maintains this peace." 
3. "The element or sphere in which alone grace, mercy, and peace have place. He mentions truth in  :-; love, in  :-."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This salutation does not differ from those commonly employed by the sacred writers, except in the emphasis which is placed on the fact that the Lord Jesus Christ is 'the Son of the Father.'" 
2. "In all of [John's] writings he dwells much on the fact that the Lord Jesus is the Son of God, and on the importance of recognizing that fact in order to the possession of true religion."
3. "This phrase is not to be connected with the expression 'the Son of the Father,' as if it meant that he was his Son 'in truth and love,' but is rather to be connected with the 'grace, mercy, and peace' referred to, as a prayer that they might be manifested to this family in promoting truth and love."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The sentiment in God assumes the character of pitying love. Mercy is kindness and goodwill toward the miserable and afflicted, joined with a desire to relieve them."
2. "In the Divine mind, and in the order of our salvation as conceived therein, the mercy precedes the grace."
3. "The words indicate the contents of the whole Epistle."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Grace refers to the fountain of favour to undeserving man revealed in Christ; mercy to the individual application of that favour in the forgiveness of sins and the succour of all misery; peace to the result in the tranquillity of a soul one with God." 
2. "These blessings come from the Father through the Son of the Father; but the repetition of the ‚Äòfrom‚Äô makes emphatic the distinctness and equality of the Two Persons."
3. "There is here an observable deviation from St. Paul‚Äôs formula; as also in the addition of ‚Äòtruth and love‚Äô the two spheres or characteristics of the Christian life in which, though not on account of which, these blessings are imparted."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The salutation is like that in the Pastoral Epistles: 'ŒßŒ±œÅŒπœÇ, the wellspring in the heart of God; ŒµŒªŒµŒøœÇ, its outpourings; ŒµŒπœÅŒ∑ŒΩŒ∑, its blessed effect'." 
2. "It serves to bring out distinctly the twofold personal relation of man to the Father and to the Son."
3. "The Fatherhood of God, as revealed by one who being His Son can reveal the Father, and who as man (ŒôŒ∑œÉŒøœÖ) can make him known to men."

### John Gill:
1. "...to confirm the deity of Christ, which is plainly implied in wishing for the above things equally from him, as from the Father..."
2. "He is God's own Son, in a true, proper, and natural sense: and he is so 'in love'; he is his well beloved Son, his dear Son, the Son of his love..."
3. "...since he is not only the image of him, but of the same nature, and has the same perfections with him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Grace takes away guilt; mercy, misery: peace implies the abiding in grace and mercy."
2. "It includes the testimony of God's Spirit, both that we are his children, and that all our ways are acceptable to him."
3. "This is the very foretaste of heaven itself, where it is perfected."
