## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This walking in truth is a walking after God’s commandments in love."
2. "The expression of the commandment in the first person is a mark of gentleness and delicacy: a sign that he who wrote it kept the commandment himself."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It was old in that Christians heard it from the first in the Gospel preaching; new, in that the Gospel rested love on the new principle of filial imitation of God who first loved us, and gave Jesus to die for us."
2. "Love performs both tables of the law, and is the end of the law and the Gospel alike."
3. "For a man to urge a woman ('THEE'; not thee and thy children) that he and she should love one another, is hardly like an apostolic precept, however pure may be the love enjoined; but all is clear if 'the lady' represent a Church."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "John presumed that the command to love one another was understood as far as the gospel was known; and he might well presume it, for true Christianity never prevails anywhere without prompting to the observance of this law."
2. "That we love one another - That is, that there be among the disciples of Christ mutual love; or that in all circumstances and relations they should love one another."
3. "This general command, addressed to all the disciples of the Savior, John doubtless means to say was as applicable to him and to the pious female to whom he wrote as to any others, and ought to be exercised by them toward all true Christians."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. New [καινην] . See on Matthew 26:29. We had [ειχαμεν] . The apostle identifies himself with his readers.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I beseech thee, Syria: the request has in it a tone of dignity as well as of courtesy; the mother is addressed, though some of her children who walked not in love are aimed at" 
2. "the apostle urges his request, which is sheltered behind the evangelical law, not as though writing to thee a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, in the first person, that we love one another." 
3. "'Let us all walk in love:' this, as well as the whole strain, shows the same exquisite courtesy which pervades St. Paul's letters to individuals."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Beseech (ερωτω). For pray as in 1 John 5:16."
2. "That we love one another (ινα αγαπωμεν αλληλους). Either a final clause after ερωτω as in John 17:15 or an object clause in apposition with εντολην, like 1 John 2:27; 1 John 3:23 and like verse 2 John 1:6."

### John Gill:
1. "the apostle having finished the inscription, salutation, and congratulation in the preceding verses, passes to an exhortation"
