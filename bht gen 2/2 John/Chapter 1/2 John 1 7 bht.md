# 2 John 7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Beware of the deceivers who deny the truth and try to lead you astray. They deny the possibility and actuality of the Incarnation, refusing to acknowledge that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. These deceivers are to be regarded as antichrists, as they oppose and fight against Christ. Therefore, it is crucial to hold steadfastly to the truth you have received and not be swayed by their deceitful teachings. Keep the commandments, both in doctrine and ethics, for love and truth are inseparable.

1. "Love and truth go hand in hand."
