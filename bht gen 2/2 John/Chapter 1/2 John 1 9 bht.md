# 2 John 9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To abide in the doctrine of Christ is to remain content with His teaching and not go beyond it, following imaginary developments or claiming to be wiser than the Master Himself. Going beyond His teaching leads to the loss of God, and the penalty is severe. However, those who abide in His doctrine, steadfastly believing and obeying it, have both the Father and the Son. It is essential to hold true to the doctrine of Christ, for through it, we have an intimate union with God.
