# 2 Peter 1:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The faith that believers have obtained is a precious gift, received through the free grace of God. It is not dependent on physical sight but is equally valuable and honorable. This faith, made possible through the righteousness of our God and Savior, satisfies God's justice and enables us to have a deep and abiding relationship with Christ.

2. "The divine election is as independent of man's control, as the lot which is cast forth."

3. "The Greek will undoubtedly bear the construction given in the margin; and if this be the true rendering, it furnishes an argument for the divinity of the Lord Jesus Christ."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The combined name, Simon Peter, is found Luke 5:8; John 13:6; John 20:2; John 21:15, and elsewhere, though in these instances it is given as Simon; Symeon occurring only in Acts 14:14."
2. "The word Christ never occurs in the second epistle without Jesus; and only in this instance without some predicate, such as Lord, Savior."
3. "The word should be written like - precious. Compare precious in 1 Peter 1:7, 1 Peter 1:19; 1 Peter 2:4, 1 Peter 2:6, 1 Peter 2:7. Not the same in measure to all, but having an equal value and honor to those who receive it, as admitting them to the same Christian privileges."

### John Calvin:
1. "Prayer takes the first place at the beginning of this Epistle, and then follows thanksgiving, by which he excites the Jews to gratitude, lest they should forget what great benefits they had already received from God’s hand."
2. "This is a commendation of the grace which God had indiscriminately shewed to all his elect people; for it was no common gift, that they had all been called to one and the same faith, since faith is the special and chief good of man."
3. "He adds, through the righteousness of God, in order that they might know that they did not obtain faith through their own efforts or strength, but through God’s favor alone."

2. "The O.T. sense of δικαιοσυνη applied to God (Romans 1:17) and here to Christ." 
3. "The use of θεος by Peter as a predicate with Jesus Christ no more disproves the Petrine authorship of this Epistle than a like use in John 1:1 disproves the Johannine authorship of the Fourth Gospel and the same use in Titus 2:13 disproves the genuineness of Titus."

### John Gill:
1. "The use of [the term servant] shows the apostle's humility, his sense of obligation to Christ, and acknowledgment of him as his Lord, and that he esteemed it an honour to stand in such a relation to him."
2. "This [faith] is said to be 'precious', as it is in its own nature, being a rich and enriching grace, of more worth and value than gold that perisheth, or than thousands of gold and silver... it is that grace which makes Christ, and all that is his, precious to souls."
3. "[Faith] is an abiding grace, and will never fail, when the most precious things in nature do... it is 'like precious' with that the apostles had... it is the substance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not seen; and as it works by love to Christ and his people."
