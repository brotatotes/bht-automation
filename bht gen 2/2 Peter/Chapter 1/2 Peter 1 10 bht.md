# 2 Peter 1:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In light of the importance and certainty of God's calling and election, we are urged to be even more diligent in confirming and strengthening our salvation. This requires us to exhibit qualities such as courage, knowledge, temperance, and others. By doing so, we not only assure ourselves of our own faith, but we also provide tangible evidence to others that we have been called and chosen by God. Through the exercise of these graces, we can confidently affirm our status as true Christians, knowing that our election is secure and that we will never stumble and fall.
