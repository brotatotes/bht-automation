# 2 Peter 1:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God promises that if we diligently cultivate and exhibit the virtues and graces of our faith, He will abundantly supply us with the strength and grace necessary to face the challenges and trials of life. As a result, He will grant us a glorious entrance into His eternal kingdom, where we will experience full triumph and joy. This entrance is not limited to a future event but encompasses the spiritual reign of God in our hearts here on earth, as well as the admission of our separate souls into His everlasting kingdom at death.
