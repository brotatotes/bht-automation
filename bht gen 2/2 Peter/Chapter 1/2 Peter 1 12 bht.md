# 2 Peter 1:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is crucial to continuously remind ourselves of the essential truths necessary for our abundant participation in Christ's kingdom. As believers, we should not neglect our diligence, for everlasting destruction awaits the slothful while everlasting glory awaits the diligent (2 Peter 1:10-11). Pastors and teachers fulfill a vital role in refreshing the memories of the faithful, emphasizing the importance of well-known truths (2 Peter 1:12-13). We are firmly established in the present truth of the Gospel, which we should never underestimate, as it is through this truth that our faith is strengthened and our hearts are transformed (2 Peter 1:12-13).
