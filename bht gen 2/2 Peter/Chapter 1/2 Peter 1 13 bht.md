# 2 Peter 1:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle emphasizes the brevity of life in this body, referring to it as a temporary tabernacle or tent. This serves as a reminder of how short our time on earth truly is, and how easily a believer can transition out of this earthly existence. May this understanding inspire us to make the most of our time here, living for the glory of God and investing in the things that truly matter.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But (notwithstanding this previously conceded fact, that you know and stand firm in the truth) I think it right" 
2. "as long as I am in this tabernacle (see for the sense 2 Corinthians 5:1 ff.: and below), to stir you up"
3. "in reminding"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But you know the truth, this tabernacle, I therefore need to make the most of my short time for the good of Christ's Church."
2. "The zeal... ought to stimulate Christians on the same ground."
3. "In... compare 2 Peter 3:1."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Yea, I think it meet - I think it becomes me as an apostle. It is my appropriate duty; a duty which is felt the more as the close of life draws near."
2. "As long as I am in this tabernacle - As long as I live; as long as I am in the body. The body is called a tabernacle, or tent, as that in which the soul resides for a little time."
3. "To stir you up, by putting you in remembrance - To excite or arouse you to a diligent performance of your duties; to keep up in your minds a lively sense of Divine things. Religion becomes more important to a man’s mind always as he draws near the close of life, and feels that he is soon to enter the eternal world."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Tabernacle [σκηνωματι] . A figurative expression for the body, used also by Paul, 2 Corinthians 5:1, 2 Corinthians 5:4."
2. "Peter also has the same mixture of metaphors which Paul employs in that passage, viz., building and clothing."
3. "The word, as well as the entire phrase, carries the idea of brief duration - a frail tent, erected for a night."

### John Calvin:
1. "He expresses more clearly how useful and how necessary is admonition, because it is needful to arouse the faithful, for otherwise torpor will creep in from the flesh."
2. "Now, this moderation is to be observed towards those to whom a sharp reproof would not be suitable, but who ought on the contrary to be kindly helped, since they are inclined of themselves to do their duty."
3. "At the same time, I doubt not but that it was Peter’s object to gain more authority and weight to his teaching, when he said that he would endeavor to make them remember these things after his death, which was then nigh at hand."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Their danger, on the contrary, is so grave that he must speak to them as long as life lasts"
2. "The body is here figuratively described as a tent or ‘tabernacle’ by a word which occurs again in the figurative sense in the next verse"
3. "The figure was a somewhat common one in later Classical Greek, particularly in medical writers. It conveyed the idea that the body is the mere tenement of the man, and a fragile one, erected for a night’s sojourn and quickly taken down."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Peter considers this to be his solemn duty, 'right' (δικαιον)."
2. "Peter feels the nearness of death and the urgency upon him."
3. "By putting you in remembrance (εν υπομνησε). 'By way of reminding you.'"

### John Gill:
1. "This is the apostle's other reason for his conduct, taken from the duty of his place and office; judging it to be what became him as an apostle and elder, and the minister of the circumcision, and was what was due to God and Christ, whom he served, and the souls of men under his care."
2. "For the body is as a tabernacle for the soul to dwell in, pitched for a time, and, ere long, to be taken down."
3. "To stir you up; to the lively exercise of grace, and constant performance of duty: by putting you in remembrance: of the said things; for saints are apt to be forgetful of their duty, and backward to it, and sluggish and slothful in it."

### John Wesley:
1. In this tabernacle — Or tent. How short is our abode in the body! How easily does a believer pass out of it!
