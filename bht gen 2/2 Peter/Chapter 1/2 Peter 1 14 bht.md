# 2 Peter 1:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The putting off of my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ declared to me, refers to Peter's impending death, which he knew would be sudden and quick. Though the exact timing is uncertain, Peter acknowledges that death is not far off. Rather than being filled with dread, he encourages us to prepare for death, knowing that it is not the end, but a departure from this world to a new realm. The brevity of life should inspire us to labor diligently in serving the Lord and to cherish the value of our remaining days.
