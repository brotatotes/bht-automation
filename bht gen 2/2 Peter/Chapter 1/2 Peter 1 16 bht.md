## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Such cunningly-devised fables would be the mythologies of the heathen, the cabalistic stories of the Jews; and these may be alluded to, and perhaps also the fables of the Gnostics."
2. "The power...of our Lord Jesus Christ, and coming...second and glorious coming."
3. "Eye-witnesses of His majesty...on the occasion to be mentioned."


### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "A precautionary protest of the Spirit against the rationalistic theory of the Gospel history being myth."
2. "A specimen of His power was given at the Transfiguration also of His 'coming' again, and its attendant glory."
3. "We were admitted into His innermost secrets, namely, at the Transfiguration."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The doctrines which they held about the coming of the Saviour were not, like many of the opinions of the Greeks, defended by weak and sophistical reasoning, but were based on solid evidence - evidence furnished by the personal observation of competent witnesses."
2. "The advent of the Saviour is commonly represented as connected with the exhibition of power."
3. "That transfiguration was understood to have an important reference to the coming of the Saviour in his kingdom and his glory, and was designed to be a representation of the manner in which he would then appear."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "We have not followed [Î¿Ï… ÎµÎ¾Î±ÎºÎ¿Î»Î¿Ï…Î¸Î·ÏƒÎ±Î½Ï„ÎµÏ‚]. A strong compound, used only here and ch. 2 2, 15. The ejx gives the force of following out; in pursuance of; closely."
2. "Cunningly devised [ÏƒÎµÏƒÎ¿Ï†Î¹ÏƒÎ¼ÎµÎ½Î¿Î¹Ï‚]. Only here and 2 Timothy 3:15, in which latter passage it has a good sense, to make thee wise. Here, in a bad sense, artfully framed by human cleverness [ÏƒÎ¿Ï†Î¹Î±]."
3. "Fables [Î¼Ï…Î¸Î¿Î¹Ï‚]. This word, which occurs only here and in the Pastoral Epistles, is transcribed in the word myth. The reference here may be to the Jewish myths, rabbinical embellishments of Old - Testament history; or to the heathen myths about the descent of the gods to earth, which might be suggested by his remembrance of the transfiguration; or to the Gnostic speculations about aeons or emanations, which rose from the eternal abyss, the source of all spiritual existence, and were named Mind, Wisdom, Power, Truth, etc."

### John Calvin:
1. "Lest, then, the faithful should think that in these labors they were beating the air, he now comes to set forth the certainty of the gospel; and he denies that anything had been delivered by him but what was altogether true and indubitable."
2. "In the first place, Peter indeed asserts that he had been an eyewitness; for he had himself seen with his own eyes the glory of Christ, of which he speaks. This knowledge he sets in opposition to crafty fables, such as cunning men are wont to fabricate to ensnare simple minds."
3. "We hence conclude, that they by no means serve Christ, nor are like the apostles, who presumptuously mount the pulpit to prattle of speculations unknown to themselves; for he alone is the lawful minister of Christ, who knows the truth of the doctrine which he delivers."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The phrase rendered â€˜fablesâ€™... is the term â€˜mythsâ€™ which is so familiar in the Classics."
2. "The â€˜mythsâ€™ are defined ... as â€˜cunningly devised,â€™ or cleverly elaborated."
3. "This term for â€˜eye-witnessâ€™ is peculiar to the present passage... [it] may carry with it here the idea of privileged spectators, or eye-witnesses of something which was hidden from others."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Not having followed." 
2. "The Gospel miracles were only allegories and not facts." 
3. "But having become eye-witnesses."

### John Gill:
1. "For we have not followed cunningly devised fables....but upon an evidence which they had received, both with their eyes and ears, and also on a word of prophecy surer than that."
2. "When we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ...and this will be with power; and it designs his more near coming to take vengeance on the Jewish nation, and deliver his people from the afflictions and persecution they laboured under, and which was with great power."
3. "But were eyewitnesses of his majesty; meaning...but of that glory and greatness which were upon him, when he was transfigured on the mount before them."

### John Wesley:
1. "These things are worthy to be always had in remembrance. For they are not cunningly devised fables - Like those common among the heathens." 
2. "While we made known to you the power and coming â€” That is, the powerful coming of Christ in glory." 
3. "But were eyewitnesses of his majesty â€” At his transfiguration, which was a specimen of his glory at the last day."
