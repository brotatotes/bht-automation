## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And this voice we (Apostles: Peter, James, and John) heard borne from heaven, being with Him in the holy mount."
2. "The epithet would naturally arise when the gospel history was known, as marking a place where a manifestation of this divine presence and glory had taken place."
3. "It is hardly necessary to refute Grotius’s idea, that Mount Sion is meant, and that the voice referred to is that related in Joh 12:28."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "we heard borne from heaven."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Voices which we ourselves heard come out of heaven." 
2. "The 'holy mount of God' (Ezekiel 28:14) would now receive another application."

### John Calvin:
1. "He calls it the holy mount, for the same reason that the ground was called holy where God appeared to Moses."
2. "For wherever the Lord comes, as he is the fountain of all holiness, he makes holy all things by the odor of his presence."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The character of the Divine testimony to Christ is thus yet more carefully described, in respect both of its own directness and of the credibility of the report which was given of it."
2. "By the ‘holy mount’ is to be understood not the temple-mount (as if the voice referred to were, as Grotius imagined, that recorded in John 12:28), but the Mount of Transfiguration."
3. "It is interesting to observe how in his old age Peter’s mind is filled with the wonders of the Transfiguration, and how he finds in the glory which he witnessed there a presage of the glory in which Christ was to return."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This voice (ταυτην την φωνην). The one referred to in verse 2 Peter 1:17."
2. "We heard (ηκουσαμεν). First aorist active indicative of ακουω, a definite experience of Peter."
3. "In the holy mount (εν τω αγιω ορε). Made holy by the majestic glory. See Ezekiel 28:14 for 'holy mount of God,' there Sinai, this one probably one of the lower slopes of Hermon. Peter's account is independent of the Synoptic narrative, but agrees with it in all essentials."

1. "And we — Peter, James, and John. St. John was still alive." 
2. "Being with him in the holy mount — Made so by that glorious manifestation, as mount Horeb was of old, Exodus 3:4,5."
