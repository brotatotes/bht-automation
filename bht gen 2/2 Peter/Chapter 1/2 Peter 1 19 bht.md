# 2 Peter 1:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the verse, we are encouraged to give earnest heed to the prophetic word. This word is described as a lamp or torch shining in a dark place, guiding us in the midst of darkness. The prophecies serve as a more secure confirmation of Christ's coming glory, surpassing even the miraculous Transfiguration. As we hold fast to the sure word of prophecy, it illuminates our path until the day dawns and the morning star, Jesus Christ, rises in all His glory.
