# 2 Peter 1:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The prophetic word, as contained in the Old Testament, is a firm and secure foundation for our faith. It gives us assurance of Christ's sufferings and glory, as witnessed by the apostles and confirmed through the Transfiguration. The prophecies serve as a lamp that illuminates and reveals unseen truths, guiding us on our journey through the darkness until the full light of the gospel dawns upon us. So let us heed the prophetic word as a light in the darkness, for it is a sure testimony of God's promises and the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
