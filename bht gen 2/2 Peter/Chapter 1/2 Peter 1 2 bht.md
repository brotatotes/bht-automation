# 2 Peter 1:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
True abundance of grace and peace comes from a genuine knowledge of God and His Son, Jesus our Lord. This knowledge goes beyond a mere recognition and delves into a profound understanding of who God is and the intimacy of a relationship with Him. By knowing Jesus, we come to know the Father and experience His paternal favor. It is through this knowledge that we find true happiness, sanctification, and reconciliation with God. As we strive to deepen our knowledge of God and Jesus, we open ourselves to the multiplication of grace and peace, allowing these blessings to transform every aspect of our lives.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "grace to you and peace be multiplied (...) in knowledge of God" 
2. "cognitio maturior: but this can hardly be given in English without too strong a phrase"
3. "Ἰης . τοῦ κυρ . ὑμῶν (...) should be noticed as a morsel of evidence to the independence of the Epistle"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Grace . . . peace— ( :-). through—Greek, 'in': the sphere IN which alone grace and peace can be multiplied."
2. "The Father is here meant by 'God,' but the Son in 2 Peter 1:1: marking how entirely one the Father and Son are."
3. "Still the prominent object of Peter's exhortation is 'the knowledge of Jesus our Lord' (a phrase only in Romans 4:24), and, only secondarily, of the Father through Him (2 Peter 1:8; 2 Peter 2:20; 2 Peter 3:18)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Grace and peace abound to us, or may be expected to be conferred on us abundantly, if we have a true knowledge of God and of the Saviour."
2. "Such a knowledge constitutes true religion: for in that we find 'grace' - the grace that pardons and sanctifies; and 'peace' - peace of conscience, reconciliation with God, and calmness in the trials of life."


### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The compound expressing full knowledge, and so common in Paul's writings."
2. "The word Lord in the second epistle is always used of God, unless Christ or Savior is added."

### John Calvin:
1. "By grace is designated God’s paternal favor towards us."
2. "We become happy and prosperous in all things through the knowledge of God."
3. "God cannot be rightly known except in Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "These blessings will abound in the readers only as the readers themselves abide and advance in Divine knowledge."
2. "It means more than simple acknowledgment. It denotes an intenser, more complete and intuitive knowledge than is expressed by the simple noun."
3. "This intimate ‘knowledge’ is also defined as the knowledge not only of God, but of Jesus our Lord; because, as Calvin suggests, it is only by knowing the latter that we can rightly know the former."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Full (additional, επ) knowledge as in 2 Peter 1:8 (only γνωσις in 2 Peter 1:5; 2 Peter 1:6; 2 Peter 3:18), but επιγνωσιν again in 2 Peter 1:3; 2 Peter 1:8; 2 Peter 2:20."
2. "As in Colossians, so here full knowledge is urged against the claims of the Gnostic heretics to special γνωσις."
3. "The text here is very uncertain. Bengel, Spitta, Zahn, Nestle accept the short reading of P and some Vulgate MSS. and some minuscles with only του κυριου ημων (our Lord) from which the three other readings may have come."

### John Gill:
1. "By a multiplication of grace may be meant a larger discovery of the love and favour of God."
2. "A multiplication of peace...may be designed an affluence of all kinds of prosperity, temporal and spiritual, external and internal."
3. "Grace may take in all these senses: an increase of internal graces...larger measures of the gifts of the Spirit...a clearer view and more enlarged knowledge of the Gospel."

### John Wesley:
1. Through the divine, experimental knowledge of God and of Christ.
