# 2 Peter 1:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
No scripture prophecy should be understood based on personal interpretation. It is not the result of human ingenuity, but rather, it is divinely inspired. The prophetic words spoken by the prophets were not their own opinions, but were given to them by the Holy Spirit. Thus, it is important to approach scripture with reverence and humility, seeking the guidance of the Holy Spirit for a true and accurate understanding.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "That no prophecy of Scripture comes of private interpretation...prophecy springs not out of human interpretation, i.e. is not a prognostication made by a man knowing what he means when he utters it: but &c."
2. "The saying regards, not our interpretation of prophecy, but its resolution, or interpretation, by the prophets themselves."
3. "The prophets spoke not of themselves, but as they were moved by the Holy Ghost."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "No prophecy is found to be the result of 'private interpretation,' and so origination."
2. "The words of the prophetical (and so of all) Scripture writers were not mere words of the individuals, and therefore to be interpreted by them, but of 'the Holy Ghost' by whom they were 'moved.'"
3. "In a secondary sense the text teaches also, as the word is the Holy Spirit's, it cannot be interpreted by its readers (any more than by its writers) by their mere private human powers, but by the teaching of the Holy Ghost."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Knowing this first - Bearing this steadily in mind as a primary and most important truth. That no prophecy of the Scripture...Is of any private interpretation."
2. "The more correct interpretation, as it seems to me, is that which supposes that the apostle teaches that the truths which the prophets communicated were not originated by themselves; were not of their own suggestion or invention; were not their own opinions, but were of higher origin, and were imparted by God."
3. "The fact that it discloses truths which the human mind could not of itself have originated, is a good reason for studying it with diligence and with prayer - not for supposing that it is unlawful for us to attempt to understand it; a good reason for reverence and veneration for it - not for sanctified neglect."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Is [γινεται] . More literally, arises or originates." 
2. "His own. Rev., special, in margin." 
3. "The usual word is eJrmhneia (1 Corinthians 12:10; 1 Corinthians 14:26). Literally, it means loosening, untying, as of hard knots of scripture."

### John Calvin:
1. "We ought not to rush on headlong and rashly when we read Scripture, confiding in our own understanding."
2. "Then Peter especially bids us to believe the prophecies as the indubitable oracles of God because they have not emanated from men's own private suggestions."
3. "Thou wilt never come well prepared to read it, except thou bringest reverence, obedience, and docility."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This verse seems to mean that prophecy does not originate in the prophet's own private interpretation of things, that it is not the mere expression of his own reading of the future."
2. "The fact that prophecy is something so different from man's own view of events or forecastings of the future is to be known 'first,' that is, it is to be recognized as a fact of primary importance."
3. "It is a reason why we should give that earnest heed to it which was enjoined in the previous verse."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "No prophecy of Scripture comes out of private disclosure, not of private interpretation."
2. "The usual meaning of επιλυσις is explanation, but the word does not occur elsewhere in the N.T."
3. "It is the prophet's grasp of the prophecy, not that of the readers that is here presented, as the next verse shows."

### John Gill:
1. "No prophecy of the Scripture, that is contained in Scripture, be it what it will, is of any private interpretation."
2. "Not that this is levelled against the right of private judgment of Scripture."
3. "No Scripture prophecy, nor [this prophecy] concerning the second coming of Christ; and this sense the following words require."

### John Wesley:
1. "No scripture prophecy is of private interpretation"
2. "It is not any man's own word."
3. "It is God, not the prophet himself, who thereby interprets things till then unknown."
