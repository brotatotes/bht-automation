# 2 Peter 1:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The prophecy in question did not come about from a human decision or agenda, but rather through the will of God. The individuals who spoke and wrote these prophecies were not acting on their own accord, but were instead directed and influenced by God himself. They were completely passive, allowing themselves to be moved by the divine power of the Holy Spirit.
