## BHT:
By His divine power, God has given us all things necessary for life and godliness, Peter writes. This gift of God's grace provides for our physical needs and the growth of our spiritual life. The gospel is unparalleled in its ability to transform hearts and change lives. We respond by recognizing our dependence on God and seeking to add to our faith virtue and knowledge. In doing so, we align ourselves with God's purpose, for He has called us to eternal glory through Christ and through the virtues of Christian character.
