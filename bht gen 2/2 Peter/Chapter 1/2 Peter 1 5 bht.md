# 2 Peter 1:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For this reason, we should give all diligence and put forth every effort in our pursuit of holiness. Just as God's divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness, we are exhorted to add virtue to our faith and knowledge to our virtue. This progression of virtues is not a passive endeavor but requires energy, boldness, and constant cultivation. By diligently adding one virtue to another and striving to grow in all aspects of our character, we can manifest the true essence of our faith and fulfill the will of the Lord.
