# 2 Peter 1:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christian temperance involves the self-control of all our desires and actions, abstaining from any pleasure that does not lead to God. It encompasses the governance of our thoughts and affections, as well as our actions. Intemperance, on the other hand, is abusing the world by focusing only on earthly desires, while true temperance seeks to use the gifts of creation to draw nearer to the Creator. In cultivating patience, it is essential to nurture godliness, maintaining a constant awareness of God's presence and trust in His providence, which helps us endure with humility and faith.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Temperance is now too much used of one sort only of self-restraint, fully to express the word."
2. "Let such discriminating knowledge not be without its fruit, of steady holding in hand of the passions and tempers."
3. "It is not to be mere brute Stoical endurance, but united with God-fearing and God-trusting."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In the exercise of Christian knowledge or discernment of God's will, let there be the practical fruit of self-control as to one's lusts and passions."
2. "Incontinence weakens the mind; continence, or self-control, moves weakness and imparts strength."
3. "It is not to be mere stoical endurance, but united to [and flowing from] God-trusting."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word here refers to the mastery over all our evil inclinations and appetites. We are to allow none of them to obtain control over us."
2. "Everything is to be confined within proper limits, and to no propensity of our nature are we to give indulgence beyond the limits which the law of God allows."
3. "And to temperance patience - Notes, James 1:4."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Temperance is self-control; holding the passions and desires in hand."
2. "Patience is the heroic, brave patience with which a Christian not only bears but contends."
3. "In the former word Peter contemplates Christian fellow-believers as naturally and properly holding the first place in our affections… But he follows this with the broader affection which should characterize Christians, and which Paul lauds in 1 Corinthians 13:0, the love of men as men."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Extravagance is the child of ignorance. A right estimate of oneself and mastery over oneself should be fostered by the knowledge which consists in the practical recognition of duty; and this latter should be helped by the former."
2. "The grace which is rendered ‘patience’ both in the A.V. and in the R.V. is of a stronger and more positive character than the familiar English term, and might be more fitly translated patient (or, persevering) endurance."
3. "Christian self-control is to be practised in and along with the spirit of patient endurance, which saves it from harshness and fitfulness, confirms it into constancy, and mellows it into tenderness and humility."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Temperance (την εγκρατειαν). Self-control. Old word...the opposite of the πλεονεξια of the heretics." 
2. "Patience (την υπομονην). For which see James 1:3."
3. "Godliness (την ευσεβειαν). For which see verse 2 Peter 1:3."

### John Gill:
1. "Avoiding all excess in eating and drinking, and all impure and unclean lusts; for it signifies nothing what a man knows, or professes to know, if his life is a scene of intemperance and debauchery."
2. "Moreover, this may include abstinence, not only from hurtful lusts, but from the use of things indifferent, when the peace and comfort of a weak brother are endangered; for then to knowledge must be added love.
3. "Under affliction from the hand of God, that there be no murmuring nor repining; and under reproaches and persecutions from men, that they faint not, and are not discouraged by them; and in the expectation of the heavenly glory."

### John Wesley:
1. "Christian temperance implies the voluntary abstaining from all pleasure which does not lead to God. It extends to all things inward and outward: the due government of every thought, as well as affection."
2. "Intemperance is to abuse the world. He that uses anything below, looking no higher, and getting no farther, is intemperate. He that uses the creature only so as to attain to more of the Creator, is alone temperate, and walks as Christ himself walked."
3. "And to patience godliness — Its proper support: a continual sense of God's presence and providence, and a filial fear of, and confidence in, him; otherwise your patience may be pride, surliness, stoicism; but not Christianity."
