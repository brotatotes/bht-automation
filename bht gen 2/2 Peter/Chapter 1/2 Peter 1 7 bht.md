# 2 Peter 1:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The importance of brotherly kindness cannot be overstated. Without it, our godliness would be nothing more than a facade, lacking in genuine love and care for our fellow believers. It serves as both an evidence of our regenerated hearts and a testament to the truth and power of our relationship with God. However, we must also remember that true godliness goes beyond mere brotherly kindness. It extends to a pure and perfect love for God and for all mankind, encompassing a universal kindness and generosity towards others.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Not suffering your godliness to be moroseness, nor a sullen solitary habit of life, but kind and generous and courteous."
2. "Universal kindness of thought, word, and act towards all: a catholic large-heartedness, not confining the spirit of φιλαδελφία to ἀδελφοί only."
3. "These two last correspond to the ἀγάπη εἰς ἀλλήλους καὶ εἰς πάντας of 1 Thessalonians 3:12."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And in your godliness brotherly kindness"; not suffering your godliness to be moroseness, nor a sullen solitary habit of life, but kind, generous, and courteous [ALFORD].
2. Your natural affection and brotherly kindness are to be sanctified by godliness. "And in your brotherly kindness love," namely, to all men, even to enemies, in thought, word, and deed. From brotherly kindness we are to go forward to love. Compare 1 Thessalonians 3:12, "Love one toward another (brotherly kindness), and toward all men (charity)." So charity completes the choir of graces in Colossians 3:14 [BENGEL].

### Albert Barnes:
1. "And to godliness brotherly kindness - Love to Christians as such."
2. "There is to be a special affection for Christians as of the same family; there is to be a true and warm love, however, for all the race."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In the former Epistle the grace of brotherly-love has a still more prominent place assigned to it...saving our regard for God and His claims from becoming an apology for neglecting His children and their interests."
2. "Our love, it is meant, strongly as it should beat within the Christian household, ought not to be confined to that, but should enlarge itself into a catholic interest in all men."
3. "Here Peter is engaged with the growth of the spiritual character, and therefore begins with faith in Christ as the foundation of all...It is enough to notice how these graces are made to blend into each other, each being in the other ‘like adjoining colours of the rainbow, mingled with it, and exhibited along with it’."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Love of the brethren (την φιλαδελφιαν). See 1 Peter 1:22."
2. "Love (την αγαπην). By deliberate choice (Matthew 5:44). Love for Christ as the crown of all (1 Peter 1:8) and so for all men."
3. "Love is the climax as Paul has it (1 Corinthians 13:13)."

### John Gill:
1. "Without [brotherly kindness], godliness, or external worship, or a profession of religion, is a vain show."
2. "Brotherly kindness is both the evidence of regeneration and of the truth and power of real godliness."
3. "Charity is more extensive in its objects and acts than brotherly kindness or love."

### John Wesley:
1. "Sour godliness, so called, is of the devil."
2. "Mild, sweet, serene, and tender is her mood, Nor grave with sternness, nor with lightness free."
3. "The pure and perfect love of God and of all mankind."
