# 2 Peter 1:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For if these things, such as faith, knowledge, self-control, perseverance, godliness, brotherly affection, and love, are in you and continue to increase, they will prevent you from being idle or unfruitful in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. By diligently cultivating these virtues, we not only advance in our understanding of the Lord, but also demonstrate our genuine knowledge of Him. May our lives be marked by an ever-increasing abundance of these graces, so that we may avoid being barren or unfruitful in our pursuit of Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For these things (the above-mentioned graces) being in you and multiplying render you not idle nor yet unfruitful towards the perfect knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ."
2. "These virtues are all regarded as so many steps in advancing towards the ·ºêœÄŒØŒ≥ŒΩœâœÉŒπœÇ of Christ, which is the great complex end of the Christian life."
3. "He only can declare Christ, who reflects Christ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Supposing these things to have an actual subsistence in you"
2. "Render, constitute you, habitually, by the very fact of possessing these graces"
3. "The full knowledge of Christ is the goal towards which all these graces tend"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If they are in you in rich abundance; if you are eminent for these things."
2. "Their efforts would be followed by such happy results as to be an encouragement to exertion."
3. "On no other efforts does God smile more propitiously than on the attempt to secure the salvation of the soul and to do good."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In the sense of being the verb is stronger than the simple einai, to be; denoting being which is from the beginning, and therefore attaching to a person as a proper characteristic; something belonging to him, and so running into the idea of rightful possession as above." 
2. "Hence, more correctly, as Rev., idle. Compare 'idle word' (Matthew 12:36); 'standing idle' (Matthew 20:3, Matthew 20:6); also, 1 Timothy 5:13. The tautology, barren and unfruitful, is thus avoided."
3. "The idea is not idleness in the knowledge, but idleness is pressing on and developing toward and finally reaching the knowledge. With this agrees the compound ejpignwsin, the constantly increasing and finally full knowledge."

### John Calvin:
1. "For if these things be in you...you will at length prove that Christ is really known by you..." 
2. "...he shews that all those glory, in vain and falsely, that they have the knowledge of Christ, who boast of it without love, patience, and the like gifts..." 
3. "But he would not have the faithful to be only taught patience, godliness, temperance, love; but he requires a continual progress to be made as to these endowments..."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The suggestive courtesy of the statement appears also in the phrase which the A. V. renders ‚Äòbe in you,‚Äô and the R. V. ‚Äòare yours,‚Äô but which means rather ‚Äòsubsisting for you.‚Äô"
2. "What is taken for granted, therefore, is not that these graces are in these believers in profusion, or in larger measure than in others, but that, being in them, they are steadily growing and expanding, and exhibiting all the evidence of vitality."
3. "The sevenfold symmetry of the spiritual character, and the furnishing forth of all these varied graces, are recommended not as ends to themselves, but as means toward the higher end of an ever enlarging, and at last perfect, knowledge of Christ Himself."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For if these things are yours and abound, they make you to be not idle nor unfruitful." 
2. "Knowledge. 'Full (additional) knowledge' as in 2 Peter 1:2."

### John Gill:
1. "For if these things be in you,.... Are wrought in you by the Spirit of God, and exercised and performed by his assistance, who works in his people both to will and do:and abound; increase in their acts and exercises by the frequent performance of them"
2. "they make you; both by way of influence and evidence,[that ye shall] neither [be] barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ."
3. "There is a knowledge of Christ which is barren and fruitless; and those that have it are so in their conversations, and it will be of no avail to them another day"

### John Wesley:
1. "Added to your faith. And abounding - Increasing more and more, otherwise we fall short."
2. "Make you neither slothful nor unfruitful - Do not suffer you to be faint in your mind, or without fruit in your lives."
3. "If there is less faithfulness, less care and watchfulness, since we were pardoned, than there was before, and less diligence, less outward obedience, than when we were seeking remission of sin, we are both slothful and unfruitful in the knowledge of Christ, that is, in the faith, which then cannot work by love."
