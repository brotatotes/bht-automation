# 2 Peter 1:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who lack the necessary graces such as faith, knowledge, and the purification of sins, are spiritually blind. They are unable to see beyond the present earthly things and are near-sighted when it comes to understanding the true nature of the gospel. They have forgotten the significance of their past sins being cleansed and fail to recognize their need for continual sanctification. Without these graces, they are deprived of the clear vision of God's love and are unable to perceive the spiritual blessings that await them.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The advantage of the presence is great, for the disadvantage of the absence indicates no less than spiritual blindness and oblivion."
2. "He to whom these are not present is blind, short-sighted, having incurred forgetfulness of the purification of his former sins."
3. "The purification of his former sins refers to the fact of his ancient, pre-Christian, sins having been purged away in his baptism."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Confirming the need of these graces by the fatal consequences of the want of them."
2. "He closes his eyes as unable to see distant objects, and fixes his gaze on present and earthly things which alone he can see."
3. "The continually present sense of one's sins having been once for all forgiven is the strongest stimulus to every grace."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "But he that lacketh these things is blind - He has no clear views of the nature and the requirements of religion."
2. "And cannot see afar off - The word used here... means to shut the eyes... to be 'near-sighted.' The meaning here is, that he is like one who has an indistinct vision... He sees but a little way into the true nature and design of the gospel."
3. "And hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins - He does not remember the obligation which grows out of the fact that a system has been devised to purify the heart... If he had any just view of that, he would see that he was under obligation to make as high attainments as possible, and to cultivate to the utmost extent the Christian graces."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He denotes them now as merely present with him...seeing only things present and not heavenly things." 
2. "A unique expression, the noun occurring only here in the New Testament...having taken forgetfulness." 
3. "Some expositors find in the expression a suggestion of a voluntary acceptance of a darkened condition."

### John Calvin:
1. "They... go astray like the blind in darkness, because they do not see the right way which is shewn to us by the light of the gospel."
2. "Those who do not strive for a pure and holy life do not understand even the first rudiments of faith."
3. "Though, then, we daily sin, and God daily forgives us, and the blood of Christ cleanses us from our sins, yet sin ought not to rule in us, but the sanctification of the Spirit ought to prevail in us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "These graces are to be cultivated; for, if we have them not, we become blind and 'sink back into a want of power to perceive even the elementary truths of the kingdom of God'." 
2. "He is 'blind,' not seeing when he thinks he sees, not seeing certain things as he ought to see them. And he is this not in the sense of being 'blind' to all things, but in the sense of being 'nearsighted,' seeing things in false magnitudes, having an eye for things present and at hand, but none for the distant realities of the eternal world."
3. "So here the 'sins of old' are said to have been purified in the sense of having had the uncleanness belonging to them cleansed away, or their guilt removed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Seeing only what is near." 
2. "Having forgotten." 
3. "The cleansing."

### John Gill:
1. "He that lacketh these things...is blind: let him boast ever so much of his light and knowledge...for he has no true knowledge of God, as in Christ...nor does he know what it is to have communion with him in Christ..."
2. "...he cannot see afar off: at least, not the good land that is afar off, the kingdom of heaven...he sees not that he is poor, and wretched, and miserable, but fancies himself to be rich, and in need of nothing."
3. "...he hath forgotten the purification of his old, or former sins...he does not think that he stands in any need of being purged from former sins; and is entirely unmindful of, and neglects, the purification of them by the blood of Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "He cannot see God, or his pardoning love. He has lost the evidence of things not seen."
2. "He has lost sight of the precious promises: perfect love and heaven are equally out of his sight."
3. "He cannot now see what himself once enjoyed. Having, as it were, forgot the purification from his former sins - Scarce knowing what he himself then felt, when his sins were forgiven."
