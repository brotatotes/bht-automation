# 2 Peter 2:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
False prophets can include those who speak the truth without being sent by God as well as those who were truly sent by Him but corrupted their message. Their actions lead to destructive heresies and divisions which ultimately result in their own destruction. These false teachers deny the Lord who purchased them, but even in their own demise, Christ's redemptive work encompasses them.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There were false prophets also among the people, as there shall be among you also, false teachers, the which shall introduce heresies of destruction, and denying the master who bought them." 
2. "The expression is not to be resolved as E.V. (after Beza, as usual) by an adjective, 'damnable heresies,' as it thereby loses its meaning, merely conveying the writer's own [judgment of] condemnation."
3. "The construction is not very plain. Of the two participial clauses, ... 'denying,' and 'bringing upon themselves,' one must be taken as equivalent to a finite verb, corresponding to 'shall introduce' above."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "false teachers—teachers of falsehood."
2. "such a 'false prophet' was Balaam."
3. "bringing in error by the side of the true doctrine."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The authors of these sects, holding the views which they did, and influenced by the motives which they would be, and practicing the morals which they would practice, would bring upon themselves swift and certain destruction."
2. "It was such a denial of the Lord 'as having bought them,' as to be in fact a renunciation of the uniqueness of the Christian religion."
3. "Any doctrine which represented him, his person, or his work, as essentially different from what was the truth, would amount to such a denial."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "False teachers...privily shall bring in...damnable heresies." 
2. "Denying the Lord."
3. "Swift."

### John Calvin:
1. "Not different [from the ancient Church] will be the condition of the Church under the gospel, from what it was formerly under the law; false prophets disturbed the ancient Church; the same thing must also be expected by us."
2. "Let us then remember that the Spirit of God hath once for all declared, that the Church shall never be free from this intestine evil; and let this likeness be always borne in mind, that the trial of our faith is to be similar to that of the fathers."
3. "The advice, indeed, is general, that we ought to beware of false teachers; but, at the same time, he selected one kind of such from whom the greater danger arose."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The ‘but’ introduces a contrast with what was stated at the close of the previous chapter. There were prophets in Israel who ‘spake from God,’ but there arose in the same Israel false prophets, and so it shall be in the N. T. Israel." 
2. "Christ Himself foretells the rise of ‘false prophets’ (Matthew 24:24), and Paul warned the elders of Ephesus of men who should arise within the Church ‘speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them’ (Acts 20:30)." 
3. "In bringing in these heresies of destruction the false teachers will be even denying the Lord, and their doing so will mean that they have brought doom upon themselves."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "False prophets also, in contrast with the true prophets just pictured" 
2. "Shall privily bring in, as if secretly" 
3. "Denying, present middle participle"

1. "These are 'damnable', or 'destructive', or 'heresies of destruction'; which lead to eternal destruction both those that introduce and propagate them, and those that embrace and profess them."
2. "The manner in which these are usually introduced is 'privily'; at unawares, secretly, under a disguise, and gradually, by little and little, and not at once, and openly."
3. "And even denying the Lord that bought them; not the Lord Jesus Christ, but God the Father; for the word δεσποτης is expressive of the power which masters have over their servants, and which God has over all mankind." (136 words)

### John Wesley:
1. "Those that spake even the truth, when God had not sent them; and also those that were truly sent of him, and yet corrupted or softened their message, were false prophets."
2. "They first, by denying the Lord, introduced destructive heresies, that is, divisions; or they occasioned first these divisions, and then were given up to a reprobate mind, even to deny the Lord that bought them."
3. "Yet these very men perish everlastingly. Therefore Christ bought even them that perish."
