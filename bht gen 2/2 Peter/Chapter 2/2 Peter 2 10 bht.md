## BHT:
Those who walk after the flesh, indulging in the lust of uncleanness, and who despise government and those in positions of authority, particularly dishonor the natural order established by God. They disregard the authority that has been put in place and show no respect or reverence for those in positions of power. Instead of being subject to the governance provided, they rebel against it, causing disharmony and chaos.
