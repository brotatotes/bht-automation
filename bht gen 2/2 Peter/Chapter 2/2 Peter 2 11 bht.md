# 2 Peter 2:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When angels present themselves before the Lord, as seen in Job 1:6 and Job 2:1, they do not bring a railing judgment against others. This is a demonstration of their reverence and respect for God. Just as angels, who are far greater in strength and might than human beings, do not speak evil accusations against others, we should also refrain from speaking slanderously or disrespectfully. Let us take this as a reminder to guard our speech and treat others with kindness and dignity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Angels, being greater in strength and might, bring not against them before the Lord a railing judgment."
2. "The thought is not a lame one, but shows forcibly the unbecomingness of their irreverence, seeing that even angels who are so far above them yet do not bring railing accusations against doxes."
3. "In the interpretation, bad angels, fallen from their heavenly estate, but regarded here according to their essential condition as sons of glory."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Judgment belongs to God, not the angels. How great is the dignity of the saints who, as Christ's assessors, shall hereafter judge angels!"
2. "If superior angels dare not, as being in the presence of God, the Judge, speak evil even of the bad angels, how awful the presumption of those who speak evil blasphemously of good 'dignities.'"
3. "The angels who sinned still retain the indelible impress of majesty. Satan is still 'a strong man': 'prince of this world'; and under him are 'principalities, powers, rulers of the darkness of this world.' We are to avoid irreverence in regard to them, not on their account, but on account of God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is not known precisely to what Peter alludes here, nor on what the statement here is based."
2. "Whatever may have been the origin of this tradition, no one can doubt that what is here said of the angels accords with probability, and no one can prove that it is not true."
3. "They abhor all scurrility and violence of language; they simply state matters as they are."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Power and might [ισχυι και δυναμει] . Rev., might and power. The radical idea of ijscuv, might, is that of indwelling strength, especially as embodied."
2. "Thus, 'Love the Lord thy God with all thy strength' (Mark 12:30): 'according to the working of his mighty power' (Ephesians 1:19)."
3. "Generally, then, it may be said that while both words include the idea of manifestation or of power in action, ijscuv emphasizes the outward, physical manifestations, and dunamiv the inward, spiritual or moral virtue."

### John Calvin:
1. "He hence shews their rash arrogance, because they dared to assume more liberty than even angels."
2. "For all the magistrates were then ungodly, and bloody enemies to the gospel. They must, therefore, have been hateful to angels, the guardians of the Church."
3. "While such moderation, he says, is shewn by angels, these men fearlessly give vent to impious and unbridled blasphemies."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The most reasonable explanation, however, seems to be that even angels, who so far excel men, do not presume themselves to speak in terms of railing judgment against even offenders like these 'darers.'"
2. "The reckless, impious audacity of the latter is thus presented in the darkest possible colours by being set over against the reverent regard for authority which in all circumstances characterizes the former."
3. "From the Rabbinical writings and the Apocryphal books we can gather how large a mass of popular and traditional lore grew up from an early period around many points of Old Testament doctrine."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Though greater (μειζονες οντες). Than the evil δοξα. Concessive participle and comparative adjective." 
2. "In might and strength (ισχυ κα δυναμε). Locative case. Both indwelling strength (ισχυς, Mark 12:30) and ability (δυναμις, Matthew 25:15)."
3. "Railing judgment (βλασφεμον κρισιν). 'Blasphemous accusation.' Against them (κατ' αυτων). The evil angels (δοξα)."

### John Gill:
1. "Which is not to be understood of evil angels, or devils...but of good angels, who excel in strength..." 
2. "and yet these bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord..."
3. "since angels, who are so much above men, even above the most dignified among them, behave in this manner, it must be an aggravation of the sin of these persons, who are so much below them, to speak evil of them."

### John Wesley:
1. Whereas angels — When they appear before the Lord, Job 1:6; Job 2:1, to give an account of what they have seen and done on the earth.
