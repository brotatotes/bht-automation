# 2 Peter 2:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These individuals, devoid of reason and understanding, are likened to irrational animals, destined for capture and destruction. They shamelessly speak evil about matters they know nothing about. They are like wild animals consumed by their destructive passions and destined for ruin. Their wickedness ensnares them, just as fierce animals fall prey to their own destructive nature.
