# 2 Peter 2:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who are described as having eyes full of adultery are always carrying around the image of an adulterous woman, unable to look at anything without lustful thoughts. This violation of the seventh commandment extends beyond physical actions and words, encompassing even unchaste looks. Their continual gaze at a lewd and infamous woman reveals their incessant lust for her. By enticing unstable souls through their wanton looks and carnal desires, these individuals lead others into the sin of adultery.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "having eyes full of an adulteress...and that cannot be made to cease from sin" 
2. "laying baits for unstable souls"
3. "having a heart practised in covetousness"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Full of an adulteress," as though they carried about adulteresses always dwelling in their eyes: the eye being the avenue of lust.
2. "That cannot be made to cease from sin."
3. "Laying baits for."
4. "Not firmly established in faith and piety."
5. "Not only the eyes, which are the channel, but the heart, the fountainhead of lust."
6. "Cursing and covetousness, as in Balaam's case, often go together: the curse he designed for Israel fell on Israel's foes and on himself. True believers bless, and curse not, and so are blessed."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The eye was, as it were, full of this passion; it saw nothing else but some occasion for its indulgence; it expressed nothing else but the desire."
2. "The wanton glance is a principal occasion of exciting the sin; and there is much often in dress, and mien, and gesture, to charm the eye and to deepen the debasing passion."
3. "The expression here does not mean that they have no natural ability to cease from sin, or that they are impelled to it by any physical necessity, but only that they are so corrupt and unprincipled that they certainly will sin always."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Eyes. Another illustration of Peter's emphasis on sight. It is the instrument of evil no less than of good." 
2. "An heart they have exercised [καρδιαν γεγυμνασμενην εχοντες] . The A. V. is awkward. Better, Rev., having a heart exercised. Exercised is the word used for gymnastic training, from which gymnastic is derived." 
3. "Cursed children [καταρας τεκνα] . Lit., children of cursing; and so Rev. See on Mark 3:17, and 1 Peter 1:14."

### John Calvin:
1. "He reminds the faithful to beware of their hidden and deceitful arts; for he compares their impostures to hooks which may catch the unwary to their destruction."
2. "Let there be then a stability of faith, and we shall be safe from the artifices of the ungodly."
3. "By calling them cursed or execrable children, he may be understood to mean, that they were so either actively or passively, that is, that they brought a curse with them wherever they went, or that they deserved a curse."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "having eyes full of an adulteress. The phrase ‘full of’ also means, at least occasionally in the Classics, ‘engrossed by.’ Thus the sense may be either  having eyes for nothing else but an adulteress,  or  revealing in their very eyes the adulterous object of their desire."
2. "enticing unstable souls. The verb occurs again in 2 Peter 2:18 and in James 1:14, and is a more picturesque term than the ‘beguiling’ of the A. V. It means to allure by holding out a bait to one."
3. "Three great vices, therefore, which go naturally together, being only so many types of the same selfishness, viz. luxuriousness, sensuality, avarice, are ascribed to them here."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Vivid picture of a man who cannot see a woman without lascivious thoughts toward her."
2. "Insatiable lust."
3. "Rhetorical metaphor from the gymnasium."

### John Gill:
1. "Having eyes full of adultery.... For the seventh command is not only violated by unclean actions, and obscene words, but also by unchaste looks."
2. "Having a lewd and infamous woman always in mind and sight, continually looking at her and lusting after her."
3. "Their eyes and their hearts were only, and always, for their lust... and by their wanton looks and carnal lusts, they allured them into the sin of adultery."
