# 2 Peter 2:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They have forsaken the right way and are following the way of Balaam, who loved the wages of unrighteousness. Balaam's actions were influenced by his love of gain and he was willing to use his position as a prophet for selfish purposes. Like him, those who have strayed from the right path are driven by covetousness and desire the rewards of unrighteousness. Their teachings and actions are detrimental, spreading the poison of impiety and seeking to lead others astray.
