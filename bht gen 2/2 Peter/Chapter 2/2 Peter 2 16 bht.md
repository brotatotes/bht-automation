# 2 Peter 2:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God used Balaam's own animal to convict him of his own wrongdoing. The rebuke from the creature he rode was a powerful reminder of his iniquity. The miraculous incident of the ass speaking highlighted the divine intervention in the situation. It was not just the words of the animal, but the incredible fact that it spoke at all, that stood as a clear hindrance to Balaam's disobedience. The rebuke from the animal and the angel served as a condemnation of Balaam's obstinacy and disregard for God's command.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "[The rebuke] came from an animal which was part of his own substance: he himself furnished the conviction of his own iniquity, from the animal on which he rode."
2. "The participial clause brings into notice the miraculous character of the incident."
3. "The Apostle evidently regards not so much the words of rebuke uttered, as the miraculous fact, as being the hindrance."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "his own beast convicted him of his own iniquity."
2. "It was not the words of the ass (for it merely deprecated his beating it), but the miraculous fact of its speaking at all, which withstood Balaam's perversity in desiring to go after God had forbidden him in the first instance."
3. "Thus indirectly the ass, and directly the angel, rebuked his worse than asinine obstinacy; the ass turned aside at the sight of the angel, but Balaam, after God had plainly said, Thou shalt not go, persevered in wishing to go for gain; thus the ass, in act, forbade his madness."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If God employed means so extraordinary to rebuke 'his' depravity, it was to be expected that in some appropriate way he would express his sense of the wickedness of those who resembled him."
2. "The very animal upon which he rode, mute and naturally stupid, was made to utter a reproof; a reproof as directly from heaven as though the stones had cried out beneath his feet, or the trees of the wood had uttered the language of remonstrance."
3. "He was so mad or infatuated that he allowed neither reason, nor conscience, nor the will of God, to control him!"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The verb denotes the utterance of a sound or voice, not only by man, but by any animal having lungs."
2. "Schmidt (" Synonymik ") says that it does not indicate any physical capability on the part of the man, but describes the sound only from the hearer's stand - point."
3. "In view of this general sense of the verb, the propriety is apparent of the defining phrase, with man's voice."

### John Calvin:
1. "The gift of prophecy was so special, that though he did not worship the true God, and had not true religion, he might yet have been endued with it."
2. "God has sometimes caused prophecy to exist in the midst of idolatry, in order that men might have less excuse."
3. "They ridicule all religion under the cloak of wit; and when addicted, like beasts, to their own lusts, they will mingle with the faithful; they prattle something about the gospel, and yet they prostitute their tongue to the service of the devil, that they may bring the whole world, as far as they can, to eternal perdition."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The phrase means literally, 'but he had a rebuke for his transgression.'"
2. "The ass is designated here... by a general term which means simply a 'beast that bears the yoke,' or a 'beast of burden.'"
3. "The difficult questions about the credibility and interpretation of the story of Balaam belong, however, to the criticism and exegesis of the Old Testament."
