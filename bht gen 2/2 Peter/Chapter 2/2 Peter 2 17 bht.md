# 2 Peter 2:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These religious teachers are compared to fountains without water that disappoint travelers in the desert, as well as to misty clouds driven by whirlwinds that offer hope but deliver darkness instead. Their empty and deceitful words may appear impressive, but they lack substance and fail to fulfill their promises. Ultimately, their destiny is one of eternal darkness, symbolizing the certainty and hopelessness of their fate.
