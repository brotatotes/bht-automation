# 2 Peter 2:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They speak with great arrogance and falsehood, using extravagant words to deceive and lead astray. Their words lack substance, but they allure others through their promiscuous and indulgent behavior. These individuals have escaped from the path of error, but are still vulnerable to being tempted back into sin. The allure of their enticing words and sinful ways can easily ensnare those who are not firmly rooted in the truth.

### Marvin Vincent:
