# 2 Peter 2:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The false teachers, in their deceptive ways, would entice the people with promises of liberty, freeing them from the restraints and rules they viewed as unnecessary. However, what they failed to acknowledge was their own enslavement to corruption and sin. While they boasted of liberation, they themselves remained bound by the very vices they claimed to be free from. Their empty promises revealed the hypocrisy of their teachings, leaving those who followed them in a state of bondage rather than true freedom.
