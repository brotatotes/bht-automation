# 2 Peter 2:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is important to recognize that false doctrine and immoral conduct tend to go hand in hand. Oftentimes, those who deny essential truths of the gospel are licentious in their own behavior. This connection between false belief and immoral living is not a coincidence, but rather a result of seeking to obtain religious sanction for corrupt practices. Sadly, such individuals can lead many astray, causing the way of truth to be spoken of in a negative light. Ultimately, their actions bring harm to the reputation of Christ and his teachings among those who are not followers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The connexion of depraved moral conduct with erroneous doctrine was almost universal."
2. "It is those who, seeming to be in the way of truth, yet favour and follow false teachers."
3. "Ab iis qui foris sunt, discrimen ignorantibus verorum et falsorum Christianorum."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "False doctrine and immoral practice generally go together."
2. "The way of truth shall be evil spoken of."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is a very remarkable circumstance, that those who have denied the essential doctrines of the gospel have been so frequently licentious in their own conduct, and have inculcated opinions which tended to licentiousness."
2. "Many of the forms of religious error have somehow had a connection with this vice."
3. "People who are corrupt at heart often seek to obtain the sanction of religion for their corruptions."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Shall follow. See on ch. 2 Peter 1:16. Pernicious ways [απωλειαις] . The true reading is ajselgeiaiv, lascivious doings. So Rev. See on 1 Peter 4:3. The use of the plural is rare. Compare Jude 1:4.

### John Calvin:
1. "It is, indeed, no slight offense to the weak, when they see that false doctrines are received by the common consent of the world, that a large number of men are led astray, so that few continue in true obedience to Christ."
2. "Almost all turn aside into corruptions, and being deluded by the teachers of licentiousness, they become profane."
3. "So when the reins are let loose, and every kind of licentiousness is practiced, the name and the doctrine of Christ are exposed to the reproaches of the ungodly."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The immoral life is represented as the natural result of false belief." 
2. "Christianity is designated 'the way of the truth' as being a mode of life which results from, or bears the qualities of, the truth."
3. "Greatest injury is done to the cause of Christ among those outside by men who, while 'seeming to be in the way of truth, yet favor and follow false teachers.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Lascivious doings (ασελγειαις). Associative instrumental ease after εξακολουθησουσιν (future active, for which verb see 2 Peter 1:16)."
2. "Αυτων (their) refers to ψευδοδιδασκαλο (false teachers) while πολλο to their deluded followers. See Romans 2:23 for a picture of such conduct by Jews (quotation from Isaiah 52:5, with βλασφημεω used as here with δι' υμας, because of you)."
3. "The way of truth (η οδος της αληθειας). Hοδος (way) occurs often in N.T. for Christianity (Acts 9:2; Acts 16:17; Acts 18:25; Acts 22:4; Acts 24:14). This phrase is in Genesis 24:48 as 'the right road,' and that is what Peter means here. So Psalms 119:30. See again 2 Peter 2:15; 2 Peter 2:21."

### John Gill:
1. "The road both of error and wickedness is a broad one, in which many walk; and a multitude is no proof of the truth of a church or of the principles of men, nor to be followed." 
2. "By reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of; that is, either Christ, who is truth itself, and the true way to eternal life and happiness; or the Gospel, the word of truth, which holds forth Christ the truth, and points to him, and every other truth, and nothing but truth."
3. "They should be the occasion, by their impure lives, of the name of Christ, and his doctrines, being blasphemed by profane and irreligious men."

### John Wesley:
1. The way of truth will be evil spoken of — By those who blend all false and true Christians together.
