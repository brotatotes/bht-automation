# 2 Peter 2:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
People who have initially turned away from the corrupt practices of the world and come to know Christ, but are subsequently drawn back into those same pollutions and unable to overcome them, are in a worse state than they were before. This relapse is more insidious and deserving of a greater judgment, as they have rejected the knowledge of Christ and fallen back into the very sins they sought to escape.
