# 2 Peter 2:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If only they had not turned their backs on the holy commandment that was once delivered to them, for that commandment contained the entire law of God, both spoken and written, revealing His perfect will. But alas, they chose to forsake the way of righteousness, having known the truth, and returned to their own pollutions and the profligacy of the world. How much better it would have been for them to remain ignorant of the truth, for their knowledge of the Lord and Savior only emphasizes the condemnation they now face.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For it were (that use of the imperfect without ἄν, answering to the Latin 'faciebam, ni:') better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than, having known it, to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them."


### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "the way of righteousness—the way of truth" (2 Peter 2:2).
2. "the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour."
3. "turn—back again."
4. "from the holy commandment—the Gospel which enjoins holiness."
5. "Holy, not that it makes holy, but because it ought to be kept inviolate."
6. "delivered—once for all; admitting no turning back."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It would have been better for them, for: (1)Then they would not have dishonored the cause of religion as they have now done;"
2. "They would not have sunk so deep in profligacy as they now have; and,"
3. "They would not have incurred so aggravated a condemnation in the world of woe."

### John Calvin:
1. "By saying that having forsaken the commandment delivered unto them, they returned to their own pollutions, he intimates first, how inexcusable they were."
2. "But he declares that they who make themselves slaves again to the pollutions of the world fall away from the gospel."
3. "The faithful also do indeed sin; but as they allow not dominion to sin, they do not fall away from the grace of God, nor do they renounce the profession of sound doctrine which they have once embraced."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The ‘better’ here, as in 1 Peter 3:17 (see note there), means  more to their advantage."
2. "The ‘way of righteousness’ is not quite the same as ‘the Gospel’ or ‘the way of salvation.’ It is a term for Christianity specifically on its ethical side, as a new moral life."
3. "The ‘holy commandment’ is not to be limited either to the commandment known as the ‘new commandment’ (John 13:34), or to the Sermon on the Mount. It is the ethical requirement of the Gospel as a whole, the law of life which Christ has left."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It were better (κρειττον ην). Apodosis of a condition of second class without αν..."
2. "Not to have known (μη επεγνωκενα). Perfect active infinitive of επιγινωσκω (cf. επιγνωσε, verse 2 Peter 2:20) to know fully."
3. "II Peter strikes a high ethical note (2 Peter 1:5)."

### John Gill:
1. "It would have been a lesser evil, and not so much aggravated, not to have known the way of righteousness." 
2. "A large, notional, though not an experimental knowledge, these apostates had of the word and doctrine of righteousness, and indeed of the whole of the Christian religion, which may truly go by this name."
3. "Wherefore, it would have been better for them to have been in their former ignorance, either in Judaism, or in Gentilism, since proportionate to a man's light is his guilt, and so his punishment."

### John Wesley:
1. The commandment — The whole law of God, once not only delivered to their ears, but written in their hearts.
