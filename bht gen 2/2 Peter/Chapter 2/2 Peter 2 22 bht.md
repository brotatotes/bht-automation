# 2 Peter 2:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The dog and the sow serve as symbols for the nature of sin and the irreclaimable state of those who have turned away from God's grace. Just as a dog returns to its vomit and a sow to the mire, apostates revert to their former ways. This reminds us that without the transformative power of God's grace, we are all like dogs and sows before the sight of God.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Under all the appearances of reformation, still their evil nature remained, as really as that of the dog or the swine, and that nature finally prevailed."
2. "The passage would seem to imply, that whatever pains should be taken to change the habits of the dog, he would return to them again."
3. "No matter how clean the swine is made by washing, this would not prevent it, in the slightest degree, from rolling in filth again."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "The gospel is a medicine which purges us by wholesome vomiting, but there are many dogs who swallow again what they have vomited to their own ruin."
2. "The gospel is also a laver which cleanses all our uncleanness, but there are many swine who, immediately after washing, roll themselves again in the mud."
3. "The godly are reminded to take heed to themselves, except they wish to be deemed dogs or swine."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The ‘but’ which the A. V. introduces is not sufficiently supported."
2. "The repute of the dog and the sow, not only in Judea but generally throughout the East, is well known. The former, as an unclean animal and the scavenger of Oriental towns, became a term of reproach, a name for one’s enemies, a figure of the profane or impure."
3. "If these verses are pressed, as is often the case, into the controversy on the nature of grace as indefectible or otherwise, the two proverbs would certainly favour the Calvinistic view rather than the Arminian. For their point is, that the nature of the creatures was not changed, but that each, after a temporary separation, returned to the impurity which was according to its nature."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The first proverb here given comes from Proverbs 26:11. Εξεραμα is a late and rare word (here only in N.T., in Diosc. and Eustath.) from εξεραω, to vomit." 
2. "This second proverb does not occur in the O.T., probably from a Gentile source because about the habit of hogs."

### John Gill:
1. "Which expresses the filthy nature of sin, signified by vomit, mire, and dirt, than which nothing is more abominable and defiling."
2. "Likewise their irreclaimable and irrecoverable state and condition, it being impossible they should be otherwise, unless their natures were changed and altered."
3. "So such apostates return to what they were before, to their former principles and practices."

### John Wesley:
1. The dog, the sow — Such are all men in the sight of God before they receive his grace, and after they have made shipwreck of the faith. Proverbs 26:11.
