# 2 Peter 2:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The fallen angels, despite their former rank and holiness, were not spared the punishment they deserved. God's justice and severity are demonstrated in how He directly and justly punished them for their sins. These angels were thrown out of heaven, descending to inferior places like lightning, experiencing the depths of misery. They were kept in custody, like condemned criminals, chained in a dark dungeon until the judgment of the great day. However, even in their captivity, they continue to seek opportunities to cause harm.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "if God spared not angels having sinned...for their sin"
2. "casting them into hell...delivered them over to dens of darkness"
3. "in custody unto judgment"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If God in past time has punished the ungodly and saved His people, He will be sure to do so also in our days." 
2. "Angels‚Äîthe highest of intelligent creatures, yet not spared when they sinned." 
3. "They are 'reserved' unto hell's 'mist of darkness' as their final 'judgment' or doom, and meanwhile their exclusion from the light of heaven is begun."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Neither their former rank, their dignity, nor their holiness, saved them from being thrust down to hell; and if God punished them so severely, then false teachers could not hope to escape."
2. "The word here used occurs nowhere else in the New Testament, though it is common in the Classical writers. It is a verb formed from Œ§Œ±ÃÅœÅœÑŒ±œÅŒøœÇ Tartaros, Tartarus, which in Greek mythology was the lower part, or abyss of Hades, ŒëÃîÃÅÕÖŒ¥Œ∑œÇ HadeÃÑs, where the shades of the wicked were supposed to be imprisoned and tormented, and corresponded to the Jewish word ŒìŒµŒµÃÅŒΩŒΩŒ± Geenna - 'Gehenna.'"
3. "The meaning seems to be, that they are confined in that dark prisonhouse as if by chains. We are not to suppose that spirits are literally bound; but it was common to bind or fetter prisoners who were in dungeons, and the representation here is taken from that fact."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "It is strange to find Peter using this Pagan term, which represents the Greek hell, though treated here not as equivalent to Gehenna, but as the place of detention until the judgment."
2. "Sirov originally is a place for storing corn. Rev., pits of darkness."
3. "So Milton: 'Here their prison ordained In utter darkness, and their portion set As far removed from God and light of heaven As from the center thrice to the utmost pole.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "We must always bear in mind that there is a difference between God and men; for men indeed judge unequally, but God keeps the same course in judging."
2. "The argument is from the greater to the less; for they [the angels] were far more excellent than we are, and yet their dignity did not preserve them from the hand of God; much less then can mortal men escape, when they follow them in their impiety."
3. "Chains of darkness. This metaphor intimates that they are held bound in darkness until the last day. And the comparison is taken from malefactors, who, after having been condemned, suffer half of their punishment by the severity of the prison, until they are drawn forth to their final doom."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is not merely that those of the angels who did sin were not spared, but that even the class of angels as such were not spared when sin entered among them."
2. "Having cast them down into hell (bound) with chains of darkness, committed them as in reserve unto judgment."
3. "Here, as the immediately following words indicate, Peter has in view neither hades, the world of the departed generally, nor Gehenna, hell in the sense of the place of final judgment, but the intermediate scene or state of penalty."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "First instance of certain doom, that of the fallen angels." 
2. "The dark and doleful abode of the wicked dead like the Gehenna of the Jews."
3. "Kept for judgment."

### John Gill:
1. "He did not forgive their sin, nor provide a Saviour for them; but directly, and at once, notwithstanding the dignity and excellency of their nature, in strict justice, and awful severity, without any mercy, inflicted due punishment on them."
2. "They were hurled out of heaven, from whence they fell as lightning, into the 'lowest', or inferior places."
3. "Leaving them under the guilt of sin, which is the power of darkness, and in black despair; shutting them up in unbelief, impenitence, and hardness of mind; being holden with the cords of their sins, and in the most dreadful state of bondage and captivity to their lusts, in just judgment on them."

### John Wesley:
1. "Cast them down to hell ‚Äî The bottomless pit, a place of unknown misery."
2. "Delivered them ‚Äî Like condemned criminals to safe custody, as if bound with the strongest chains in a dungeon of darkness, to be reserved unto the judgment of the great day."
3. "Though still those chains do not hinder their often walking up and down seeking whom they may devour."
