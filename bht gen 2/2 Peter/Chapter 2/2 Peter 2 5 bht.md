# 2 Peter 2:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By bringing a flood upon the world of ungodly men, God showed that He would not let sin go unpunished. Noah, as the eighth person and a preacher of righteousness, stood in stark contrast to the wickedness of his age. Though the ungodly were numerous, their great numbers could not save them from the judgment that ultimately came upon them. The example of Noah serves as a warning that the wicked cannot escape divine vengeance, and that righteousness will always find preservation, even if it is in the form of a chosen few.
