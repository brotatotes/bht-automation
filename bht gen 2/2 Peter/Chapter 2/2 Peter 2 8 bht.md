# 2 Peter 2:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The righteous man dwells amidst wickedness but remains steadfast, not succumbing to their ways. He is tormented by the ongoing exposure to their wickedness, seeing and hearing things that deeply trouble his soul. He is pained by their actions, repulsed by their language, and refuses to participate or be influenced by their filth. His distress is a constant torture, a test of his faith and character in the face of such evil.
