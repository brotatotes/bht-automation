## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This Epistle now, beloved, a second, write I unto you: in which Epistles I stir up your pure mind." 
2. "Œ¥ŒπŒ¨ŒΩŒøŒπŒ± is that aspect of the spiritual being of man, in which it is turned towards the outer world; his mind for business and outer interests, guiding him in action...it is not obscured by fleshly and selfish regards." 
3. "I stir up your pure mind in reminding."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "pure‚Äîliterally, 'pure when examined by sunlight'; 'sincere.' Adulterated with no error."
2. "Opposite to 'having the understanding darkened.' ALFORD explains, The mind, will, and affection, in relation to the outer world, being turned to God [the Sun of the soul], and not obscured by fleshly and selfish regards."
3. "by way of‚ÄîGreek, 'in,' 'in putting you in remembrance'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In both which I stir up your pure minds ... - That is, the main object of both epistles is the same - to call to your remembrance important truths which you have before heard, but which you are in danger of forgetting, or from which you are in danger of being turned away by prevailing errors."
2. "The word properly refers to 'that which may be judged of in sunshine;' then it means 'clear, manifest;' and then 'sincere, pure' - as that in which there is no obscurity."
3. "The apostle regarded them as 'disposed' to see the truth, and yet as liable to be led astray by the plausible errors of others. Such minds need to have truths often brought fresh to their remembrance, though they are truths with which they had before been familiar."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Pure minds ... mind. The word rendered pure is often explained tested by the sunlight; but this is very doubtful, since eilh, to which this meaning is traced, means the heat, and not the light of the sun."
2. "Others derive it from the root of the verb eiJlissw, to roll, and explain it as that which is separated or sifted by rolling, as in a sieve."
3. "The kindred noun eijlikrineia, sincerity, is found 1 Corinthians 5:8; 2 Corinthians 1:12; 2 Corinthians 2:17. Rev., here, sincere."

### John Calvin:
1. "I stir up your pure mind, he means the same as though he had said, 'I wish to awaken you to a sincerity of mind.'"
2. "For the meaning is, that the minds of the godly become dim, and as it were contract rust, when admonitions cease."
3. "And as men are, by nature, for the most part, fond of novelty and thus inclined to be fastidious, it is useful for us to bear in mind what Peter says, so that we may not only willingly suffer ourselves to be admonished by others, but that every one may also exercise himself in calling to mind continually the truth, so that our minds may become resplendent with the pure and clear knowledge of it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The expression seems to imply that a comparatively short time had elapsed since he wrote them before. This is referred to as an ‚Äòevidence of his affectionate solicitude, as well as of the importance and urgency of the subject-matter‚Äô (Lillie)."
2. "The Epistle also deepens notably in the loving urgency of its tone, as it now approaches its conclusion. Hence the repeated appeals to the readers as ‚Äòbeloved‚Äô which distinguish this chapter."
3. "It seems to mean primarily unmixed, distinct. The cognate noun is found three times in the N. T. (1Co 5:8; 2 Corinthians 1:12; 2 Corinthians 2:17). The term has a definite ethical sense in the N. T., which goes beyond anything it has in Classical Greek."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Beloved. With this vocative verbal (four times in this chapter), Peter 'turns away from the Libertines and their victims' (Mayor)."
2. "I stir up. Present active indicative, perhaps conative, 'I try to stir up.'"
3. "Sincere. Old adjective of doubtful etymology (supposed to be ŒµŒπŒªŒ∑, sunlight, and Œ∫œÅŒπŒΩœâ, to judge by it). Plato used it of ethical purity (œàœÖœáŒ∑ ŒµŒπŒªŒπŒ∫œÅŒπŒΩŒ∑œÇ) as here and Philippians 1:10, the only N.T. examples."

### John Gill:
1. "he addresses these saints here, as also in 2 Peter 3:8, under the character of 'beloved'; because they were the beloved of God, being chosen by him according to his foreknowledge, and regenerated by him, according to his abundant mercy."
2. "The Syriac and Arabic versions read, 'my beloved'; and the Ethiopic version, 'my brethren': his end in writing both this and the former epistle follows."
3. "he calls their minds pure [...] and may design the sincerity of their hearts in the worship of God, in the doctrines of Christ, and to one another, and of the grace of the Spirit of God in them."
