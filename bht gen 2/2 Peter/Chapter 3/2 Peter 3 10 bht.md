# 2 Peter 3:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The day of the Lord will arrive abruptly, like a thief in the night, catching people off guard. In that day, the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will be dissolved with fervent heat. Even the earth and everything in it will not escape destruction as they will be burned up. God has already made provisions for this through the elemental forces He has set in motion, such as subterranean fire, ethereal fire, and celestial bodies like comets. These mechanisms reveal God's intention for the universe to undergo significant transformations.
