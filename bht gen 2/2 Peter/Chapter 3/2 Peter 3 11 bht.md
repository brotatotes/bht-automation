# 2 Peter 3:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Considering that all things shall be dissolved, it is imperative for us to understand the significance of this truth and its impact on our lives. We should live with a constant expectation and readiness for the day of God, recognizing that the earthly things we pursue are fleeting and temporary. Our focus should be on cultivating holy behaviors towards others and pieties towards God, encompassing a wide range of moral conduct and devotion. By remembering the transitory nature of life, we are compelled to reflect on our preparedness and strive for a life of holiness and godliness.
