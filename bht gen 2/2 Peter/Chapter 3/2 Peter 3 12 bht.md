# 2 Peter 3:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The day of God is an event that believers are eagerly expecting, desiring its arrival through holy living and fervent prayers. It is a day when Christ will reveal Himself fully as God, showcasing His divine attributes. This day has been foretold by the patriarchs, prophets, Christ Himself, and the apostles, giving believers the assurance that it will surely come. In light of this, believers should be ready for this day, actively engaged in acts of faith, love, and worship, rather than passively slumbering or sleeping.
