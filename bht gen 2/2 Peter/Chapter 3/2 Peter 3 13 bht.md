# 2 Peter 3:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We eagerly anticipate the arrival of a new heavens and a new earth, envisioning a complete transformation from the old. In this new state of being, righteousness will prevail, and only those who are righteous will dwell there. The idea is truly profound and mysterious, capturing our imagination and instilling hope for a future that is beyond our comprehension.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But (contrast to the destructive effects of the day lately dwelt on: not “ nevertheless ” as E. V., which looks as if the two effects were in antagonism, and the earth were to be annihilated, of which idea there is no trace. The flood did not annihilate the earth, but changed it; and as the new earth was the consequence of the flood, so the final new heavens and earth shall be of the fire) according to His (God’s) promise (viz., that written in ref. Isa.)"
2. "we (no stress, as is almost unavoidable in the E. V. 'Nevertheless we, according to his promise:' there is no ἡμεῖς, nor is the distinction drawn between us and any other class of persons)"
3. "expect new heavens and a new earth, in which (heavens and earth, plur.) righteousness dwelleth"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "As the flood was the baptism of the earth, eventuating in a renovated earth, partially delivered from 'the curse,' so the baptism with fire shall purify the earth so as to be the renovated abode of regenerated man, wholly freed from the curse."
2. "The 'we' is not emphatical as in English Version."
3. "Righteousness dwelleth in that coming world as its essential feature, all pollutions having been removed."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The 'new heavens and the new earth' referred to will be such as will exist after the world shall have been destroyed by fire; that is, after the general judgment." 
2. "No one can prove that this may not be, though there is no evidence that it will be their permanent and eternal home or that even all the redeemed will at any one time find a home on this globe, for no one can suppose that the earth is spacious enough to furnish a dwelling-place for all the unnumbered millions that are to be saved."
3. "The new heavens and earth will be 'holy.' They will be the home of righteousness forever."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The 'look for' is expressed by the same term as in 2 Peter 3:12."
2. "The 'newness' of the future heavens and earth is expressed by a term which denotes what is fresh as contrasted with what is exhausted, and deals with the condition rather than with the age of an object."
