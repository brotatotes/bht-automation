# 2 Peter 3:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Though some aspects of the Epistles may be hard to understand, there are enough clear teachings within them to guide the man of God. The Bible should not be studied as an abstruse science, but as a practical guide for righteous living. It is important to anchor ourselves in the firm foundation of God's word and not be swayed by every wind of doctrine. The apostles' lives were prolonged to ensure the authenticity of the canon of Scripture. Though some may misuse the scriptures, it should not deter others from diligently studying them for guidance and wisdom.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "in all Epistles which he writes, leaving room for the possibility that the number of those Epistles was not complete, but still being added to)" 
2. "there are some things difficult to understand"
3. "those who, wanting firm foundation and anchorage, waver and drift about with every wind of doctrine"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Though there be some things hard to be understood, there are enough besides, plain, easy, and sufficient for perfecting the man of God." 
2. "When religion is studied as a science, nothing is more abstruse; when studied in order to know our duty and practice it, nothing is easier." 
3. "Men in each Church having miraculous discernment of spirits would have prevented any uninspired writing from being put on a par with the Old Testament word of God; the apostles' lives also were providentially prolonged, Paul's and Peter's at least to thirty-four years after Christ's resurrection, John's to thirty years later, so that fraud in the canon is out of question."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The true construction, so far as the evidence goes, is to refer it not directly to the 'epistles,' but to the 'things' of which Peter says Paul wrote; that is, not to the style and language of Paul, but to the great truths and doctrines which he taught."
2. "The humble inquirer after truth may find enough in the Bible to guide his feet in the paths of salvation. No one ever approached the sacred Scriptures with a teachable heart, who did not find them 'able to make him wise unto salvation.'"
3. "The way to prevent this evil is not by attempting to give to a community an authoritative interpretation of the Bible; it is to diffuse abroad just principles, that men may obtain from the Bible an intelligent view of what it means."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Hard to be understood [Œ¥œÖœÉŒΩŒøŒ∑œÑŒ±] . Only here in New Testament."
2. "Wrest (streblousin). Only here in New Testament. Meaning, originally, to hoist with a windless or screw; to twist or dislocate the limbs on a rack."
3. "The other scriptures [œÑŒ±œÇ ŒªŒøŒπœÄŒ±œÇ Œ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒ±œÇ] . Showing that Paul's epistles were ranked as scripture."

### John Calvin:
1. "We are reminded by these words, to reason soberly on things so high and obscure"
2. "We are strengthened against this kind of offense, lest the foolish or absurd speculations of men should disturb us"
3. "That those vices ought to be corrected which prevent improvement, and not only so, but render deadly to us what God has appointed for our salvation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The ‚Äòin which‚Äô refers, according to the best reading, not to the ‚Äòthings‚Äô of which Paul spake, but to the Epistles themselves."
2. "The implicit testimony contained in this statement to the authority of certain writings as Scripture also deserves to be noticed."
3. "What Peter is warning against, however, is the perils of a misuse of Scripture."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "And yet Peter does not here assert the formation of a canon of Paul's Epistles."
2. "Paul also wrote about the second coming of Christ, as is obviously true."
3. "Peter thus puts Paul's Epistles on the same plane with the O.T., which was also misused."

### John Gill:
1. "The phrase, 'in which', refers either to the epistles, or the things spoken in them."
2. "And which is no reason why they should be laid aside, but rather why they should be read with greater application and diligence, and be followed with fervent prayer, and frequent meditation."
3. "Those that are taught of God, though otherwise illiterate, may read them to great profit and advantage."

### John Wesley:
1. "St. Peter wrote this a little before his own and St. Paul's martyrdom."
2. "Therefore St Paul's writings were now part of the scriptures."
3. "But that some use the scriptures ill, is no reason why others should not use them at all."
