# 2 Peter 3:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Beloved, be on guard, for just as the ungodly were led astray, you too may be carried away by their deception. Do not let yourselves be entangled in their errors. Be vigilant, holding fast to the simplicity of the Gospel and the truth of God's grace. Take heed, lest you should fall from the steadfastness of your faith, for while believers cannot ultimately lose their salvation, they can still falter in their faith and their profession of it. Stay rooted in the truth and watchful against the cunning schemes of the enemy.

3. "Wicked... fall from... 'steadfastness' or stability in contrast with the 'unstable'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "People should read the Bible with the feeling that it is possible that they may fall into error, and be deceived at last. This apprehension will do much to make them diligent, and candid, and prayerful, in studying the Word of God." 
2. "The particular danger here referred to is not that of falling from grace, or from true religion, but from the firm and settled principles of religious truth into error."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Being led away [συναπαχθεντες] . Better, Rev., carried away. It is the word used by Paul of Barnabas, when he dissembled with Peter at Antioch."
2. "Steadfastness [στηριγμου] . Only here in New Testament. See on ch. 2 Peter 1:12."
3. "The term [καθολικη] , catholic or general, applied to the Epistles of James, Peter, John, and Jude, was used from the second century onward in the sense of something addressed to the faithful generally, as distinguished from Christians of particular nations or cities, as the Galatians or Ephesians."

### John Calvin:
1. "The craft of our enemy, the many and various treacheries which he employs against us, the cavils of ungodly men, leave no place for security."
2. "It seems that we stand on slippery ground, and the certainty of our salvation is suspended, as it were, on a thread, since he declares to the faithful, that they ought to take heed lest they should fall from their own steadfastness."
3. "This exhortation, and those like it, are by no means intended to shake the firmness of that faith which recumbs on God, but to correct the sloth of our flesh."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The epithet ‘lawless’ is that which was formerly applied to the men of Sodom... It points, therefore, to the licentious character of the errorists." 
2. "The phrase ‘carried away with’ is an extremely forcible one... It may suggest the picture of the ‘error’ as a powerful current sweeping what it can into its bosom, and snatching the unwary off from the rock of their stedfastness."
3. "This particular term ‘stedfastness’ occurs only here, but belongs to the same class with the previous ‘unstable'."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Knowing these things beforehand (προγινωσκοντες). Hence they are without excuse for misunderstanding Peter or Paul on this subject."

### John Gill:
1. "Beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked; from the simplicity of the Gospel, along with such wicked men, that wax worse and worse, deceivers and being deceived, by giving into any of their errors which respect the grace of God, or the person and offices of Christ, or particularly his second coming; be upon the watch and guard against them." 
2. "Lest ye fall from your own steadfastness; which was proper to them, and which, by the grace of God, they had, and retained, both in the faith of Christ and doctrine of the Gospel; for though the saints can never finally and totally fall into sin, or from the truth, yet they may fall from their steadfastness, both as to the exercise of the grace of faith, and as to their profession of the doctrine of faith."
