# 2 Peter 3:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To truly grow and mature in our faith, we are called to continually cultivate and develop every aspect of our Christian temper. Our spiritual well-being is dependent on what we feed our souls with, just as the health of our bodies relies on the quality of our daily food. While it may be easy to deviate from God's will and follow our own desires, doing so will ultimately bring spiritual leanness and dissatisfaction, highlighting the importance of staying rooted in His truth and following His guidance.
