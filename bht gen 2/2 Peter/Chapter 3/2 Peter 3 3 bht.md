# 2 Peter 3:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Firstly, it is important to be aware of the predictions made by the apostles and prophets, one of which is that in the last days, scoffers or mockers would arise. These individuals, as described by the Scriptures, ridicule and make a mockery of the truths and teachings found in the Word of God. Whether this refers to the time of the Messiah or the final days of the Jewish state, it is evident that such scoffers were expected to appear.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "knowing this first...that there shall come in the last of the days...scoffers in (their) scoffing" (cf. ref., where the same phrase occurs).
2. "scoffers making use of scoffing" (scoffers making use of scoffing: cf. Revelation 14:2, κιθαρῳδῶν κιθαριζόντων ἐν ταῖς κιθάραις αὐτῶν: 2 Kings 20:22, ἐλάλησεν (ἡ γυνὴ ἡ σοφὴ) ἐν τῇ σοφίᾳ αὐτῆς: Dan 1:4 Theod., συνιέντας ἐν πάσῃ σοφίᾳ, κ. γινώσκοντας γνῶσιν, κ. διανοουμένους φρόνησιν."
3. "walking according to their own lusts" (so Jude 1:18; Jude 1:16, here combined).

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Their very scoffing shall confirm the truth of the prediction."
2. "Their own pleasure is their sole law, unrestrained by reverence for God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Knowing this first - As among the first and most important things to be attended to - as one of the predictions which demand your special regard."
2. "It is probable that Peter refers to the same thing, and we may suppose that this was so well understood by all the apostles that they made it a common subject of preaching."
3. "Here the sense seems to be that they would treat with derision or contempt the predictions respecting the advent of the Saviour, and the end of the world."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Scoffers walking... in mockery." 
2. "Mockers shall come with mockery... walking."

### John Calvin:
1. "For it was necessary that this should have been foretold, because they might have been shaken, had impious men attacked them suddenly with scoffs of this kind."
2. "The more God offers himself by the gospel to the world, and the more he invites men to his kingdom, the more audacious on the other hand will ungodly men vomit forth the poison of their impiety."
3. "Let us therefore bear in mind, that there is nothing to be feared more than a contest with scoffers."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The ‘last of the days’ mean the times immediately preceding the Second Coming of Christ, and immediately introducing the Messianic Age, otherwise described as the ‘age to come.’"
2. "When these mockers come, they will come in character. Both nouns are unusual in the N.T., the former occurring again only in Jude 1:18, the latter only here."
3. "Sensuality and faith, coarse self-indulgence and clear spiritual apprehension, cannot coexist. The mocking spirit is the sister or child of the unclean spirit."

1. "In the first place, principally, and chiefly, and which might easily be known and observed from the writings of the apostles and prophets; that there shall come in the last days scoffers, or 'mockers'".
2. "nor do the Scriptures of truth escape the banter and burlesque of these scoffers; the doctrines of it being foolishness to them, and the commands and ordinances in it being grievous and intolerable to them".
3. "such as these, according to the prophets and apostles, were to come in 'the last days'; either in the days of the Messiah, in the Gospel dispensation, the times between the first and second coming of Christ... or in the last days of the Jewish state, both civil and religious".
