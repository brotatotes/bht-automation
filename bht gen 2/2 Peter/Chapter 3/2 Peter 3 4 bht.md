# 2 Peter 3:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These mockers scoff at the promise of Christ's coming, questioning where the fulfillment of this promise is and disregarding its likelihood. Their argument is based on the stability of nature and the unchanging course of events, leading them to conclude that all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation. They do not acknowledge or name Jesus, but instead reason from the natural order of things to deny any future interruption or fulfillment of the promise.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The time of waiting for the promise necessarily dates from the death of the πατέρες, and things have continued as we now see them from the beginning of creation."
2. "Those meant by οἱ πατέρες are largely and generally those to whom the promise was made, but also any others in the same category, e.g. those who bear the same relation to the N.T. church as they did to the O.T."
3. "The assertion must not be pressed to any particular date, but given that wide reference which would naturally be in the mind of one making such a general charge."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Presumptuous skepticism and lawless lust, setting nature and its so-called laws above the God of nature and revelation, and arguing from the past continuity of nature's phenomena that there can be no future interruption to them, was the sin of the antediluvians, and shall be that of the scoffers in the last days."
2. "Where—implying that it ought to have taken place before this, if ever it was to take place, but that it never will."
3. "The 'scoffers' here are not necessarily atheists, nor do they maintain that the world existed from eternity. They are willing to recognize a God, but not the God of revelation. They reason from seeming delay against the fulfilment of God's word at all."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Where is the 'fulfillment' of that promise; or, where are the 'indications' or 'signs' that he will come?...they who had believed this were entirely deluded."
2. "Those old men, the prophets, indeed foretold this event...since they have departed, the affairs of the world have gone on very much as they did before."
3. "The argument here...is based on the stability of the laws of nature, and the uniformity of the course of events...Things continued to go on as they had always done...there was every indication that those laws would continue to operate as they had always done."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "From the beginning of the creation [απ αρχης κτισεως] . Not a common phrase."
2. "Fell asleep [εκοιμηθησαν] . A literal and correct translation of the word... Some have supposed that the peculiarly Christian sense of the word is emphasized ironically by these mockers."
3. "The difference between the pagan and the Christian usage lies in the fact that, in the latter, it was defined by the hope of the resurrection, and therefore was used literally of a sleep, which, though long, was to have an awaking."

### John Calvin:
1. "It was a dangerous scoff when they insinuated a doubt as to the last resurrection; for when that is taken away, there is no gospel any longer, the power of Christ is brought to nothing, the whole of religion is gone."
2. "Then Satan aims directly at the throat of the Church, when he destroys faith in the coming of Christ."
3. "All religion is wholly subverted, except faith in the resurrection remains firm and immovable."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The question, put with triumphant scorn by these mockers, repeats the cherished terms used by believers the ‘promise ‘in which they trusted, the ‘coming’ which they looked for with vivid expectancy."
2. "Their argument will be taken from the delay in the fulfilment of ‘that blessed hope’ (Titus 2:13) of the Christian brotherhood, and from the unbroken uniformity of things."
3. "The first generation of Christian believers received this promise (Acts 1:11, etc.), and lived in the hope of its sure and speedy fulfilment. They died without witnessing that, and this would be used with their children as an argument for discrediting the promise itself."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Peter, like Paul (1 Thessalonians 5:1; 2 Thessalonians 2:1), preached about the second coming, as Jesus himself did repeatedly..."
2. "Both Jesus and Paul (2 Thessalonians 2:1) were misunderstood on the subject of the time and the parables of Jesus urged readiness and forbade setting dates for his coming..."
3. "From the beginning of creation (απ' αρχης κτισεως). Precisely so in Mark 10:6, which see."

### John Gill:
1. "What is become of the promise of his coming? Where is the accomplishment of it?"
2. "Where the fulfilment of all this? He is not come, nor is there any sign or likelihood of it."
3. "Reasoning from the settled order of things, the constant revolution of the sun, moon, and stars, the permanency of the earth, and the succession of the inhabitants of it, to the future continuance of things, without any alteration."

### John Wesley:
1. "They do not even deign to name him."
2. "All things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation."
