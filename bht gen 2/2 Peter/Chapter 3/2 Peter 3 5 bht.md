# 2 Peter 3:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These individuals willingly choose ignorance, unaware that the heavens and the earth were created from the beginning by God's powerful word. They neglect to consider that the earth, once positioned for a flood, is now being preserved for future judgment. God's word not only established the earth but can also bring about its dissolution. The earth, held together by water, was formed to stand in and be surrounded by water. These truths, ignored by the willfully ignorant, highlight the power and sovereignty of God over all creation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This fact which follows escapes them of their own will."
2. "The heavens were from of old and the earth formed out of water and by means of water."
3. "Water was the material, out of which the earth was made."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Their ignorance is voluntary. They obstinately shut their eyes to the Scripture record of the creation and the deluge."
2. "A confutation of their objection, 'all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation.'"
3. "The earth arose out of the water by the efficacy of the water itself."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They who thus will or think; that is, they who hold the opinion that all things will continue to remain as they were, are ignorant of this fact that things have not always thus remained; that there has been a destruction of the world once by water."
2. "The 'will' has usually more to do in the denial and rejection of the doctrines of the Bible than the 'understanding' has."
3. "The idea which our translators seem to have had is, that, in the formation of the earth, a part was out of the water, and a part under the water; and that the former, or the inhabited portion, became entirely submerged, and that thus the inhabitants perished. This was not, however, probably the idea of Peter. He doubtless has reference to the account given in Genesis 1:0: of the creation of the earth, in which water performed so important a part."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The heavens were. But the Greek has not article. Render, there were heavens."
2. "Standing together; i.e., compacted or formed."
3. "DiÃ¡ has its usual sense here, not as Rev., amidst, but by means of. Bengel : 'The water served that the earth should consist.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "The world no doubt had its origin from waters...but it pleased the Lord to use waters for the purpose of destroying it." 
2. "The power of nature is not sufficient to sustain and preserve the world, but contains the very element of its own ruin, whenever it may please God to destroy it." 
3. "The history of the deluge is an abundantly sufficient witness that the whole order of nature is governed by the sole power of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The 'this' then refers to the fact which is to be stated immediately." 
2. "The relation in which this statement on the formation of a heaven and an earth in the beginning stands to what follows, is somewhat uncertain."
3. "The very element which the Word of God used in first preparing that solid earth and 'all things' was employed by the same word in destroying them."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For this escapes them being willing."
2. "There is no need to make Peter mean the Jewish mystical 'seven heavens' because of the plural which was used interchangeably with the singular."
3. "Out of the primeval watery chaos... by means of water."

### John Gill:
1. "These men...might have known that the heavens and the earth were from the beginning; and that they were made by the word of God; and that the earth was originally in such a position and situation as to be overflowed with a flood...and that the present heavens and earth are kept and reserved for a general burning." 
2. "It was 'by the word of God' that they at first existed, and were so long preserved in being...so the same Word they might be dissolved, and made to pass away, as they will."
3. "Moreover, the earth consists, or is kept and held together by water; there is a general humidity or moisture that runs through it, by which it is compacted together...and it is also said to stand 'in the water', or by the water; upon it...or rather in the midst of it."

### John Wesley:
1. "For this they are willingly ignorant of â€” They do not care to know or consider."
2. "That by the almighty word of God - Which bounds the duration of all things, so that it cannot be either longer or shorter."
3. "The aerial heavens were, and the earth - Not as it is now, but standing out of the water and in the water - Perhaps the interior globe of earth was fixed in the midst of the great deep, the abyss of water; the shell or exterior globe standing out of the water, covering the great deep."
