# 2 Peter 3:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The interpretations of the mentioned phrase have been diverse, but it is clear that it refers to the world's destruction through water. This destruction involved a significant change to the heavens and earth, which were originally formed from water and ultimately perished by water. The flood served as a reminder that the world has been destroyed before, discrediting the notion that all things continue as they were. This event highlights the potential for future upheaval and emphasizes the need to recognize the transient nature of the world we inhabit.
