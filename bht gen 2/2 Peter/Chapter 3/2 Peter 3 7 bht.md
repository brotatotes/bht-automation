# 2 Peter 3:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The present state of the heavens and earth is wonderfully preserved and upheld by the same creative Word of God that brought them into existence. This preservation is not eternal, for the heavens and earth are reserved for destruction by fire. This fiery judgment will come at the appointed time, when God will judge the world and bring everlasting punishment upon the ungodly. The heavens and earth, as they exist now, are not as they have always been or will be, but for a time, they are being upheld and reserved for this coming judgment.
