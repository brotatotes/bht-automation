# 2 Peter 3:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do not be dismayed by the apparent delay of God's promises, for His measure of time is not like ours. A thousand years to Him is as one day, signifying His eternal nature and His ability to accomplish in an instant what might take thousands of years for us. So, when it seems that God is taking a long time to act, remember that His purpose is not hindered by time. He is always ready to fulfill His promises and patiently allows for repentance and change. Trust in His eternal perspective and His perfect timing.
