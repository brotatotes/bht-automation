# 2 Thessalonians 1:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
May the Lord, who is rich in goodness, count you worthy of His call, and fulfill every desire for goodness in your life. It is by His grace that we are considered worthy, and it is His own goodness that moves Him to perfect our faith. May God bring to completion the work of faith in our lives, for faith itself is a powerful work of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Our God may count YOU worthy of your calling" - The verb has the secondary emphasis: see below.
2. "And may fulfill all right purpose of goodness" - It (εὐδοκία) must then apply to the Thessalonians, as it does to human agents in Philippians 1:15.
3. "And all work of faith, in power" - Activity of faith: see reference 1 Thessalonians note.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "May you be found among the saints whom God shall count worthy of their calling."
2. "The calling here is not merely the first actual call, but the whole of God's electing act, originating in His 'purpose of grace given us in Christ before the world began,' and having its consummation in glory."
3. "Fulfil (His) every gracious purpose of goodness (on your part), that is, fully perfect in you all goodness according to His gracious purpose."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That our God would count you worthy of this calling."
2. "May God fill you with all that good which is pleasing to him."
3. "The work of religion on the soul is always represented in the Bible as one of power."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The end is, 'that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God.'"
2. "He prays that God may perfect their pleasure in goodness."
3. "Eudokia good pleasure, delight, is a purely Biblical word."

### John Calvin:
1. "He might have said in one word, that your faith may be fulfilled, but he terms it good pleasure. Farther, he expresses the idea still more distinctly by saying, that God was prompted by nothing else than his own goodness, for he finds nothing in us but misery."
2. "Paul, on the other hand, recognizes in the whole progress of our salvation nothing but the pure grace of God."
3. "For it is no easier task to bring faith to perfection in an individual, than to rear upon water a tower that may by its firmness withstand all storms and fury of tempests, and may surmount the clouds in height, for we are not less fluid than water, and it is necessary that the height of faith reach as high as heaven."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The calling to which Paul refers is that destiny of the saints which he has just been describing."
2. "Had it been a mare matter of justice, such a prayer as this of Paul’s would have been inappropriate if not impertinent. But while it is by God’s grace any one is counted worthy, there is a corresponding conduct looked for and required in those who are visited by this grace."
3. "The prayer of Paul therefore is, that God would powerfully bring to complete and satisfactory result every desire or purpose which their goodness of heart engendered, or more probably would so increase their goodness as to make these desires themselves perfect, irrespective of their results, and would enable them to maintain and perfect that activity and endurance to which faith had prompted them."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "To which end  (εις ο). So Colossians 1:29. Probably purpose with reference to the contents of verses 2 Thessalonians 1:5-10. We have had the Thanksgiving (verses 2 Thessalonians 1:3-10) in a long, complicated, but rich period or sentence."
2. "Both ideas may be here. It is God's calling of the Thessalonians.And fulfil every desire of goodness  (κα πληρωση πασαν ευδοκιαν αγαθωσυνης). 'Whom he counts worthy he first makes worthy' (Lillie). Yes, in purpose, but the wonder and the glory of it all is that God begins to count us worthy in Christ before the process is completed in Christ (Romans 8:29)."
3. "May the Thessalonians find delight in goodness, a worthy and pertinent prayer.Work of faith  (εργον πιστεως). The same phrase in 1 Thessalonians 1:3. Paul prays for rich fruition of what he had seen in the beginning. Work marked by faith, springs from faith, sustained by faith."

### John Gill:
1. "We add our prayers, and not only now, but always, that you may be among them in whom Christ will be glorified and admired."
2. "The words may be rendered, 'that our God would count you worthy of the call'; of the call of Christ when he shall be revealed from heaven, and come a second time."
3. "Faith is not only an operative grace, and is attended with good works; but it is a work itself, not of man's, for he cannot produce it in himself, nor exercise it of himself; but it is the work of God, of his operation which he works in his people."

### John Wesley:
1. All the good pleasure of his goodness — Which is no less than perfect holiness.
