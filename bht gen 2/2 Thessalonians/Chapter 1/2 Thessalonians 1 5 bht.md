# 2 Thessalonians 1:5 Commentary Help Text

The injustice and suffering experienced by good individuals while the wicked prosper can lead to doubts about God's righteousness and fairness. However, these apparent inequalities in Providence are actually a clear demonstration that there will be a righteous judgment to rectify these imbalances. God is not unjust or indifferent; He will ensure that justice is served. Through afflictions, the saints are being prepared for their future glory and their character is being refined by the Spirit of God. These temporary sufferings will ultimately result in an eternal weight of glory.
