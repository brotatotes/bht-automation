# 2 Thessalonians 1:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is just and proper in the eyes of God to shift the burden of affliction from those who are troubled to those who trouble them. This principle is reflected throughout history, such as during the time of the Passover when many of the Jews who caused turmoil were slain. The apostle Paul refers to these beginnings of sorrows and makes it clear that such affliction will not go unpunished, ultimately leading to the destruction of those who trouble the righteous.
