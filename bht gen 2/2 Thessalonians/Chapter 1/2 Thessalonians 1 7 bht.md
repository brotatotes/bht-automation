# 2 Thessalonians 1:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The justice of God is revealed in the promise of rest given to those who are afflicted and persecuted for the sake of righteousness. This rest is not merely a temporary reprieve, but an eternal peace that awaits the saints after death and at the coming of the Lord. It is a release from toil, sin, and all forms of persecution. When the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven, God's justice will be fully displayed, as tribulation is rendered to persecutors and the long-awaited rest is granted to the persecuted.
