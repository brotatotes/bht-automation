# 2 Thessalonians 1:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The flame of fire symbolizes God's bright glory and consuming vengeance. Those who wilfully do not know God, like Pharaoh, are guilty of rebellion against Him. Ignorance of God leads to contempt and ultimately death. The punishment of ungodly men is often associated with fire, signifying their endless torture and inconceivable misery. The unbelieving Jews and all who disobey the truth will face severe condemnation, with their punishment being worse than that of Tyre, Sidon, Sodom, and Gomorrah.
