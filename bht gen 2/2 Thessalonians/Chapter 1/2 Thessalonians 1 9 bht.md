# 2 Thessalonians 1:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who reject salvation and defy God's authority will face an eternal and unending punishment. Their sins and enmity against God will persist, leading to everlasting destruction. This punishment extends beyond this present life, causing one to fall short of God's presence and glory. Such is the severity of God's vengeance against those who reject Him. Let this be a warning to all who are stubborn and refuse to acknowledge God. Instead, let us humble ourselves before Him, seeking His mercy and forgiveness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The sentence emanating from Him in person, sitting as Judge and driving them far from Him."
2. "The presence of the Lord is the source whence the sentence goes forth; 'the glory of His power' is the instrument whereby the sentence is carried into execution."
3. "Cast out from the presence of the Lord is the idea at the root of eternal death, the law of evil left to its unrestricted working, without one counteracting influence of the presence of God, who is the source of all light and holiness."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The soul is destroyed as to the great purposes of its being - its enjoyment, dignity, honor, holiness, happiness."
2. "The wicked will be punished forever, then it must be admitted that it would not have been possible to reveal the doctrine in human language!"
3. "It will be one of the circumstances contributing to the deeper woe of the place of punishment, that those who dwell there will be banished from that holy abode, and will never be permitted to enter there."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Shall be punished [δικην τισουσιν] . The verb (N. T. o.) means to pay or render. Lit. shall pay penalty."
2. "Everlasting destruction [ολεθρον αιωνιον] . The phrase nowhere else in N. T. In LXX, 4 Macc. 10 15. Rev. properly, eternal destruction."
3. "The power [δυναμις] and glory of God are associated in Matthew 24:30; Mark 13:26; Luke 21:27; Revelation 4:11; Revelation 19:1."

### John Calvin:
1. "He shews, by apposition, what is the nature of the punishment of which he had made mention — destruction without end, and an undying death."
2. "The perpetuity of the death is proved from the circumstance, that it has the glory of Christ as its opposite. Now, this is eternal, and has no end."
3. "Accordingly, the influence of that death will never cease. From this also the dreadful severity of the punishment may be inferred, inasmuch as it will be great in proportion to the glory and majesty of Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "'A testimony, this, to the eternity of future punishment that is not easy to be explained away.'" (Ellicott)
2. "How are men to be reclaimed if the very presence on which all holy desire and life depend, becomes destruction to them?" 
3. "Those to whom His power is unfriendly, and who have no expectation that it will be exerted in their behalf, will flee from its glory."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Who (οιτινες). Qualitative use, such as."
2. "Shall suffer punishment (δικην τισουσιν). Future active of old verb τινω, to pay penalty (δικην, right, justice), here only in N.T., but αποτινω once also to repay Philemon 1:19."
3. "Eternal destruction (ολεθρον αιωνιον). Accusative case in apposition with δικην (penalty)."

### John Gill:
1. "With destruction both of soul and body, though not with the annihilation of either...the smoke of their torment will ascend forever."
2. "Sin being committed against an infinite and eternal Being...will be infinite in its duration; nor will it cease to be in the persons punished, who will not be in the least reformed or purged from sin by punishment; which will make the continuance of it just and necessary."
3. "And these will be driven from the presence of the Lord...the punishment of loss; or what they will be deprived of, the presence of the Lord...may also signify how sudden and terrible their destruction will be."

### John Wesley:
1. "Tremble, ye stout-hearted." 
2. "Everlasting destruction — As there can be no end of their sins, (the same enmity against God continuing,) so neither of their punishment; sin and its punishment running parallel throughout eternity itself."
3. "What unspeakable punishment is implied even in falling short of this, supposing that nothing more were implied in his taking vengeance!"
