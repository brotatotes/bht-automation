# 2 Thessalonians 2:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The believers' gathering together to Christ in the clouds refers to the final gathering of all the saints at the second coming of Christ. This event is affirmed by angels, prophets, apostles, and even Christ himself. It is important to approach this truth with reverence and sobriety, not being easily swayed by claims that the event is imminent. Instead, we should hold firmly to the certainty of this gathering, knowing that it is a sure promise from God.
