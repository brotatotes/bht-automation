# 2 Thessalonians 2:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The deceivableness of unrighteousness, the fraudulence of sinful systems, and the rejection of truth all contribute to the downfall of those who perish. By rejecting the love of the truth, they become blinded by the god of this world and are led astray by deceitful teachings. It is not due to God's decree or lack of access to the Gospel, but rather their own rejection and contempt of it that leads to their perishing. God, in His sovereignty, allows them to fall into the strong delusion they willingly embrace.
