# 2 Thessalonians 2:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The deliberate rejection of the truth leads to a terrifying consequence: God permits the wicked to be deceived, and they willingly embrace falsehood. This is not a random occurrence, but a deliberate act of divine judgment. By allowing them to be blinded by error, God exposes the true nature of their unbelief and underscores the importance of embracing the truth. It is a sobering reminder of the consequences of turning away from God and indulging in wickedness.
