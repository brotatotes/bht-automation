# 2 Thessalonians 2:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The purpose of these events is that all who do not love the truth may be judged and condemned, as they did not believe the truth and took pleasure in unrighteousness. In their rejection of the truth and their love for sin, they have no grounds to question God's judgment upon them. It is a just consequence that those who reject God's righteousness will face condemnation.
