# 2 Thessalonians 2:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Beloved of the Lord, we can find great comfort in the fact that God has chosen us from the beginning. This divine act of selection is the foundation of all the other blessings of grace that we receive. It is an unchanging and certain choice that leads us to salvation. This choice is not arbitrary, but based on our sanctification by the Holy Spirit and our belief in the truth. This assures us that we cannot be easily deceived or led astray by the error of the wicked or the deceitful tactics of the antichrist.
