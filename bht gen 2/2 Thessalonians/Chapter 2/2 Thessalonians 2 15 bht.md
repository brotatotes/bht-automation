# 2 Thessalonians 2:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Standing firm in the teachings of the Gospel, without wavering or being troubled, is crucial, especially in regards to the belief in Christ's second coming. These teachings, or 'traditions,' are not mere human opinions, but truths that have been passed down from one generation to another. The apostles, through both oral and written means, delivered these doctrines, ordinances, and rules of discipline to the believers. Holding fast to them, without adding or subtracting from them, is essential for a faithful and steadfast walk with God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "No human reasoning powers can connect the two, God’s sovereignty and man’s freewill: all we know of them is, that the one is as certain a truth as the other."
2. "In proportion then as we assert the one strongly, we must ever implicate the other as strongly."
3. "ἅς is the accusative of second reference."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "God's sovereign choice of believers, so far from being a ground for inaction on their part, is the strongest incentive to action and perseverance in it."
2. "The Thessalonians had not held fast his oral instructions but had suffered themselves to be imposed upon by pretended spirit-revelations, and words and letters pretending to be from Paul."
3. "Because the apostles' oral word was as trustworthy as their written word, it by no means follows that the oral word of those not apostles is as trustworthy as the written word of those who were apostles or inspired evangelists."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Stand fast - Amidst all the temptations which surround you."
2. "Hold the traditions which ye have been taught...any precept, doctrine, or law."
3. "This passage can furnish no authority for holding the 'traditions' which have come down from ancient times...We have all that is necessary for salvation in the written word."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Tradition, in the scriptural sense, may be either written or oral. It implies on the part of a teacher that he is not expressing his own ideas, but is delivering or handing over a message received from some one else."
2. "The prominent idea of tradition is therefore that of an authority external to the teacher."

### John Calvin:
1. "Our steadfastness and power of perseverance rest on nothing else than assurance of divine grace."
2. "The calling of God ought to fortify us against all occasions of offense in such a manner, that not even the entire ruin of the world shall shake, much less overthrow, our stability."
3. "For the matter treated of is the most important of all — that their faith may remain secure in the midst of a dreadful agitation of the Church."

2. "But human progress in all fields is made by use of the old, found to be true, in connection with the new if found to be true."

### John Gill:
1. "Stand fast in the doctrine of the Gospel in general, and in the article of Christ's second coming in particular, and not in the least waver about the thing itself, nor be shaken in mind, and troubled as if it was just at hand."
2. "Hold the traditions which ye have been taught: meaning the truths of the Gospel, which may be called traditions, because they are delivered from one to another."
3. "These doctrines, ordinances, and rules of discipline were communicated to them, both by word of mouth, when the apostles were in person among them, and by writing afterwards to them; for what the apostles delivered in the ministry of the word to the churches, they sent them in writing, that they might be a standing rule of faith and practice."

### John Wesley:
1. "Hold - Without adding to, or diminishing from, the traditions which ye have been taught - The truths which I have delivered to you."
2. "Whether by word or by our epistle - He preached before he wrote."
3. "And he had written concerning this in his former epistle."
