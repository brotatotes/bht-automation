### John Gill:
1. "And since they had such a share in the affection both of the Father and the Son, it need not to have been doubted but that what was prayed for would be granted."
2. "All true solid consolation is from God and Christ...and it is the gift of God, an instance of his grace and favour, and not a point of merit."
3. "Hope, as well as faith, is the gift of God, a free grace gift of his...and is what is sure and certain, and will never deceive, nor make ashamed."
