## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Comfort your hearts—unsettled as you have been through those who announced the immediate coming of the Lord."
2. "Good word and work—The oldest manuscripts invert the order, 'work and word.'"
3. "Establishment in these were what the young converts at Thessalonica needed, not fanatical teaching."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Thessalonians were in the midst of trials, and Paul prayed that they might have the full consolations of their religion." 
2. "The apostle Paul was inspired. He has recorded in this chapter a distinct prediction of an important series of events which were to occur at a future, and most of them at quite a remote period."
3. "The church is safe. It has now passed through every conceivable form of trial, and still survives, and is now more vigorous and flourishing than it ever was before."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Everlasting consolation. Everlasting, in contrast to all other comforts which are liable to come to an end, to be confronted with emergencies for which they are insufficient. The word ‘consolation’ here indicates not so much the act of consoling as the ground of comfort."
2. "Good hope. ‘Good, because of the pre-eminent excellence of the object of it, the impregnable basis on which it rests, and the purifying influence which it exerts in the heart and life.’"
3. "Comfort should result not only in the feeling of personal security, but in an unanxious and unselfish diligence in every good word and work. The energies which were frittered away in vain speculations and gloomy forebodings should now, when our future is provided for, be concentrated on the duty of the hour."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

3. "God is the God of comfort and strength."

### John Gill:
1. "Comfort your hearts by shedding abroad the love of Christ, and of the Father; by the discoveries of pardoning grace; by the application of Gospel promises; by the word and ordinances, which are breasts of consolation."
2. "Stablish you in every good word of God, or truth of the Gospel, which contains good tidings of good things, so as not to waver about them, or stagger in them, or to depart from them; in practice of every duty, so as to be steadfast, and immoveable, and always abounding therein."
3. "Good words and good works, principles and practices, should go together, and the saints stand in need of stability in both."
