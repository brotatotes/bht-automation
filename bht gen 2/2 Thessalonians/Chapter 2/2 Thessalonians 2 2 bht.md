# 2 Thessalonians 2:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let no supposed message or letter, claiming to be from me, shake your conviction in this matter. The Thessalonians had been deceived by false claims about the imminent return of the Lord, causing them to abandon their daily lives and indulge in irregular behavior. However, they were urged not to be easily swayed by such unfounded beliefs, prophecy, or even claims attributed to Paul. Instead, they were admonished to remain steadfast in their faith and not be unsettled or confused by these deceptive teachings.
