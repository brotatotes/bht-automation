# 2 Thessalonians 2:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Beware of false wisdom and interpretations that can lead to deception. The predicted falling away from true faith provides comfort for those witnessing disarray in the Church. The man of sin, whether a person or a kingdom under Satan's influence, is yet to be fully revealed. Certain events must occur before the second coming of Christ, so do not be swayed by claims of an imminent return. The man of sin exalts himself above all, opposing rightful authority and claiming divine prerogatives. It is not surprising, as he increases sin and opposes righteousness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The man of sin, in whom sin is as it were personified, as righteousness in Christ."
2. "He that withstands CHRIST, the ἀντί χριστος."
3. "The temple at Jerusalem: on account of the definiteness of the expression, ὁ ναὸς τοῦ θεοῦ, and on account of καθίσαι."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "the falling away," or "apostasy," namely, the one of which "I told you" before
2. The hindering power meanwhile restrains its manifestation; when that shall be removed, then this manifestation shall take place.
3. He is the son of perdition, as consigning many to it, and finally doomed to it himself.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The means for deception in the early Christian church consisted of a claim to uncommon wisdom in the interpretation of obscure prophecies of the Scriptures."
2. "The phrase 'the man of sin' may refer to a succession of men of the same general character, aiming at the accomplishment of the same plans."
3. "To no succession of men who have ever lived could the appellative 'the man of sin' be applied with so much propriety as to this [the papacy] succession."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Deceive [εξαπατηση] . Better beguile; since the word means not only making a false impression, but actually leading astray." 
2. "Falling away [αποστασια] . Only here and Acts 21:21. Comp. LXX, Joshua 22:22; 2 Chronicles 29:19."
3. "The man of sin - the son of perdition [ο ανθρωπος της ανομιας, ο υιος της απωλειας] . See on children of light, 1 Thessalonians 5:5."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul, accordingly, fortifies beforehand the minds, not merely of the Thessalonians, but of all the pious, that when the Church should come to be in a scattered condition, they might not be alarmed, as though it were a thing that was new and unlooked for."
2. "The weak, however, have something here on which to rest, when they learn that the unseemly state of matters which they behold in the Church was long since foretold."
3. "Paul, however, does not speak of one individual, but of a kingdom, that was to be taken possession of by Satan, that he might set up a seat of abomination in the midst of God’s temple — which we see accomplished in Popery."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Let no man deceive you by any means, either by professing superior enlightenment as if a spirit spoke through him, or by interpreting my words as if I had meant what he affirms."
2. "The man of sin. This title might appropriately be used of an element existing in many men, as Paul elsewhere speaks in that sense of 'the old man;' or it might be used as the designation of a class of men rather than of an individual, as we speak of 'the intemperate man;' but when we read on and find that all the expressions Paul uses regarding 'the man of sin' and his coming are not only personal but individual, we cannot but think he expected that the final outburst of evil would be headed by a personal Antichrist."
3. "Be revealed. Before Christ is revealed, Antichrist must first be revealed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is amazing how gullible some of the saints are when a new deceiver pulls off some stunts in religion."
2. "The meaning is clear. Hοτ is causal, because, but the verb is understood. The second coming not only is not 'imminent,' but will not take place before certain important things take place, a definite rebuff to the false enthusiasts."
3. "The terrible phrase, the son of perdition, is applied to Judas in John 17:12 (like Judas doomed to perdition), but here to the lawless one (ο ανομος, verse 2 Thessalonians 2:8), who is not Satan, but some one definite person who is doing the work of Satan."

### John Gill:
1. "By any of the above means; by pretending to a revelation from the Spirit; or to have had it from the mouth of anyone of the apostles; or to have a letter as from them, declaring the day of Christ to be instant; or by any other means whatever; do not be imposed upon by them for the following reasons"
2. "for there were things to be done before the coming of Christ, which were not then done, and which required time"
3. "this not of some Jews who professed faith in Christ, and departed from it, or of some Christians who went off to the Gnostics; but is to be understood of a more general defection in the times of the Papacy"

### John Wesley:
1. "He is, in an emphatical sense, the man of sin, as he increases all manner of sin above measure."
2. "He it is that opposeth himself to the emperor, once his rightful sovereign; and that exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped - Commanding angels, and putting kings under his feet, both of whom are called gods in scripture; claiming the highest power, the highest honour."
3. "So that he sitteth - Enthroned.In the temple of God — Mentioned Revelation 11:1.Declaring himself that he is God — Claiming the prerogatives which belong to God alone."
