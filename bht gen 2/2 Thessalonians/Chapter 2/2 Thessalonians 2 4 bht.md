# 2 Thessalonians 2:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The man of sin, the son of perdition, opposes God and all that is good. The papacy claims divine honors and exalts itself above every object of worship. The Pope, as Christ's vicar, claims higher honors than any ancient hero worship. The Church, meant to be a pillar of truth, has become a den of superstitions. Understanding the characteristics of Antichrist, such as the worship of humanity, helps us comprehend the final form of this opposing power. We must discern the claims of those who assume divine power and exalt themselves, as they embody the spirit of Antichrist.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The fourth and last world kingdom, under which we now live, shall have one final head, the concentrated embodiment of all the sin and lawless iniquity which have been in pagan and papal Rome."
2. "Anti-Christian tendencies produce different Antichrists: these separate Antichrists shall hereafter find their consummation in an individual exceeding them all in the intensity of his evil character."
3. "Antichrist shall exalt himself above every object of worship, whether on earth as the CÃ¦sar, or in heaven as God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "No Protestant will doubt that this has been the character of the papacy. The opposition of the general system to the gospel... are obvious illustrations of this."
2. "It cannot be supposed that any one would openly claim to be superior to God, but the sense must be, that the enactments and ordinances of the 'man of sin' would pertain to the province in which God only can legislate."
3. "The Pope has claimed higher honors, as the vicegerent of Christ, than was ever rendered in the ancient 'hero worship.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "That is called God [Î»ÎµÎ³Î¿Î¼ÎµÎ½Î¿Î½ Î¸ÎµÎ¿Î½] . Above the true God and the false gods."
2. "The opposer claims divine honors for himself."
3. "Shewing [Î±Ï€Î¿Î´ÎµÎ¹ÎºÎ½Ï…Î½Ï„Î±] . Publicly asserting divine dignity."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul, however, now draws, as if in a picture, a striking likeness of Antichrist; for it may be easily gathered from these words what is the nature of his kingdom, and in what things it consists."
2. "Now, every one that has learned from Scripture what are the things that more especially belong to God, and will, on the other hand, observe what the Pope claims for himself â€” though he were but a boy of ten years of age â€” will have no great difficulty in recognizing Antichrist."
3. "But it is asked, how the Church is represented as the den of so many superstitions, while it was destined to be the pillar of the truth? I answer, that it is thus represented, not on the ground of its retaining all the qualities of the Church, but because it has something of it remaining."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Who opposeth who is the adversary of God and all that is good."
2. "The phrase will best be understood by referring to Daniel 11:0."
3. "If in our own day we look for a type of Antichrist which may help us to understand what the final form may be, we see at least this characteristic fulfilled in the Positivist worship of humanity."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This participial clause is in apposition with the two preceding phrases, the man of sin, the son of perdition." 
2. "Caius Caligula had made a desperate attempt to have his statue set up for worship in the Temple in Jerusalem. This incident may lie behind Paul's language here."
3. "Caligula claimed to be God. Moffatt doubts if Paul is identifying this deception with the imperial cultus at this stage."

### John Gill:
1. "Who opposes him in his kingly office, styling himself the head and spouse of the church, assuming to himself all power in heaven and in earth."
2. "Antichrist would exalt himself above all the gods of the Gentiles, who are only nominally, and not by nature, gods... this haughty creature antichrist assumes to himself all power, both in heaven, earth, and hell."
3. "He sits, and has homage done him by his creatures, as if he was a god, and is not only styled Christ's vicar, but a god on earth, and our Lord God the Pope."
