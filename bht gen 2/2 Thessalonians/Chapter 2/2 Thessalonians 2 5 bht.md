# 2 Thessalonians 2:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Thessalonians had received the powerful Gospel message from the apostle Paul, who had faithfully taught them about the coming of Christ when he was with them. Yet, there was a surprising forgetfulness among them, as if they had lightly regarded what they had been previously taught. Paul's doctrine was consistent and unchanging, so there was no reason for them to be shaken by other teachings. It is a reminder that we should not be easily swayed, but rather hold firm to the truth we have received.
