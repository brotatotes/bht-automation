### Henry Alford:

3. "The removal of the withholding power will be when the civil polity, derived from the Roman empire, which is to be, in its last form, divided into ten kingdoms, shall yield to the prevalent godless 'lawlessness' with 'the lawless one' as its embodiment."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The obvious meaning of this would be, that, when the apostle wrote, there was a tendency to what would occur under the great apostasy, and that this would soon develop itself if it were not restrained."
2. "It is not known precisely what is referred to by the phrase 'what withholdeth,' τὸ κατέχον to katechon. The phrase means properly, something that 'holds back,' or 'restrains.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If we turn to our Lord’s discourse, the only thing to which such power is ascribed is the purpose of God that the Gospel should first be preached for a witness unto all nations, before the end come." 
2. "It is to be observed, however, that the expression so rendered in the Authorised Version is equally applicable to a voluntary withdrawal; indeed, it was not an unusual expression among the Greeks for declining battle." 
3. "The purpose contemplated by God in thus restraining the man of sin was that he might not be revealed before his appointed time."
