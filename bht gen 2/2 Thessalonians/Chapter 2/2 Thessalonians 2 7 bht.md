# 2 Thessalonians 2:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The hidden influence of wickedness, working in opposition to godliness, is already at play, laying the foundations of false teachings within the church. This mystery of iniquity is not solely limited to the Roman Catholic Church, but extends to other religious groups as well. The rise of this iniquity brings about practices such as the admiration of celibacy and virginity, the despising of authority, and the introduction of idolatry and bloodshed. It is through the addition to and distortion of God's Word that this dark power finds its full expression.
