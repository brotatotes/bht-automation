# 2 Thessalonians 2:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The coming of Antichrist is marked by deceit and the working of Satan, evident through the false power, signs, and wonders he displays. Antichrist seeks to imitate Christ's works as a sign of divinity, but these are simply signs and wonders of a lie. Just as Christ's miracles were done by the power of God, Satan also attempts to draw people away from the truth through counterfeit miracles. Antichrist's teachings are filled with hypocrisy and lies, leading astray those who are not rooted in the true gospel.
