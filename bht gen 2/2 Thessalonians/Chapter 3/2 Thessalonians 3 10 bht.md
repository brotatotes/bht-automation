# 2 Thessalonians 3:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If any would not work, neither should he eat. This proverbial expression, used by Paul, highlights the principle that idleness and laziness should not be supported. The Jewish tradition and the gathering of manna in the Scriptures emphasize the importance of labor and productivity. This extends to all who are able to work for a living but refuse to do so. The responsibility lies with the individuals themselves to contribute to their own sustenance and not rely on the support of others. Therefore, it is just and reasonable to withhold assistance to those who are unwilling to work.
