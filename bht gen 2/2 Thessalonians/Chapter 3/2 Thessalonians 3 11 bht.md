# 2 Thessalonians 3:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Idleness leads to a dangerous path of busyness in other people's affairs, as those who have nothing to occupy their own time often meddle with the business of others. This behavior is not only unproductive but also disruptive, causing unnecessary trouble and diverting attention away from one's own responsibilities. These idle busybodies can become a source of annoyance and division in communities, churches, and even personal relationships, ultimately reflecting poorly on human nature. It is important to recognize the importance of productive work, as avoiding it can lead to a negative impact on societies and individuals alike.
