The exhortation is directed towards those who have erred, urging them to consider the consequences they have earned. The emphasis is on cultivating repose within one's sphere of influence and avoiding restlessness. It is also essential to be content with what one has and to refrain from being oppressive or unreasonable. By working diligently and quietly within their calling, individuals can contribute to a peaceful and harmonious community.
