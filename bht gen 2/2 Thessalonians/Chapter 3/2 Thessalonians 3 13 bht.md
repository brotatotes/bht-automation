# 2 Thessalonians 3:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Be diligent and steadfast in doing good, whether it is in acts of charity or in any other good work. Do not let the laziness or disorderliness of others discourage you from helping them. Though you may encounter ingratitude or difficult behavior from those you help, do not become weary or lose heart, for doing good is pleasing in the sight of God. Remember that your good deeds are to be done in faith, love, and obedience to God, seeking His glory above all else.
