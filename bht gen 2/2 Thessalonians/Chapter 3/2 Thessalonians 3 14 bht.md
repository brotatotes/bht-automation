### Albert Barnes:

1. "Note that man. This does not mean, set a mark upon that man; but merely, take note of him in your own minds."

3. "At first sight the term employed might seem to indicate only the avoidance of intercourse in business and social life with the offender, and not the extreme ecclesiastical censure of excommunication. It might seem to be advice given rather to guide individuals in their treatment of the offender, than to guide the church."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Condition of the first class, with negative ου, assuming it to be true."
2. "Put a tag on that man. Here only in N.T."
3. "The idea is to have one's thoughts turned in on oneself."

### John Gill:
1. "And the clause here respects the notice the church should take of such a person; not in a private way, or merely by way of admonition and reproof, such as is given before rejection from communion; but by the black mark of excommunication."
2. "Lay him under censure, exclude him from your communion, put a brand upon him as a scabbed sheep, and separate him from the flock."
3. "That he may have his eyes turned in him, as the word signifies, and he may be brought to a sight and sense of his sin, and be filled with shame for it, and loath it, and himself on the account of it, and truly repent of it, and forsake it."

### John Wesley:
1. Have no company with him — No intimacy, no familiarity, no needless correspondence.
