# 2 Thessalonians 3:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When dealing with a fellow believer who has erred, it is important to approach them with love and gentleness, not as an enemy seeking to destroy them. Instead of shunning them without explanation, we are called to admonish them as a brother, speaking to them with empathy, meekness, and tenderness. The goal of this admonition is not simply to condemn, but to lovingly restore the erring brother or sister to a place of reconciliation and fellowship within the church community. In doing so, we demonstrate the true meaning of brotherly love and seek their repentance and restoration.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We are not to deal with a man as an adversary over whom we are to seek to gain a victory, but as an erring brother - a brother still, though he errs."
2. "There is great danger that when we undertake the work of discipline we shall forget that he who is the subject of it is a brother, and that we shall regard and treat him as an enemy."
3. "All is kind, and gentle, though firm; the offender is a man and a brother still; he is to be followed with tender sympathy and prayer, and the hearts and the arms of the Christian brotherhood are to be open to receive him again when he gives any evidence of repenting."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "We must observe, however, by what sign he would have brotherly love shewn — not by allurements or flattery, but by admonitions; for in this way it will be, that all that will not be incurable will feel that concern is felt for their welfare."
2. "Excommunication does not tend to drive men from the Lord’s flock, but rather to bring them back when wandering and going astray."
3. "Excommunication is distinguished from anathema: for as to those that the Church marks out by the severity of its censure, Paul admonishes that they should not be utterly cast away, as if they were cut off from all hope of salvation; but endeavors must be used, that they may be brought back to a sound mind."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Though deprived, as we say, of church privileges, and shut out from fellowship with the members of the church, he was not to be counted hopeless."

2. "Few things in our churches are more difficult of wise execution than the discipline of erring members."
3. "The word εχθρος is an adjective, hateful, from εχθος, hate. It can be passive, hated, as in Romans 11:28, but is usually active, hostile, enemy, foe."

### John Gill:
1. "Nor deal with him in an hostile, fierce, furious, and passionate manner, as if you were seeking his destruction, and not his restoration."
2. "Admonish, or 'reprove' him as a brother; as one that has been called a brother... and therefore should not be treated in a virulent manner, but with a brotherly affection, meekness, compassion, and tenderness."
3. "The church... should inquire, and diligently observe, what effect the ordinance of excommunication has upon them, and renew their admonitions and friendly reproofs, if possible, to recover them."

### John Wesley:
1. Admonish him as a brother — Tell him lovingly of the reason why you shun him.
