# 2 Thessalonians 3:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The opening salutation of Paul's epistle is signed with mine own hand, indicating that while the body of the letter was dictated, this personal touch was added by the apostle himself. This signature serves as a token, distinguishing his genuine epistles from any potential forgeries. By including this distinguishing mark, Paul gives reassurance to the readers that they can trust the authenticity of his words and not be troubled by any false teachings or counterfeit letters that may have been circulated among them.
