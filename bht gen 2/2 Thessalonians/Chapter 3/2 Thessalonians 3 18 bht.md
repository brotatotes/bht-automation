# 2 Thessalonians 3:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He concludes his Epistles by praying for grace to all, adding the amen as a response from the congregation after hearing the Epistle read. The subscription at the end claiming the Epistle was written from Athens should be disregarded, as it is more likely to have been written from Corinth. This concluding prayer for grace, with its accompanying amen, serves as a sign or token of the shared benediction, extending grace to all recipients of the Epistle.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He closes every Epistle by praying for GRACE to those whom he addresses."
2. "Amenâ€”omitted in the oldest manuscripts. It was doubtless the response of the congregation after hearing the Epistle read publicly; hence it crept into copies."
3. "The Subscription is spurious, as the Epistle was written not 'from Athens,' but from Corinth."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all." - See the notes, Romans 16:20.

3. "At all events, this subscription is of no authority." - See the notes at the end of the Epistles to the Romans and 1 Corinthians.
