# 2 Thessalonians 3:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle is praying to be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men, who were constant adversaries, stirring up trouble and opposition wherever he went. It is important to remember that not all men have faith, and those who do not may exhibit unreasonable and wicked behavior. This highlights the reality that not everyone who professes to believe actually possesses true faith.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is obvious that the key to the answer will be found in Acts 18:0."
2. "They were the Jews at Corinth, who were at that time the especial adversaries of the Apostle and his preaching."
3. "To all men the (Christian) faith does not belong all men do not receive it have no receptivity for it obviously pointing at Jews by this description."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "That we...be delivered from unreasonable...men." 
2. "An undesigned coincidence with Acts 18:12-17." 
3. "The Thessalonians...might think 'all' would similarly receive it; but the Jews were far from having such a readiness to believe the truth."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They had a distorted vision of the value of objects, and in tenacious adherence to their own views...they presented a constant obstruction to the true gospel." 
2. "People often have a hobby. They give more importance to some object than it deserves. They, therefore, undervalue other objects; press their own with improper zeal; denounce others who do not feel the same interest in them which they do."
3. "The state of mind in which the apostle was when he wrote this, seems to have been this: He recollected the readiness with which the Thessalonians had embraced the gospel, and the firmness with which they held it, and seems to suppose that they would imagine the same thing must be found true everywhere. But he says all people have not the same faith; all were not prepared cordially and fully to embrace the gospel."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Unreasonable [ατοπων] . See on Luke 23:41, and comp. Acts 25:5; Acts 28:6. In LXX in a moral sense, iniquitous, Job 4:8; Job 11:11; Job 34:12."
2. "The word originally means out of place."
3. "All men have not faith. See on Acts 6:7; Galatians 1:28."

### John Calvin:
1. "He means, however, deliverance, so that he may come off victorious, whether by life or by death."
2. "Paul simply says that all that make a profession of faith are not such in reality."
3. "For we shall not merely inflict injury upon pious teachers, if we have doubts as to their fidelity, whenever domestic enemies do them harm, but our faith will from time to time waver, unless we keep in mind that among those who boast of the name of Christians there are many that are treacherous."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To find here [as Jowett does] a mere shrinking of the flesh on the part of the apostle from the dangers that awaited him, is to assign to the apostle a character that never belonged to him."
2. "We need not scruple to ascribe to the apostle so much apprehension of danger as would prompt him to ask the Thessalonians to pray for his deliverance."
3. "Wherever the Gospel is preached, it meets with such opposition as Paul speaks of, for not all accept it. It always sifts a community and marks off a remnant, large or small, who do not believe, the perverse and wicked men."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "First aorist passive subjunctive of ρυομα, old verb to rescue." 
2. "Originally in the old Greek ατοπος (α privative and τοπος) is out of place, odd, unbecoming, perverse, outrageous, both of things and persons."
3. "Πονηρος is from πονεω, to work (πονος), looking on labour as an annoyance, bad, evil."

### John Gill:
1. "And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men... who were the implacable and constant adversaries of the apostle... who often lay in wait for him, and opposed him, and gave him trouble in all places, stirring up the people against him" (Commentary, point 1).
2. "for all men have not faith... all mankind have it not, none but Christ's sheep" (Commentary, point 2).
3. "rather the true sense of the words is, that all that are professors of religion, and members of churches, and even all that are preachers of the word, have not faith... they may have an historical and temporary faith and the faith of miracles, and even all faith but the true faith; they may profess to believe, and yet not believe" (Commentary, point 3).

### John Wesley:
1. All men have not faith — And all men who have not are more or less unreasonable and wicked men.
