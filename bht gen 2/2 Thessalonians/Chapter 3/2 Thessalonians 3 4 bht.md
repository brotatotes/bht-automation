# 2 Thessalonians 3:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The basis of our confidence regarding others should not rest in themselves, but in the Lord. This trust in the Lord is what gives our expectation the power to not only encourage, but also inspire hope. Such confidence in the Lord serves as both an exhortation and a hopeful exhortation.
