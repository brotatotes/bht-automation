# 2 Thessalonians 3:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Whoever takes it upon themselves to receive, refuse, or cast out members should be cautious, for this is reminiscent of Diotrephes. The term disorderly refers specifically to those who walk in a manner that lacks diligence and work ethic. They are not following the admonitions given by Paul, either in person or in his previous letter. It is important for every member, regardless of gender, to adhere to the traditions and teachings received from the apostles.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The παράδοσις refers to the oral instruction which the Apostle had given them when he was present, and subsequently confirmed by writing."
2. "στέλλεσθαι] lit. ‘to take in, or shorten sail:’ ἱστία μὲν στείλαντο, θέσαν δʼ ἐν νηῒ μελαίνῃ, Il. α. 433: hence, to draw in or shorten, generally: πότερά σοι παῤῥησίᾳ | φράσω τὰ κεῖθεν, ἢ λόγον στειλώμεθα, Eur. Bacch. 625; to conceal: ἐβουλεύετο μὲν στέλλεσθαι, οὐ μὴν ἠδύνατό γε κρύπτειν τὸ γεγονός, Polyb. Frag. hist. 39."


### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Hereby he puts to a particular test their obedience in general to his commands..."
2. "He had enjoined mild censure of such in 2 Thessalonians 3:14-15, 'Warn... the unruly'; but now that the mischief had become more confirmed, he enjoins stricter discipline, namely, withdrawal from their company."
3. "Paul plainly would not have sanctioned the order of Mendicant Friars, who reduce such a 'disorderly' and lazy life to a system. Call it not an order, but a burden to the community."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It became, therefore, necessary to use the strong language of command, as he does here, and to require that if they would not work, the church should withdraw from them."
2. "The effect of the expectation of the speedy appearing of the Lord Jesus has always been to induce men to neglect their worldly affairs, and to lead idle lives."
3. "This is the true notion of Christian discipline. It is not primarily that of cutting a man off, or denouncing him, or excommunicating him; it is that of withdrawing from him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Withdraw yourselves from... to place one's self away from." 
2. "Disorderly. This adverb... found only in Paul, and only in the Thessalonian Epistles."

### John Calvin:
1. "He forbids that their indolence should be encouraged by indulgence, and teaches that those live holily who procure for themselves the necessaries of life by honorable and useful labor."
2. "For this truly is disorder - not considering for what purpose we were made, and regulating our life with a view to that end, while it is only when we live according to the rule prescribed to us by God that this life is duly regulated."
3. "For doctrine obtains much more of credit and authority, when we impose upon others no other burden than we take upon ourselves."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The exhortations of the former Epistle are repeated and expanded with more studied distinctness of language."
2. "The injunction to withdraw or separate is given not to the presbyters or office-bearers, but to the whole church."
3. "There were some in Thessalonica who had merely caught the new phrases...and lived upon the kindness of their brethren."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Name (ονομα) here for authority of Jesus Christ." 
2. "Paul wishes his readers to realize the responsibility on them for their obedience to his command." 
3. "He calls him 'brother' still. The adverb ατακτως is common in Plato and is here and verse 2 Thessalonians 3:11 alone in the N.T., though the adjective ατακτος, equally common in Plato we had in 1 Thessalonians 5:14 which see. Military term, out of ranks."

### John Gill:
1. "whoever therefore take upon them to receive, or refuse, or cast out members of themselves, and at their own pleasure, act the part of Diotrephes"
