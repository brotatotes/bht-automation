# 2 Thessalonians 3:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For you know how to follow us, the apostles, who have set a model for your imitation. We urge you not to live in a disorderly manner, which would bring about disunity and discontent. As our spiritual fathers and guides, it is only fitting that you imitate our way of life, for we have conducted ourselves in a manner that is holy, just, and blameless among you. We have not lived idly or inactively, but have diligently served and ministered to you.
