# 2 Thessalonians 3:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul and his companions, instead of relying on others for their sustenance, chose to pay for their own meals and work diligently to support themselves. Their intention was to avoid any false charges and make it clear that they were financially independent. They not only preached tirelessly but also labored with their hands, allowing them to sustain themselves and ensure that their focus remained on spreading the Gospel without being a burden to others.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἄρτον ἐφάγομεν, a Hebraistic expression for 'got our sustenance:' παρά τινος, 'at any one's expense,' from any one as a gift: there seems to be an allusion in the construction to the original sense of δωρεάν."
2. "ἐργαζόμ. belongs to ἄρτον ἐφ. as a contrast to δωρεάν: but by working, &c. The sentence may also be taken as De W. and Ellic., regarding ἐν κόπῳ κ. μόχ. as the contrast to δωρεάν, and ἐργαζ. νύκτ. κ. ἡμ. as a parallel clause to ἐν κόπ. κ. μόχ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "They preached gratuitously though they might have claimed maintenance from their converts."
2. "night and day—scarcely allowing time for repose."
3. "His reason for the same course at Corinth was to mark how different were his aims from those of the false teachers who sought their own lucre."

### Albert Barnes:

3. "In fact, labored for our own support."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Any man's bread. For nought. The word is a noun, meaning a gift."
2. "The accusative often adverbially as here; as a gift, gratis."
3. "Labor and travail. Be chargeable. By depending upon them for pecuniary support."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He lodged with Jason, but did not receive his meals gratis, for he paid for them."
2. "Paul had to make his financial independence clear to avoid false charges which were made in spite of all his efforts."
3. "To eat bread is merely a Hebraism for eat."

### John Gill:
1. "He signifies, that what they ate, they bought with their own money, and lived on no man, without giving him a valuable consideration for what they had."
2. "Not only laboriously preaching the Gospel to them, as often as they could have opportunity, but working very hard and incessantly with their hands."
