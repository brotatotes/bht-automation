# 2 Thessalonians 3:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Ministers, like Paul, had the power to claim support, but they chose not to fully exercise this right. They did not want idle individuals to eat at the expense of others, nor did they want to hurt other ministers who couldn't support themselves. By not demanding full support, ministers set an example of preserving their independence and avoiding misunderstanding. They sought to have the means to exercise charity and to demonstrate selflessness to others. Therefore, they made themselves an example to follow, showing the importance of balancing personal rights with consideration for the well-being of the community.
