## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I suffer even these things" - the sufferings attendant on my being a prisoner.
2. "I know whom I have believed" - I know what a faithful, promise-keeping God He is. It is not, I know how I have believed, but, I know WHOM I have believed; a feeble faith may clasp a strong Saviour.
3. "That which I have committed unto him" - the body, soul, and spirit, which I have deposited in God's safe keeping. So Christ Himself in dying.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "For the which cause I also suffer these things - That is, I suffer on account of my purpose to carry the gospel to the Gentiles... Nevertheless I am not ashamed."
2. "For I know whom I have believed - Margin, 'trusted.' The idea is, that he understood the character of that Redeemer to whom he had committed his eternal interests, and knew that he had no reason to be ashamed of confiding in him."
3. "And am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him - That is, the soul, with all its immortal interests. A man has nothing of higher value to intrust to another than the interests of his soul, and there is no other act of confidence like that in which he intrusts the keeping of that soul to the Son of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The meaning of the passage is that Paul is convinced that God is strong to enable him to be faithful to his apostolic calling, in spite of the sufferings which attend it, until the day when he shall be summoned to render his final account."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is an inconceivable consolation, when we are able to bring a good conscience in opposition to the unjust judgments of men."
2. "Faith, therefore, neither leans on the authority of men, nor rests on God, in such a manner as to hesitate, but must be joined with knowledge."
3. "Let us always remember that Paul does not pursue philosophical speculations in the shade, but, having the reality before his eyes, solemnly declares, how highly valuable is a confident hope of eternal life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He assumes that the things of which he speaks are known to Timothy." 
2. "The analogy of the word ‘keep,’ however, as applied to God, is in favour of the former construction."
