He is urged to preserve the pattern of sound words as a model of pure, wholesome doctrine, avoiding any misrepresentation or alteration. These words go beyond mere literal expressions, encompassing essential Christian teachings such as the Trinity, the nature of Christ, righteousness, and atonement. Timothy is encouraged to grasp and cling to these teachings, keeping them alive in his ministry, and holding fast to the faith and love that are found in Christ Jesus.
