# 2 Timothy 1:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
All the believers who were in Asia, those who had once accompanied Paul in Rome, had turned away from him. It was a heartbreaking moment for Paul, the aged and faithful soldier of Christ, now imprisoned. This trial was reserved for a time when he was nearing the end of his earthly journey, on the borders of immortality. It is a reminder of the trials faced by other faithful servants of God, like Francis Xavier, the apostle of the Indies, who was forsaken by all and died alone in a cottage.
