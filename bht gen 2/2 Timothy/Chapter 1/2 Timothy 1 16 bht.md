### Albert Barnes:

2. "He was himself still living 2 Timothy 1:18, but not improbably then absent from his home."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Refreshed [ανεψυζεν] . N. T. o. Several times in LXX; often in Class. Anayuxiv refreshing, Acts 3:19; and katayucein to cool, Luke 16:24. Originally to cool; to revive by fresh air."
2. "Chain [αλυσιν] . Once in Paul, Ephesians 6:20. Several times in Mark, Luke, and Acts. It may mean handcuffs or manacles (see Lightfoot, Philippians, ed. of 1896, page 8), but is not limited to that sense either in classical or later Greek."
3. "See Hdt 9:74; Eurip. Orest. 984. Mark 5:4 is not decisive."

### John Calvin:
1. "From this prayer we infer, that the good offices done to the saints are not thrown away, even though they cannot recompense them; for, when he prays to God to reward them, this carries in it the force of a promise."
2. "To the family of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me... hence we infer that 'the blessing of God rests, not only on the head of the righteous man,' but on all his house. So great is the love of God toward his people, that it diffuses itself over all who are connected with them."
3. "This is a proof, not only of his liberality, but likewise of his zeal; seeing that he cheerfully exposed himself to danger and to the reproach of men, in order to assist Paul."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The expression 'to the house of Onesiphorus,' suggests, though it cannot be said to prove, the supposition that he himself was dead."
2. "Acts of kindness were to the heart of St. Paul as a cool breeze in the parching heat, as water to the thirsty, as the shadow of a rock in a weary land."
3. "The word is obviously chosen to remind Timothy of the weakness which had made St. Paul's entreaty in 2 Timothy 1:3 a painful necessity."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Grant mercy (δωιη ελεος). The phrase nowhere else in the N.T. Second aorist active optative of διδωμ, the usual form being δοιη. This is the usual construction in a wish about the future."
2. "For he oft refreshed me (οτ πολλακις με ανεψυξεν). First aorist active indicative of αναψυχω, old verb, to cool again, in LXX and Koine often, here only in N.T., but αναψυξις in Acts 3:20. In the first imprisonment or the second. If he lost his life for coming to see Paul, it was probably recently during this imprisonment."
3. "Was not ashamed of my chain (αλυσιν μου ουκ επαισχυνθη). Passive deponent again (first aorist indicative) with accusative as in 2 Timothy 1:8. For αλυσιν (chain) see Ephesians 6:20. Note absence of augment in επαισχυνθη."

### John Gill:
1. "He oft refreshed me; both with his Christian visits, and spiritual conversation, which to the apostle, in the heat of his affliction and persecution, were like a fan in hot weather, cooling and reviving."
2. "He answered to his name, which signifies, 'one that brings profit': he is said to be one of the seventy disciples."
3. "Onesiphorus was not ashamed of the apostle, though he was bound with a chain; nor was he ashamed of the cause for which he suffered: and the apostle proposes him to Timothy, as an example worthy of imitation, in those times of defection."

### John Wesley:
1. The family of Onesiphorus — As well as himself.Hath often refreshed me — Both at Ephesus and Rome.
