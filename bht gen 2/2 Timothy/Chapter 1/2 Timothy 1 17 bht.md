# 2 Timothy 1:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Onesiphorus was relentless in his search for me in Rome, going from place to place until he found me. His determination is evident in how diligently he sought me out, even at the risk of his own safety. Despite the challenges of locating me in a city as busy as Rome, Onesiphorus was able to discover my lodging, where I was being kept by a soldier. His efforts were not in vain, for he ultimately found me and provided comfort during my time of need.
