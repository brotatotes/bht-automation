## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "May the Lord grant to him to find mercy from the Lord...in that day" (see on 2Ti 1:12)
2. "And how many services he did (to me: or, to the saints: the general expression will admit of either) in Ephesus"
3. "Thou knowest well (the comparative is not for the positive, here or any where: but the signification is, ‘better, than that I need remind thee’)"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "the Lord—who rewards a kindness done to His disciples as if done to Himself"
2. "in how many things—how many acts of ministry he rendered"
3. "very well—rather as Greek, 'Thou knowest better'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day - The day of judgment; notes at 2 Timothy 1:12. This proves that Onesiphorus was then alive, as Paul would not offer prayer for him if he was dead."
2. "Yet his mind is calm, and his faith in the gospel is unshaken. He expresses no regret that he had embraced the gospel; no sorrow that he had been so zealous in it as to bring these calamities upon himself."
3. "In the general apostasy, the turning away of those on whom he might have relied, it is refreshing and interesting, to find mention made of one unshaken friend; 2 Timothy 1:16. He never swerved in his affections. He had been kind to him in former years of comparative honor, and he did not leave him now in the dark day of adversity."

### Philip Schaff:

1. "By 'mercy', he means the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life; or that crown of righteousness and everlasting glory and happiness, which will be a grant from the Lord, or a free gift through Jesus Christ; the effect of pure grace and mercy, and not of merit."
2. "The apostle does not propose to requite him himself; he knew it was out of his power; but he had an interest in the Lord, and at the throne of grace; and he makes use of that in his favour, and prays the Lord that he might find mercy of him."
