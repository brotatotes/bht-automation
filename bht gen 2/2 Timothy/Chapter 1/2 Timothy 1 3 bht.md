## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He does not mean to put on the same footing the Jewish and Christian service of God; but simply to assert his own conscientious service of God as he had received it from his progenitors."
2. "Not only Paul, but the Jews who reject Christ, forsake the faith of their forefathers, who looked for Christ; when they accept Him, the hearts of the children shall only be returning to the faith of their forefathers."
3. "The cause of Paul's feeling thankful is, not that he remembers Timothy unceasingly in his prayers, but for what Timothy is in faith and graces."

### Albert Barnes:

3. "The religion of the Old Testament and the New is essentially the same."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "I thank God whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, as there goes along with my prayers an unceasing remembrance of thee, and a daily and nightly longing, as I recall thy tears, to see thee, that I may be filled with joy - I thank God, I say, for that I have been reminded of the unfeigned faith that is in thee."

Night and day [νυκτος και ημερας] . See 1 Timothy 5:5. The phrase in Paul, 1 Thessalonians 2:9; 1 Thessalonians 3:10; 2 Thessalonians 3:8. Const. with greatly desiring.

2. "With a pure conscience. This was the point in the past on which St. Paul dwelt with an ever-increasing thankfulness."
