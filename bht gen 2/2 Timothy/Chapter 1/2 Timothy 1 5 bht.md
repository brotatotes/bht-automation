# 2 Timothy 1:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Timothy's faith is described as sincere and authentic, implanted in his heart by the Spirit of God. This faith also dwelt in his mother and grandmother, continuing with them until the end. It is not a fleeting or temporary faith but a settled and abiding grace, a gift from God that is irrevocable. It is a reminder and inspiration for Timothy to remain steadfast in his own faith, not to degenerate from himself and his ancestors, and to advance in his Christian journey.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The oldest manuscripts read, 'When I called to remembrance'; implying that some recent incident (perhaps the contrasted cowardice of the hypocrite Demas, who forsook him) had reminded him of the sincerity of Timothy's faith."
2. "The faith of the one parent sanctified the child. She was probably converted at Paul's first visit to Lystra."
3. "The mention of the faith of his mother and grandmother is designed as an incentive to stir up his faith."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The 'undesigned coincidence' furnishes an argument for the authenticity of both." 
2. "This shows that Paul was acquainted with the family, and that the statement in the Epistle to Timothy was not forged from the account in the Acts."
3. "But the piety of his mother alone is commended, and it is fairly implied that his father was not a believer."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The writer's thought is probably not confined to Christian faith, but has in view the continuity of Judaism and Christianity."
2. "According to Paul, Christians are or stand in faith; but faith is not represented as dwelling in them."
3. "The writer merely means that faith had already dwelt in Timothy's grandmother and mother before it did in him."

### John Calvin:
1. "When one has begun well and valiantly, the progress he has made should encourage him to advance, and domestic examples are powerful excitements to urge him forward."
2. "By this godly education, therefore, Timothy is admonished not to degenerate from himself and from his ancestors."
3. "Timothy, from his childhood, while he had not yet obtained a knowledge of the gospel, was imbued with the fear of God, and with such faith as proved to be a living seed, which afterwards manifested itself."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Warm as the words sound, there is just the shadow of a misgiving in them." 
2. "His remembrance of their piety had helped him. A like remembrance might help his disciple."
3. "The Greek ‘but’ suggests a mental contrast in the slight misgiving implied in ‘I am persuaded.’"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Having been reminded (υπομνησιν λαβων). "Having received a reminder."
2. "A reminder by another while αναμνησις remembrance (1 Corinthians 11:24) is rather a recalling by oneself."
3. "I am persuaded (πεπεισμα). Perfect passive indicative of πειθω, 'I stand persuaded.'"

### John Gill:
1. "This is to be understood of the grace of faith, which was implanted in the heart of Timothy by the Spirit of God, and was genuine and sincere."
2. "And which dwelt in her, and continued with her to the last."
3. "For true faith is an abiding grace, it is a gift of God, that is irrevocable, and without repentance."

### John Wesley:
1. "Which dwelt — A word not applied to a transient guest, but only to a settled inhabitant." 
2. "First — Probably this was before Timothy was born, yet not beyond St. Paul's memory."
