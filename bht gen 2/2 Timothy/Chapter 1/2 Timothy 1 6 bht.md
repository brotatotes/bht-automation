## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For which cause"‚Äînamely, because thou hast inherited, didst once possess, and I trust ("am persuaded") still dost possess, such unfeigned faith [ALFORD].
2. "Stir up"‚Äîliterally, "rekindle," "revive the spark of"; the opposite of "quench" or "extinguish" (2 Timothy 1:6). Paul does not doubt the existence of real faith in Timothy, but he desires it to be put into active exercise. Timothy seems to have become somewhat remiss from being so long without Paul (2 Timothy 2:22).
3. "Gift of God"‚Äîthe spiritual grace received for his ministerial office, imparting fearlessness, power, love, and a sound mind (2 Timothy 1:7).

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The idea is, that Timothy was to use all proper means to keep the flame of pure religion in the soul burning..."
2. "However rich the gifts which God has bestowed upon us, they do not grow of their own accord, but need to be cultivated by our own personal care."
3. "It is such an expression as an aged Presbyterian, or Congregational, or Baptist minister would address to a son whom he had assisted to ordain. Nothing would be more natural than to remind him that his own hands had been laid on him when he was set apart to the work of the ministry."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "To stir or kindle the embers."
2. "The word is, therefore, figurative, to stir or kindle the embers."
3. "The gift of God."

### John Calvin:
1. "The more abundantly that Timothy had received the grace of God, the more attentive (the Apostle intimates) he ought to be in making progress from day to day."
2. "We ought, therefore, on the other hand, to strive to bring to perfection everything that is good in us, and to kindle what is languid."
3. "Let us therefore remember that we ought to apply to use the gifts of God, lest, being unemployed and concealed, they gather rust."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is necessary to remind the disciple, shrinking from danger or worry, to 'stir up' (literally, 'to rekindle') the gift of God."
2. "The gifts [are] connected with his own imposition of hands rather than with that of the presbyters who assisted him."
3. "The passage is not without interest as bearing on the sacramental language of the Church. The outward sign was not only a symbol, but an instrument of the spiritual gift."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For which cause," stronger than Œ¥ŒπŒø. So in verse 2 Timothy 1:12; Titus 1:13. Only example of Œ±ŒπœÑŒπŒ± by Paul save in Acts 28:20.
2. Old compound to remind (1 Corinthians 4:17; 2 Corinthians 7:15).
3. Present active infinitive of Œ±ŒΩŒ±Œ∂œâœÄœÖœÅŒµœâ, old double compound (Œ±ŒΩŒ± and Œ∂œâœÄœÖœÅŒøŒΩ, live coal, Œ∂œâŒøœÇ and œÄœÖœÅ, then the bellows for kindling), to rekindle, to stir into flame, to keep blazing (continuous action, present time), only here in N.T.

### John Gill:
1. "Because of the great affection the apostle had for Timothy, and because of that confidence he had of him, that unfeigned faith dwelt in him..."
2. "By 'the gift' is meant his ministerial gift; for what qualifies men for the ministry, is not anything natural in them, nor acquired by them, but what is given unto them, and that of God..."
3. "There is in the word used a metaphor taken from coals of fire covered with ashes, as if almost extinct, and need to be blown up into a flame, and a very apt one it is..."

### John Wesley:
1. "I remind thee of stirring up - literally, blowing up the coals into a flame."
2. "The gift of God - all the spiritual gifts, which the grace of God has given thee."
