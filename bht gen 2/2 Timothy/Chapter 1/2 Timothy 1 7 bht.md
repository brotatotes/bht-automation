# 2 Timothy 1:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For God has not given us the spirit of fear, but of power, love, and a sound mind. The spirit we have been given as Christians is not one of cowardice, but one that empowers us to face any challenge with strength and boldness. Love is the central component that ties together power and sobriety, preventing us from the negative extremes of fearfulness and rashness. A sound mind, grounded in the principles of the Gospel, guides our actions and enables us to make wise decisions.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The spirit of power, as opposed to the weakness implied in cowardice."
2. "Love, as opposed to that false compliance with men, which shrinks from bold rebuke: that lofty self-abandonment of love for others, which will even sacrifice repute, and security, and all that belongs to self, in the noble struggle to do men good."
3. "Correction, the original meaning of σωφρονισμός, 'admonition of others that they may become σωφρ.,' τὸ σωφρονίζειν τινά, must be retained, as necessary both on account of that usage of the verb, and on account of the context."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For, c.—implying that Timothy needed the exhortation 'to stir up the gift of God in him,' being constitutionally 'timid': 'For God did not give us (so the Greek, namely, at our ordination or consecration) the spirit of fear.' The spirit which He gave us, was not the spirit of timidity (literally, 'cowardice,' which is weakness), but of 'power' (exhibited in a fearless 'testimony' for Christ)"
2. "Fear within exaggerates the causes of fear without. 'The spirit of power' is the spirit of man dwelt in by the Spirit of God imparting power; this power 'casteth out fear' from ourselves, and stimulates us to try to cast it out of others"
3. "love—which moves the believer while 'speaking the truth' with power, when giving his testimony for Christ, at the same time to do so 'in love'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The tendency of [love] is to 'cast out fear'... and to make the mind bold and constant."
2. "Nothing will do more to inspire courage, to make a man fearless of danger, or ready to endure privation and persecution, than 'love'."
3. "The state referred to here is that in which the mind is well balanced, and under right influences; in which it sees things in their just proportions and relations; in which it is not feverish and excited, but when everything is in its proper place."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Of power [δυναμεως]: Here, the power to overcome all obstacles and to face all dangers."
2. "Of love [αγαπης]: See on Galatians 5:22."
3. "Of a sound mind [σωφρονισμου]: Not self - control, but the faculty of generating it in others or in one's self, making them swfronev of sound mind."

### John Calvin:
1. "God governs his ministers by the Spirit of power, which is the opposite of cowardice."
2. "They who have slavish meanness and cowardice, so that they do not venture to do anything in defense of the truth, when it is necessary, are not governed by that Spirit by whom the servants of Christ are guided."
3. "It is God, therefore, who endues us with 'the spirit of power;' for they who, in other respects, give tokens of much strength, fall down in a moment, when they are not upheld by the power of the Divine Spirit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "God did not give the spirit of fear." 
2. "In the use of so strong a word, we trace the desire of the apostle to rouse Timothy from what seemed to him an undue timidity."
3. "A sound mind implies more than this, the gift of bringing others to the state so described; and it was in this that Timothy, with all his personal excellence, was defective."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A spirit of fearfulness...the human spirit as endowed by the Holy Spirit"

3. "Of love...one of the gifts of the Spirit...which drives out fear"

### John Gill:
1. "For God hath not given us the spirit of fear....but of power." 
2. "and of love; to God, and Christ, and his church, and which is a fruit of the Holy Spirit." 
3. "and of a sound mind: in the principles and doctrines of the Gospel; and which shows itself in a prudent conduct and behaviour."

### John Wesley:
1. "The spirit which God hath given us Christians, is not the spirit of fear - Or cowardice."
2. "Power and sobriety are two good extremes. Love is between, the tie and temperament of both; preventing the two bad extremes of fearfulness and rashness."
