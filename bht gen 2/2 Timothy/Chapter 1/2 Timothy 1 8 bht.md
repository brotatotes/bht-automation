# 2 Timothy 1:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do not be ashamed of testifying about the Gospel, as it is the message from Christ himself and encompasses his life, death, resurrection, and salvation. Anyone who is ashamed of the Gospel will be held accountable by Christ. Just as the Gospel itself represents suffering, the apostle encourages Timothy to bear the afflictions that come with preaching and professing the Gospel, knowing that the power of God overcomes all obstacles.
