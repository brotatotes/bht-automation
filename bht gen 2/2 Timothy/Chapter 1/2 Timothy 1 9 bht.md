# 2 Timothy 1:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The salvation we have received is a testament to God's love and grace. Through His eternal purpose and grace, He has called us to a holy calling. This calling is not based on our own works, but is a result of God's predetermined plan. Before the world began, God had already ordained this gift of salvation for us. This demonstrates that salvation is solely the work of God and not something we can earn. In light of this, we should respond by using the gifts and abilities God has given us to serve Him faithfully.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The having 'saved us' in His eternal purpose of 'grace, given us in Christ before the world began,' precedes his actual 'calling' of us in due time with a call made effective to us by the Holy Spirit."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He has brought us into a state in which salvation is so certain, that Paul could speak of it as if it were already done."
2. "A calling which is in its own nature holy, and which leads to holiness."
3. "The whole arrangement was irrespective of our deserts."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Salvation is ascribed to God."
2. "With a holy calling [ŒªŒ∫Œ∑œÉŒµŒπ Œ±Œ≥ŒπŒ±] . Klhsiv, calling, often in Paul; but the phrase holy calling only here."
3. "Before the world began [œÄœÅŒø œáœÅŒøŒΩœâŒΩ Œ±ŒπœâŒΩŒπœâŒΩ] . See additional note on 2 Thessalonians 1:9. In Pastorals the phrase only here and Titus 1:2...The gift planned and ordered in the eternal counsels is here treated as an actual bestowment."

### John Calvin:
1. "The salvation which he has bestowed on us easily swallows up all the evils that must be endured in this world."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "God has done so much for us. Shall we not at least do something for Him, if only by exercising the gifts He has bestowed on us?"
2. "A holy calling, i.e. a calling, a summons, which implies holiness. This was not 'according to our works,' for they were by hypothesis, and in fact, unholy, but is referred to the purpose and the favour of God."
3. "And as no commencement in time could be ascribed to the Divine purpose, for that would imply change in the Unchangeable, this purpose, yes, and even the gift, must be thought of as belonging to periods beyond man's power to measure; literally, 'before the times of ages or ages' before the years of eternity."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "ŒöŒªŒ∑œÉŒπœÇ here apparently not the invitation, but the consecrated service, 'the upward calling' (Philippians 3:14)."
2. "Paul often uses Œ∫Œ±ŒªŒµœâ of God's calling men (1 Thessalonians 2:12; 1 Corinthians 1:9; Galatians 1:6; Romans 8:20; Romans 9:11)."
3. "First aorist passive articular participle agreeing with œáŒ±œÅŒπœÇ (grace), a thoroughly Pauline expression (1 Corinthians 3:10; Romans 12:3; Romans 12:6, etc.), only here in Pastoral Epistles."

### John Gill:
1. "God had a mind to save some; he pitched on his own Son to be the Saviour of them; he put those persons into his hands, where they are safely preserved."
2. "Salvation was not only resolved upon, but the scheme of it was contrived from eternity, in a way agreeable to all the divine perfections, in which Satan is most mortified, the creature abased, and the elect effectually saved."
3. "Vocation is also according to both the purpose and grace of God: it is according to his purpose; the persons called are fixed upon by him; whom he predestinates he calls; none are called, but whom God purposed to call."

### John Wesley:
1. "The love of the Father, the grace of our Saviour, and the whole economy of salvation, are here admirably described."
2. "Having called us with an holy calling - which is all from God, and claims us all for God."
3. "According to his own purpose and grace - that is, his own gracious purpose."
