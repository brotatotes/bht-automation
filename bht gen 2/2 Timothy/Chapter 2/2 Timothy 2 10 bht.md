# 2 Timothy 2:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Therefore, as believers, we should not be discouraged but rather encouraged by the fact that God's word is not limited or restricted.

Salvation is not just freedom from evil, but it also entails the glorious and complete enjoyment of all good things that God has in store for us.
