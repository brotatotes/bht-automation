# 2 Timothy 2:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For if we be dead with him, refers to believers being united with Christ, sharing in his death and dying to sin. This concept of being dead with Christ is not only a legal sense, but also includes believers dying for the sake of Christ and the Gospel, conforming to his image, and living a life of sanctification to his glory. Through this union with Christ, believers are not only dead to sin, but also experience a life of communion with him, finding their life and favor in him.
