# 2 Timothy 2:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Denying Christ is a grave act that arises from weakness and unbelief, prioritizing worldly desires over the sacred name of the Son of God. This denial goes beyond mere words, leading to the denial of our connection with Him. We must not underestimate the seriousness of this pronouncement, as it will be proven true in due time. It is important to remember the significance of our faith and not to place greater value on the temporary pleasures of this world over our allegiance to Christ.
