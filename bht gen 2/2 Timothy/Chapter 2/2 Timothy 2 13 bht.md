# 2 Timothy 2:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Even if our faith wavers or falters, God remains faithful and true to His promises. Our lack of belief does not change His nature or His commitment to fulfill what He has spoken. We may question or doubt, but His faithfulness is unwavering. His word is sure, and He will never deny Himself or His commitment to His people.
