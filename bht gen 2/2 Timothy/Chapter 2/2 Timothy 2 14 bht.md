# 2 Timothy 2:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To remind those under your care is not only a useful and comforting practice but also a necessary one. It is important to strive and contend not for mere words, but for the form of sound and wholesome teachings of our Lord Jesus. Engaging in futile arguments about insignificant matters can only lead to the subversion and confusion of the hearers, which is both unprofitable and harmful. Therefore, it is essential to avoid such pointless disputes and instead focus on what truly matters in the faith.
