# 2 Timothy 2:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A faithful servant of God is like a diligent workman who does not seek to please others but lives a life of integrity and sincerity, presenting their work to God. By rightly understanding and explaining the word of truth, they are able to dissect its parts and share its deep truths with others. It is important not to skim over or give selective parts of the gospel, for only those who faithfully and accurately divide and distribute the whole message can stand without shame.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Strive to present thyself to God approved, a workman unshamed by his work being found unworthy."
2. "The meaning of ὀρθοτομέω is very variously derived and explained, 'recte secare' being unquestionably the rendering."
3. "The original meaning being 'rightly to divide,' the idea of τέμνειν was gradually lost, as in καινοτομεῖν, so that the word came to signify 'to manage rightly,' 'to treat truthfully without falsifying'."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Study—Greek, 'Be earnest,' or 'diligent.'"
2. "rightly dividing—'rightly handling' [Vulgate] 'rightly administering' [ALFORD]; literally, cutting 'straight' or 'right': the metaphor being from a father or a steward (1 Corinthians 4:1) cutting and distributing bread among his children [VITRINGA and CALVIN], (Luke 12:42)."
3. "The same image of a way appears in the Greek for 'increase' (see on Proverbs 11:5- :). The opposite to 'rightly handling,' or 'dispensing,' is, Proverbs 11:5- :, 'corrupt the word of God.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The object of the ministry is not to please men... [it] demands study or care... to lead a minister to seek popular favor rather than the divine approval."
2. "A man faithfully performing his duty, so that when he looks over what he has done, he may not blush."
3. "The minister of the gospel is to make a proper distribution of that word, adapting his instructions to the circumstances and wants of his hearers, and giving to each that which will be fitted to nourish the soul for heaven."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "To show thyself approved [σεαυτον δοκιμον παραστησαι] . Parasthsai, better, present. In Pastorals only here and chapter 2 Timothy 4:17. Often in Acts and Paul. See on Acts 1:3; Romans 16:2; Ephesians 5:27. Dokimon approved, only here in Pastorals, five times by Paul." 
2. "A workman [εργατης] . In Paul, 2 Corinthians 11:13; Philippians 3:2. In Pastorals, 1 Timothy 5:18. That needeth not to be ashamed [ανεπαισχυντον] . N. T. o. o LXX, o Class. Lit. not made ashamed, as Philippians 1:20. A workman whose work does not disgrace him."
3. "Rightly dividing [ορθοτομουντα] . N. T. o. o Class. In LXX, Proverbs 3:6; Proverbs 11:5; both times in the sense of directing the way. From ojrqov straight and temnein to cut. Hence, to cut straight, as paths; to hold a straight course; generally, to make straight; to handle rightly."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul here applies the best and most excellent remedy when he commands Timothy to keep his eyes fixed on God; as if he had said; 'Some aim at the applause of a crowded assembly, but do thou study to approve thyself and thy ministry to God.'"
2. "By this term he indirectly reproves the foolishness of those who so greatly torment themselves by doing nothing. Let us therefore be 'workmen' in building the Church, and let us be employed in the work of God in such a manner that some fruit shall be seen then we shall have no cause to 'blush.'"
3. "To all these faults he contrasts 'dividing aright,' that is, the manner of explaining which is adapted to edification; for that is the rule by which we must try all interpretation of Scripture."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Study, Strictly, ‘be eager, be zealous.’"
2. "Rightly dividing. The literal meaning, ‘cutting straight,’ admits obviously of many figurative applications, and the word has been referred accordingly to the work of the sculptor, the road-maker, the carpenter, the ploughman, the carver at table, the sacrificing priest."
3. "I am disposed to think that we may perhaps class this among the medical words with which these Epistles abound, and see in it a reference to the work of the surgeon, in which any deflection from the true line of incision might be perilous or even fatal."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Give diligence." - σπουδασον
2. "To present." - παραστησα
3. "Handling aright." - ορθοτομουντα

### John Gill:
1. "Not unto men, as pleasing them; but unto God, showing all fidelity and uprightness."
2. "Such who are faithful and diligent ones, 'need not to be ashamed'; such do not cause shame, neither in themselves nor in others."
3. "To divide the word of truth rightly, is to cut it open, and dissect its several parts, and search and look into the inside and bottom of it, for to find out every truth contained in it, and lay them open to others."

### John Wesley:
1. "A workman that needeth not to be ashamed"
2. "Rightly dividing the word of truth"
3. "They that give one part of the gospel to all have real need to be ashamed"
