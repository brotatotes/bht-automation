# 2 Timothy 2:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The danger of false teachings is likened to a spreading disease that feeds on and destroys the truth. Just as gangrene rapidly eats away at flesh, these errors and heresies devour the souls of those who are deceived by them, leading to destruction and death. It is crucial to address and stop the spread of such falsehoods, naming and avoiding those who promote them.
