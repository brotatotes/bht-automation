# 2 Timothy 2:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They distorted Paul's words and twisted the meaning to fit their own destructive beliefs, denying the true sense of the resurrection. By doing this, they were undermining the very foundation upon which faith stands, endangering all other doctrines of religion. This error was not only a deviation from the truth, but it also led them to deny the future resurrection and cling to a skewed understanding of a mere spiritual revival. It is crucial to recognize the danger of such teachings and stay vigilant in upholding the true understanding of the resurrection.

### Philip Schaff:
