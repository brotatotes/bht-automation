# 2 Timothy 2:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The firm and unchanging foundation of God is the truth and faithfulness that upholds His Church. It is a secure foundation that cannot be shaken, with inscriptions on each side - one declaring that the Lord knows those who are His, and the other urging everyone who claims to be of the Lord to turn away from iniquity. Only those who genuinely depart from evil truly belong to Him, for God is intimately acquainted with His own and calls them to live in righteousness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "God’s firm foundation standeth... ἐκκλησία τεθεμελιωμένη ὑπὸ θεοῦ the congregation of the faithful, considered as a foundation of a building placed by God, the οἰκία spoken of in the next verse." 
2. "The Lord knoweth them that are His (the LXX runs: ἐπέσκεπται καὶ ἔγνω ὁ θεὸς τοὺς ὄντας αὐτοῦ καὶ τοὺς ἁγίους, καὶ προσηγάγετο πρὸς ἑαυτόν)" 
3. "Let every one that nameth the name of the Lord (viz. as his Lord: not exactly equivalent to ‘calleth on the name of the Lord’) stand aloof from iniquity"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In the steadfast standing of the Church there is involved the steadfast certainty of the doctrine in question."
2. "God abates not His faithfulness."
3. "Apostasy from the faith is sure soon to be followed by indulgence in iniquity."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "As long as this foundation remained firm, there was no reason to be troubled from the few instances of apostasy which had occurred."
2. "The Lord knoweth them that are his - [...] showing that no one can deceive God; that he is intimately acquainted with all who enter that building; and that in the multitudes which enter there, the friends and the foes of God are intimately known."
3. "The foundation has two inscriptions - the first implying that God knows all who are his own people; the other, that all who are his professed people should depart from evil."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "By 'the sure foundation of God' is meant the church, which is 'the pillar and stay of the truth', by means of which the truth of God is to withstand the assaults of error." 
2. "The two go together. The purity of the church is indispensable to its security." 
3. "Whatever may be implied in God's election, it does not relieve Christians of the duty of strict attention to their moral character and conduct."

### John Calvin:
1. "We know too well, by experience, how much scandal is produced by the apostasy of those who at one time professed the same faith with ourselves."
2. "But they who in the ordinary opinion of men held a distinguished rank, having been formerly regarded as pillars, cannot fall in this manner, without involving others in the same ruin with themselves; at least, if their faith has no other support."
3. "First of all, therefore, let us hold this principle, that, amidst so great weakness of our flesh, the elect are nevertheless beyond the reach of danger, because they do not stand by their own strength, but are founded on God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The idea was, as we have seen, a familiar one with St. Paul, and is referred sometimes to Christ Himself (1 Corinthians 3:11), sometimes to good works (1 Timothy 6:19). Here it would seem to represent the thought that God’s unchanging truth is the foundation of His Church."
2. "The figure is probably drawn from the practice of engraving inscriptions on one or both sides of the foundation stone. So in Revelation 21:14 the names of the twelve apostles are found on the twelve foundations of the mystical Jerusalem."
3. "Every one who names the name of the Lord, who speaks of Christ as His Lord, and therefore calls himself a Christian, is bound by so doing to depart from iniquity."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Howbeit (μεντο). Strong adversative, 'however.'"
2. "Firm (στερεος). Old adjective, solid, compact, in N.T. only here, 1 Peter 5:9; Hebrews 5:12; Hebrews 5:14."
3. "Let every one depart (αποστητω πας). Paraphrase of Numbers 16:27; Isaiah 26:13; Isaiah 52:11; Jeremiah 20:9. Second aorist active imperative of αφιστημ (intransitive use), 'Let every one stand off from.' Probably another echo of the rebellion of Korah."

### John Gill:
1. "That faith, which is the faith of God's elect, is of the operation of God, and is the gift of his grace, and of which Christ is the author and finisher, is firm and immovable as a foundation."
2. "Or the doctrine of eternal election may be here designed; which is the foundation of all spiritual blessings, of faith and of holiness, of joy and comfort here, and happiness hereafter, and even of complete and everlasting salvation."
3. "Let everyone that nameth the name of Christ... depart from iniquity."

### John Wesley:
1. "But the foundation of God — His truth and faithfulness."
2. "Standeth fast — Can never be overthrown; being as it were sealed with a seal, which has an inscription on each side: on the one, The Lord knoweth those that are his; on the other, Let every one who nameth the name of the Lord, as his Lord, depart from iniquity."
3. "Indeed, they only are his who depart from iniquity. To all others he will say, 'I know you not.' Matthew 7:22,23"
