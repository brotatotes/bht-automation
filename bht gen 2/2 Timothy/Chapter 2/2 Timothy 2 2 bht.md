# 2 Timothy 2:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul entrusted Timothy with the task of sharing the profound teachings of God's grace that he had received from him. Timothy was instructed to pass on this deposit of truth to trustworthy individuals who not only believed in Christ, but also exhibited integrity and uprightness. It is important to recognize that no one is sufficient for such a responsibility on their own, but it is God who empowers and equips individuals to minister the Word effectively.
