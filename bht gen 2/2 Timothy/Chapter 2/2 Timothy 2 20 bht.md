# 2 Timothy 2:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a metaphorical sense, the church is depicted as a great house with a variety of vessels - some made of precious materials like gold and silver, while others are made of wood and earth, intended for less honorable uses. Just as a great house contains vessels for different purposes, so too does the church have a diversity of believers with varying gifts and attainments. However, it is important to note that the moral quality of individuals determines their significance, as even a vessel made of gold can be put to dishonorable use if misused by its owner.
