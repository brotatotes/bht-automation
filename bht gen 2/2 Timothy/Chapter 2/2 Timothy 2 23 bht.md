# 2 Timothy 2:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The servant of the Lord must not strive, but be gentle towards all, apt to teach, patient of wrong, in meekness correcting those who oppose themselves. Foolish and unlearned questions, which do not contribute to godliness, should be avoided by ministers of the Gospel and not entertained in private conversation. These questions are ignorant, untrained, and uneducated, leading to speculations that do not promote intellectual growth. Such questions only generate strifes and contentions, hindering the progress of the Gospel.
