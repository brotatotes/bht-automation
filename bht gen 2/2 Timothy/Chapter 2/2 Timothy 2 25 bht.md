# 2 Timothy 2:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In dealing with those who oppose themselves, we are called to instruct them with a combination of zeal and meekness. It is important to approach them in a tender and gentle manner, even if they are stubborn and resistant. Repentance plays a crucial role in their journey towards the truth, as it involves a change of mind and a confession of their errors. While it is ultimately God's work to grant true repentance, as ministers of the Gospel, we are encouraged to continue our instructions, knowing that the acknowledgement of the truth will follow.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "instructing with correction, which those who deal in 'uninstructive' or 'undisciplined questions' need"
2. "repentance—which they need as antecedent to the full knowledge of the truth"
3. "The cause of the spiritual ignorance which prompts such 'questions' is moral, having its seat in the will, not in the intellect"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We are not to become angry with such persons, and denounce them at once as heretics. We are not to hold them up to public reproach and scorn; but we are to set about the business of patiently 'instructing them.'"
2. "The apostolic precept about the way of treating those who are in error; and can any one fail to see its beauty and propriety?"
3. "Meekness' and 'gentleness' are the very best things, if you wish to convince another that he is wrong. With his heart first, and then modestly and kindly show him 'what the truth is,' in as few words, and with as unassuming a spirit, as possible, 'and you have him.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Instructing [παιδευοντα] . See on 1 Timothy 1:20. Better, correcting!"
2. "The meaning is, those who oppose the servant of the Lord; Who carry on the ajntiqeseiv oppositions (1 Timothy 6:20); =gainsayers (ajntilegontev Titus 1:9)."
3. "More correctly, the knowledge."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul means that even towards the most unworthy we must exercise meekness."
2. "Whoever shall consider that repentance is the gift and work of God, will cherish more earnest hope."
3. "Our labors and exertions are thus of no advantage in themselves; and yet, through the grace of God, they are not fruitless."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word never means simple instruction, but always education and discipline, and is obviously used here in contrast to the ‘undisciplined’ questioning of the preceding verse."
2. "Even in the work of opposing or correcting, the servant of Christ is to keep that possibility in view."
3. "As the error contemplated was one of false doctrine springing from corrupt life, so the remedial process was to begin at the beginning, first amendment of life, and then intellectual perception of the truth."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Correcting (παιδευοντα). See Titus 2:12. 'Schooling' (Parry)."

3. "Repentance (μετανοιαν). 'Change of mind' (2 Corinthians 7:10; Romans 2:4)."

### John Gill:
1. "In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves...in a tender and gentle manner, though very perverse and obstinate."
2. "Repentance here designs a repentance of errors in principle, a change of mind upon conviction, and such as issues in a free and ingenuous confession, and acknowledgment of the truth before opposed."
3. "Though this is not certain, that God will give repentance to such contradictors and blasphemers of his Gospel; yet as it is his will, that all his chosen ones should come to repentance...it is an encouragement to the ministers of the Gospel to continue their instructions."
