# 2 Timothy 2:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
While under the influence of error, individuals are in a deep slumber or spiritually intoxicated, unaware of their captivity by the devil. However, there is hope for them to awaken and recover themselves from this state. They can escape the snare of the devil through the illuminating power of God's truth and willingly submit to His will. This deliverance from the enemy's bondage is possible through the transformative work of God in their lives.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The representation in this part of the verse implies that, while under the influence of error, they were like a man intoxicated, or like one in deep slumber."
2. "There is a little confusion of metaphor here, since, in the first part of the verse, they are represented as asleep, or intoxicated; and, here, as taken in a snare. Yet the general idea is clear."
3. "It is an affecting representation of those who have fallen into error. They are in a deep slumber. They are as if under the fatal influence of some stupefying potion. They are like birds taken alive in this state, and at the mercy of the fowler."

### Marvin Vincent:

3. "A truly shocking condition, when the devil has so great power over us, that he drags us, as captive slaves, here and there at his pleasure."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "That they may recover themselves. Literally, 'that they may awake as from a drunken sleep.'"
2. "If we accept them as pointing to different agents, then the probable meaning is, 'that they may awake sobered from the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him (the devil), unto (i.e. awaking unto) His will (the will of God).'"
3. "There seems, however, sufficient reason for supposing that the change of pronoun was determined by the desire of avoiding the repetition of the same word rather than by any purpose to distinguish between the two."

2. "Taken captive alive."

### John Gill:
1. "And that they may recover themselves,.... Or "awake", and come to themselves, and appear to be sober, and in their right mind: the metaphor is taken from drunken men, who are overcharged, and are not in their senses, and being stupified fall asleep..."
2. "...and so escape out of the snare of the devil; for as carnal lusts and pleasures are the snares and nets, in which Satan, who may be compared to a fowler, catches some; so errors and heresies are those with which he ensnares others..."
3. "...when the prey is taken from the mighty, and the lawful captive is delivered; and so it is an encouragement to the ministers of the word to go on in instructing, hoping this may be the case."

### John Wesley:
1. Who â€” At present are not only captives, but asleep; utterly insensible of their captivity.
