# 2 Timothy 2:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are called to endure hardships and sufferings that come as a result of their faith in Christ. Just as a soldier is willing to endure hardships for the sake of their country, so should the soldier of the cross be willing to do it for the sake of their Savior and for the good of humanity. The call to endure hardness is not without strong necessity, as patient endurance of trials and afflictions is essential for perseverance in the faith. These hardships are not about inflicting harm, but rather about displaying patience in the face of adversity.
