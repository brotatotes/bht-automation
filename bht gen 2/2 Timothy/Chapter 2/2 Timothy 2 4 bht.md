# 2 Timothy 2:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christians should avoid becoming entangled in the affairs and cares of this world, just as soldiers at war carefully avoid getting involved in worldly matters. By focusing solely on their duty to please their commanding officer, Christians can fully devote themselves to the work and service they are called to. This analogy draws from both the Roman law of arms and the Grecian games, emphasizing the importance of single-minded dedication in the Christian life.
