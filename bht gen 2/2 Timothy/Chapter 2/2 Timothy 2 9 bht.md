# 2 Timothy 2:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The word of God, as preached by the apostle Paul, cannot be hindered or restrained, even though he himself is suffering and imprisoned. His chains may confine him physically, but they do not prevent the gospel from spreading and reaching those who are willing to hear it. In fact, his imprisonment serves to further the cause of the gospel, as it becomes known even in places like Caesar's palace and leads to the conversion of some. Persecution and suffering may seem like obstacles, but they can often lead to the greater spread of the message of Christ.
