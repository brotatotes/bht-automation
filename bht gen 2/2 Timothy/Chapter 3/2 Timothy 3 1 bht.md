In the last days, which started with the death of Jesus, there would be even worse times with men of bad principles and practices in the churches. These times would be troublesome and dangerous, requiring extra caution and care. The phrase last days refers to the gospel dispensation, which began with Jesus' death and continues until the end of the world.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. Perilous—literally, "difficult times," in which it is difficult to know what is to be done: "grievous times."
3. Shall come—Greek, "shall be imminent"; "shall come unexpectedly" [BENGEL].

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The 'object' of this reference to the perilous times which were to occur, was evidently to show the necessity of using every precaution to preserve the purity of the church, from the fact that such sad scenes were to open upon it."
2. "Times of danger, of persecution, and of trial."
3. "There can be no doubt that in all these passages the apostle refers to the same events."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "But know this By this prediction he intended still more to sharpen his diligence; for, when matters go on to our wish, we become more careless; but necessity urges us keenly."
2. "Paul, therefore informs him, that the Church will be subject to terrible diseases, which will require in the pastors uncommon fidelity, diligence, watchfulness, prudence, and unwearied constancy; as if he enjoined Timothy to prepare for arduous and deeply anxious contests which awaited him."
3. "He means that there will not be, even under the gospel, such a state of perfection, that all vices shall be banished, and virtues of every kind shall flourish; and that therefore the pastors of the Christian Church will have quite as much to do with wicked and ungodly men as the prophets and godly priests had in ancient times."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In the last days. The words imply, as do many other passages in the New Testament, the belief that the end of the world’s history was not far off, that the then state of the world presented signs of its approach."
2. "History has baffled that expectation, but the permanent truth remains that, as elsewhere, ‘prophecy hath springing and germinant accomplishments.’ So here, phenomena of evil, like those described by St. Paul, bring on one of those days of the Lord that are preludes of the final judgment."
3. "Perilous. Better, ‘grievous.’ The idea is that of distress rather than danger."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Know this (τουτο γινωσκε)"
2. "In the last days (εν εσχαταις ημεραις)"
3. "Grievous (χαλεπο). Hard. Shall come (ενστησοντα)."

### John Gill:

3. "The Jews generally understand by this phrase, when used in the Old Testament, the days of the Messiah; and which are the last days of the world, in comparison of the times before the law, from Adam to Moses, and under the law, from thence to Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. In the last days — The time of the gospel dispensation, commencing at the time of our Lord's death, is peculiarly styled the last days. Grievous - Troublesome and dangerous.
