# 2 Timothy 3:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle's doctrine, depicted as my doctrine, is not his own creation, but what he received from God and faithfully preached. It was well-known and accompanied by a life that aligned with its principles. Timothy witnessed Paul's unwavering faith in God's love, salvation through Jesus Christ, and eternal glory, which gave him assurance until the end.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "His pious mother Eunice and grandmother Lois would recommend him to study fully Paul's Christian course as a pattern."
2. "Hence arose Timothy's knowledge of Paul's persecutions, which were the common talk of the churches in those regions about the time of his conversion."
3. "My set aim, or resolution, in my apostolic function, and in every action is, not my selfish gain, but the glory of God in Christ."

### Albert Barnes:

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "He gives to us, in this sentence, a very lively picture of a good teacher, as one who does not, by words only, train and instruct his disciples, but, so to speak, opens his very breast to them, that they may know, that whatever he teaches, he teaches sincerely." 
2. "Such were the early instructions which had been imparted to Timothy in the school of Paul. Yet he does not merely bring to remembrance what he had learned from him, but bears testimony to his former life, that in this manner he may urge him to perseverance."
3. "It is his wish, however, that the example of his 'faith, love, and patience' should be constantly before the eyes of Timothy; and for that reason he dwells chiefly on his persecutions, which were best known to him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Thou hast followed. Better, 'thou didst follow.' The pronoun is emphatic, and the tense points to a definite time, probably that of Timothy's early discipleship, which St. Paul had in his memory."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle calls the doctrine he delivered, 'my doctrine': not because he was the author of it, or that it was a scheme of principles formed and contrived by him; but because it was the doctrine which he had received from God, which was given him to preach, and which he did preach purely and faithfully."
2. "His life was agreeable to his doctrine, and ornamental to his profession."
3. "And as the doctrine of faith, embraced, professed, and preached by him, was well known, so no less conspicuous was the grace of faith in him, with respect to his interest in God's everlasting love, in salvation by Jesus Christ, and in eternal glory and happiness; of which he had a full assurance, and which remained constant and firm in him to the end."
