# 2 Timothy 3:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is consoling to know that afflictions and sufferings have a joyful end. The apostle recalls his past experiences in places where Timothy had also lived, serving as a tangible testimony of the truth. He endured various persecutions, which can be seen in a detailed account in 2 Corinthians 11:23. However, throughout all these trials, the Lord delivered him. This serves as a reminder of the glory and power of God, to whom the apostle attributes his deliverance.
