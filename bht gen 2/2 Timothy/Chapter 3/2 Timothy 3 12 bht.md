# 2 Timothy 3:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
All who desire to live godly lives and be in Christ must be willing to face persecution. This is the price of loyal service to Christ, as it was for Paul and for all believers. Persecution may take various forms, whether through deprivation, disadvantage, imprisonment, or even death. However, as Christians, we should not be surprised or discouraged by persecution, for it is the common experience of those who follow Christ. Let us remember that living godly lives in Christ means being willing to endure tribulations and face opposition for the sake of the gospel.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The 'essence' of persecution consists in 'subjecting a person to injury or disadvantage on account of his opinions.' It is something more than meeting his opinions by argument, which is always right and proper; it is inflicting some injury on him; depriving him of some privilege, or right; subjecting him to some disadvantage, or placing him in less favorable circumstances, on account of his sentiments."
2. "It may be by depriving him of an office which he held, or preventing him from obtaining one to which he is eligible; it may be by subjecting him to fine or imprisonment, to banishment, torture, or death."
3. "If, in any manner, or in any way, he is subjected to disadvantage on account of his religious opinions, and deprived of any immunities and rights to which he would be otherwise entitled, this is persecution."

2. "In short, let us know that we are Christians on this condition, that we shall be liable to many tribulations and various contests."
3. "Moreover, as soon as zeal for God is manifested by a believer, it kindles the rage of all ungodly men; and, although they are not exposed to the same assaults, and do not engage in the same battles, yet they have a warfare in common, and shall never be wholly at peace and exempt from persecutions."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "All that will live godly. The Greek is emphatic, ‘all who purpose,’ ‘all whose will is’ to live godly."
