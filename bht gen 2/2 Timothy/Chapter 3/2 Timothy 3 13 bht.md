# 2 Timothy 3:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Evil men, impostors, and deceivers are a constant presence in the world, and their actions only worsen over time. They continue to deceive and lead others astray, not only blinding themselves further in their own errors but also embracing the errors of others. Professors of true religion must be prepared for ongoing persecution, for the breach between light and darkness, between righteousness and wickedness, widens as time goes on. The tragedy lies in the fact that these seducers are not only able to deceive others but are themselves under the deception, spiraling further into iniquity.
