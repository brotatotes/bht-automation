# 2 Timothy 3:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The holy Scriptures possess the power to impart wisdom that leads to eternal salvation, but this wisdom can only be obtained through faith in the promised Messiah. Just as the Jews taught their children the Scriptures from a young age, we too should diligently study and meditate upon the Old and New Testaments, for they contain the knowledge that can make us abundantly wise unto salvation. It is not the mere knowledge of the law that leads to true wisdom, but rather a spiritual understanding of Christ and a firm trust in Him for our salvation.
