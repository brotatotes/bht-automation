## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The man of God is perfectly accoutred out of Scripture for his work."
2. "No oral tradition is needed to be added."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Scriptures have laid down the way which leads to perfection, and...if any one were perfect, he would find in the Scriptures all the instruction which he needed in those circumstances."
2. "Whatever good work the man of God desires to perform, or however perfect he aims to be, he will find no deficiency in the Scriptures, but will find there the most ample instructions that he needs."
3. "No new phase of human affairs can appear in which it will not direct him; no new plan of benevolence can be started, for which he will not find principles there to guide him; and he can make no progress in knowledge or holiness, where he will not feel that his holy counselor is in advance of him still, and that it is capable of conducting him even yet into higher and purer regions."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Perfect [αρτιος]... the idea is rather that of mutual, symmetrical adjustment of all that goes to make the man: harmonious combination of different qualities and powers."
2. "Thoroughly furnished [εξηρτισμενος]... It fills out the idea of being fitted out."
3. "Any writing which can produce such profitable results vindicates itself as inspired of God. It is to be noted that the test of the divine inspiration of Scripture is here placed in its practical usefulness."

### John Calvin:
1. "Perfect means here a blameless person, one in whom there is nothing defective; for he asserts absolutely, that the Scripture is sufficient for perfection."
2. "Seeing that Paul speaks of the Scriptures, which is the name given to the Old Testament, how does he say that it makes a man thoroughly perfect? ... the writings of the apostles contain nothing else than a simple and natural explanation of the Law and the Prophets, together with a manifestation of the things expressed in them."
3. "This eulogium, therefore, is not inappropriately bestowed on the Scriptures by Paul; and, seeing that its instruction is now rendered more full and clear by the addition of the Gospel, what can be said but that we ought assuredly to hope that the usefulness, of which Paul speaks, will be much more displayed, if we are willing to make trial and receive it?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "That the man of God may be complete, completely equipped."
2. "It is obvious that St. Paul refers chiefly, many would say exclusively, to the Scriptures of the Old Testament."
3. "The fact that the word had gained this wider range explains St. Paul's addition of the qualifying adjective, not 'every Scripture' absolutely, but 'every God-inspired Scripture,' as though giving a test by which that inspiration might be recognised."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The man of God (ο του θεου ανθρωπος)."
2. "May be complete (ινα η αρτιος)."
3. "Furnished completely (εξηρτισμενος)."

### John Gill:
1. "The design of the Scriptures and the end of writing them are, that both preachers of the word, and hearers of it, might have a perfect knowledge of the will of God."
2. "Thoroughly furnished unto all good works, or 'every good work'; particularly to the work of the ministry, which is a good one."
3. "The holy Scriptures... give directions about [good works], as well as show where strength is to be had to perform them."

### John Wesley:
1. "That the man of God...may be perfect — Blameless himself..." 
2. "Thoroughly furnished - By the scripture, either to teach, reprove, correct, or train up others."
