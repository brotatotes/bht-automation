# 2 Timothy 3:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the future, there will be a widespread and intensified manifestation of self-centeredness and greed among people, including those within the church. This selfishness will take precedence over showing love and care for others. The pursuit of material wealth will also dominate their motivations and actions. These traits will be prevalent, deeply rooted, and will have significant negative consequences.
