# 2 Timothy 3:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These individuals are heady, acting impulsively and driven by their passions. They are high-minded, filled with pride that blinds them. Their pursuit of pleasure diminishes their love and awareness of God. Their actions and desires are misguided, leading to the disturbance of society and their own downfall. They prioritize worldly delights over a meaningful relationship with God. Their reckless pursuit of pleasure overrides their love and devotion to the Divine.

1. "Traitors,.... To their princes and sovereigns, whose deaths they have contrived and compassed, and whom they have assassinated and murdered; and have been betrayers of the secrets of persons, which they have come at by auricular confession to them; and of their best and nearest friends, to preserve and secure themselves."
2. "Heady; rash, daring, bold, and impudent, fit to say and do anything, though ever so vile and wicked."
3. "High-minded; puffed and swelled up with a vain conceit of themselves, and speaking great swelling words of vanity; lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God; lovers of sinful pleasures, or the pleasures of sin, which are but for a season, and not God; serving divers lusts and pleasures, and not God; making a god of their belly; sensual idolaters, delighting themselves in their carnal lusts, and not in the service of God."

### John Wesley:
1. Lovers of sensual pleasure — Which naturally extinguishes all love and sense of God.
