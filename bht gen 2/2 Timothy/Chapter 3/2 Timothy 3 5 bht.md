# 2 Timothy 3:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Having a mere external form of godliness, pretentiously displaying piety and holiness before others, is not enough. True godliness encompasses not only outward appearances and expressions, but also a sincere and genuine commitment to the power and reality of God. It is disheartening to witness individuals who claim to profess religion, yet deny the transformative and life-changing power that comes with it. Such hypocrisy was already present in the days of the apostles, and sadly, it continues to persist in our current times as well.
