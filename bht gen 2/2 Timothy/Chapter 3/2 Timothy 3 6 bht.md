False teachers often try to deceive people by subtly infiltrating their lives and homes, exploiting their weaknesses and using flattering words to gain influence.

These deceptive teachers prey on their vulnerabilities and lead them astray. It is crucial to be discerning and aware in order to identify and avoid such manipulative individuals.
