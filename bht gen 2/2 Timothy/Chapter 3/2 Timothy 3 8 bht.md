# 2 Timothy 3:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In ancient times, there were opponents to the truth, just as there are now. Jannes and Jambres were Egyptian magicians who resisted Moses by trying to counterfeit his miracles. They withstood the truth and corrupted the minds of many. These individuals were void of judgment and had impure notions, opposing the Scriptures and true spiritual religion. We need not be surprised when adversaries rise up against Christ and His gospel, for even Moses faced opposition. Let us be aware of these false teachers and hold fast to the unchanging truth of God's Word.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is no wonder that there should be now such opponents to the truth, for their prototypes existed also in ancient times."
2. "Thus these also withstand the truth, being men corrupted in mind, worthless concerning the faith."
3. "They were the sons of Balaam prophesied to Pharaoh the birth of Moses, in consequence of which he gave the order for the destruction of the Jewish children, and thenceforward appear as the counsellors of much of the evil, in Egypt, and in the desert, after the Exodus, which happened to Israel."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Jannes and Jambres were sacred scribes (a lower order of priests in Egypt) skilled in magic."
2. "They did so by trying to rival Moses' miracles. So the false teachers shall exhibit lying wonders in the last days."
3. "Reprobate—incapable of testing the truth."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The point of the remark of the apostle here, is, that they resisted Moses by attempting to imitate his miracles, thus neutralizing the evidence that he was sent from God."
2. "In like manner, the persons here referred to, opposed the progress of the gospel by setting up a similar claim to that of the apostles; by pretending to have as much authority as they had; and by thus neutralizing the claims of the true religion, and leading off weak-minded persons from the truth."
3. "This is often the most dangerous kind of opposition that is made to religion."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "As [ον τροπον] . The formula occurs in the Synoptic Gospels (see Matthew 23:37; Luke 13:34), and in Acts (i. 11; Acts 7:28), but not in Paul."
2. "Jannes and Jambres. According to tradition, the names of the chiefs of the magicians who opposed Moses. Exodus 7:11, Exodus 7:22."
3. "Reprobate [αδοκιμοι] . In Pastorals only here and Titus 1:16. A Pauline word. See on Romans 1:28, and castaway, 1 Corinthians 9:27."

### John Calvin:
1. "This comparison confirms what I have already said about the 'last times', for he means that the same thing happens to us under the gospel, which the Church experienced almost from her very commencement, or at least since the law was published."
2. "Paul reminds us that we need not wonder if adversaries rise up against Christ to oppose his gospel since Moses likewise had those who contended with him; for these examples drawn from a remote antiquity yield us strong consolation."
3. "The reason why there were two of them may be conjectured to have been this, that, because the Lord had raised up for his people two leaders, Moses and Aaron, Pharaoh determined to place against them the like number of magicians."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The names do not appear in the Pentateuch or elsewhere in the Old Testament. They are found in the Targum or Paraphrase of Exodus 7:11; Exodus 22:11, ascribed to Jonathan, and may represent either a fragment of decorative fiction or an unwritten tradition."
2. "According to one legend they were the sons of Balaam, who prophesied the birth of Moses, suggested the murder of the Hebrew infants, and were Pharaoh’s counsellors in all evil."
3. "As in the reference to Enoch in Jude 1:14, we see a free use of what we call uncanonical materials by way, not of proof, but illustration."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Like as (ον τροπον). "In which manner." Adverbial accusative and incorporation of the antecedent τροπον into the relative clause."
2. "Withstood (αντεστησαν). Second aorist active (intransitive) of ανθιστημ, to stand against, 'they stood against' (with dative Μωυσε)."
3. "Corrupted in mind (κατεφθαρμενο τον νουν). Perfect passive participle of καταφθειρω, old compound, in N.T. only here in critical text."

### John Gill:
1. "These were not Jews, who rose up and opposed Moses, but Egyptian magicians."
2. "They both pretended to miracles; though what they did were no other than lying wonders."
3. "They resist the Scriptures of truth, not allowing them to be a sufficient rule without their unwritten traditions, and even Christ, who is truth itself, in all his offices, prophetic, priestly, and kingly."

### John Wesley:
1. "Several ancient writers speak of Jannes and Jambres, as the chief of the Egyptian magicians."
2. "Men of corrupt minds, impure notions, and wicked inclinations."
3. "Void of judgment, quite ignorant, as well as careless, of true, spiritual religion."
