# 2 Timothy 4:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
At his appearing and his kingdom, Christ will judge the quick and the dead. This refers to a future event, the last day, where Christ will appear in person in a most glorious manner. Currently, Christ's kingdom is of a spiritual nature, but it will be more evident in the future through the spread of the Gospel and the revival of godliness. The general judgment, executed with righteousness and impartiality, is certain. Believers should eagerly await Christ's second appearance and focus on both reading and hearing Scripture, without neglecting the ministry of pastors.

"And, indeed, in like manner as God showed by an inestimable pledge, when he spared not his only-begotten Son, how great is the care which he has for the Church, so he will not suffer to remain unpunished the negligence of pastors, through whom souls, which he hath redeemed at so costly a price, perish or are exposed as a prey."
