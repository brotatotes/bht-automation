# 2 Timothy 4:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Demas, who was once my fellow laborer in the ministry, has now forsaken me. It is likely that his motivation for leaving was rooted in his love for the comforts and safety of the world rather than enduring the hardships of standing by my side during difficult times. Similarly, Crescens, whose whereabouts are uncertain, may have been assigned to preach in Galatia. And while Titus has left Crete to carry out his work as an evangelist, he was also asked to rejoin me and bring me updates on the churches there.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "His motive for forsaking Paul seems to have been love of worldly ease, safety, and comforts at home, and disinclination to brave danger with Paul."
2. "Paul had written to him (Titus 3:12) to come to him in the winter to Nicopolis (in Epirus), intending in the spring to preach the Gospel in the adjoining province of Dalmatia."
3. "Paul here speaks only of his personal attendants having forsaken him he had still friends among the Roman Christians who visited him (Titus 3:12- :), though they had been afraid to stand by him at his trial."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Demas hath forsaken me...under the influence of a desire to live, he afterward forsook him, even in circumstances where he greatly needed the presence of a friend." 
2. "Having loved this present world...he desired to live. He was not willing to stay with Paul, and subject himself to the probabilities of martyrdom; and, in order to secure his life, he departed to a place of safety."
3. "Paul was pained by his departure, and that he felt lonely and sad, is quite apparent. But I see no evidence that Demas was influenced by what are commonly called worldly feelings, or that he was led to this course by the desire of wealth, or fame, or pleasure."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "That no epithet is attached to his name in Colossians 4:14 may be a shadow of Demas's behavior mentioned here."
2. "Having loved...this present world."
3. "Crescens...most probably Galatia...sent to Gaul."

### John Calvin:
1. "Having embraced this world, It was truly base in such a man to prefer the love of this world to Christ."
2. "He could not have assisted Paul without many troubles and vexations, attended by imminent risk of his life; he was exposed to many reproaches, and must have submitted to many insults, and been constrained to leave off the care of his own affairs; and, therefore being overcome by his dislike of the cross, he resolved to consult his own interests."
3. "Not only so, but in order that the church at Ephesus may not be left destitute or forlorn during Timothy’s absence, he sends Tychicus thither, and mentions this circumstance to Timothy, that he may know that that church will not be in want of one to fill his place during his absence."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Now, when persecution was keener, he deserted him. St. Paul is content to record the fact and the motive. The religion of Christ would have interfered with his worldly prospects."
2. "Nothing is, or can be, known of him, and it is doubtful whether the Galatia is the province of that name in Asia Minor, or Gaul. Traditions, of no authority, connect his name now with one, now with the other."
3. "Assuming this to be the latest of St. Paul’s Epistles, we must assume that Titus, after receiving the Epistle addressed to him, had started from Crete for Nicopolis, had then pressed on to join St. Paul at Rome, and had afterwards started to carry on his work as an evangelist at Dalmatia."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Forsook me...wilful desertion." 
2. "Crescens...No other mention of him."
3. "Titus...had been asked to rejoin Paul...he came and has been with Paul."

### John Gill:
1. "His faith might be right, though low, and his love sincere, though not fervent; and through a fear of persecution, and loss of life, he might be tempted to leave the apostle, and withdraw from Rome, for his own safety."
2. "Having loved this present world, not the sins and corruptions of the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life; such a love is inconsistent with the love of the Father and the grace of God."
3. "Here the apostle had doubtless been useful for the conversion of souls, and planting of churches, and therefore sent Titus thither, to assist them in their state and condition, and bring him an account of them."

### John Wesley:
1. "Demas, once my fellow laborer, hath forsaken me." 
2. "Crescens, probably a preacher also, is gone...to Galatia."
3. "Titus...is gone...to Dalmatia, having now left Crete."
