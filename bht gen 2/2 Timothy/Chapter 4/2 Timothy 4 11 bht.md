# 2 Timothy 4:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Despite being alone at this moment, I find comfort in knowing that God is with me, which is enough. I urge you, Timothy, to bring Mark with you, for he has once again become useful to me in our ministry. Though Mark had previously departed from our work, he has since demonstrated his value and contribution to the cause of spreading the Gospel. It is a testament to his growth and transformation that I now confidently affirm his profitability in serving alongside us.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "he is profitable to me for the ministryâ€”Mark had been under a cloud for having forsaken Paul at a critical moment in his missionary tour with Barnabas... Hence Paul, appropriately here, wipes out the past censure by high praise of Mark and guards against Timothy's making self-complacent comparisons between himself and Mark, as though he were superior to the latter."
2. "Demas apostatizes. Mark returns to the right way, and is no longer unprofitable, but is profitable for the Gospel ministry."
3. "Timothy had subsequently occupied the same post in relation to Paul as Mark once held."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Only Luke is with me - Luke, the author of the gospel which bears his name, and of the Acts of the Apostles."
2. "For a considerable part of the ministry of Paul, he was his traveling companion..."
3. "It may be observed, however, that this is such language as Paul might be expected to use of Mark, after what had occurred, as recorded in Acts 15:38."

1. "Luke...His connection with Paul appears first in Acts 16:10...He accompanied Paul to Jerusalem, after which we lose sight of him until he appears at Caesarea...He is mentioned Colossians 4:14 and Philippians 1:24." 
2. "Mark...Probably John Mark...The first mention of him since the separation from Paul...occurs in Colossians and Philemon...In 1st Peter he sends salutations to Asia." 
3. "Profitable for the ministry...only here, chapter 2 Timothy 2:21, Philippians 1:11."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is pleasant to note in this last mention of him the fullest recantation of the adverse opinion recorded in Acts 15:38."
