# 2 Timothy 4:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Tychicus, mentioned in Acts 20:4 and Ephesians 6:21, was sent by Paul to Ephesus to take Timothy's place in presiding over the church during his absence. It is possible that Tychicus had been sent ahead before Paul anticipated any danger to himself, and now he desired the company of Timothy. The reason Paul initially sent Tychicus to Ephesus is unknown, but it highlights his concern for the church there and the importance of having continued ministry in Timothy's absence.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Thou art to come to me, but Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus to supply thy place (if thou so willest it) in presiding over the Church there in thy absence."
2. "It is possible Tychicus was the bearer of this Epistle, though the omission of 'to thee' is rather against this view."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Tychicus - See Acts 20:4. In Ephesians 6:21, Paul calls him 'a beloved brother, and faithful minister in the Lord.'"
2. "But it may be asked why he did not retain him with him, or why should he have sent him away, and then call Timothy to him? The probability is, that he had sent him before he had seen reason to apprehend that he would be put to death; and now, feeling the need of a friend to be with him, he sent to Timothy, rather than to him, because Tychicus had been employed to perform some service which he could not well leave, and because Paul wished to give some special instructions to Timothy before he died."
3. "Have I sent to Ephesus - Why, is not certainly known; compare Intro. Section 2."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Tychicus is mentioned Acts 20:4, Acts 20:5; Ephesians 6:21; Colossians 4:7."
2. "The cloak [Ï†ÎµÎ»Î¿Î½Î·Î½]...Hesychius, however, explains as a glwssokomon, originally a case for keeping the mouthpieces of wind - instruments; thence, generally, Glwssokomon is the word for the disciples' treasury - chest."
3. "The books [Î²Î¹Î²Î»Î¹Î±]...Timothy is here requested to bring some papyrus documents which are distinguished from the vellum manuscripts."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Tychicus have I sent." Better, 'I sent.' In Ephesians 6:21, we find Tychicus mentioned as the bearer of the Epistle to that Church.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Tychicus I sent to Ephesus  (Î¤Ï…Ï‡Î¹ÎºÎ¿Î½ Î±Ï€ÎµÏƒÏ„ÎµÎ¹Î»Î± ÎµÎ¹Ï‚ Î•Ï†ÎµÏƒÎ¿Î½). Perhaps Paul had sent him on before he came to Rome. He may have been still on the way to Ephesus. 

### John Gill:
1. "To supply the place of Timothy, while he came to Rome, and continued there: so careful was the apostle of the church there, that they might not be without the ministry of the word during his absence"
