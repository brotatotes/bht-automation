# 2 Timothy 4:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The cloak mentioned in this passage is not a trivial detail but a significant aspect of Paul's circumstances. It sheds light on the last scene of his life and his need for warmth as winter approached. Paul's request for the cloak, which he had left in Troas, indicates the practical necessity of staying warm in his Roman citizenship. The mention of books and parchments further reveals the importance of written resources in Paul's study and teaching. Even as he neared the end of his journey, Paul remained mindful and reliant on these materials for his ministry.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The cloak (Ï†ÎµÎ»ÏŒÎ½Î·Ï‚ is said to be a corrupted form of Ï†Î±Î¹Î½ÏŒÎ»Î·Ï‚, lat. pÃ¦nula, a thick outer cloak... but it is against this idea, as indeed Bengel remarks, that the books should be afterwards mentioned."
2. "A long discussion of the meanings of Ï†ÎµÎ»ÏŒÎ½Î·Ï‚, and of the question whether it is rightly supposed to be a corruption from Ï†Î±Î¹Î½ÏŒÎ»Î·Ï‚, may be found in Wolf ad loc.: see also Ellic."
3. "What reason, is not clear: but in St. Paulâ€™s life of perils, it may well be conceived that he may have been obliged to leave such things behind, against his intention."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The mention of his 'cloak,' so far from being unworthy of inspiration, is one of those graphic touches which sheds a flood of light on the last scene of Paul's life, on the confines of two worlds."
2. "In this [world], wanting a cloak to cover him from the winter cold, in that [world] covered with the righteousness of saints, 'clothed upon with his house from heaven'."
3. "He [Paul] was anxious respecting these [books] that he might transmit them to the faithful, so that they might have the teaching of his writings when he should be gone."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The common opinion that it was a wrapper or traveling-cloak, is the most probable; and such a garment would not be undesirable for a prisoner."
2. "It should be remembered, also, that winter was approaching 2 Timothy 4:21, and such a cloak would be particularly needed."
3. "It is worthy of remark that even Paul did not travel without books, and that he found them in some way necessary for the work of the ministry."

### John Calvin:
1. "Nor is there any absurdity in saying that Paul desired to have it brought from so great a distance, because that garment, through long use, would be more comfortable for him, and he wished to avoid expense."
2. "Still more does this expression refute the madness of those men who â€” despising books, and condemning all reading â€” boast of nothing but their own divine inspirations."
3. "Here some one will ask, 'What does Paul mean by asking for a robe or cloak, if he perceived that his death was at hand?' This difficulty also induces me to interpret the word as denoting a chest, though there might have been some use of the 'cloak' which is unknown in the present day; and therefore I give myself little trouble about these matters."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The meaning of the Greek word is doubtful... â€˜cloak,â€™ a thick travelling wrapper, is a good equivalent for it."
2. "Age and infirmities make him wish in his prison at Rome for the cloak that had so often warmed him, or he wanted the material for his defence, or the books that were the companion of his solitude."
3. "The books, but especially the parchments... St. Paul habitually travelled as with a portable library among his baggage."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The old preacher can be happy with his books."
2. "One can only guess what rolls the old preacher longs to have with him, probably copies of Old Testament books, possibly copies of his own letters, and other books used and loved."
3. "These in particular would likely be copies of Old Testament books, parchment being more expensive than papyrus, possibly even copies of Christ's sayings (Luke 1:1-4)."

### John Gill:
1. "Some take it for a garment...others take it to be a kind of desk or scrutoire, to put papers in, or a chest for books, a book press."
2. "But others take it to be a courser and meaner garment, wore in cold and rainy weather, to preserve from the inclementencies of it."
3. "Though he was now grown old, and near his exit, yet was mindful and careful of his books, and desirous of having them to read."

### John Wesley:
1. "The cloak - Either the toga, which belonged to him as a Roman citizen, or an upper garment, which might be needful as winter came on."
2. "Which I left at Troas with Carpus - Who was probably his host there."
3. "Especially the parchments - The books written on parchment."
