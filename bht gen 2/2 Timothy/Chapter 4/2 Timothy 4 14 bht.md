# 2 Timothy 4:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Lord will reward Alexander the coppersmith for the evil he has done, as the apostle Paul speaks this as a prophetic declaration. The insolence and resistance of Alexander, despite his lowly status and lack of education, were evidence of his personal dislike and opposition towards the apostle and his teachings. Nevertheless, Paul desires that God's justice be served and that any personal zeal for the glory of God remains separate from human passions. The Lord will bring about the appropriate recompense according to the works of Alexander the coppersmith.
