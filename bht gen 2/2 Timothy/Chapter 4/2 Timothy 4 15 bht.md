# 2 Timothy 4:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He greatly withstood our words by vigorously opposing and resisting the truths of the Gospel preached by Paul and Timothy. It was important to avoid his company and be on guard against him to prevent him from causing harm to them and the church. The apostle's imprecations on him were not simply due to personal injury, but because of the damage he was doing to the cause of truth as a professed public teacher.
