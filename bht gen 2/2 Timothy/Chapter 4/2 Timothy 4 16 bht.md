# 2 Timothy 4:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
No man stood with me in my time of need; even my closest friends and companions forsake me. It is a common experience for people to be abandoned by those they expect to support them. I faced a challenging and brutal trial, which can be understood as my first defense when I appeared before the merciless Emperor Nero.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But the Lord (Jesus) stood by me, and strengthened me, that by my means the proclamation (of the Gospel) might be delivered in full measure."
2. "For what? that he might witness a good confession, and that the κήρυγμα might be expanded to the utmost."
3. "The lion then is the devil; ὁ ἀντίδικος ἡμῶν διάβολος ὡς λέων ὠρυόμενος περιπατεῖ ζητῶν τίνα καταπίῃ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This must have been, therefore, a second imprisonment."
2. "His 'first' trial in his second imprisonment seems to have been on the charge of complicity in the conflagration; his absence from Rome may have been the ground of his acquittal on that charge; his final condemnation was probably on the charge of introducing a new and unlawful religion into Rome."
3. "May it not be laid to THEIR charge," for they were intimidated; their drawing back from me was not from bad disposition so much as from fear; it is sure to be laid to the charge of those who intimidated them.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge - That it may not be “reckoned,” or imputed to them." 
2. "The prayer of the apostle here breathes the very spirit of Christ."
3. "See the notes on Luke 23:34; compare Acts 7:60."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Defense of the gospel against its adversaries." 
2. "The first Romans imprisonment cannot be alluded to here."
3. "To come to or stand by one as a friend."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "No one stood with me...He was allowed to stand before the judge alone, as a man who had no friends."
2. "I pray God...the fact that he uttered it at all shows how deep a wound the desertion had inflicted."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  "At my first defence (εν τη πρωτη απολογια). Original sense of 'apology' as in Philippians 1:7; Philippians 1:16. Either the first stage in this trial or the previous trial and acquittal at the end of the first Roman imprisonment. Probably the first view is correct, though really there is no way to decide."
2. "No one took my part  (ουδεις μο παρεγενετο). 'No one came by my side' (second aorist middle indicative of παραγινομα). See 1 Corinthians 16:3."
3.  "But all forsook me  (αλλα παντες με εγκατελειπον). Same verb and tense used of Demas above (verse 2 Timothy 4:10), 'But all were forsaking me' (one by one) or, if aorist εγκατελιπον, 'all at once left me.'"
4.  "May it not be laid to their account  (μη αυτοις λογισθειη). First aorist passive optative in future wish with negative μη. Common Pauline verb λογιζομα (1 Corinthians 13:5; Romans 4:3; Romans 4:5)."

### John Gill:
1. "No man stood with me...no man appeared in his cause, to speak to his character, to be a witness for him, or plead his cause." 
2. "All men forsook me; all his friends, all that came with him from Judea, or from Asia...being timorous of coming into danger, and of the loss of their lives."
3. "[I pray God] that it may not be laid to their charge; that this sin may not be imputed to them, or they be punished for it, but that it might be pardoned."

### John Wesley:
1. "My friends and companions forsake me." 
2. "Do we expect to find such as will not forsake us?"
