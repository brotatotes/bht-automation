3. "Men judge much, and justly, of the value of a system of religion by its power to comfort in the day of calamity, and to sustain the soul when about to enter on an untried state of being."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Strengthened [ενεδυναμωσεν] . See on 1 Timothy 1:12. The preaching [το κηρυγμα] . Better, the message (par excellence), the gospel message."
2. "Might be fully known [πληροφορηθη] . See on verse 5. Lit. might be fulfilled; fully carried out by being proclaimed before rulers in the capital of the world."

1. "Though the church at Rome had failed to perform its duty, he affirms that the gospel had suffered no loss by it, because, leaning on heavenly power, he was himself fully able to bear the whole burden."
2. "He does not boast of his courage, but gives thanks to the Lord; that, when reduced to extremities, he did not give way nor lose heart under so dangerous a temptation."
3. "By the word 'lion,' many suppose that he means Nero. For my part, I rather think that he makes use of this expression to denote danger in general; as if he had said, 'out of a blazing fire,' or 'out of the jaws of death.' He means that it was not without wonderful assistance from God, that he escaped, the danger being so great that but for this he must have been immediately swallowed up."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "Strengthened me... 'Poured power into me.'" 
3. "I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion...A proverb, but not certain what the application is whether to Nero or to Satan or to the lion in the arena where Paul could not be sent because a Roman citizen."
