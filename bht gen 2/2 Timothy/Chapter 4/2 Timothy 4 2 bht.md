# 2 Timothy 4:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As ministers of the gospel, we are called to have a sense of urgency in proclaiming the truth. We are to be ready and available at all times to share the message of salvation, without confining ourselves to certain situations or moments. This requires constant diligence and persistence, being willing to seize every opportunity to promote the gospel, even creating opportunities when there seem to be none. We are to reprove and rebuke with gentleness and patience, grounded in sound doctrine, knowing the importance of addressing sin and warning others of its consequences.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Press on, be urgent, generally: not perhaps in preaching only, but in the whole work of the ministry." 
2. "In season, out of season... be diligent in preaching." 
3. "Convict, rebuke, exhort, in all long-suffering and teaching."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Preach—literally, 'proclaim as a herald.'"
2. "be instant—that is, urgent, earnest, in the whole work of the ministry."
3. "reprove—'convict,' 'confute.' with...long-suffering and teaching."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He was always to be at his post, and was to embrace every opportunity of making known the gospel."
2. "A man who is greatly intent on an object will seek every opportunity to promote it. He will not confine himself to stated times and places, but will present it everywhere, and at all times."
3. "The minister is not merely to reason about sin, and convince men that it is wrong, but he may solemnly admonish them not to do it, and warn them of the consequences."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Be instant [επιστηθι] . Better, be ready. Once in Paul, 1 Thessalonians 5:3. Frequent in Luke and Acts. Lit. stand by, be at hand, be present. To come suddenly upon, Luke 2:38. Hence, be ready." 
2. "Instant signifies urgent, importunate, persevering. Lat. instant to press upon. Thus Latimer, 'I preached at the instant request of a curate.'"
3. "So N. T., Romans 12:12, 'Continuing instant in prayer.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "Being, by nature, exceedingly effeminate or slothful, we easily yield to the slightest opposition...the gospel will not long maintain its place, if pastors do not urge it earnestly."
2. "We have need of many excitements to urge us to advance in the right course...not even moderate exhortations, to say nothing of sound advices, are sufficient for shaking off our sluggishness."
3. "Reproofs are founded on doctrine, in order that they may not be justly despised as frivolous...keenness is moderated by gentleness; for nothing is more difficult than to set a limit to our zeal, when we have once become warm."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The entreaty or command connects itself with what had just been said as to the right use of Scripture."
2. "In season, out of season. The sharply-expressed contrast has sometimes proved misleading, and men have thought themselves bound to drag in sacred counsels in the strict sense of the word ‘unseasonably,’ even when they were casting pearls before swine."
3. "The words, strictly speaking, are in a descending scale of severity, and each act is to be not only ‘with,’ but in the temper of long-suffering."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Preach the word...Be instant in season, out of season." 
2. "Reprove...bring to proof." 
3. "Rebuke...to give honour (or blame) to, to chide."

### John Gill:
1. "Preach the word...with all courage and boldness."
2. "Be constant and assiduous in the work of the ministry; be always and wholly in it, either preparing for it, or performing it."
3. "Rebuke; or chide for sin; some privately, others more publicly, according to the nature and circumstances of the offence; some more gently, others more roughly, as is needful."

### John Wesley:
1. "Be instant — Insist on, urge these things in season, out of season - That is, continually, at all times and places."
2. "It might be translated, with and without opportunity - Not only when a fair occasion is given: even when there is none, one must be made."
