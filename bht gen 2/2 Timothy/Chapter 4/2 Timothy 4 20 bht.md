# 2 Timothy 4:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Erastus, the city treasurer of Corinth, remained there while Paul continued on his journey. Trophimus, a companion of Paul, was left sick at Miletus, possibly indicating Paul's lack of power to heal at will. The mention of Trophimus being left sick has caused some speculation, with some suggesting that he was left sick at Melita instead.
