# 2 Timothy 4:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As the apostle faced the approaching winter without his cloak, he urgently requested Timothy's presence, not only for his own benefit but also for Timothy's welfare. With the Lord by his side, Paul faced his impending martyrdom with courage and knew that he would be welcomed into heaven by Christ himself. Luke, Timothy, and Mark provided solace and support, doing all they could to comfort Paul, who already possessed the indescribable comfort of Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Paul would need his 'cloak' against the winter." 
2. "Pudens in MARTIAL and in the Chichester inscription, appears as a pagan; but perhaps he or his friends concealed his Christianity through fear." 
3. "Paul himself, says CLEMENT, 'visited the farthest west [perhaps Britain, certainly Spain], and was martyred under the rulers at Rome.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To come before winter - Probably because of the dangers of the navigation then, and because the circumstances of the apostle were such as to demand the presence of a friend."
2. "Eubulus, ... - These names are of common occurrence in the works of the classic writers, but of the persons here referred to we know nothing."

### Marvin Vincent:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The special reason for the urgency was, of course, that after October or November, the navigation of the Mediterranean was suspended."
2. "Here it will be sufficient to give a brief summary of them. They may be found at length in an Excursus in vol. 3 of Alford’s Greek Testament, and in a paper by the present writer in the Bible Educator (3 p. 245), and in a poem ‘Claudia and Pudens’ in his Master and Scholar."
3. "The conclusion drawn from these facts is that Pudens served under Aulus Plautius in Britain, and was stationed in Sussex."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Before winter... Pathetic item if Paul was now in the Mamertine Dungeon in Rome with winter coming on and without his cloak for which he asked."
2. "The Lord be with thy Spirit... Our hero, we may be sure, met the end nobly. He is already more than conqueror in Christ who is by his side and who will welcome him to heaven and give him his crown."
3. "Luke, Timothy, Mark will do all that mortal hands can do to cheer the heart of Paul with human comfort. He already had the comfort of Christ in full measure."
