# 2 Timothy 4:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the concluding blessing, we see the beautiful union of personal and general prayers for blessing. The Lord Jesus Christ is invoked to be with Timothy's spirit, providing counsel, comfort, and the grace needed in every difficulty and duty. Additionally, the inclusion of Grace be with you is a common salutation by the apostle in all epistles, imparting God's favor and empowerment. While the mention of Timothy as the first bishop of the church of Ephesus is uncertain, it is clear that he was an evangelist entrusted with the important task of spreading the Gospel.
