# 2 Timothy 4:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
There is a danger when people prioritize their own desires over the will of God, seeking teachings that align with their sinful inclinations rather than the truth. In times of darkness and wickedness, false teachers abound, catering to the itching ears of those who are eager to hear what pleases them. This fickle and unsettled mindset leads to a rejection of sound doctrine, preferring to be deceived rather than properly instructed. Therefore, we must make the most of any opportunity to embrace the true teachings of Christ, for there may come a time when there are no willing listeners.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Instead of regarding the will of God they dislike being interrupted in their lusts by true teachers."
2. "An indiscriminate mass of false teachers. Variety delights itching ears."
3. "They, as it were, tickle with pleasure the levity of the multitude who come as to a theater to hear what will delight their ears, not to learn what will do them good."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They will seek such kind of preaching as will accord with their carnal desires; or such as will palliate their evil propensities, and deal gently with their vices."
2. "The deeper the darkness, and the more gross the errors, and the more prevalent the wickedness of men, the more will a certain kind of religious teachers abound."
3. "They have 'itching ears.' They will be ready to run after all kinds of public instructors. They will be little pleased with any, and this will be one reason why they will have so many. They are fickle, and unsettled, and never satisfied."

### John Calvin:
1. "But he means that we must avail ourselves of the opportunity, while there is any reverence for Christ; as if one should say that, when a storm is at hand, we must not labor remissly, but must hasten with all diligence, because there will not afterwards be an equally fit season."
2. "First, let us learn from it, that the more extraordinary the eagerness of wicked men to despise the doctrine of Christ, the more zealous should godly ministers be to defend it, and the more strenuous should be their efforts to preserve it entire."
3. "The disposition of the world is therefore such that, by 'heaping up' with insatiable desire innumerable deceivers, it desires to banish all that belongs to God. Nor is there any other cause of so many errors than that men, of their own accord, choose to be deceived rather than to be properly instructed."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Make the most of any season, whether good or bad, now, for before long you will find none willing to listen."
2. "Sound doctrine" should be understood as "healthy teaching."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A time when one of the out of season times." 
2. "Will not hold themselves back from getting the ears tickled." 
3. "This is the temptation of the merely 'popular' preacher, to furnish the latest tickle."

### John Gill:

2. "they cannot receive it, nor bear to hear it, turn their backs on it, express their indignation at it, and treat it not only with neglect, but with ridicule and contempt"
3. "It is a blessing to have pastors and teachers after God’s heart, and who preach according to the word of God; these feed men with knowledge and understanding, but it is a curse upon a people, when they are left to choose teachers after their hearts' lusts"

### John Wesley:
1. "For they will heap up teachers — Therefore thou hast need of 'all longsuffering.' According to their own desires - Smooth as they can wish."
2. "Having itching ears — Fond of novelty and variety, which the number of new teachers, as well as their empty, soft, or philosophical discourses, pleased."
3. "Heap to themselves — Not enduring sound doctrine, they will reject the sound preachers, and gather together all that suit their own taste."
