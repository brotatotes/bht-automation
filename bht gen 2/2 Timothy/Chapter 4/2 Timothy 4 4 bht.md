# 2 Timothy 4:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Many people today are guilty of turning away from the truth of the Gospel, preferring to indulge in myths and fables instead. This is nothing new, as the Bible warns that people will turn away their ears from the truth and be drawn to worthless and unprofitable things. God allows this to happen as a consequence of their rejection of the truth, leading them to have a mind devoid of sense and judgment. It is important for us to guard against being swayed by empty and fleeting ideas, and instead, hold fast to the solid truths of the Gospel.
