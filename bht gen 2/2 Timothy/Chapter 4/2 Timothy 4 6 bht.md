# 2 Timothy 4:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The time has come for the apostle to depart from this world, as revealed to him by God. His life will be poured out like a sacrificial libation, not to atone for sin but as a willingness to give himself for the Lord's work. This impending departure serves as a reminder to Timothy to be diligent and steadfast in his faith, as the apostle's presence and teachings may soon be gone.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For I am already being offered (as a drink-offering: i.e. the process is begun, which shall shed my blood)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For I am already being offered; literally, as a libation; appropriate to the shedding of his blood."
2. "A motive to stimulate Timothy to faithfulness—the departure and final blessedness of Paul; it is the end that crowns the work."
3. "My departure—literally, 'loosing anchor'. Dissolution."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "His own work was nearly done. He was soon to be withdrawn from the earth, and whatever benefit the world might have derived from his experience or active exertions, it was now to be deprived of it."
2. "The word 'ready' in the phrase 'ready to be offered,' conveys an idea which is not in the original. It implies a willingness to depart, which, whether true or not, is not the idea conveyed by the apostle... No doubt he was ready, in the sense of being willing and prepared, but this is not the idea in the Greek."
3. "The proper idea in the use of the word would be, that he had been bound to the present world, like a ship to its moorings, and that death would be a release. He would now spread his sails on the broad ocean of eternity."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Already. What he is now suffering is the beginning of the end."
2. "The figure is explained by some of loosing a Ship from its moorings; by others of breaking camp."
3. "Paul's situation in the Custody of the Praetorians at Rome would naturally suggest a military metaphor."

### John Calvin:
1. "So long as I lived, I stretched out my hand to thee; my constant exhortations were not withheld from thee; thou hast been much aided by my advices, and much confirmed by my example; the time is now come, that thou shouldst be thine own teacher and exhorter, and shouldst begin to swim without support: beware lest any change in thee be observed at my death."
2. "By the word dissolution he means that we do not altogether perish when we die; because it is only a separation of the soul from the body."
3. "The faith of the Philippians was ratified by his death, in precisely the same manner that covenants were ratified in ancient times by sacrifices of slain beasts; not that the certainty of our faith is founded, strictly speaking, on the steadfastness of the martyrs, but because it tends greatly to confirm us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I am being offered. My life is being poured out as a libation."
2. "The time of my departure."
3. "The Greek word is used here only in the New Testament, and was probably suggested by the way in which it was commonly applied to the ‘breaking up’ or ‘dispersion’ of those who had been gathered together for a sacrifice or ft libation."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "What was then a possibility is now a certainty" (Parry).
2. "The sacrifice of Paul's life-blood has begun."
3. "The hour has struck. The time has come."

### John Gill:
1. "This sacrifice of himself was not to atone for sin, his own, or others; Christ's death was the only sacrifice for sin, and that is a complete one, and needs no other to be added to it."
2. "Death analyzes men, and reduces them to their first original earth; it is a removing of persons from one place and state to another; from an house of clay, from this earthly house of our tabernacle, to an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens, to everlasting habitations, and mansions in Christ's Father's house."
3. "The apostle knew...that his time of removing out of this world was very near; and which he mentions, to stir up Timothy to diligence, since he would not have him long with him, to give him counsel and advice, to admonish him, or set him an example."

### John Wesley:
1. "The time of my departure is at hand — So undoubtedly God had shown him."
2. "I am ready to be offered up — Literally, to be poured out, as the wine and oil were on the ancient sacrifices."
