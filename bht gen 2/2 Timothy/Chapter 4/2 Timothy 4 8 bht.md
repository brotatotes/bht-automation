# 2 Timothy 4:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The crown of righteousness signifies the future happiness and glory of the saints. It represents the righteousness that God has imputed and worked in them. This crown is not achieved through earthly ambition, but through personal holiness and spreading holiness to others. It is a reward given by God's grace to those who have been justified by faith. The righteous Judge, God Himself, will bestow this crown on those who have loved the appearing of Christ. This includes those who have embraced His salvation, will be transformed to be like Him, and will enjoy the everlasting vision of Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness...the bestowal of which is conditional on the substantiation and recognition of righteousness...a crown among the righteous." 
2. "There is no sort of inconsistency here with the doctrines of grace...it is not easy to say how righteousness can [constitute the crown]." 
3. "The Lord shall award me in that day, the righteous judge...not only to me, but also to all who have loved His appearing."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The reward is in recognition of righteousness wrought in Paul by God's Spirit; the crown is prepared for the righteous; but it is a crown which consists in righteousness."
2. "A man is justified gratuitously by the merits of Christ through faith; and when he is so justified God accepts his works and honors them with a reward which is not their due, but is given of grace."
3. "The righteous heavenly Judge stands in contrast to the unrighteous earthly judges who condemned Paul."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "It was not the crown of ambition; it was not a garland won in struggles for earthly distinction; it was that which was the appropriate reward of his efforts to be personally holy, and to spread the principles of holiness as far as possible through the world."
3. "No matter how numerous the competitors, or how worthy any one of them may be, or how pre-eminent above his brethren, yet all may obtain the prize; all may be crowned with a diadem of life, of equal brilliancy."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Henceforth, there is laid up...a crown of righteousness." 
2. "Judge...shall give...at that day."

### John Calvin:
1. "This certainty arises from turning his eyes to the day of the resurrection, and this is what we also ought to do... hold out to our minds the coming of Christ." 
2. "Justification by free grace... perfectly agree... for as soon as God has received us into favor, he likewise accepts our works, so as even to deign to give them a reward, though it is not due to them."
3. "And not to me only... he invites them to a participation of the crown... the same hope of obtaining the crown had not been held out to us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A crown of righteousness." Better, 'the crown.' The force of the genitive may be either that perfect righteousness constitutes the crown, as 'glory' in 1 Peter 5:4, and 'life' in James 1:12; or else, and perhaps preferably, that it is the crown belonging to righteousness.
2. The Lord is, of course, the Lord Jesus.

2. "The righteous judge, the umpire who makes no mistakes, who judges us all." 
3. "But also to all them that have loved his appearing, who have loved and still love his second coming."

### John Gill:
1. "The happiness of the future state of the saints is signified by a crown, on account of the glory and excellency of it..."
2. "[The crown] is God the Father's free gift unto his children, what they are born heirs unto, and have a meetness for, through regenerating and sanctifying grace, and have a legal title to it through the righteousness of Christ."
3. "Christ will appear unto salvation to them, and so to their joy; they will appear with him in glory, and be like him, and enjoy the everlasting vision of him."

### John Wesley:
1. "The crown of that righteousness - Which God has imputed to me and wrought in me."
2. "Will render to all â€” This increases the joy of Paul, and encourages Timotheus. Many of these St. Paul himself had gained."
3. "That have loved his appearing â€” Which only a real Christian can do. I say a real Christian, to comply with the mode of the times: else they would not understand, although the word Christian necessarily implies whatsoever is holy, as God is holy. Strictly speaking, to join real or sincere to a word of so complete an import, is grievously to debase its noble signification, and is like adding long to eternity or wide to immensity."
