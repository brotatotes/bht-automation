### Albert Barnes:
1. "Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me - As soon as possible."
2. "Timothy had been Paulâ€™s traveling companion, and was his intimate friend."
3. "It is evident from this that he did not regard him as the prelatical 'bishop of the church of the Ephesians,' or consider that he was so confined to that place in his labors, that he was not also to go to other places if he was called in the providence of God."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "As he knew that the time of his death was at hand, there were many subjects â€” I doubt not â€” on which he wished to have a personal interview with Timothy for the good of the Church."
2. "Undoubtedly there must have been no trivial reason why he called him away from a church over which he presided, and at so great a distance."
3. "Hence we may infer how highly important are conferences between such persons; for what Timothy had learned in a short space of time would be profitable, for a long period, to all the churches; so that the loss of half a year, or even of a whole year, was trivial compared with the compensation gained."

### John Gill:
1. "From Ephesus, where Timothy was, to Rome, where the apostle was; and this request did not arise purely from a desire of seeing Timothy, as in 2 Timothy 1:4 but rather because he had some things to say to him, relating to the care of the churches and the good of the interest of Christ, which he chose not to write with ink and paper."
2. "He desires the rather that he would use diligence, and hasten his coming to him; partly because winter was coming on, when travelling would not be so safe and comfortable, 2 Timothy 4:21 and partly because the time of his death was at hand, 2 Timothy 4:7."
3. "Also because he was almost alone."

### John Wesley:
1. Come to me â€” Both that he might comfort him, and be strengthened by him. Timotheus himself is said to have suffered at Ephesus.
