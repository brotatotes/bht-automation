# 3 John 1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The recipient of the letter, Caius, is described as beloved and loved in the truth. This expression of endearment highlights the writer's strong affection and genuine love for him. Caius is known for his character, being well-beloved by God, Jesus Christ, and his fellow brethren. His reputation reflects grace, prosperity of the soul, and a commitment to living in truth. It is possible that Caius is the same person mentioned by Paul in Romans 16:23, indicating a connection between the two letters. The letter might have been sent to Corinth or Caius might have relocated from Achaia to Asia.
