# 3 John 10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Diotrephes, in his arrogance, spoke malicious words against the apostle and the missionaries, attempting to justify his own actions and discredit their ministry. It is not uncommon for those who oppose the gospel to slander and gossip about the ministers of God's Word. However, these empty words hold no weight against the truth and the faithful service of those who proclaim it.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I will remember...before all by stigmatizing and punishing."
2. "The brethren" are the missionaries on their journey.
3. "Diotrephes possibly stood at the head of this party, which fact, as well as this domineering spirit, may account for his hostility to the missionaries, and to the apostle John, who had, by the power of love, tried to harmonize the various elements in the Asiatic churches."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He would punish his arrogance and presumption; would take measures that he should be dealt with in a proper manner."
2. "If it was the duty of the church to have received these men, who had been thus recommended to them, and it had been prevented from doing what it would otherwise have done, by the influence of one man, then it was proper that the influence of that man should be restrained, and that the church should see that he was not to control it."
3. "No one can show that this was not all that the apostle proposed to do, or that any feelings of private vindictiveness entered into his purpose to remember what Diotrephes had done."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Prating [φλυαρων] . From fluw to bubble up or boil over. Hence of talk which is both fluent and empty."
2. "Compare the kindred adjective fluaroi tattlers, 1 Timothy 5:13."
3. "Casteth them out. By excommunication, which, through his influence, he had power to bring about."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We mark here the same tone of faithful sternness which pervades the two other Epistles: in these, however, as against those who assailed the truth, in this against one who invades the order of the church."
2. "I will bring to remembrance before the church, his works which he doeth: not merely his prating against us with malicious words, as reported by the evangelists, but his actions, of more importance to the apostle than any words spoken against himself merely."
3. "He casteth them out who would receive the brethren: by using his influence to have them cut off from the Christian society, whether by formal excommunication or otherwise."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The aged apostle is not afraid of Diotrephes and here defies him." 
2. "Not simply foolish chatter, but malevolent words."
3. "John knows that the conduct of Diotrephes will not stand the light."

### John Gill:
1. "It is a common thing for ministers of the Gospel to be prated against, not only by the men of the world, but by professors of religion, and by such who call themselves preachers also; nor need it be wondered at..." 
2. "And what is said against Christ's ministers is no other than prating; silly, idle, trifling, and empty stuff..." 
3. "But he did not receive them into his house, and entertain them as he ought to have done; for a minister of the Gospel, and a pastor of a church, ought to be hospitable, and given to hospitality..."

### John Wesley:
1. He prateth against us — Both them and me, thereby endeavouring to excuse himself.
