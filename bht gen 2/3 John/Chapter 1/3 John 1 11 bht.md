# 3 John 11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Beloved, imitate not the evil actions of Diotrephes, but instead seek to imitate the good actions of Demetrius. Those who do evil, who follow the ways of darkness, have not truly seen or experienced the presence of God. However, those who do good, who walk in righteousness and show love to others, are truly born of God and reflect His character.
