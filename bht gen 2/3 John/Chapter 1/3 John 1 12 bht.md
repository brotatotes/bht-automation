# 3 John 12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Demetrius, the individual mentioned here, is commended for his good reputation among both believers and the broader community. His upright character and acts of kindness have earned him a favorable testimonial from those who have witnessed his conduct. This testimony, aligned with the truth of God's Word, serves as a reliable endorsement of Demetrius. Moreover, John himself can vouch for Demetrius, adding his own testimony alongside the others. Such overwhelming affirmation showcases the genuine and honorable nature of Demetrius' walk in the truth.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The objective Truth of God, which is the divine rule of the walk of all believers, gives a good testimony to him who really walks in the truth."
2. "It was the mirror in which the walk of Demetrius was reflected: and his form, thus seen in the mirror of God‚Äôs Truth, in which the perfect form of Christ is held up to us, appeared in the likeness of Christ."
3. "The contrast here is between his own personal testimony and the two testimonies foregoing."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Gospel standard of truth bears witness to him that he walks conformably to it, in acts of real love, hospitality to the brethren (in contrast to Diotrephes), etc."
2. "He that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in God."
3. "Besides the testimony of 'all men,' and 'of the truth itself.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Demetrius hath good report of all men - Little is known of Demetrius...It is the use of the phrase 'hath good report of all,' implying that some testimony was borne to his character beyond what the writer personally knew."
2. "And of the truth itself - Not only by men, who might possibly be deceived in the estimate of character, but by fact. It was not merely a reputation founded on what 'appeared' in his conduct, but in truth and reality."
3. "Yea, and we also bear record - John himself had personally known him...and could now add his own testimony, which no one would call in question, to his excellent character."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Demetrius hath good report [Œ¥Œ∑ŒºŒ∑œÑœÅŒπœâ ŒºŒµŒºŒ±œÅœÑœÖœÅŒ∑œÑŒ±Œπ] . Lit., unto Demetrius witness hath been born. See John 3:26.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Demetrius hath the witness of all men... we know nothing else about him, unless... he may indeed be the bearer of this letter from Ephesus to Gaius and may also have come under suspicion for some reason and hence John's warm commendation." 
2. "And of the truth itself... it is possible... that John means the Holy Spirit and not a mere personification of the truth." 
3. "Yea we also... a third witness to Demetrius, that is John himself... John knew Demetrius well in Ephesus."

### John Gill:
1. "He [Demetrius] was either the same with Demas, which is a contraction of this name, or the person that John sent from Ephesus with this letter: we read of an Ephesian of this name, Acts 19:24; though not the same person; or else one that also was a member of the same church with Gaius and Diotrephes; and he being kind and beneficent, obtained a good report of the generality of men, not only of the brethren, but of those that were without; for a liberal man is universally respected."

### John Wesley:
1. And from the truth itself ‚Äî That is, what they testify is the very truth.Yea, we also bear testimony ‚Äî I and they that are with me.
