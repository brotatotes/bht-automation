# 3 John 14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The message emphasizes the significance of cultivating strong relationships and friendships within the community of believers. Just as the apostle yearned for a face-to-face encounter with his dear friend, we too should cherish the opportunity to connect with others on a personal level. The salutation of peace, reminiscent of the Jewish greeting, signifies a desire for overall prosperity and harmony. It encourages us to acknowledge and greet our friends individually, recognizing their value and contribution within the family of God.
