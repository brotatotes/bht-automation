# 3 John 5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Beloved, in all your actions, may you do them faithfully and with integrity, truly exemplifying what it means to be a person of faith. May your works not be driven by a desire for human recognition, but rather motivated by love and a genuine desire to bring glory to God. Just as Gaius was known for his gracious hospitality towards strangers, may you also extend kindness and generosity to those in need, demonstrating hospitality with sincerity and genuine care.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "faithfully— an act becoming a faithful man."
2. "whatsoever thou doest— a distinct Greek word from the former 'doest': translate, 'workest': whatsoever work, or labor of love, thou dost perform. So, 'She hath wrought a good work upon me.'"
3. "and to strangers— The oldest manuscripts, 'and that (that is, and those brethren) strangers.' The fact of the brethren whom thou didst entertain being 'strangers,' enhances the love manifested in the act."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Beloved, thou doest faithfully -...he had fully, in that respect, done his duty as a Christian."
2. "Whatsoever thou doest - In all your contact with them, and in all your conduct toward them."
3. "To the brethren - Probably to Christians who were well known to him... And to strangers - Such as had gone to the church... with a letter of commendation from John."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Thou doest a faithful work." 
2. "Ergazomai, like prassein, contemplates the process rather than the end of action, carrying the ideas of continuity and repetition. It means to labor, to be active, to perform, with the idea of continued exertion, and therefore is used of servants, or of those who have an assigned business or office." 
3. "The best texts read, instead of eijv touv to the (strangers), touto, that; so that the sentence is, literally, 'to them that are brethren, and that strangers.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A faithful work."
2. "In whatsoever thou doest."
3. "And strangers withal."

### John Gill:
1. "Beloved, thou doest faithfully,.... Or a faithful thing, and as became a faithful man, a believer in Christ; in all his beneficence and charity he acted the upright part."
2. "He did not do it in an hypocritical way, to be seen of men, and gain applause from them, but from a principle of love, and with a view to the glory of God."

### John Wesley:
