# 3 John 7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The missionaries went forth to preach the gospel, and they did so for the sake of the Name, which represents the essence of the Christian creed. It was important for them to be regarded highly and not seen as seeking their own worldly interest. By taking nothing of the Gentiles, they avoided being a stumbling block in the way of the Gospel and ensured that they were not chargeable to those they were ministering to. Their primary concern was for the good of souls and the glory of Christ.
