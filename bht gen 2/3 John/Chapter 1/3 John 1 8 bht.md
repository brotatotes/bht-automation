# 3 John 8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We ought to receive and support those who preach the truth with kindness and generosity. Just as the apostle and Gaius welcomed and provided for them, we should open our homes to these preachers and supply their needs when they depart. By doing so, we become fellow helpers in spreading the Gospel and contributing to the work of proclaiming the truth to the world. Some help by using their gifts in preaching, while others assist by providing financial support for those who labor in the word and doctrine.
