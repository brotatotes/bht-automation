# 3 John 9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
There were individuals in the church who desired to have authority and preeminence, governing according to their own will. This ambitious spirit is dangerous, as it paves the way for false teachings and the rise of antichrist. Christians should be vigilant, guarding against those who seek power and status within the church, as the mystery of iniquity is already at work.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "That Epistle was not designed by the Spirit for the universal Church, or else it would have been preserved unto the church."
2. "Evidently occupying a high place in the Church where Gaius was."
3. "Receiveth us not - virtually, namely, by not receiving with love the brethren whom we recommended to be received."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The fair and obvious interpretation of the Greek word used by the apostle, (ἔγραψα egrapsa,) without that particle, is, I 'wrote' - implying that it had been already done."
2. "The presumption, from the phrase 'who loveth to have the pre-eminence,' would rather seem to be that he was an aspiring man, arrogating rights which he did not have, and assuming authority to which he was not entitled by virtue of any office."
3. "Whatever was the cause, the case furnishes an illustration of the bad influence of one ambitious and arrogant man in a church."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "I wrote unto the Church. The best texts insert ti somewhat, which indicates that the apostle did not regard the communication as specially important."
2. "Diotrephes [διοτρεφης]. The name is from Diov of Zeus (Jove), and trefw to nourish, and means Jove - nursed."
3. "Who loveth to have the pre - eminence [ο φιλοπρωτευων]. From the adjective filoprwtov fond of being first. The word occurs here only."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I wrote somewhat to the church: not meaning either important or unimportant, but touching the maintenance of the evangelists."
2. "Diotrephes, who loveth to have the pre-eminence among them, the members of the church, receiveth us not."
3. "The evangelists had reported to St. John that neither his authority nor his letter was honored by Diotrephes; that he rejected both, and spoke against the apostle publicly in a church which was almost entirely under his influence."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Not epistolary aorist nor a reference to II John as Findlay holds, but an allusion to a brief letter of commendation."
2. "Διοτρεφες (Διος and τρεφω, nourished by Zeus). This ambitious leader and sympathiser with the Gnostics would probably prevent the letter referred to being read to the church."
3. "This ambition of Diotrephes does not prove that he was a bishop over elders, as was true in the second century (as Ignatius shows). He may have been an elder (bishop) or deacon, but clearly desired to rule the whole church."

### John Gill:
1. "Diotrephes gave no heed to what he had wrote, suppressed his letter, and would not suffer it to be read to the brethren."
2. "This ambitious spirit prevailed and obtained among the false teachers, who set up themselves at the head of parties, and above the apostles of Christ, and paved the way for antichrist."


### John Wesley:
1. "Who loveth to have the preeminence among them."
2. "To govern all things according to his own will."
3. "So did the mystery of iniquity already work!"
