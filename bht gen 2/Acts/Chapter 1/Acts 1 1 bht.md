## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Whatever latitude may be given to this word, it must at all events exclude the notion that Luke had at this time seen the Gospels of Matt. or Mark, in which many things which Jesus did and taught are contained, which he had not related in his πρῶτος λόγος." 
2. "Its position here shews that it is emphatic, and the parallel cases all point to a distinct and appropriate meaning for the word." 
3. "That meaning here seems to be, that the Gospel contained the ἀρχάς, the outset, of all the doings and teachings of our Lord, as distinguished from this second treatise, which was to relate their sequel and results."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "a very important statement, dividing the work of Christ into two great branches: the one embracing His work on earth, the other His subsequent work from heaven"
2. "the one complete when He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, the other to continue till His second appearing"
3. "all the subsequent labors of the apostles are just an exhibition of the ministry of the glorified Redeemer Himself because they were acting under His authority, and He was the principle that operated in them all"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Since this book was written to the same individual as the former, it was evidently written with the same design to furnish an authentic and full narrative of events concerning which there would be many imperfect and exaggerated accounts."
2. "Since these events pertained to the descent of the Spirit, to the spread of the gospel, to the organization of the church [...] it was of great importance that a fair and full narrative of these things should be preserved."
3. "The record of these events preserved in the sacred narrative is one of the greatest blessings that God has conferred on mankind."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The history of the Church was under the immediate control of the exalted Redeemer, and may justly be considered as the continuation in heaven of the work which he had begun on earth."
2. "Thus the history which follows is linked to, or (may I not rather say) welded with, the past; and the founding of the Church in the earth is presented as one continuous work, begun by the Lord in person, and perfected by the same Lord through the ministry of men."
3. "The former treatise 'delivered to us, not all that Jesus did and taught, but 'all that Jesus began to do and teach until the day when he was taken up.' The following writings appear intended to give us, and do, in fact, profess to give us, that which Jesus continued to do and teach after the day in which he was taken up."

### John Calvin:
1. "The sum of the gospel consisteth of these two parts, namely, of the doctrine of Christ, and of his acts."
2. "For this is a holy knot which no man may dissolve."
3. "It is, therefore, manifest that those works and sayings only which make any thing unto the sum of our salvation are noted in this place."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The writer of this most ancient fragment shows that this limitation must have been laid down by St. Luke, for he specially records how the martyrdom of Peter and the journey of Paul to Spain are both omitted in the history."
2. "The position this book occupied from the very early days of Christianity in the teaching of the Church, leads us to conclude that it must tell the story of some peculiar and critical period in the Church’s history, that it must relate some all-important and vital developments of Christian practice and government."
3. "These opening words with which St. Luke commences the ‘Acts’ throw light upon the whole book. They at once remove the first impression which leads men to view the Acts of the Apostles as detached memoirs, or a recital deeply interesting containing inspired utterances, but on the whole as disconnected, without any set defined purpose."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Acts of the Apostles (Πραξεις αποστολων) is the reading of B D (Aleph in subscription) Athanasius, Origen, Tertullian, Cyprian, Eusebius, Cyril of Jerusalem, Theodoret, Hilary."
2. "The former treatise  (τον μεν πρωτον). Literally, the first treatise. The use of the superlative is common enough and by no means implies, though it allows, a third volume."
3. "The Acts, according to Luke, is a continuation of the doings and teachings of Jesus."

### John Gill:
1. "This is a summary of his former treatise, his Gospel, which gave an account of what Christ began to do, and did; not of the common and private actions of his life; or of what was done, either in public, or private, throughout the whole of his life..."
2. "...but of his extraordinary actions, of the miracles he wrought; and these not all, and everyone of them; but many of them, and which were sufficient to prove him the Messiah; and particularly of all things he did relating to the salvation of his people..."
3. "...of his sufferings and death, how that thereby he made full atonement for sin, brought in an everlasting righteousness, and obtained eternal redemption for his people..."
