# Acts 1:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples were completely engrossed in watching Jesus ascend into heaven, their gaze fixed upon him with deep curiosity and longing. Even as the cloud enveloped him, they kept their eyes trained towards the sky, as if hoping to catch another glimpse of him. They were so captivated by this extraordinary sight that they continued to look upward until Jesus disappeared from view. In this awe-inspiring moment, two angels in shining white garments appeared alongside them, their presence serving as a symbol of their purity and glory.
