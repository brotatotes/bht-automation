# Acts 1:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The angels gently rebuked the disciples for their longing for the physical presence of Jesus, reminding them that seeking Him in such a way would not bring them closer to Him. Instead, they were called to have faith and not desire His bodily presence on earth. Furthermore, the angels emphasized the importance of the disciples' mission, instructing them to wait in Jerusalem until they received the Holy Spirit. As for His second coming, it was reiterated that Jesus would return in the same human form, in the clouds of heaven, and with His mighty angels, just as He had ascended.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There is a propriety in the address, ἄνδρ . Γαλιλαῖοι . It served to remind them of their origin, their call to be His disciples, and the duty of obedience to Him resting on them in consequence."
2. "οὕτως, i.e. ἐν νεφέλῃ, Luke 21:27 [in the clouds of heaven: and in the same human form]. His corporeal identity is implied in οὗτος ὁ Ἰησοῦς."
3. "‘Non ii, qui ascendentem viderunt, dicuntur venturum visuri. Inter ascensionem et inter adventum gloriosum nullus interponitur eventus eorum utrique par: ideo hi duo conjunguntur. Merito igitur Apostoli ante datam Apocalypsin diem Christi ut valde propinquum proposuerunt. Et congruit majestati Christi, ut toto inter ascensionem et inter adventum tempore sine intermissione expectetur.’ Bengel."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "as if your now glorified Head
were gone from you never to return: He is coming again not another,
but 'this same Jesus'; and 'as ye have seen Him go, in the like
manner shall He come'—as personally, as visibly, as
gloriously; and let the joyful expectation of this coming
swallow up the sorrow of that departure."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The same Jesus - This was said to comfort them. The same tried friend who had been so faithful to them would return. They ought not, therefore, to look with despondency at his departure."
2. "Shall so come - At the day of judgment. John 14:3, 'if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again,' etc."
3. "The great transactions of redemption have been public, open, often grand. The apostasy was public, in the face of angels and of the universe... Hence, he will come with clouds - with angels - with fire - and will raise the dead, and exhibit to all the universe the amazing close of the scheme of redemption."

### John Calvin:
1. "Let us first learn out of this place that we must not seek Christ either in heaven, either upon earth, otherwise than by faith; and also, that we must not desire to have him present with us bodily in the world; for he that doth either of those two shall oftentimes go farther from him." 
2. "The angels' intent was to call back the apostles from desiring the carnal presence of Christ. For this purpose was it that they said that he should not come again until he came to judge the world."
3. "The only looking for Christ's coming must both restrain the importunate desires of our flesh, and support our patience in all our adversities; and, lastly, it must refresh our weariness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The angels...gently reprove these loving followers of Jesus, who remained gazing upwards, not without a hope He might reappear."
2. "Their duty now was not quiet contemplation and still waiting, but real earnest work."
3. "It is a reproof which belongs to all ages of the Christian Church."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This Jesus. Qui vobis fuit eritque semper Jesus, id est, Salvator."  (Corn. a Lapide). The personal name assures them that Jesus will always be in heaven a personal friend and divine Saviour (Knowling).
