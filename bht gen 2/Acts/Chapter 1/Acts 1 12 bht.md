# Acts 1:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The distance of a Sabbath-day's journey was usually considered to be about two thousand cubits, which is less than a mile. This measurement was not stipulated in the Mosaic law, but it was a tradition observed by the Jews. The disciples had traveled from Jerusalem to the mount called Olivet, which was a place frequented by Jesus. From there, Jesus ascended to heaven, leaving the disciples gazing intently at His departure. The mention of this specific distance in the text adds credibility to the historical account.
