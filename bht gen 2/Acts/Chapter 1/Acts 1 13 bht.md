# Acts 1:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples found themselves in an upper room, a private chamber in the highest part of a house, commonly used by the Jews for prayer. It is likely that this upper room was the same place where they had celebrated the last Supper with Jesus. The room provided a secluded and suitable space for them to gather for devotion and religious conversations. Despite their previous doubts and faults, the disciples were now reunited, firm in their faith, and eagerly awaiting the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word ὑπερῷον huperoōn, here translated “upper room,” occurs only four times in the New Testament: Acts 9:37, “She (Dorcas) was sick and died; whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper chamber” (see also Acts 9:39); Acts 20:8, “And there were many lights in the upper chamber where they were gathered together.” The room so designated was an upper chamber used for devotion, or as a place where to lay the dead before burial, or occasionally for conversation, etc."
2. "Here it evidently means the place where they were assembled for devotion."
3. "Such a room as that here referred to was a part of every house, especially in Jerusalem; and the disciples probably selected one where they might be together, and yet so retired that they might be safe from the Jews."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "An upper room [το υπερωον] . With the article, denoting some well-known place of resort."
2. "It was the name given to the room directly under the flat roof."
3. "In such an apartment Paul delivered his farewell address at Troas (Acts 20:8), and the body of Dorcas was laid (Acts 9:37)."

### John Calvin:
1. "Too, too ridiculous are the Papists, which go about to prove Peter his supremacy hereby, because he is reckoned up first of all the apostles."
2. "But if he be, therefore, the chief of all the apostles, because his name is first in the catalogue of the apostles’ names, I will again conclude, that the mother of Christ was inferior unto all the rest of the women, because she is [here] reckoned the last; which they will in no case admit, as indeed it were a thing too absurd."
3. "Because the disciples had fallen away, and filthily fled from their Master Christ, every man whither fear did drive him, they did deserve to be deprived of honor. Therefore, that we may know that by the appointment of the Lord they were gathered together again, Luke reckoneth up all their names." (126 words)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is hardly likely that the priests, bitterly hostile as they were to Jesus, would have allowed His followers the use of any room in the temple."
