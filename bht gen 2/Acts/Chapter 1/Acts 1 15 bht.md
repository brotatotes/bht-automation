# Acts 1:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During the days between the Ascension and Pentecost, the assembly grew, not by new conversions, but by those who had been disciples. The Holy Spirit stirred within Peter, the leading spirit of the community. The number of people gathered in the upper room was about one hundred and twenty, including the apostles and disciples. This number was significant as it represented a complete and perfect start, symbolizing the gathering of all the tribes of Israel unto one faith. It is evident that the election of ministers and pastors should be done by the church, not by external entities or patrons.
