### Henry Alford:
1. "We may enquire, by what change in mind and power Peter was able, before the descent of the Spirit, thus authoritatively to speak of Scripture and the divine purposes?"
2. "The answer will be found in the peculiar gift of the Spirit to the Apostles, John 20:21; John 20:23; where see note."

3. "A man will be just as free in wickedness if it be foretold that he will be wicked, as if it had never been known to any other being but himself."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "This scripture. The best texts substitute the. See on Mark 12:10."
3. "The Holy Ghost [το πνευμα το % αγιον]. Lit., The Spirit, the Holy. Guide. See on lead, Luke 6:39."

2. "We ought to attribute this honor unto the prophecies of the Scriptures, that they are able to appease all such fear as we conceive of the sudden event of things." 
3. "Such manner of speeches bring greater reverence to the Scriptures, whilst we are taught by them that David and all the rest of the prophets did speak only as they were directed by the Holy Ghost; so that they themselves were not the authors of their prophecies, but the Spirit which used their tongues as an instrument."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Guided by the Holy Spirit, St. Peter finds... an injunction to proceed to the election of another to make up the number of the Twelve."
