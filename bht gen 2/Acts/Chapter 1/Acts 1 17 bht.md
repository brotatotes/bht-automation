# Acts 1:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Judas, one of the chosen apostles, held a significant role within the ministry of Jesus. He was numbered among the twelve to fill the empty place, emphasizing the importance of maintaining the fullness of their number. Although his later betrayal was undoubtedly shocking, it is worth noting that Judas actively participated in the ministry alongside the other apostles. He preached, performed miracles, and even served as the treasurer for Jesus and His disciples. The fact that Judas obtained this ministry by divine appointment further highlights the significance of his role within the group.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
