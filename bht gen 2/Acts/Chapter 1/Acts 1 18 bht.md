# Acts 1:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage reveals that a field was acquired through the profit gained from an immoral act. Some interpretations propose that the purchase might have been executed by another individual with the betrayer's funds. In addition, it is indicated that Judas met his demise by falling facedown, potentially due to the rope snapping before or during his death.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The various attempts to reconcile the two narratives, which may be seen in most of our English commentaries, are among the saddest examples of the shifts to which otherwise high-minded men are driven by an unworthy system."
2. "That there should have been a double account actually current of the death of Judas at this early period is in the highest degree improbable, and will only be assumed by those who take a very low view of the accuracy of the Evangelists."
3. "It is obvious that, while the general term used by Matthew points mainly at self-murder, the account given here does not preclude the catastrophe related having happened, in some way, as a divine judgment, during the suicidal attempt." 

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 18. falling headlong, &c.—This
	information supplements, but by no means contradicts, what is said in
	Matthew 27:5.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A man is said often to do a thing when he furnishes means for doing it." 
2. "The reward of iniquity - The price which he had for that deed of stupendous wickedness - the betraying of the Lord Jesus."
3. "And falling headlong - The word here rendered 'headlong' - πρηνής prēnēs (Latin 'pronus,' whence our English word 'prone') - means properly 'bent forward, head-foremost'; and the idea is, that his position in hanging himself was such that when the cord broke he fell headlong, or fell forward on his face."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Purchased [εκτησατο]. See on possess, Luke 18:12. Better, as Rev., obtained."
2. "Judas did not purchase the field, but the priests did with the money which he returned to them (Matthew 27:7)."
3. "The expression means merely that the field was purchased with the money of Judas."

### John Calvin:
1. "His burial was the perpetual note of ignominy; was the reward which he had for his falsehood and wicked act."
2. "The very common name of the field should be a note of infamy for the priests, which had bought (the) innocent blood of [from] the traitor."
3. "In that Psalm is contained the common image of the whole Church, which is the body of the Son of God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Falling headlong (πρηνης γενομενος). Attic form usually πρανης. The word means, not 'headlong,' but 'flat on the face' as opposed to υπτιος on the back (Hackett)."
2. "Hackett observes that the place suits admirably the idea that Judas hung himself (Matthew 27:5) and, the rope breaking, fell flat on his face and burst asunder in the midst (ελακησεν μεσος)."
3. "Gushed out (εξεχυθη). First aorist passive indicative of εκχεω, to pour out."

### John Gill:
1. "The Ethiopic version calls this field, 'a vineyard'; and so it might be, and yet the potter's field too...or he may be said to purchase it because it was purchased with his money."
2. "And falling headlong he burst in the midst; either falling from the gallows, or tree on which he hanged himself, the rope breaking, upon a stone, or stump, his belly was broke, and burst."
3. "As to the seeming difference between the Evangelist Matthew and the Apostle Peter, it may be reconciled by either of the ways before mentioned...or he might be cast down from hence by men, either of themselves, or by the order of the civil magistrates."

### John Wesley:
1. "This man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity." 
2. "A field was purchased with the reward of his iniquity."
3. "Falling down on his face — It seems the rope broke before, or as he died."
