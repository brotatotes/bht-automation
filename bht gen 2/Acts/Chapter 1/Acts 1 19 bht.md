# Acts 1:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During those days of expectant prayer, the Holy Ghost was stirring within Peter, the leading spirit of the emerging Christian community. The scene in the temple, the purchase of the field, and the name Aceldama, meaning the field of blood, were widely known to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. Aceldama served as a burial place for strangers, reminding them of the guilt of Judas, who betrayed Jesus for thirty pieces of silver. The name Aceldama carried a double emphasis, signifying both the blood price paid for Christ's betrayal and the possibility that it was the location of Judas' death.

### John Gill:
1. "And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem,.... As that he betrayed Jesus of Nazareth into the hands of the chief priests, for thirty pieces of silver; that this was the reward of his iniquity; and that with this a field was purchased for the burying of strangers in; and that he died in such a miserable way."
2. "there was scarce an inhabitant in Jerusalem but knew all this, insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue; or 'in their own dialect', the 'Jerusalem dialect'"
3. "because it was bought with the price of Christ's blood: and if, as some say, Judas hanged him self here, or was thrown headlong here by Satan, and that this was the place where his bowels gushed out; then it may be likewise so called, because it was sprinkled with his blood."

### John Wesley:
1. "That is, the field of blood, St. Luke seems to have added to the words of St. Peter, for the use of Theophilus and other readers who did not understand Hebrew."
