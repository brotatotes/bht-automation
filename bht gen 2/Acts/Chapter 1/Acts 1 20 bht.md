# Acts 1:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The usage of certain words in this passage is significant, such as habitation which conveys the defeat of the enemies in the psalmist's dwelling place. The term bishopric refers not specifically to a bishop, but to the office or overseership. This psalm is often seen as Messianic and can be applied to both Judas and the Messiah, highlighting their roles as betrayers and persecuted individuals respectively. The citations are taken from the Septuagint, indicating the freedom of the Apostle in quoting from the Greek translation of the Old Testament.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Apostle applies eminently to [Judas] the words which in the Psalm are spoken in the plural of all such enemies."
2. "The same is true of Psalms 109:0, and there one adversary is even more pointedly marked out."
3. "The citations are freely from the LXX."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 20. his bishopric—or "charge."
	The words are a combination of Psalms 69:25;
	Psalms 109:8; in which the apostle
	discerns a greater than David, and a worse than Ahithophel and his
	fellow conspirators against David.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The term 'habitation,' in the Psalm, means evidently the dwelling-place of the enemies of the writer of the Psalm. It is an image expressive of their overthrow and defeat by a just God."
2. "If the Psalm was originally composed with reference to the Messiah and his sufferings, the expression here was not intended to denote Judas in particular, but one of his foes who was to meet the just punishment of rejecting, betraying, and murdering him."
3. "And as the office had now become vacant by the death of Judas, and according to one declaration in the Psalms, so, according to another, it was proper that it should be conferred on some other person."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Habitation [επαυλις] . Only here in New Testament. The word is used in classical Greek of a place for cattle."
2. "Bishopric [επισκοπην] . See on 1 Peter 2:12. Rev., better, office, with overseership in margin. Compare Luke 19:44."
3. "Another [ετερος] . And different person. See on ch. Acts 2:4."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Acts 1:69 is often quoted as Messianic in Matthew and John."
2. "His habitation (η επαυλις αυτου). Only here in the N.T., a country house, cottage, cabin."
3. "His office (την επισκοπην αυτου). Our word bishopric (Authorized Version) is from this word, office of bishop (επισχοπος). Only that is not the idea here, but over-seership (επι, σκοπεω) or office as in 1 Peter 2:12."

### John Gill:
1. "The psalm, out of which these words are cited, is a psalm concerning the Messiah, and there are many passages cited out of it in the New Testament, and applied to him, or referred unto."
2. "The poverty and distress he submitted to; the griefs and sorrows which he bore; the fatigues he underwent at his examination; and the weakness of body he was then reduced to, as well as the reproach cast upon him on the cross, when his enemies shook their heads at him, are in a very lively manner described."
3. "That this psalm refers to Judas Iscariot, and to his affair, was so clear a point with the ancients, that they used to call it the Iscariotic Psalm."

### John Wesley:
1. His bishopric — That is, his apostleship. Psalm 69:25.
