# Acts 1:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Lord Jesus, during His time on earth, constantly interacted with His disciples, fostering a close relationship with them. His going in and out among them demonstrated His intimate involvement in their lives. As their Master, He guided and led them, fulfilling the divine will and purpose. This aligns with the prophecy that another should take the charge of Judas and continue the ministry. The choice of a replacement was necessary to ensure the fulfillment of God's plan and the ongoing work of spreading the Gospel.
