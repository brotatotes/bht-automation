# Acts 1:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
From the beginning of Jesus' ministry, starting with His baptism by John, to the time of His ascension, it was important to choose someone who had been a faithful follower, witnessing His teachings and miracles. This chosen one would become a witness, along with the Apostles, of the resurrection of Jesus and all the events surrounding it. Being an eyewitness of the resurrection was crucial in order to join the Apostles in testifying to the truth of the resurrection.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The baptism of John, as a well-known date, including of course the opening event of our Lord's ministry, His own baptism."
2. "This one event was the passage-point between the Lord's life of humiliation and His life of glory, the completion of His work below and beginning of His work above."
3. "It is remarkable that Peter here lays down experience of matters of fact, not eminence in any subjective grace or quality, as the condition of Apostleship."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Beginning from the baptism of John—by whom our Lord was not only Himself baptized, but first officially announced and introduced to his own disciples."
2. "Unto that same day when he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection—How clearly is the primary office of the apostles here expressed: (1) to testify, from personal observation, to the one great fact of 'the resurrection of the Lord Jesus'; (2) to show how this glorified His whole previous life, of which they were constant observers, and established His divine claims."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "During all the time in which the Lord Jesus, beginning (his ministry) at the time when he was baptized by John, went in and out among us, until the time when he was taken up" 
2. "From those who had during that time been the constant companions of the Lord Jesus must one be taken, who would thus be a witness of his whole ministry." 
3. "It is fit or proper that one should be ordained...The reason why it was proper that he should be taken from the seventy disciples was, that they had been particularly distinguished by Jesus himself, and had been witnesses of most of his public life."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Witness [μαρτυρα] . One who shall bear testimony : not a spectator, a mistake often made on Hebrews 12:1. Compare Acts 2:32.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The ministry of Jesus began with the ministry of John."
2. "The one chosen should be a personal witness who can speak from his own experience of the ministry, resurrection, and ascension of the Lord Jesus."
3. "One can easily see that this qualification will soon put an end to those who bear such personal testimony."

### John Gill:
1. "Now Peter moves, that one who had been so early a follower of Christ, who had heard his excellent discourses, and seen his miracles, and who had steadfastly and constantly adhered to him, might be chosen in the room of Judas." 
2. "The end of this choice was, to be a witness with us of his resurrection; the resurrection of Christ from the dead, which supposes his incarnation and life, and so his obedience, ministry, and miracles in it; and also his sufferings and death, with all the benefits and advantages thereof."
3. "It was necessary that one should be chosen, and joined with them, who had been with them, and with Jesus, from the beginning, to the time of his ascension; and who was an eyewitness of his resurrection, that he might join with the apostles in their testimony."

### John Wesley:
1. To be a witness with us of his resurrection — And of the circumstances which preceded and followed it.
