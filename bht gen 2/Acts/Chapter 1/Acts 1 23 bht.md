# Acts 1:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The assembly of believers carefully selected two individuals, Joseph Barsabbas and Matthias, to potentially fill the vacant apostolic position. They sought to make a decision that not only reflected their own judgment, but also sought the divine will of God. Recognizing the significance of this choice, they resorted to the casting of lots, entrusting the outcome to the decision of God. This method allowed them to go beyond the limitations of human reasoning and seek divine guidance in this important matter.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In all probability both the selected persons (see Eus [10] i. 12) belonged to the number of the Seventy, as it would be natural that the candidates for apostleship should be chosen from among those who had been already distinguished by Christ Himself among the brethren."
2. "Justus is a Roman cognomen, assumed according to a custom then prevalent."
3. "Μαθθίαν ] Nothing historical is known of him. Traditionally, according to Nicephorus (H. E. ii. 40, Winer), he suffered martyrdom in Æthiopia; according to others, in Colchis (Menolog. Græc. iii. 198, Winer): another account (Perionii Vitæ Apost. p. 178 sqq., Winer) makes him preach in Judæa and be stoned by the Jews."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "They appointed - 'put up' in nomination; meaning not the Eleven but the whole company, of whom Peter was the spokesman."

2. "Like as the dignity of this function was excellent, so was it meet that in the choosing of Matthias, the chief judgment should be left unto God, however men did their duty."
3. "I say, therefore, that they went this way to work, being moved by the Spirit, like as they were directed in all the action by the same Spirit."

### Philip Schaff:
