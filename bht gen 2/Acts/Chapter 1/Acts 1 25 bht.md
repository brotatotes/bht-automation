## BHT:
Judas, one of the apostles, fell from his position of apostleship through his betrayal of Jesus. As a result, he went to his own place, a destination implicated to be a place of torment among the dead. This destiny spoken of by Jesus alludes to the solemnity and seriousness of Judas's actions.
