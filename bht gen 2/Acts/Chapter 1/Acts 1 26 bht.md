# Acts 1:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The casting of lots to choose Matthias as the twelfth apostle was a method used in the Old Testament to determine the will of God. Contrary to popular misconception, it is not a game of chance but a process governed by natural laws. Although the casting of lots can be abused and lead to strife and dishonesty, in this case, it was a means through which God directed the selection of Matthias. Through this process, Matthias was numbered among the eleven apostles, completing the broken Twelve and taking his place in the apostolic ministry.
