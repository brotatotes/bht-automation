# Acts 1:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples were gathered together, not necessarily in Jerusalem, but possibly at Bethany or on the Mount of Olives. They were commanded to stay in Jerusalem, where they had previously witnessed Christ's suffering and where the Gospel was to go forth. They were told to wait for the promise of the Father, the pouring out of the Holy Spirit, which God the Father had promised. This promise had been spoken to them by Jesus himself.
