# Acts 1:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples, having witnessed the resurrection of Jesus and heard him speak about the kingdom of God, held on to their expectation of a temporal kingdom for Israel. They still clung to the idea of an outward dominion over all nations. United in their purpose, they approached Jesus as a group, seeking to know when this kingdom would come. Their question revealed their lingering belief in a physical reign, rather than understanding the spiritual nature of Christ's kingdom.
