# Acts 1:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is not for you to know the times or the seasons of the coming of the Son of Man. These words of Jesus caution against indulging in a curious inquiry into the future and trying to fix definite dates. The Father, in His own authority, holds the knowledge of these matters and will reveal them according to His perfect timing. Hence, it is more beneficial for us to focus on being faithful in our present tasks rather than being consumed by a desire to know the intricacies of what lies ahead.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is a general reproof and assertion, spoken with reference to men, as forbidden to search curiously into a point which Omniscience has reserved the times and seasons of the future divine dealings."
2. "The Knowledge of the Son is not here in question, only that of the disciples."
3. "We must not so limit the ὑμῶν, nor forget that the γνῶναι χρόνους ἢ καιρ has very seldom been imparted by prophecy, which generally has formed a testimony to this very fact, that God has them in His foreknowledge, and, while He announces the events, conceals for the most part in obscurity the times."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is not for you to know the times, &c.—implying not only that this was not the time, but that the question was irrelevant to their present business and future work."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The question of the apostles respected the time of the restoration; it was not whether he would do it... Jesus had answered them then by showing them that certain signs would precede his coming."
2. "God has uniformly reproved a vain curiosity on such points..."
3. "All prophecy is remarkably obscure in regard to the time of its fulfillment. The reasons why it is so are such as the following: (2) As they are to be brought about by human agency, they are so arranged as to call forth that agency. If people knew just when an event was to come to pass, they might be remiss, and feel that their own efforts were not needed."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The former of these words, time absolutely, without regard to circumstances; the latter, definite periods, with the idea of fitness." 
2. "His own, stronger than the simple possessive pronoun. The adjective means private, personal." 
3. "Often used adverbially in the phrase kat' ijdian, apart, privately."

### John Calvin:
1. "Go as far forward in learning as our Master Christ goeth in teaching, anal willingly to be ignorant of those things which he doth conceal from us."
2. "Being contented with the revelation of God, we think it an heinous crime to inquire any further."
3. "For unless we will burst in against his will and commandment, this shall have force and strength enough to restrain the outrageousness of our wits."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Lord’s reply in the 7th and 8th verses tacitly sanctions their expectation of a great restoration, but gravely rebukes the self-seeking impatience of His Jewish followers."
2. "The whole teaching of the Acts shows that in the sight of God all men were alike, and might share in the same blessings His witnesses were to carry the good news of salvation to the uttermost part of the earth."
3. "Surely these ever recurring mistakes should call men back to consider the last words of the Lord whenever these vain attempts are made to fix times and seasons for the great restoration of all things. That day and that hour is known to the Father only."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is curious how eager people have always been to fix definite dates about the second coming of Christ as the apostles were about the political Messianic kingdom which they were expecting." 
2. "Hath set (εθετο). Second aorist middle indicative, emphasizing the sovereignty of the Father in keeping all such matters to himself, a gentle hint to people today about the limits of curiosity." 
3. "Note also 'his own' (ιδια) 'authority' (εξουσια)."

### John Gill:
1. "It is not for you to know the times or the seasons... but when should be the time, the day, and hour of the coming of the Son of Man..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Times, in the language of the Scriptures, denote a longer; seasons, a shorter space."
2. "Which the Father hath put in his own power - To be revealed when and to whom it pleaseth him."
