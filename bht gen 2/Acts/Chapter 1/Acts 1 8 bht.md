# Acts 1:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
But ye shall receive power - meaning the power of the Holy Ghost, strength from Him to preach the Gospel, and work miracles in confirmation of it, and courage and greatness of mind amidst all reproaches and persecutions, to face and oppose their enemies. This power would empower them to be witnesses to Christ, not only through their preaching but also through their willingness to suffer for His sake. It was this power that would enable them to fulfill their mission and spread the gospel to the ends of the earth.
