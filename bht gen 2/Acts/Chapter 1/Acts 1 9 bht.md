# Acts 1:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus ascended to heaven before the watching eyes of his disciples. They were not asleep or distracted but were eyewitnesses to this miraculous event. As Jesus ascended, it appeared as if he was supported by a cloud. Some scholars suggest that this cloud was actually a group of angels appearing in this form. This cloud served to receive and escort Jesus as he made his way to heaven, ensuring the disciples that this was indeed a true ascension.

(3) A part of the work of Christ was yet to be performed in heaven. That was the work of intercession." (150 words)
