# Acts 10:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Caesarea, specifically the Caesarea near Joppa, there was a man named Cornelius - a Roman or Italian with a Roman name. He was a centurion of the Italian band, a group of soldiers from Italy who served in various parts of the empire. This Caesarea, distinct from Caesarea Philippi, was the setting for this significant encounter between the Galilean fisherman Peter and the Roman officer, highlighting the providential plan at work in the spread of the gospel.

J. vii. 1. 3; 2. 1, or Stratonis (see below), distinguished from Cæsarea. Philippi, see note Mat 16:13 ) is between Joppa and Dora, 68 Rom. miles from Jerusalem according to the Jerus.

2. "It was, even before the destruction of Jerusalem, the seat of the Roman Procurators (see ch. Acts 23:23 ff.; Acts 24:27 ; Act 25:1 ), and called by Tacitus (Hist. ii. 79) ‘Judææ caput.’"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The reception of the narrative of I Peter Acts 11:1-3 shows that the other apostles regarded him as a Gentile." 
2. "In Acts 10:28, Peter evidently regards him as a foreigner - one who did not in any sense esteem himself to be a Jew." 
3. "It is evident that many of the soldiers in the Roman army would be those who were born in other parts of the world; and it is altogether probable that those who were born in Rome or Italy would claim pre-eminence over those enlisted in other places."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Centurion. See on Luke 7:2. Band [σπειρης] . See on Mark 14:16. Italian. Probably because consisting of Roman soldiers, and not of natives of the country.

### John Calvin:
1. "God vouchsafeth to advance a stranger, and one uncircumcised, unto singular honor above all the Jews, because he doth both send his angel unto him, and for his sake bringeth Peter to Cesarea, that he may instruct him in the gospel."
2. "A rare example that a soldier was so devout towards God, so upright and courteous towards men!"
