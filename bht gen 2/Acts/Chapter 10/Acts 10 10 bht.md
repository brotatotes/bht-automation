# Acts 10:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of the day, when it was customary to eat, he experienced a great hunger. As he fell into a trance, he was no longer in his usual state, for this was a supernatural phenomenon, not arising from any natural cause within him. The symbols presented in visions and trances are often tailored to the individual's natural faculties, making it easier for him to comprehend the message being conveyed.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἔκστασις] The distinction of this appearance from the ὅραμα above (though the usage is not always strictly observed) is, that in this case that which was seen was a revelation shewn to the eye of the beholder when rapt into a supernatural state, having, as is the case in a dream, no objective reality"
2. "whereas, in the other case, the thing seen actually happened, and was beheld by the person as an ordinary spectator, in the possession of his natural senses."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 10. a trance—differing from
	the "vision" of Cornelius, in so far as the things seen had
	not the same objective reality, though both were supernatural.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'trance, or ecstasy,' denotes 'a state of mind when the attention is absorbed in a particular train of thought, so that the external senses are partially or entirely suspended.'"
2. "The soul seems to have passed out of the body, and to be conversant only with spiritual essences."
3. "This effect seems to be caused by so intense and absorbing a train of thought as to overcome the senses of the body, or wholly to withdraw the mind from their influence, and to fix it on the unseen object that engrosses it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Very hungry...desired to eat."
2. "He fell into a trance...an ecstasy fell upon him."
3. "Luke alone employs the word in this sense of ecstasy or trance."

### John Calvin:
1. "Because our minds are wholly, as it were, set upon the earth, to the end Peter might the better comprehend the oracle..."
2. "...it was meet that his mind should be, as it were, moved from his place and carried up..."
3. "...he is carried up above the world after an unwonted manner."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The vision presented to him in the trance was adapted to the physical condition in which he was at the moment."
2. "These circumstantial details, however, are of high importance in the direct narrative. They add to its life and reality, and they constitute part of the process through which Peter was brought to his new state of mind."
3. "This preternatural state of mind in which Peter saw the allegorical vision is to be contrasted with the full retention of his natural faculties with which Cornelius saw the angel."
