# Acts 10:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this vision, the sheet descending from heaven represents the calling of the Gentiles to be a part of the church of God. The sheet, fastened at the corners with cords reaching up to heaven, symbolizes the unity and connection between Christ and his church, as well as the unity among its members. This vision reveals the mystery of how the church, whose origin is heavenly, includes those who are born again and have their citizenship in heaven.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The ends of the ropes were attached to the sheet, and, in the vision, they only were seen."
2. "These four ἀρχaί (whether ends of ropes attached to the corners, or those corners themselves) are not without meaning, directed as they are to the four parts of heaven, and intimating that men from the North, South, East, and West, now were accounted clean before God, and were called to a share in his kingdom."
3. "The symbolism is, as usual, fancifully exaggerated by Wordsw. in his note. The four ἀρχaί are the four gospels because the word ἀρχή occurs somewhere near the beginning of each, &c., &c. Who can wonder, after this, at the distrust of all Scripture symbolism by intelligent, but unspiritual minds?"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 9-16. upon the housetop—the
	flat roof, the chosen place in the East for cool retirement. 
	the sixth hour—noon.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The language is derived from a common mode of speaking in the Hebrew Scriptures, as if the sky above us was a solid, vast expanse, and as if it were opened to present an opportunity for anything to descend."
2. "The sacred writer does not say that Peter literally saw such an object descending; but he uses this as an imperfect description of the vision."
3. "Knit at the four corners - Bound, united, or tied. The corners were collected, as would be natural in putting anything into a great sheet."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The form of vessel which appeared to Peter 'recalled an image most familiar to his previous life - the wind-stretched canvas of the craft on the Lake of Galilee."
2. "The extremity or corner, marking a beginning of the sheet."
3. "The word for sheet in this passage was also the technical term for a bandage, as was the kindred word ojqonion, used of the linen bandages in which the Lord's body was swathed."

### John Calvin:
1. "The opening of heaven signifieth, in my judgment, another thing in this place than in the seventh chapter."
2. "Peter saw our heaven which we see divided, so that a sheet came thence."
3. "Heaven was opened to Stephen, that he did behold the glory of Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The verb in the original denotes that he gazed upon the opened heaven, and carefully surveyed it."
2. "The impression conveyed is that the great sheet not only floated from heaven, but gradually approached St. Peter, so as to invite his close examination."
3. "The more literal translation would be, 'fastened to the ends of four cords,' the upper part of the cords being lost in the heavens."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Beholdeth (θεωρε). Vivid historical present and change from past time."
2. "Sheet (οθονην). Old word for linen cloth and only here in the N.T."
3. "The picture is the sheet held up by four cords to which the sheet is fastened."

### John Gill:
1. "the opening and revealing the mystery of the calling of the Gentiles"
2. "the church of God, whose original is from heaven, and consists of persons born from above, who have their conversation in heaven"
3. "the church being knit to Christ, and the members of it one to another"

### John Wesley:
1. Tied at the corners — Not all in one knot, but each fastened as it were up to heaven.
