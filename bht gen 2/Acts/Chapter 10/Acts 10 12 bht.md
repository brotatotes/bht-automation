# Acts 10:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This vision showed Peter that in the Gospel dispensation, all types of people, from different nations and backgrounds, can be part of the church. The inclusion of both clean and unclean animals represented the end of the distinction in food under the ceremonial law. It also conveyed the message that even those with the worst reputation, if called by grace, should be welcomed into Gospel churches.
