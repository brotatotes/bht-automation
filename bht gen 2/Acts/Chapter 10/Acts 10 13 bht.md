# Acts 10:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On the rooftop, a voice from heaven addressed Peter by name. This divine voice, like the sheet Peter saw, came from God Himself. Through this encounter, the previous distinction between clean and unclean creatures in the law was abolished. Peter learned that he could now eat whatever he chose. This freedom extended beyond food, as he understood that he could have fellowship with all people, without distinction or discrimination. By removing the law concerning the choice of beasts, God revealed that He rejects no people and that Peter should maintain communion with all equally.
