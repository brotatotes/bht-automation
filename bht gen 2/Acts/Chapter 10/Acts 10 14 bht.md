# Acts 10:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter's initial hesitation to obey God's command to eat unclean animals is understandable. It is natural to question something that appears to go against one's deeply ingrained beliefs and practices. However, once Peter understands that this command is from the Lord, he eventually obeys. This episode reveals Peter's adherence to the ceremonial law and his limited understanding of its abolition through Christ. Nevertheless, this doubt and delay allow for a clearer and more undeniable demonstration of God's will in this significant matter.
