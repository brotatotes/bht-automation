# Acts 10:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
What God has made clean and declared pure, we should not regard or label as common or unclean. In the eyes of God, no distinction remains between different nations or people. In fact, the Lord's instruction to Peter about the vision of unclean animals signifies the abolition of the ceremonial distinctions that were once in place. This truth of inclusion and unity is echoed in other passages of the Bible. Just as God has purified and made all things clean, we must not make them impure or unworthy.

3. "The same truth which is asserted by the heavenly voice in Peter’s vision is declared in Ephesians 1:10, Colossians 1:20, and 1 Timothy 4:4-5."

### John Calvin:
1. "That which God hath made clean, do not thou make profane; but the sense is, It is not for us to allow or condemn any thing; but as we stand and fall by the judgment of God alone, so is he judge of all things."
2. "But let us trust to the heavenly oracle, and freely despise all his inhibitions. We must always ask the mouth of the Lord, that we may thereby be assured what we may lawfully do; forasmuch as it was not lawful even for Peter to make that profane which was lawful by the Word of God."
3. "This voice alone ought to suffice to correct such boldness, That it is not lawful for us to make this or that unclean, but that this power belongeth to God alone."
