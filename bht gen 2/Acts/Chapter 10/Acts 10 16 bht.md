# Acts 10:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To make a deeper impression, this was done three times. It was not about the mystical meaning of the number three, but rather to confirm Peter's assurance of the truth. The repetition of the vision served to remove any doubt and firmly establish the significance of what was being revealed. Just as in the story of Joseph in Genesis, where Pharaoh's dream was repeated to emphasize its certainty, so too was this vision repeated to leave no room for doubt.
