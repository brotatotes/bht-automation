# Acts 10:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When faced with uncertainty and doubt, it is important to pay attention to the events unfolding both within and around us. Just as Peter grappled with his thoughts, questioning the meaning of his experience, providence intervened with the arrival of the men seeking him. These simultaneous occurrences often hold the key to understanding the divine plan and can provide clarity in moments of confusion. By carefully observing and reflecting on the convergence of internal reflections and external circumstances, we can uncover the deeper truths and guidance that God is revealing to us.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Valcknaer and Stier understand ἐν ἑαυτῷ, as ch. Acts 12:11, where γενόμενος is expressed... 'when he came to himself,' but without γενόμενος this is very harsh."
2. "It surely is better not to force from its obvious meaning so natural a conjunction of words as ἐν ἑαυτῷ διηπόρει."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The preparations here made—of Peter for his Gentile visitors, as of Cornelius for him—are devoutly to be noted."
2. "But besides this, at the same moment, 'the Spirit' expressly informs him that three men were inquiring for him, and bids him unhesitatingly go with them, as sent by Him."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Every part of this transaction is made to harmonize with every other part; and it was so arranged that just in the moment when the mind of Peter was filled with perplexity, the very event should occur which would relieve him of his embarrassment."
2. "An event of divine Providence may be as clear an expression of his will, and may as certainly serve to indicate our duty, as the most manifest revelation would do."
3. "We should then carefully mark the events of God’s providence. We should observe and record the train of our own thoughts, and should watch with interest any event that occurs, when we are perplexed and embarrassed, to obtain, if possible, an expression of the will of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Doubted [διηπορει] . See on Luke 9:7. In himself."
2. "On reflection, as compared with his ecstatic state."
3. "Had made inquiry [διερωτησαντες] . 'Having inquired out;' having asked their way through [δια] streets and houses, until they found the dwelling of the tanner, who was an obscure man, and not easily found."

### John Calvin:
1. "Peter was taught not only by the vision, but also by the Word of God; and yet in seeing he saw not, until the Spirit is unto him an interpreter; a most excellent mirror of our slackness."
2. "Although we be yet far unlike to Peter; for we are so far from understanding by and by what God will, or to what end he speaketh to us, that many interpretations are scarce sufficient for us."
3. "But we must also note that which Luke addeth, that Peter did think earnestly upon the vision, to wit, after that he was come to himself again after his amazedness; for this was a token of godly reverence, that he did not carelessly suffer the vision to escape him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Again we should give close attention to the coincidence of time. It is manifestly intended that we are to see here the marks of a providential pre-arrangement."
2. "The messengers who had been ‘drawing nigh to the city’ when the apostle’s trance began were now actually at the gate, having inquired their way to the house."
3. "Before the gate. This was the outside door or gate which led, according to the fashion of eastern dwellings in all ages, into the inner court of the house."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Was much perplexed in himself... to be completely at a loss to know what road to take." 
2. "When out of the ecstasy he was more puzzled than ever."
3. "It took diligent inquiry to find the obscure house of Simon the tanner."

### John Gill:
1. "For notwithstanding what he had heard and seen, he had not at once a full knowledge of this matter."
2. "he was before, as it were, out of himself, and was in a trance, or ecstasy; and now being come to himself, and reflecting on what he had seen and heard, he had some doubts and hesitations in his mind."
3. "something providentially happened, which was a key unto, and opened the whole vision clearly to him."

### John Wesley:
1. "While Peter doubted in himself, behold the men - Frequently the things which befall us within and from without at the same time, are a key to each other."
2. "The things which thus concur and agree together, ought to be diligently attended to."
