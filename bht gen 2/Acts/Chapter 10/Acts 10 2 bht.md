## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He had abandoned polytheism, and was a worshipper of the true God: whether a proselyte of the gate, or not, seems uncertain."
2. "The object of this providential interference seems to have been, to give solemn sanction to such reception, by the agency of him who was both the chief of the Apostles, and the strong upholder of pure Judaism."
3. "From Cornelius’s own narrative, Acts 10:31, as well as from the analogy of God’s dealings, we are certainly justified in inferring, with Neander, that the subject of his prayers was that he might be guided into truth."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "A devout man, c.—an uncircumcised Gentile proselyte to the Jewish faith, of whom there were a very great number at this time a distinguished proselyte, who had brought his whole household establishment under the hallowing influence of the Jewish faith and the regular observance of its principal seasons of worship."
2. "gave much alms to the people—that is, the Jewish people, on the same principle as another centurion before him (Acts 10:2); thinking it no 'great thing,' if they had 'sown unto him spiritual things, that they should reap his carnal things' (1 Corinthians 9:11)."
3. "prayed to God alway—at the stated daily seasons. (See on 1 Corinthians 9:11-12)."

### Albert Barnes:

### John Calvin:

2. "Luke reckoneth up the fear of God and prayer as fruits and testimonies of godliness and of the worship of God, and that for good causes."
3. "Forasmuch as misericordia, or mercy, is the inward affection of the heart properly. For from this fountain springeth true and well ordered bountifulness, if the troubles and sorrows of our brethren do move us to compassion."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Devout (ευσεβης). Old word from ευ (well) and σεβομα (to worship, to reverence), but rare in the N.T. (Acts 10:2; Acts 10:7; 2 Peter 2:1). It might refer to a worshipful pagan (Acts 17:23, σεβασματα, objects of worship), but connected with 'one that feared God' (φοβουμενος τον θεον) Luke describes 'a God-fearing proselyte' as in Acts 10:22; Acts 10:35."

3. "He brought up his family in a religious way, as every good man should; and which was very remarkable in a Gentile, a soldier, and an officer."

### John Wesley:
1. Who gave much alms to the people — That is, to the Jews, many of whom were at that time extremely poor.
