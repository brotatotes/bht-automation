# Acts 10:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter, without prior knowledge of who these men were or their purpose, suddenly appears before them, revealing himself as the one they were searching for. This unexpected encounter was a powerful moment, with Peter standing face to face with strangers who would soon become significant figures in his life. The supernatural communication Peter received gave him the assurance that this was no ordinary interaction. His immediate response showed his conviction and willingness to follow God's leading, without any hesitation or doubt.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 21. I am he whom ye seek—This
	seems to have been said without any communication being made to Peter
	regarding the men or their errand.

### John Calvin:
1. "Behold, I am he whom ye seek."
2. "That which God calleth pure, judge not thou to be common."


### Philip Schaff:
1. "This coming down the outside stair, and suddenly standing face to face with the strangers, with whom he was presently to make such intimate acquaintance, is one of the most vivid passages of the narrative." 
2. "The introduction of the words here, however, disturbs the true sequence of the narrative. At this time St. Peter knew nothing of Cornelius or of what had happened at Cæsarea."
3. "They must have been much startled by this sudden address. They saw in a moment the man whom they were seeking: they perceived that some supernatural communication had been made to him; and renewed strength must have been given instantaneously to their conviction that they were engaged in no common transaction."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Cause  (αιτια). Or reason. Common in this sense. See on Matthew 19:3. 

### John Gill:
1. "Without being called by any of the family he came down, and without being informed in that way who the men were inquiring for."
2. "He declared himself to be the person they were seeking after."
3. "It was only told him there were three men seeking him, and he was bid to go with them, without any scruple or hesitation."
