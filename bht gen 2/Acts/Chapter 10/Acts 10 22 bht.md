# Acts 10:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Cornelius, a just man, lived righteously and was esteemed by both Gentiles and Jews. He desired to hear words from Peter to be instructed, not to flatter him. The mentioning of his good reputation among the Jews aimed to gain favor with Peter. As a Gentile, Cornelius needed to profess his worship of the God of Abraham with the Jews as witnesses to display his godliness. The conversion of Cornelius relied on the means of hearing the word, similar to the way faith comes by hearing, as expressed in other biblical passages.
