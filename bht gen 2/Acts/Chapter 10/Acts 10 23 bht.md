# Acts 10:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter, being overcome with the authority of God, promptly lodged the men in his home and departed with them the following morning. He was accompanied by several brethren from Joppa, about six in total, who joined him not only out of respect and companionship, but also to witness any significant events unfold. This gathering of Jewish Christians was crucial because it highlighted the remarkable nature of a Jew inviting Gentiles into his home.
