# Acts 10:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Cornelius met Peter, he fell down at his feet, a gesture expressing his deep affection and reverence for the apostle. This act of worship was not meant to ascribe divine honor to Peter as a mortal man, but rather to show profound respect. It is important to note that Cornelius did not consider Peter to be God or an angel, as he was aware of Peter's identity and purpose. Instead, this act can be understood as a display of civil worship and respect, rather than religious adoration.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "May not the same reason have occasioned the omission of αὐτοῦ after πόδας? the one αὐτ. would almost require the other."
2. "It was natural for Cornelius to think that one so pointed out by an angel must be deserving of the highest respect; and this respect he shewed in a way which proves him not to have altogether lost the heathen training of his childhood."
3. "He must have witnessed the rise of the custom of paying divine honours first to those who were clothed with the delegated power of the senate, and then κατ ʼ ἐξοχήν to him in whom the imperial majesty centered."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Fell down at his feet, and worshipped him—In the East this way of showing respect was customary not only to kings, but to others occupying a superior station; but among the Greeks and Romans it was reserved for the gods."
2. "Peter, therefore, declines it as due to no mortal [GROTIUS]."
3. "Those who claim to have succeeded Peter, have not imitated this part of his conduct" [ALFORD].

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Fell down at his feet - This was an act of profound regard for him as an ambassador of God."
2. "In Oriental countries it was usual for persons to prostrate themselves at length on the ground before men of rank and honor."
3. "Worshipped him. This does not mean religious homage, but civil respect - the homage, or profound regard which was due to one in honor."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Worship is worthship, or honor paid to dignity or worth."
2. "This usage survives in the expressions worshipful and your worship."
3. "Here the meaning is that Cornelius paid reverence by prostrating himself after the usual oriental manner."

### John Calvin:
1. "For we may gather that there was some divine thing in that worship, because he did ascribe unto mortal man the honor which is due to God alone."
2. "But we must not think that Cornelius did count Peter instead of God; for if he translated God’s honor unto mortal man, where is that godliness and religion, with the title whereof he was of late adorned?"
3. "Therefore, I think that he meant nothing less than to spoil God of his lawful worship, that he might give it to man; but forasmuch as he meant to give singular honor unto the prophet and apostle of Christ, he fell into an immoderate token of reverence, and so he offended in excess."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This first meeting of Cornelius and Peter is one of the great incidents of history."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Most commentators consider it inexplicable." 
2. "It is probably an extension of the ordinary articular infinitive under the influence of the Hebrew infinitive construct without regard to the case, regarding it as a fixed case form and so using it as nominative."
3. "The word probably means here reverence like old English usage (Wycliff) and not actual worship, though Peter took it that way (verse Acts 10:26)."

### John Gill:
1. "Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet; to testify his great affection for him, and reverence of him." 
2. "Not with a religious adoration, or with worship due to God; for that would have been contrary to his character as a devout man, and one that feared God; but with civil worship and respect."
3. "Nor could he take him for an angel of God, or for one sent immediately from heaven to him; for he had been informed who he was, and what he was, and from whence he came, and what he was to do."
