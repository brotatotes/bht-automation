# Acts 10:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter, having learned the lesson of equality through his vision, humbly refused the excessive honor bestowed upon him. He made it clear that he was just a mortal man, not deserving of worship. This contrasts with instances in Scripture where angels and even Jesus accepted worship. The behavior of Peter serves as a reminder for those who claim to follow in his footsteps, to imitate his conduct and avoid the temptation of seeking glory beyond what is appropriate for human beings.

2. "We are at once reminded of the horror expressed by Paul and Barnabas, when the attempt was made at Lystra to give them Divine homage (Acts 14:14), and of the repudiation of this kind of homage by the angel in St. John‚Äôs vision (Revelation 22:8-9)."

### John Gill:
1. "But Peter took him up,.... As he lay at his feet, and lifted him up and set him on his legs:saying, stand up; and continue in this posture"
2. "I myself also am a man; a mortal man, a man of like passions with others, no better than others by nature"
3. "and it was by grace, and not any merit of his own, that he was a believer in Christ, and an apostle of his; and therefore he chose not to have any distinguishing homage and respect paid to him, and especially in any excessive and extravagant way; which though not designed, might carry in it a suggestion, as if he was more than a man."

### John Wesley:
1. I myself also am a man ‚Äî And not God, who alone ought to be worshipped, Matthew 4:10. Have all his pretended successors attended to this?
