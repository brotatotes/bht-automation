# Acts 10:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we see the significance of breaking down barriers between different groups of people. The practice of separating oneself from others was well-established among the Jews, but it was not explicitly prohibited. However, the intention behind this practice was to keep them as a distinct people. The gospel message, which was to be preached to all, shattered the barrier between Jews and Gentiles, allowing for the opportunity of salvation for all. This new understanding was a profound revelation for Peter, as he now recognized that no one should be regarded as excluded from God's adoption.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There is some difficulty about this unlawfulness of consorting with those ἀλλόφυλοι who, like Cornelius, worshipped the true God. It rests upon no legal prohibition, and seems, at first sight, hardly consistent with the zeal to gain proselytes predicated of the Pharisees."
2. "But whatever exceptions there may have been, it was unquestionably the general practice of the Jews to separate themselves in common life from uncircumcised persons."
3. "Ye, though ye see me here, know, how strong the prejudice is which would have kept me away: and I, though entertaining fully this prejudice myself, yet have been taught &c."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "There was no express prohibition to this effect, and to a Certain extent intercourse was certainly kept up." 
2. "But intimate social fellowship was not practiced, as being adverse to the spirit of the law."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The design was to keep them a separate people. To do this, Moses forbade alliances by contract, or marriage, with the surrounding nations, which were idolatrous."
2. "God hath showed me - Compare Acts 15:8-9. He had showed him by the vision, Acts 10:11-12."
3. "That no man was to be regarded as excluded from the opportunity of salvation, or was to be despised and abhorred. The gospel was to be preached to all; the barrier between Jews and Gentiles was broken down, and all were to be regarded as capable of being saved."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word [αθεμιτον] emphasizes the violation of established order, being from the same root as tiqhmi, to lay down or establish."
2. "Peter's statement is general, referring to the general practice of the Jews to separate themselves in common life from uncircumcised persons."
3. "They keep separate from all strangers in eating, sleeping, and matrimonial connections."

### John Calvin:
1. "He pronounceth that those are now clean who were before unclean, so that they have mutual fellowship now with the saints."
2. "Furthermore, whereas he said that it was wickedness for the Jews to go in unto the Gentiles, we must know that this came not so much from the law, as from the observation of the fathers."
3. "But Peter compareth the Jews and the Gentiles together in this place; and because the wall of separation was pulled down, and the covenant of life is now common to them both alike, he saith that those are not to be counted aliens who are made partakers of God’s adoption."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There is no precise and explicit text in the Old Testament which forbids such intercourse, but the strict avoiding of such intercourse is in harmony with the whole spirit of the Old Testament."
2. "The primary reference is to the custom of eating together at the same table. This is the point specified in chap. Acts 11:3 (see Galatians 2:12)."
3. "The word ‘me’ is emphatic, and it is contrasted with ‘ye’ above. Dean Alford puts this point well: ‘Ye, though ye see me here, know how strong the prejudice is which would have kept me away; and I, though entertaining fully this prejudice myself, yet have been taught,’ etc."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "There is nothing more binding on the average person than social custom."
2. "It is that middle wall of partition between Jew and Gentile (Ephesians 2:14) which Jesus broke down."
3. "Now Peter takes back both the adjectives used in his protest to the Lord... that is great progress."

### John Gill:
1. "For a man that is a Jew, to keep company with, or come unto one of another nation...made it very criminal." 
2. "It is forbidden a Jew to unite himself to Gentiles...lest he should fall upon him and kill him."
3. "He saw there was now no difference between Jew and Gentile...every believer of whatsoever nation, was acceptable to God."

### John Wesley:
1. But God hath showed me — He speaks sparingly to them of his former doubt, and his late vision.
