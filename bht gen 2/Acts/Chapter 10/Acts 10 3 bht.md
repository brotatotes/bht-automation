# Acts 10:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Cornelius saw in a vision, not in a trance, with his bodily eyes, which made it evident that the appearance was objectively real. This vision occurred at the ninth hour, indicating that Cornelius observed the Jewish hours of prayer. Additionally, an angel of God was sent to signify the acceptance of Cornelius' piety and to direct him to send for Peter for instruction in the way of salvation. The vision to Cornelius was a crucial moment in the introduction of the Gospel to the Gentile world, which is why an angel was commissioned to visit the Roman centurion.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἐν ὁράμ. φανερῶς" - not in a trance, but with his bodily eyes: thus asserting the objective truth of the appearance.
2. "ὡσεὶ περὶ ὥρ. ἐν." - It here appears that C. observed the Jewish hours of prayer.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 3-6. saw . . .
	evidently—"distinctly." 
	the ninth hour of the
	day—three o'clock, the hour of the evening sacrifice. But he
	had been "fasting until that hour" ( :-), perhaps from the sixth hour ( :-).

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He saw in a vision - See the notes on Acts 9:10."
2. "Evidently - Openly; manifestly."
3. "An angel of God - See the notes on Matthew 1:20. Compare Hebrews 1:14. This angel was sent to signify to Cornelius that his alms were accepted by God as an evidence of his piety, and to direct him to send for Peter to instruct him in the way of salvation. The importance of the occasion - the introduction of the gospel to a Gentile, and hence, to the entire Gentile world - was probably the chief reason why an angel was commissioned to visit the Roman centurion. Compare Acts 16:9-10."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. A vision. See on ch. Acts 8:31. Evidently [φανερως] . Better, clearly or distinctly, as opposed to a fancy.

### John Calvin:
1. "Luke putteth vision for a kind of oracle coming from God, that we may know that Cornelius was brought unto the faith of Christ after an heavenly manner."
2. "And because men are oftentimes deceived with juggling, Luke setteth down the time to avoid all suspicion, when he mentioneth the ninth hour."
3. "Although there were always seals added unto visions, that they might free the servants of God from fear of illusions, because when he appeared in dreams, yet were there such marks of certainty imparted in their minds as would not suffer them to doubt."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The language seems carefully chosen so as to assert the certainty and absolute distinctness of the vision."
2. "Cornelius seems simply to have been drawn into sympathy with the religion of the Hebrews on its moral and spiritual side."
3. "A distinct appeal was made at Cæsarea to the hearing, as well as the seeing, of Cornelius."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Coming in (εισελθοντα). Ingressive second aorist active participle, not present. So punctiliar, 'saw come,' not 'saw coming.'"
2. "So also 'say' or 'speak,' not 'saying.'"
3. "Luke repeats the account of this vision to Cornelius twice (Acts 10:30; Acts 11:13) and also the story of the vision to Peter (Acts 10:1-16; Acts 10:28; Acts 11:5)."

### John Gill:
1. "He saw in a vision evidently,.... He was not in a dream, or in a trance, but he was thoroughly awake, and his eyes open..."
2. "...to let him know that he knew him, as angels are very knowing spirits; and to express his affection and friendship to him..."
3. "...he was a messenger, not of bad, but of good news to him; as well as to engage his attention to him..."

### John Wesley:
1. "He saw in a vision - Not in a trance, like Peter: plainly, so as to leave one not accustomed to things of this kind no room to suspect any imposition."
