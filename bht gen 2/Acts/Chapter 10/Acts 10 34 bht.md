# Acts 10:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage reminds us not to judge based on external appearances or social status, for God is impartial and does not show favoritism. It is crucial to recognize that God's love is not limited to a specific nation or group, but extends to all people. His acceptance is not determined by outward circumstances, but by a person's character and relationship with Him.
