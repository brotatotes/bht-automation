# Acts 10:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
No matter one's nationality, God's favor is extended to all who seek after Him and live in righteousness. True acceptance with God is not based on external factors or lineage, but on the condition of the heart. It is not the fear of God or the works of righteousness themselves that earn acceptance, but rather they serve as indicators of those who have found favor in God's eyes. This inclusivity means that the blessings of Christianity are freely offered to anyone who reaches out their hand to receive them, regardless of their background or nationality.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He saw, that in every nation, men who seek after God, who receive His witness of Himself without which He has left no man, and humbly follow His will as far as they know it, these have no extraneous hindrance, such as uncircumcision, placed in their way to Christ, but are capable of being admitted into Godâ€™s church though Gentiles, and as Gentiles."
2. "That only such are spoken of, is agreeable to the nature of the case; for men who do not fear God, and work unrighteousness, are out of the question, not being likely to seek such admission."
3. "He speaks popularly, and certainly not without reference to the character he had heard of Cornelius, which consisted of these very two parts, that he feared God, and abounded in good works."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "he that feareth him, and worketh righteousnessâ€”This being the well-known phraseology of the Old Testament in describing the truly godly man, within the pale of revealed religion..."
2. "...there can be no doubt that the apostle intended to describe exactly such saintshipâ€”in its internal spirituality and external fruitfulnessâ€”as God had already pronounced to be genuine and approved."
3. "And since to such 'He giveth more grace,' according to the law of His Kingdom, He sends Peter... to 'show him the way of God more perfectly,' as before to the devout Ethiopian eunuch."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The favors of God were no longer to be confined to the Jewish people, but might be extended to all."
2. "Acceptance with God does not depend on the fact of being descended from Abraham, or of possessing external privileges, but on the state of the heart."
3. "These two things comprehend the whole of religion, the sum of all the requirements of God - piety toward God, and justice toward people."

### John Calvin:
1. "The fear of God is nothing else but godliness and religion; and righteousness is that equity which men use among themselves, taking heed lest they hurt any man, and studying to do good to all men."
2. "The first accepting of God, whereby he receiveth us into favor, is altogether free; for there can as yet no respect of works be had, seeing all things are corrupt and wicked."
3. "Although the faithful please God after regeneration with good works, and their respects of works, yet that is not done with the merit of works. For the cleanliness of works is never so exact that they can please God without pardon; yea, forasmuch as they have always some corruption mixed with them, they are worthy to be refused."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Nationality, even a divinely-appointed nationality, like the Jewish, constitutes, in the sight of God, no essential mark of difference between one man and another."
2. "The true distinction between one man and another, as before God, is moral."
3. "The meaning of this passage is, that all the blessings of Christianity are freely offered to every human hand that is stretched out to receive them."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A Gentile would not have to become a Jew in order to become a Christian."
2. "The new idea that now makes a revolution in Peter's outlook is precisely this that Christ can and will save Gentiles like this Cornelius group without their becoming Jews at all."

### John Gill:
1. "He that feareth him; God, not with a slavish fear, or with the fear of punishment to be inflicted by him... but with a godly filial fear; which is a new covenant blessing... and faith among the rest, without which it is impossible to please God." 
2. "He who... does works of righteousness... such an one is acceptable, or well pleasing to God, let him be of what nation he will."
3. "Though God accepts those who fear him and work righteousness, their fear and works are not the ground of their acceptance, but are descriptive of the persons accepted by him in Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "He that, first, reverences God, as great, wise, good, the cause, end, and governor of all things..."
2. "..not only avoids all known evil, but endeavors, according to the best light he has, to do all things well..."
3. "The assertion is express, and admits of no exception. He is in the favour of God, whether enjoying his written word and ordinances or not."
