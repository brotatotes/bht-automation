2. "I the more incline to this, the simplest and most forcible rendering, from observing that so far from ὑμεῖς οἴδατε being a harsh beginning to a new sentence, it is the very form in which Peter began his address to them Acts 10:28, ὑμεῖς ἐπίστασθε, &c."
3. "διὰ Ἰης., χρ. belongs to εὐαγγελ., not to εἰρήνην."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The simplest view, perhaps, is this, that we have here three things in apposition (1) the proclamation of the Gospel (τὸν λόγον) which was spread through Judaea; (2) the subject-matter (τὸ ρῆμα) of the proclamation, the new religion which was thus diffused; (3) the fact that Jesus was divinely anointed for this mission."
