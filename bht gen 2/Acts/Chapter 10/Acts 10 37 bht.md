# Acts 10:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The message that was proclaimed, the history and events surrounding Jesus and the gospel, were well-known even to those outside of Judea and Galilee. The fame of the miracles and the preaching of John the Baptist had spread throughout the regions, bridging the gap between the Gentiles and the knowledge of Christ. The preaching of the Gospel started in Galilee after John initiated the practice of water baptism as a symbol of repentance. It is important to note that Galilee was in close proximity to Cesarea, where these events took place.
