# Acts 10:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter and the other apostles were witnesses, even eyewitnesses, of Christ's ministry as he went from place to place. They saw with their own eyes the good that he did and the miracles he performed. Ultimately, it was the Jews who put Jesus to death, as they had requested and instigated the crucifixion.
