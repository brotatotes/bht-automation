# Acts 10:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The resurrection appearances of Jesus were not meant to convince everyone, but rather to provide evidence to chosen witnesses before his death. These witnesses had the privilege of eating and drinking with Jesus after he rose from the dead, confirming the reality of his resurrection. Jesus conversed with his chosen witnesses, strengthening their faith and ensuring that they could testify to the truth of his resurrection.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And there is no real difficulty in it: Luke 24:41; Luk 24:43 and Joh 21:12 give us instances; and, even if συνεπίομεν is to be pressed, it is no contradiction to Luke 22:18, which only refers to one particular kind of drinking."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Not to all the people - Not to the nation at large, for this was not necessary in order to establish the truth of his resurrection."
2. "He, however, showed himself to many persons. See the Harmony of the Accounts of the Resurrection of Jesus."
3. "Who did eat and drink ... - And by doing this he furnished the clearest possible proof that he was truly risen; that they were not deceived by an illusion of the imagination or by a phantom. Compare John 21:12-13."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Chosen before [προκεχειροτονημενοις]. Only here in New Testament. The simple verb ceirotonew, to appoint, occurs Acts 14:23; 2 Corinthians 8:19; and originally means to stretch out the hand for the purpose of giving a vote."
2. "Hence to elect by show of hands, and generally to appoint. Plato uses the word of the election of leaders of choruses ('Laws,' 765)."
3. "In later ecclesiastical usage it signified ordain, as bishops or deacons. Who [οιτινες]. The compound pronoun marks them more strongly as belonging to the class of eye-witnesses."

### John Calvin:
1. "And yet, assuredly God used this moderation to a good end. For the certainty of the resurrection was proved by many and firm testimonies, and this was profitable to exercise the faith of the godly, to believe the gospel rather than their eyes."
2. "That Christ did eat, curious men move a question, what became of that meat? But the answer is easy; that like as it was created out of nothing, so was it easily brought to nothing by the divine power of Christ."
3. "For when, as we say that Christ was not enforced with any necessity of his own to eat, but that he meant only to provide for those that were his, all occasion is cut off from the frivolous inventions of men."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The very fact that no such public recognition of His person is recorded, though at first it might have seemed to detract from the evidence of His resurrection, but serves to enhance it"
2. "Witnesses, namely those who had been previously appointed by God."
3. "The facts here stated belong to the period of the Great Forty Days. Both St. Luke and St. John give instances."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Peter is evidently stating the thing as it happened and not trying to make a convincing story by saying that both friends and foes saw him after his resurrection."
2. "The sceptical Jews would not have believed and Jesus was kept from open contact with the world of sin after his Passion."
3. "Peter makes it clear that it was no hallucination or ghost, but Jesus himself whom they saw after he rose from the dead."

### John Gill:
1. "Not to all the people...but unto witnesses chosen before of God." 
2. "Even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead."
3. "He did sometimes eat and drink with them."

### John Wesley:
1. "Not now to all the people — As before his death"
2. "to us who did eat and drink with him"
3. "conversed familiarly and continually with him, in the time of his ministry."
