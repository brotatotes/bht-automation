# Acts 10:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The preaching of the Gospel testifies to Christ's eternal existence and His appointment by God to have all power. It also bears witness to the truth that there will be a general judgment in which all people, whether alive or dead, will be held accountable. This underscores the importance of submitting to Christ as our Judge and recognizing that our ultimate happiness depends on our relationship with Him.

3. "And chiefly, every one of us doth feel in himself too much what a hard matter it is both to lift up our minds to hope for the coming of Christ, which are entangled in earthly snares, and also continually to keep them fixed in this meditation, seeing they cease not with their lightness to be carried hither and thither continually."
