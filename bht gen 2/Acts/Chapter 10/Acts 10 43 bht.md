# Acts 10:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The witness of all the prophets testifies to the truth that all who believe in him receive the free gift of forgiveness of sins.

It is through faith in Him that we are granted this incredible grace and mercy of having our sins washed away.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "All the prophets, generically: not that every one positively asserted this, but that the whole bulk of prophetic testimony announced it."

3. "Whosoever believeth in him— This was evidently said with special reference to the Gentile audience then before him, and formed a noble practical conclusion to the whole discourse."

### Albert Barnes:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To him give all the prophets witness. It would be quite perverse to object here that no explicit reference of this kind is found in each several prophet of the Old Testament. St. Peter alludes to the general class of the prophets, and to the general drift of their writings."
2. "These concluding words of St. Peter’s speech, here arrested by a Divine interruption, deserve the utmost attention. The language is absolutely universal, including Jews and Gentiles alike. ... The doctrine of justification by faith could not be more clearly set forth."
