# Acts 10:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the believers in Acts 10:46 heard them speak in different tongues, they were amazed. These were not just ordinary languages, but languages that they had never learned or understood before. The disciples used these tongues to magnify and glorify God, expressing their gratitude for the abundant grace and mercy that had been given to them. In response to this manifestation of the Holy Spirit's power among the uncircumcised Gentiles, Peter answered, continuing the conversation.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Can any man forbid water . . . which have received the Holy Ghost, &c.—Mark, he does not say, They have received the Spirit, what need have they for water? but, Having the living discipleship imparted to them and visibly stamped upon them, what objection can there be to admitting them, by the seal of baptism, into the full fellowship of the Church?"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They heard (ηκουον). Imperfect active, were hearing, kept on hearing."
2. "With tongues (γλωσσαις). Instrumental case as in Acts 2:4; Acts 2:11 which see. The fuller statement there makes it clear that here it was new and strange tongues also as in Acts 19:6; 1 Corinthians 14:4-19."
3. "This sudden manifestation of the Holy Spirit's power on uncircumcised Gentiles was probably necessary to convince Peter and the six brethren of the circumcision that God had opened the door wide to Gentiles.
