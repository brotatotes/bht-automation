# Acts 10:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Who can forbid these individuals the ordinance of baptism, or deny its administration to them? If they have received the Holy Spirit, there is no reason to withhold the lesser gift of water baptism. This passage emphasizes that under the Gospel dispensation, there is no distinction among believers, as Christ's commission extends to both Jews and Gentiles. Therefore, there is only one baptism for all. It is evident that water baptism is an ordinance of Christ that should be continued, especially for those who have partaken in the grace of the Holy Spirit.
