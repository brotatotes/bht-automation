# Acts 10:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These passages reveal the importance of baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, while acknowledging the roles of the Father and the Holy Spirit. It is noteworthy that Peter did not personally administer baptism, as it was a duty that could be shared among other ministers. The desire of the newly baptized believers to spend more time with Peter is an expression of gratitude and a desire for further instructions. In all, these events laid the foundation for the establishment of a Gospel church.
