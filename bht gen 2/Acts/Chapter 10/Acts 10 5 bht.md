# Acts 10:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The angel's message to Cornelius reminds us that God chooses men, not angels, to deliver His instructions. This underscores the importance of the Gospel ministry and ministers, as exemplified by Philip, Ananias, and now Simon being instructed to go to Joppa. The specific designation of Simon emphasizes the divine direction in this significant event. Through the preached word, faith is cultivated, highlighting the need for attentiveness and docility towards human voices. It is by using these means that one can be enlightened by heavenly wisdom and become a disciple of Christ. (100 words)

### John Calvin:
1. "God thrusteth the ministers of his word daily upon the unwilling."

3. "Because faith cometh by hearing, no man shall attain thereunto which shall refuse and despise the word when it is preached."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We should notice, too, with what definite force Joppa is incidentally named in Acts 10:8; Acts 10:23, and Acts 11:5. This is all part of the explicit assertion of the facts of the story as literally true." 
2. "The exact designation of the man who was to bring the Gospel to Cornelius is an essential part of the transaction. The Divine direction is perceptible in every act and every word recorded."
3. "The exact designation of Peter should be carefully noted, also, from another point of view. Cornelius was to be brought to the knowledge of Christ by the instrumentality of a man, not directly by the angel who appeared to him. This is in harmony with Godâ€™s usual method of working in spiritual things."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Fetch (Î¼ÎµÏ„Î±Ï€ÎµÎ¼ÏˆÎ±). First aorist middle (indirect, for one's self) imperative of Î¼ÎµÏ„Î±Ï€ÎµÎ¼Ï€Ï‰, usual voice in ancient Greek with this verb in sense of sending another for one's own sake."
2. "Only in Acts in the N.T."
3. "See also Acts 10:22."

### John Gill:
1. "The angel was not sent to instruct Cornelius himself, but to direct him to an apostle of Christ, and minister of the Gospel, who should do it; for not angels, but men, are employed in the ministry of the word, which is the ordinary means of spiritual knowledge, and of increasing it."
2. "So the eunuch was instructed by Philip, and Saul by Ananias; which shows the excellency and usefulness of the Gospel ministry and ministers, and what dignity is put upon them, what use should be made of them, and in what esteem they should be had."
