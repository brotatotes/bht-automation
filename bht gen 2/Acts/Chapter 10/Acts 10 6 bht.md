# Acts 10:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Simon the tanner, who hosted Peter, was likely a kind and hospitable man who welcomed strangers. Tanneries were typically located outside of cities due to the unpleasantness associated with their work, involving skins and dead animals. The words spoken by Cornelius to Peter, He shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do, indicate that Peter would receive instructions or teachings that would bring spiritual enlightenment to him and his household.
