# Acts 10:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Cornelius, a pious soldier, obediently followed the heavenly vision, showcasing the simplicity of his faith. His household servants, who had been taught to fear God, proved their loyalty by willingly serving him. This soldier's devotion challenges the assumption that military life is incompatible with piety. It is worth noting that the selection of three individuals for the mission not only highlighted their religious character, but also demonstrated respect for Peter and the significance of their assignment. Through their collective example, we see the influence of faith in various aspects of life, even in unexpected places like the military.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "immediately doing as directed, and thereby showing the simplicity of his faith."

3. "DA COSTA [Four Witnesses] gives a number of ingenious reasons for thinking that, having attached himself henceforth to Peterâ€”whose influence in the composition of the second Gospel is attested by the earliest tradition, and is stamped on that Gospel itselfâ€”he is no other than the Evangelist Mark."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A pious man. This is an instance of the effect of piety in a military officer."

1. "Cornelius had this reward for being so diligent in teaching his family, that he had faithful and honest servants who were willing to do him service; and also such as that he might commit any thing to them."
2. "Forasmuch as this soldier was much conversant with Cornelius, he had also taught him to fear God, as well as his household servants. It is meet that we call to mind here that which I touched before, that there is no kind of life which excuseth us but that we must worship God purely."
3. "For a soldierâ€™s life was at that time most corrupt; for they were fallen unto filthy licentiousness, from the ancient discipline, and yet the Spirit of God beareth record in this place of the godliness of soldiers."

3. "Partly for the honour of Peter, and to show a proper respect to him, he would not send a single person, who could have told the story, and done the errand as well as three, but this would not have looked respectful enough."
