# Acts 10:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter went up to the rooftop, a common place for devotion and relaxation among the people of Judea. There, he sought solitude and privacy as he engaged in prayer. This act of going to the rooftop was significant, reminiscent of the Jewish custom of refraining from entering certain places, like a tanner's house or a bath, during prayer times. The rooftop provided Peter with a peaceful setting to connect with God, away from distractions, and to commune with Him in a deeper way.
