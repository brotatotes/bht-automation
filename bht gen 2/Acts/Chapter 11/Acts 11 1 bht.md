# Acts 11:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When news of the Gentiles receiving the word of God spread, it quickly reached the apostles and brethren in Judea. It was not just the fact of their conversion that they heard, but also the extraordinary gifts and special grace bestowed upon them by the Holy Ghost. This news was remarkable, as the Gentiles were not required to first become Jews to be accepted into the faith. Unlike the Samaritans who were half Jews, these Gentiles were real Romans, making their inclusion even more astonishing.
