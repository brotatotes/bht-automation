# Acts 11:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The creatures, which were seen on the sheet, were drawn back up into heaven. Rather than being taken up, they were animatedly and lively drawn back, as if by ropes. This action of being drawn up is akin to the hands that let the sheet down, indicating the completion of the vision. Everything that had been seen in the vision vanished as it returned to heaven.
