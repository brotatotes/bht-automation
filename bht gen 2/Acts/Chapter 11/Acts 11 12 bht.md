# Acts 11:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Peter explains his actions, he emphasizes that he entered the man's house making no distinction and nothing doubting. This deliberate approach was significant in convincing his fellow apostles and the Christians in Jerusalem of the importance of the events. Peter also acknowledges the six brethren who accompanied him as witnesses to what they had seen and heard. By avoiding mention of Cornelius's name and office, Peter focuses on the fact that they entered the man's house, considering it more persuasive to emphasize the inclusive nature of their actions rather than highlighting Cornelius's status.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1.  12.   Œø·ΩóœÑŒøŒπ ] They had accompanied him to Jerusalem, and were there to substantiate the facts, as far as they had witnessed them.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "No mention of Cornelius' name, much less of his high position, as if that affected the question."
2. "To the charge, 'Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised,' he simply speaks of the uncircumcised 'man' to whom he had been divinely sent."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Nothing doubting [ŒºŒ∑Œ¥ŒµŒΩ Œ¥ŒπŒ±Œ∫œÅŒπŒΩŒøŒºŒµŒΩŒøŒΩ]. The Rev. renders making no distinction, taking the verb in its original sense, which is to separate or distinguish." 
2. "The rendering seems rather strained, doubting being a common rendering in the New Testament and giving a perfectly good sense here. See Matthew 21:21; Mark 11:23, and note on James 1:6."
3. "It was natural that Peter should hesitate. The six brethren. The men of Joppa who had gone with Peter to Cornelius, and had accompanied him also to Jerusalem, either as witnesses for him or for their own vindication, since they had committed the same offense."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This second fact has extreme significance, and shows how deep an impression had been made by the recent events at Caesarea and Joppa, and how careful and deliberate was the course adopted by St. Peter, in order to bring conviction home to his brother apostles and the Christians at Jerusalem generally." 
2. "St. Peter simply terms Cornelius ‚Äòthe man.‚Äô There would have been nothing persuasive in his dwelling on the military rank of Cornelius, or his position at Caesarea, or on the honourable character of the corps to which he belonged."
3. "Even as regards the personal character of Cornelius, his habit of prayer, his generous almsgiving, his faithful discharge of domestic duty, it would not have been politic in Peter to have laid stress on these points before an audience full of prejudice against the Heathen, and reluctant to recognise the existence of true religion except under Hebrew conditions."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Making no distinction." (ŒºŒ∑Œ¥ŒµŒΩ Œ¥ŒπŒ±Œ∫œÅŒπŒΩŒ±ŒΩœÑŒ±). So Westcott and Hort (first aorist active participle) instead of ŒºŒ∑Œ¥ŒµŒΩ Œ¥ŒπŒ±Œ∫œÅŒπŒΩŒøŒºŒµŒΩŒøŒΩ "nothing doubting" (present middle participle) like Acts 10:20. The difference in voice shows the distinction in meaning.
2. "We entered into the man's house." (ŒµŒπœÉŒ∑ŒªŒ∏ŒøŒºŒµŒΩ ŒµŒπœÇ œÑŒøŒΩ ŒøŒπŒ∫ŒøŒΩ œÑŒøœÖ Œ±ŒΩŒ¥œÅŒøœÇ). Peter confesses it, but shows that the other six went in also.
3. "He avoids mention of Cornelius's name and office."

### John Gill:
1. "...nothing doubting,.... moreover, these six brethren accompanied me..." 
2. "...Peter was aware, that he should be called to an account for his conduct..."
3. "...to be witnesses for him, of what they had seen and heard..."
