# Acts 11:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The angel's appearance in Cornelius' house captured the attention of the apostles as they heard the story. This added seriousness to the situation, prompting Peter to follow God's direct orders instead of acting on his own initiative. The angel's presence in such a personal space lent credibility to the encounter, reducing the likelihood of it being an illusion. By taking on the form of a human, the angel further emphasized its extraordinary nature. Peter recognized the angel as a divine messenger, obeying the heavenly vision and understanding the importance of its message.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The difference between the vision of Cornelius and that of Peter is here again strikingly marked: while the latter is merely 'praying in the city of Joppa,' no place nor circumstance being named, the former sees the angel 'standing in his house.'" 
2. "Notice also that Peter never names Cornelius in his speech because he, his character and person, was absorbed in the category to which he belonged, that of men uncircumcised."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

	"the angel," for the rumor took that definite shape.

### Marvin Vincent:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The mention of this angel was a conspicuous part of the story as it reached the ears of the apostles at Jerusalem; and to their minds it must have appeared a very grave part of the whole subject."
2. "If an angel had appeared to â€˜this man,â€™ this at least raised a serious question demanding very careful attention."
3. "If the angel, too, appeared in his very house, this rendered the case much stronger. Not only did it make the risk of illusion less probable, but it seemed to give a kind of sacredness to that house."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Perhaps Peter is anxious to make it plain that he did not go of his own initiative into the house of Cornelius. He went under God's direct orders."

### John Gill:
1. "The clause, 'in his house', is very appropriately put; for since an angel had entered into his house, it could not be criminal in Peter, and the six brethren, to follow him."

3. "He looked upon him as an extraordinary person, as sent to him from God, and therefore obeyed the heavenly vision."
