# Acts 11:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As St. Peter started to share his message, the Holy Ghost interrupted and fell upon Cornelius and his companions, just as He had done at the beginning, on Pentecost. The outpouring of the Holy Spirit in speaking with tongues and other gifts was not exclusive to the Jewish believers but extended to the Gentiles as well, emphasizing that all who believe in Christ have access to the same blessings of the Spirit.
