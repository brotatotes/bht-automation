# Acts 11:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter reflects on the words of the Lord and realizes that the baptism by the Holy Ghost, which he and his fellow believers received, is the fulfullment of John's water baptism. As a result, he sees that since they have already experienced the greater baptism of the Spirit, it would be wrong to deny them the lesser baptism of water.
