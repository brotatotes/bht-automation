# Acts 11:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Because we believed, the Holy Spirit was given to us, and it is by faith in Christ that we receive God's grace. If we exclude those whom God has called and admitted into His Church, we are opposing His will and hindering His work. Let us not arrogantly lay down rules that go against the authority of the supreme Lord of the Church, but rather open our hearts and minds to the inclusive grace of God.
