# Acts 11:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The scattered disciples, who were ministers of the word, traveled far and wide to preach the Gospel. Their dispersion was not in vain, as it led to the spread of Christianity in new regions. They went as far as Phenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, bringing the message of salvation to both Jews and Gentiles. It was a remarkable episode, where their eager and loyal preaching played a significant role in the growth of the early Church, with Antioch eventually becoming a major center of Christian activity.
