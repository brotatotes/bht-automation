# Acts 11:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The early Christians who emphasized circumcision caused a significant controversy within the early Church. Their insistence on circumcision and the division it created between Jews and Gentiles resulted in a clash between Jewish and Gentile Christians. However, it is worth noting that the early Christians did not view Peter as having any special authority over the Church, which contradicts the claims made by the Roman Catholic Church. This controversy showcases the ongoing struggle within the early Church to reconcile the differences between Jewish and Gentile Christians, highlighting the need for unity and inclusivity in the Christian community.
