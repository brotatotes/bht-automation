# Acts 11:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Gospel message was not limited to the Jews alone, but also extended to the Gentiles. In Antioch, some believers from Cyprus and Cyrene, who were familiar with Gentile customs, took the opportunity to preach to the Greeks. These Greeks were not just Hellenistic Jews, but also included uncircumcised Gentiles. This act of preaching to the Gentiles was significant and displayed courage and dedication, as they proclaimed the Lord Jesus and His redemptive work to those who were in need of salvation.
