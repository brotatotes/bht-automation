## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For he was a good man—The sense of 'good' here is plainly 'large-hearted,' 'liberal-minded,' rising above narrow Jewish sectarianism, and that because, as the historian adds, he was 'full of the Holy Ghost and of faith.'"
2. "and much people were added unto the Lord—This proceeding of Barnabas, so full of wisdom, love, and zeal, was blessed to the great increase of the Christian community in that important city."
3. "BARNABAS, FINDING THE WORK IN ANTIOCH TOO MUCH FOR HIM, GOES TO TARSUS FOR SAUL—THEY LABOR THERE TOGETHER FOR A WHOLE YEAR WITH MUCH SUCCESS, AND ANTIOCH BECOMES THE HONORED BIRTHPLACE OF THE TERM CHRISTIAN."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We should not undervalue talent, eloquence, or learning in the ministry, but we may remark that humble piety will often do more in the conversion of souls than the most splendid talents." 
2. "The real power of a minister is concentrated in this, and without this his ministry will be barrenness and a curse."
3. "He was filled with the influences of the sacred Spirit, producing zeal, love, peace, joy, etc."

### John Calvin:
1. "For all those are condemned of ungodliness and malice who envy other men’s labors, and are grieved when they see the same have good success."
2. "But why doth he separate faith from the Spirit, whose gift it is? I answer, that it is not named severally, as if it were a diverse thing, but it is rather set forth as a principal token, whereby it might appear that Barnabas was full of the Holy Ghost."
3. "Thus doth the building of the Church go forward when one doth help another with mutual consent, and one doth gently allow that which another hath begun."
