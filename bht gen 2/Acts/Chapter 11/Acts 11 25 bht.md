## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Even supposing him during this retirement to have preached in Syria and Cilicia, judging by the analogy of his subsequent journeys, a few months at the most would have sufficed for this."
2. "It seems very improbable that any considerable portion of time should have been spent by him before the great work of his ministry began."
3. "The question will be determined by various persons according to the requirements of their chronological system."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Barnabas was the first to take the converted persecutor by the hand and procure his recognition as a disciple by the brethren at Jerusalem."
2. "As co-pastors, for the time being, of the Church there, they so labored that the Gospel, even in that great and many-sided community, achieved for itself a name which will live and be gloried in as long as this world lasts, as the symbol of all that is most precious to the fallen family of man: 'The disciples were called CHRISTIANS first in Antioch.'"
3. "This name originated not within, but without, the Church; not with their Jewish enemies, by whom they were styled 'Nazarenes,' but with the heathen in Antioch, and with the Romans, not the Greeks there."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In such times the ministers of the gospel need additional help, as men in harvest-time need the aid of others."
2. "Saul was in this vicinity... and he was eminently suited to assist in this work."

### John Calvin:
1. "Barnabas’ simplicity is commended to us now the second time, that whereas he might have borne the chiefest swing at Antioch, yet went he into Cilicia that he might fetch Paul thence, who he knew should be preferred before him."
2. "Therefore we see how, forgetting himself, he respecteth nothing but that Christ may be chief; how he setteth before his eyes the edifying of the Church alone; how he is content with the prosperous success of the gospel."
3. "Therefore, Barnabas is no whit afraid lest Paul do any whit debase him by his coming, so he glorify Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We cannot imagine him to have been idle in his Master’s cause; and to this period is probably to be assigned the formation of those Cilician churches of which we find mention afterwards in Acts 15:41, at the beginning of the Second Missionary Journey."
2. "the character of Barnabas is at this point set before us in a most attractive light, in that he brought out of retirement one whose eminence was sure to supersede and eclipse his own."
3. "‘Gagner cette grande âme . . . se faire son inferieur, preparer le champ le plus favorable au deploiement de son activite en oubliant soi-meme, c’est la certes le comble de ce qu’a jamais pu faire la vertu; c’est la ce que Barnabe fit pour Saint Paul."
