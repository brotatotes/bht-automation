# Acts 11:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Antioch, the disciples of Jesus were first called Christians, marking the formation of a distinct and independent Church of Christ. The name was likely given by divine intimation or by the Gentiles to distinguish the followers of Christ from the Jews. It became an honorific appellation, uniting believers from different nations and tribes, surpassing any other name or tribal affiliation. Antioch played a significant role as the birthplace of the Christian name, being known for its propensity to jeer and taunt. This city became a center of influence, spreading the Gospel and establishing the Church.

### Marvin Vincent:
