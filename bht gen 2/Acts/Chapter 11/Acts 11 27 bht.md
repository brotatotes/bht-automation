# Acts 11:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During the time Saul and Barnabas were ministering in Antioch, Christian prophets from Jerusalem arrived. These prophets possessed the ability to not only explain the obscure prophecies of the Old Testament but also to make predictions about future events. These gifted individuals were highly regarded in the early Christian church and were seen as important sources of spiritual guidance. (See Acts 13:1 for further reference.)

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

2. "This inspiration was however, occasionally, as here, and ch. Acts 21:10, made the vehicle of prophecy, properly so called."
3. "The foretelling of future events was not the usual form which their inspiration took."
