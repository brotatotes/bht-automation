# Acts 11:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The prediction made by Agabus, prompted by the Holy Spirit, foretold a significant famine that would affect the entire Roman empire. This prophecy extends beyond a single region and encompasses a much broader scope. Historical evidence supports the occurrence of famines during the reign of Claudius Caesar, confirming the fulfillment of Agabus' prophecy. Furthermore, it is interesting to note that Queen Helena of Adiabene and her son Izates provided aid to the Jewish community during this time of scarcity.
