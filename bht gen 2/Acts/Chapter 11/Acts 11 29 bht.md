# Acts 11:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The believers, recognizing the extent and severity of the famine, determined to contribute according to their ability, understanding the distress their fellow brethren in Judea would otherwise be in. This act of giving not only demonstrated their genuine conversion, but it also served as a testament to their gratitude for having received the Gospel and ministers from Jerusalem. Their generosity was a reflection of the love and unity that characterized the early Christian community, as they willingly offered their temporal resources to support those in need.
