# Acts 11:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is mentioned that some people were objecting to Peter's actions, accusing him of going into the houses of uncircumcised men and eating with them, which was considered unlawful according to Jewish traditions. However, interestingly, they did not mention anything about Peter preaching to and baptizing these people, as this aligned with the commission of Christ. It's a bit puzzling to understand how these actions could be separated, but it is clear that their objection stemmed from their adherence to the past traditions and not from an understanding of the greater purpose of the Gospel.
