# Acts 11:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The early Christian churches were organized similar to the synagogues, with overseers or presidents who were like bishops. These leaders, known as presbyters, were responsible for the administration and governance of the congregations. In the context of charity and care for the needy, it was important to entrust the distribution of alms to the wise and experienced members of the church, ensuring that they would be properly allocated to those in need. The elders played a crucial role in this, with the decision to send alms being made by them and placed in the hands of deacons for distribution.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

3. "The title ἐπίσκοπος, as applied to one person superior to the πρεσβύτεροι, and answering to our 'bishop,' appears to have been unknown in the apostolic times."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word [presbyters] literally denotes 'aged men,' but in the Jewish synagogue it was merely a name of office."
2. "It is clear, however, I think, that the elders of the Jewish synagogue here are not included...it is not probable that a charity like this would have been entrusted to the hands of Jewish elders."

### John Calvin:
1. "For if alms be thrown into the midst of the common people, or be set in the midst where every one may take what he will, every man will by and by take it to himself as if it were some common prey; and so he that is most bold will defraud the needy; yea, through his greediness he will cut the throats of the hungry."
2. "Therefore, let us mark these places, which teach that we must not only deal uprightly and faithfully, but that there is also an order and wisdom required as well in making choice as in all our administration."
