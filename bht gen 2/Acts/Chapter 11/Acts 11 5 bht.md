# Acts 11:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Being in a trance, Peter was able to see and hear things that he would not have otherwise been aware of. This state allowed for divine instruction and guidance, as it suspended the use of his outward senses and allowed him to be receptive to the message being communicated. In this trance, Peter was able to have a deeper understanding and connection with the spiritual realm.
