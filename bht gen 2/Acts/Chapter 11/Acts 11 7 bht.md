# Acts 11:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, the narrator describes hearing a voice speaking to them. It is important to note that the voice was not simply heard externally, but it was a communication that was understood and processed internally. This communication was personal and had an impact on the narrator's own intelligence and consciousness. Additionally, the command to slay and eat is a directive to not only kill, but also to prepare and consume the creatures mentioned. By emphasizing the act of slaying and eating, the passage emphasizes the importance of obedience and action in response to the voice heard.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "I heard a voice saying unto me. In St. Luke’s narrative the phrase is, ‘there came a voice to him.’ The external fact that a voice was uttered is that which he relates. St. Peter tells of his own inward experience. He ‘heard’ the voice. A communication was effectually made to his own intelligence and consciousness."
2. "Slay, and eat. The Authorised Version in Acts 10:13 has ‘kill, and eat.’ But the word in the original is the same. This is an example of the love of our translators for variety in rendering, merely for the sake of variety (see Bishop Lightfoot On a Fresh Revision of the New Testament, p. 33)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A voice saying (φωνης λεγουσης). Genitive case after ηκουσα." 
2. "Participle λεγουσης (present active of λεγω) agreeing with φωνης, a kind of indirect discourse use of the participle."

### John Gill:
1. "And I heard a voice saying unto me..."
2. "arise, Peter, slay and eat; that is, get up and slay some of these creatures upon the sheet, and dress them and eat them."
