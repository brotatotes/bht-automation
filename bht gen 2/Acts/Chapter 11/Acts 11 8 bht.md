# Acts 11:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Someone in the Bible is described as having a strong commitment to observing the ceremonial law, not even tasting what was forbidden. This strict observance reveals their deep prejudice in favor of the law's ceremonies. However, despite hearing the voice of the Lord, this person failed to obey the heavenly vision, indicating a lack of true understanding and obedience. This pattern can be seen in other cases as well, where individuals adhered to the law but fell short of wholehearted submission to God's will.
