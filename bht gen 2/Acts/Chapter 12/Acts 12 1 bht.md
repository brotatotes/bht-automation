# Acts 12:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During this time, Herod Agrippa, out of his own malicious intent, aimed to harm and trouble certain members of the church. While he may not have personally laid hands on them, it is highly probable that he instigated his soldiers or servants to mistreat the Christians. These acts of mistreatment could manifest as verbal abuse, physical strikes, or even interrupting their worship and causing disruption. Herod Agrippa's actions were driven by his desire to persecute the Christians and please the Jewish community, as he sought to gain favor with both the Romans and the Jews.
