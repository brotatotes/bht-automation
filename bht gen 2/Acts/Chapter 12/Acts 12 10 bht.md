# Acts 12:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The circumstances surrounding Peter's escape make his deliverance all the more remarkable. The first ward refers to the soldiers stationed by the door of Peter's cell, while the second ward likely refers to other soldiers stationed at the iron gate further in the prison. The gate leading into the city opened on its own, allowing Peter and the angel to pass through. Peter was led down one street by the angel, ensuring his safe passage. Once Peter was out of danger, the angel departed from him, demonstrating that he was sufficient for what needed to be done.
