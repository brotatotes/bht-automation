# Acts 12:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people were skeptical and thought the girl was out of her senses for confidently affirming that Peter had been released. They couldn't believe that their prayers for his deliverance had been answered. Despite their disbelief, the girl stuck to her statement and firmly believed in what she saw. Some even speculated that it was Peter's guardian angel, as it was a common belief among the Jews that each person had a specific angel who could assume their appearance. However, it is important to note that the Scriptures do not provide a definitive answer on this matter.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "No other rendering but his angel will suit the sense: and with a few exceptions all Commentators, ancient and modern, have recognized this meaning."
2. "From His words taken with the context we infer that each one has his guardian angel: from this passage we find not only that such was believed to be the case, but that it was supposed that such angel occasionally appeared in the semblance of the person himself."
3. "We do not...know who the speakers were: nor is the peculiar form in which they viewed the doctrine binding upon us: it may have been erroneous, and savouring of superstition. But of the doctrine itself this may not be said, as the Lord Himself has asserted it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Thou art mad—one of those exclamations which one can hardly resist on hearing what seems far 'too good to be true.'"
2. "Though this had been the burden of their fervent prayers during all the days of unleavened bread, they dispute themselves out of it as a thing incredible."
3. "How often do we pray for what we can hardly credit the bestowment of, when it comes in answer to our prayers!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Christians are often surprised even when their prayers are answered... It shows, perhaps, with how little faith, after all, they pray, and how slow they are to believe that God can hear and answer prayer."
2. "Christians are often engaged in some unprofitable controversy when they should hasten to catch the first tokens of divine favor, and open their arms to welcome the proofs that God has heard their prayers."
3. "The expression 'It is his angel' may mean that they supposed that the 'tutelary guardian,' or angel appointed to attend Peter, had come to announce something respecting him... Whatever their opinions were, however, it proves nothing on these points. There is no evidence that they were inspired in these opinions, nor are their notions countenanced by the Scriptures."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Constantly affirmed [διισχυριζετο] . Better, confidently affirmed; constant is used in its older sense of consistent. The verb contains two ideas : strong assertion [ισχυς] , and holding to the assertion through all contradiction [δια] ; hence, she strongly and consistently asserted."
2. "Angel. Guardian angel, according to the popular belief among the Jews that every individual has his guardian angel, who may, on occasion, assume a visible appearance resembling that of the person whose destiny is committed to him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is evident that the Christians (or at least some of them) who were present that night in Mary’s house believed that Peter’s guardian angel had assumed his voice and was standing before the door."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
