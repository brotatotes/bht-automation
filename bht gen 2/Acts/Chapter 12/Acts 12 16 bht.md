# Acts 12:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter's persistence in knocking on the door showed his impatience and longing to be reunited with his friends. He was in great danger of being captured again and sent back to prison if any of his enemies happened to pass by and recognize him. The astonishment of those who opened the door was evident, for they could hardly believe their own eyes. The miraculous deliverance of Peter from his confinement was truly remarkable, considering the tight security that surrounded him.
