# Acts 12:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter, aware of the magnitude of his deliverance, quickly departs and shares the details in a calm and grateful manner, beckoning for silence to honor the solemnity of the occasion. James, recognized for his authority among the Jerusalem Christians, is informed of Peter's miraculous escape as he likely had taken on a leadership role. Peter's actions of seeking a safe place after his release show his prudence in avoiding unnecessary danger. The notion that Peter went to Rome during this time lacks evidence and should not be accepted without a basis.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "His motive was haste: he tells briefly the particulars of his deliverance, and, while it was yet night, hastily departs."
2. "I believe him to have been one of those ἀδελφοὶ τοῦ κυρίου mentioned Matthew 13:55; John 7:5; ch. Acts 1:14; 1 Corinthians 9:5, of whom I have in the note on the first of these passages maintained, that they were His real maternal brethren, sons of Joseph and Mary."
3. "I see in these words a minute mark of truth in our narrative. Under the circumstances, the place of Peter’s retreat would very naturally at the time be kept secret. It probably was unknown to the person from whom the narrative came, or designedly left indefinite."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In the hubbub of joyful and wondering interrogatories there might mingle reflections, thrown out by one against another, for holding out so long against the testimony of Rhoda; while the emotion of the apostle's own spirit would be too deep and solemn to take part in such demonstrations or utter a word till, with his hand, he had signified his wish for perfect silence."
2. "James is singled out, because he had probably begun to take the oversight of the Church in Jerusalem, which we afterwards find him exercising."
3. "When told, on a former miraculous liberation from prison, to go and speak unto the people, he did it; but in this case to present himself in public would have been to tempt God by rushing upon certain destruction."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Religion is calm and peaceful; and its great scenes and surprising deliverances are rather suited to awe the soul to produce calm, sober, and grateful contemplation, than the noise of rejoicing, and the shoutings of exultation."
2. "The consciousness of the presence of God, and of his mighty power, does not produce rapturous disorder and tumult, but holy, solemn, calm, grateful emotion."
3. "Go, show these things ... - Acquaint them that their prayer is heard, and that they may rejoice also at the mercy of God."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "It was a familiar gesture of Paul."
3. "See ch. Acts 21:40; Acts 26:1."

### John Calvin:
1. "I do rather conjecture, that this was James the son of Alpheus, whose holiness was such, that it caused the Jews to wonder at it."
