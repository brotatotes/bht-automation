# Acts 12:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As day broke, there was an intense commotion among the soldiers who had been guarding Peter. The two soldiers between whom Peter had slept were particularly agitated, along with the rest of the guards who were responsible for keeping watch. Everyone was in a state of uproar, deeply concerned and frightened, trying to figure out what had happened to Peter, where he could have gone, and how he managed to escape from the prison.
