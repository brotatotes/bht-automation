# Acts 12:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
James the brother of John was one of the first apostles to be martyred, fulfilling the prophecy of Jesus that he would be baptized with the baptism of martyrdom. His brother John, on the other hand, would become the last of the apostles. The death of James by beheading was considered a dishonorable way to die among the Jews, making his sacrifice even more significant. Their close relationship as brothers and disciples of Jesus earned them the nickname Sons of Thunder, highlighting their special place in the Lord's inner circle.
