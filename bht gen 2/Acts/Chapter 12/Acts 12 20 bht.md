# Acts 12:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Herod's anger towards the people of Tyre and Sidon stemmed from a commercial rivalry, leading him to contemplate war against them. The inhabitants of these cities, concerned about the impact on their trade and resources, sought reconciliation with Herod. They approached Blastus, who held a position of influence in Herod's court, and through his intervention, peace was achieved. The people of Tyre and Sidon relied on the supplies of grain and goods from Palestine, which were crucial for their sustenance. The reconciliation brought them relief from scarcity, safeguarding their well-being and ensuring their continued provisions.
