# Acts 12:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Upon a set day, Herod, clad in royal apparel, addressed the crowds gathered for the celebration. His outfit, made entirely of shimmering silver, captivated the onlookers, filling them with awe and apprehension. As the sun's first rays glanced off his attire, it created a dazzling spectacle that left the spectators astounded. This blend of ostentation and adulation was not uncommon, as people often showered rulers with blasphemous praise. However, the frequency of this sinful practice did not diminish its wickedness.
