# Acts 12:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people, in their enthusiasm, gave a loud shout declaring that the voice they heard was not that of a mere mortal, but the voice of a divine being. These were individuals seeking to gain favor, flatterers who cried out in unison, acknowledging Herod as a deity. They exalted him, confessing that he surpassed the limitations of human nature.
