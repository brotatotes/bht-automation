# Acts 12:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The story recounts the swift and just punishment that befell a king who failed to give glory to God. An angel of the Lord struck him down, displaying God's immediate response to the offense. Interestingly, the means by which the king suffered was not obvious to those who witnessed it. The people of God alone knew about the worms that infested his flesh, causing him agony until his death on the fifth day. This swift and gruesome judgment serves as a powerful reminder of God's authority and the consequences of failing to honor Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Our narrative alleges the cause of what happened to have been the displeasure of God and the stroke to have been inflicted by His angel."
2. "In several cases of deaths by divine judgment we have accounts of this loathsome termination of the disease."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "An interesting parallel is furnished by the story of Alp Arslan, a Turkish prince of the eleventh century. 'The Turkish prince bequeathed a dying admonition to the pride of kings. 'In my youth,' said Alp Arslan, 'I was advised by a sage to humble myself before God; to distrust my own strength; and never to despise the most contemptible foe. I have neglected these lessons, and my neglect has been deservedly punished.'" 
2. "For on her return to Egypt from Libya, directly after taking vengeance on the people of Barca, she was overtaken by a horrid death. Her body swarmed with worms, which ate her flesh while she was still alive."
3. "So that the worms rose up out of the body of this wicked man, and whiles he lived in sorrow and pain, his flesh fell away, and the filthiness of his smell was noisome to all his army."

### John Calvin:
1. "And God doth sometimes use the ministry of angels in heaven in punishing; but sometimes he maketh the devils as hangmen, by whose hand he executeth his judgments."
2. "For God intended to make choice of a kind of punishment wherewith he might repress the cruelty of a proud man with extreme ignominy."
3. "Such a manifest example of horrible vengeance in a king’s person ought to terrify us not a little from presuming to take to ourselves more than we ought."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The writer of the ‘Acts,’ whom we believe to have been identical with Luke, the beloved physician, gives a more accurate description of the mysterious and terrible disease which closed the brilliant career of the ‘last king of Israel.’"
2. "It has been suggested that this fearful malady is especially reserved by God for princes who have cruelly misused their power over their subjects."
3. "After the death of Herod Agrippa I., Jerusalem was never ruled again by a native prince; a Roman procurator in Jerusalem, Cuspius Fadus, was appointed by the Government of Rome."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Like Nebuchadnezzar (Daniel 4:30) pride went before a fall. He was struck down in the very zenith of his glory." 
2. "He accepted the impious flattery (Hackett) instead of giving God the glory. He was a nominal Jew."
3. "Josephus (Ant. XIX. 8, 2) says that Herod Agrippa lingered for five days and says that the rotting of his flesh produced worms, an item in harmony with the narrative in Luke. Josephus gives further details, one a superstitious sight of an owl sitting on one of the ropes of the awning of the theatre while the people flattered him, an omen of his death to him. Luke puts it simply that God smote him."

### John Gill:
1. "The reason of the angel's smiting him was because he gave not glory to God."
2. "This was accounted by the Jews a very accursed death; they say...that their tongues swelled and fell upon their navels, and worms came out of their tongues and went into their navels."
3. "By such a token as this, a man was discovered to be a murderer with the Jews; for so they say...the sanhedrim laid hold on him and condemned him."

### John Wesley:
1. "And immediately — God does not delay to vindicate his injured honour; an angel of the Lord smote him."
2. "Men did not see the instruments in either case. These were only known to the people of God."
3. "So then vengeance tarried not. And he was eaten by worms, or vermin — How changed! And on the fifth day expired in exquisite torture."
