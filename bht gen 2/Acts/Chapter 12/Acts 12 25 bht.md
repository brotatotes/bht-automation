# Acts 12:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The purpose of Saul's mission in Jerusalem was quickly accomplished, and he did not remain there for long, seeking to avoid unnecessary attention. It is likely that Saul and Barnabas returned to Jerusalem to fulfill their ministry and serve the church during a time of persecution. They also took John Mark with them, a man of promise and usefulness, as a companion in spreading the Gospel. The ministry mentioned here most likely refers to the alms brought from Antioch to support the poor saints in Jerusalem.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "Hence there seems an additional reason for placing the visit after Herod’s death: for, of all the persons whose execution would be pleasing to the Jews, Saul would hold the foremost place."
