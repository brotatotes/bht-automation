# Acts 12:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter's imprisonment was a matter of great caution. Herod, mindful of Peter's previous escape, took no chances. He placed Peter in a heavily guarded prison, assigning four groups of soldiers, known as quaternions, to watch over him day and night. Two soldiers remained inside the prison, with Peter securely chained, while the other two stood guard at the doors. Herod's intention was to bring Peter before the people after the Passover, avoiding any possibility of controversy during the sacred festival. This careful arrangement demonstrated Herod's determination to ensure Peter's confinement and prevent any potential escape.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In military arrangements, Herod seems to have retained the Roman habits, according to which the night was divided into four watches, and each committed to four soldiers...to two of whom the prisoner was chained, the other two keeping watch before the doors of the prison."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "delivered him to four quaternions of soldiersâ€”that is, to four parties of four each, corresponding to the four Roman watches; two watching in prison and two at the gates, and each party being on duty for the space of one watch."
2. "intending after the Passover...after the whole festival was over."
3. "to bring him forth to the peopleâ€”for execution; for during 'the days of unleavened bread,' or the currency of any religious festival, the Jews had a prejudice against trying or putting anyone to death."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "During the solemnities of this religious festival, it would have been deemed improper to have engaged in the trial of a supposed criminal."
2. "The utmost precaution was taken that he should not escape; and Herod thus gave the most ample assurance to the Jews of his intention to secure Peter, and to bring him to trial."
3. "The providence of God in regard to Peter is thus remarkable. Instead of his being put suddenly to death, as was James, he was reserved for future trial; and thus an opportunity was given for the prayers of the church, and for his consequent release."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Quaternions. A quaternion was a body of four soldiers; so that there were sixteen guards, four for each of the four night-watches."
2. "Bring him forth [Î±Î½Î±Î³Î±Î³Î±Î³ÎµÎ¹Î½ Î±Ï…Ï„Î¿Î½]. Lit., lead him up; i.e., to the elevated place where the tribunal stood, to pronounce sentence of death before the people."

### John Calvin:
1. "Luke doth, in this place, declare by circumstances that Peter was, as it were, shut up in his grave, so that it might seem that he was quite past hope."
2. "He showeth the cause why he was not forthwith put to death, because it had been an heinous offense to put him to death in the Easter holidays."
3. "Herod doth not delay the time as doubtful what to do, but doth only wait for opportunity; yea, he maketh choice of a time, when as his gift may be more plausible, because there came a great multitude together from all parts unto the holy day."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers. That is, to four bands of soldiers, each band consisting of four." 
2. "These were to relieve each other in guarding the prisoner."
3. "Intending after Easter. (Literally, â€˜after the Passover.â€™) King Herod wished to be considered a strict observer of the law."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The stricter Jews regarded it as a profanation to put a person to death during a religious festival" (Hackett).
2. "Probably Agrippa had heard of Peter's previous escape (Acts 5:19) and so took no chances for connivance of the jailors."
3. "Peter was in the inner prison or lower ward and so would be led up to the judgment seat where Herod Agrippa would sit."

### John Gill:
1. "He put him in prison... and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him." 
2. "And it may be, that the reason of all this caution, and strong guard, might be because it was remembered that he, and the rest of the apostles, when committed to the same prison some years ago, were delivered out of it." 
3. "Intending after Easter, or the passover, to bring him forth to the people; to insult and abuse him, and to put him to what death they should desire."

### John Wesley:
1. Four quaternions â€” Sixteen men, who watched by turns day and night.
