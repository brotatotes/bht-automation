# Acts 12:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The believers did not cease in their prayers for him, continually and earnestly crying out to God on his behalf. Although they were likely separated into different groups, their united prayers sought deliverance for Peter from the hands of Herod. Their prayers were so fervent that when God answered their prayer and rescued Peter, they were astonished. This dedicated prayer to save Peter's life may shed light on why they did not offer the same prayer for James, who was martyred shortly after his arrest.
