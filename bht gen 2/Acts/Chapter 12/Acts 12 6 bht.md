# Acts 12:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter, undeterred by the imminent trial facing him, slept peacefully that very night. The guards, taking extra precautions, attached him with chains and ensured his confinement. However, Peter's serene slumber was a testimony to his unwavering trust in God, who gifted him with tranquility even in the face of adversity. The guards, completely unaware of the angelic presence, remained oblivious to the divine intervention that was about to unfold.
