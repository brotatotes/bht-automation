# Acts 12:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The vividness of the details given in this passage helps to reinforce the reality of the event. The angel instructs the person to gird himself, indicating that he had previously removed his outer garment and loosed his inner tunic. Additionally, he is told to bind on his sandals, preparing to walk, and to throw on his heavy cloak for protection against the morning chill. The promptness and obedience with which these instructions are followed demonstrate the necessity for swift action in the given circumstances.
