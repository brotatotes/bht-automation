# Acts 12:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Peter came out from his confinement, he followed the angel who led him. He wasn't sure if what he was experiencing was reality or merely a vision. The whole situation seemed so astonishing and extraordinary that he couldn't believe it was happening. It was as if he thought he was in a dream or trance, and everything unfolding before him was part of a vivid vision.
