# Acts 13:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we see that the mention of the prophets and teachers indicates individuals who had the ability to predict future events and interpret Old Testament prophecies, while also teaching the people about the Gospel. It is also interesting to note that Manaen, who was associated with Herod the tetrarch, had a close relationship with Herod the Great and held a prominent position. Furthermore, the mention of Saul, who later became known as Paul, shows the importance of his role in the unfolding events.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "That those enumerated were all then present, is implied by the τε … καί: see ch. Acts 1:13."
2. "Σαῦλος mentioned last, perhaps because the prophets are placed first, and he was not one, but a teacher: or it may be, that he himself furnished the account."
3. "This circumstance, which has been objected to by some as invalidating the accuracy of the account, is in fact an interesting confirmation of it, as being eminently characteristic of him who spoke as in 1 Corinthians 15:9; 2 Corinthians 12:6; Ephesians 3:8."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Simeon . . . Niger—of whom nothing is known." 
2. "How differently did these two foster brothers turn out—the one, abandoned to a licentious life and stained with the blood of the most distinguished of God's prophets, though not without his fits of reformation and seasons of remorse; the other, a devoted disciple of the Lord Jesus and prophet of the Church at Antioch! But this is only what may be seen in every age."
3. "and Saul—last of all, but soon to become first. Henceforward this book is almost exclusively occupied with him; and his impress on the New Testament, on Christendom, and on the world is paramount."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Teachers are several times mentioned in the New Testament as an order of ministers... Their precise rank and duty are not known." 
2. "It is probable that those mentioned here as prophets were the same persons as the teachers." 
3. "Saul was an apostle; and yet he is mentioned here among the 'prophets and teachers,' showing that these words denote 'ministers of the gospel' in general, without reference to any particular order or rank."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The mention of the evangelist 's name here is not in accord with his usual practice, since he nowhere mentions his own name, either in the Gospel or in the Acts."
2. "If suggeneiv, kinsmen, means here, as is claimed by some, countrymen, it would prove Lucius to be a Jew; but the word is commonly used of relatives in the New Testament."
3. "Which had been brought up with [συντροφος]. Some render foster-brother, as Rev.; others, comrade. The word has both meanings."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul's calling ought to be of no less weight amongst us, than if God should cry from heaven in the hearing of all men, that the salvation, promised in times past to Abraham, and to the seed of Abraham, doth no less appertain unto us at this day."
2. "And now the wall of separation is taken away, that both those who were far off and those which were nigh hand may be reconciled to God; and that being gathered under one head, they may grow together to be one body."
3. "Lest any man should think that that church was destitute of good and fit ministers, so that God did provide for other churches with the loss of it, Luke preventeth this, and saith, that there was such store there, that though it did help others, yet did there remain sufficient for the use thereof."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The church that was at Antioch. It was a grand work the church of Antioch was about to inaugurate, but a work which to the fathers of the Church who dwelt under the shadow of the proud Jerusalem Temple would seem very strange and contrary to the spirit which had so long dwelt in the Hebrew peoples."
2. "The ‘prophets’ and ‘teachers’ here spoken of were men to whom the power was at times given of communicating truths connected with the religion of Jesus under a Divine inspiration, and occasionally of predicting future events."
3. "No one in the early Church exercised a more noble influence than the Cypriote Barnabas; no one laboured more earnestly or more successfully to carry out his Risen Master’s plans."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul is now the central figure instead of Peter. Jerusalem had hesitated too long to carry out the command of Jesus to take the gospel to the whole world. That glory will now belong to Antioch."
2. "All prophets were teachers, but not all teachers were prophets who were for-speakers of God, sometimes fore-speakers like Agabus in Acts 11:28."
3. "Manaen shows how the gospel was reaching some of the higher classes (home of Herod Antipas)."

### John Gill:
1. "These prophets and teachers had both a gift of foretelling things to come, as Agabus and others, and of explaining the prophecies of the Old Testament, and of teaching the people evangelic truths."

3. "Saul; who afterwards was called Paul."
