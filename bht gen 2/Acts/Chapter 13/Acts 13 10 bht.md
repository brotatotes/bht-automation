# Acts 13:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Elymas, the false prophet, was known for his deceitfulness and wickedness, constantly perverting the ways of the Lord. Like his father, the devil, he was full of guile and mischief. His actions not only hindered people from finding the truth, but he actively worked against it. Paul's rebuke to Elymas reflects the gravity of his offenses, as he was a man driven by evil motives and the desire to distort the straight paths of God.
