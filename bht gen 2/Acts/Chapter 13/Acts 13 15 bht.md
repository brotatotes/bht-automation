# Acts 13:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After the law and prophets were read, the rejoicing of the law could be felt as it was a day of celebration. Each year, the law was read in its entirety, with a portion of it read each Sabbath, accompanied by lessons from the prophets. Following the reading, it was customary for anyone to address the people on any subject they deemed appropriate. However, out of respect for the rulers of the synagogue, Paul and Barnabas would have likely communicated their intentions to them beforehand.
