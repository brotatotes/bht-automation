## BHT:
The God of this chosen people, Israel, showed his favor by choosing our fathers and bestowing upon them blessings and privileges.

The narrative in these verses encompasses the entirety of the Old Testament, with God's faithfulness and the exalted position of the people being highlighted. It was not their own merit or virtue but the mighty works of God that brought honor to the people.
