# Acts 13:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During the forty years in the wilderness, God demonstrated His mercy by bearing and nourishing the Israelites like a nursing father. He tirelessly endured their stubborn and disobedient behavior, striving with their wickedness through His election and divine goodness. Though He withheld complete destruction, God ensured that their sins did not go unpunished. Ultimately, He lovingly provided for them, led them, and protected them as the apple of His eye, just as it is written in Deuteronomy 1:31.

3. "Such a course would rather tend to exasperate than to conciliate; but by reminding them of the mercies of God to them, and showing them that He had been their protector, he was better fitting them for his main purpose - that of showing them the kindness of the God of their fathers in sending to them a Saviour."
