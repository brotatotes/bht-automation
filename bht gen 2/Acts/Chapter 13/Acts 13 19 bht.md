# Acts 13:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He executed a complete destruction of the seven nations in the land of Canaan, although they were not completely annihilated or driven out. There were some who remained, causing trouble for the Israelites. Nevertheless, the conquest was so decisive that they were never able to regain their former power. The land was then divided among the tribes, each receiving their designated portion determined by lot. This division occurred around four hundred and fifty years after the choice of the fathers for their inheritance.
