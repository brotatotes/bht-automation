# Acts 13:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the disciples were serving the Lord, they were designated by the Holy Spirit for a special mission, not to be ordained, but to be set apart. It is unclear whether this happened during their regular service or on a specific occasion prompted by the Holy Spirit. In response, they fasted, prayed, and laid their hands on Barnabas and Saul, a ritual commonly used for blessings and other significant events. The work they were called to was not a permanent office in the church, but a temporary mission to spread the Gospel among the Gentiles.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The general word for the priestly service among the Jews, to which now had succeeded that of προφῆται and διδάσκαλοι in the Christian church: ministering is therefore the only word adequate to render it." 
2. "The apostolic office terminated with the apostolic times, and by its very nature, admitted not of continuance."
3. "The episcopal office, in its ordinary sense, sprung up after the apostolic times and the two are entirely distinct."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The word denotes the performance of official duties of any kind, and was used to express the priestly functions under the Old Testament. Here it signifies the corresponding ministrations of the Christian Church."
2. "As this was done in other cases on special occasions, it is not improbable that they had been led to expect some such prophetic announcement at this time."
3. "While the personality of the Holy Ghost is manifest from this language, His supreme divinity will appear equally so by comparing it with Hebrews 5:4."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "As they ministered to the Lord - It is probable that this took place on some day set apart for fasting and prayer."
2. "Separate me - Set apart to me, or for my service. It does not mean to ordain, but simply to designate, or appoint to this specific work."
3. "The 'work' to which they were now set apart was that of preaching the gospel in the regions round about Antioch. It was not any permanent office in the church, but was a temporary designation to a missionary enterprise in extending the gospel."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Ministered [λειτουργουντων] . See on the kindred noun ministration, Luke 1:23. This noun has passed through the following meanings : 1. A civil service, especially in the technical language of Athenian law."
2. "The Greek adds dh, now, which is not rendered by A. V. or Rev. It gives precision and emphasis to the command, implying that it is for a special purpose, and to be obeyed at the time."
3. "Compare Luke 2:15; Acts 14:36; 1 Corinthians 6:20."

### John Calvin:
1. "The prayers of all the godly are the spiritual calves of the lips, (Hosea 14:2,) wherewith God is well pleased, when they are offered up upon the holy altar; that is, in Christ’s name."
2. "God commandeth that Paul and Barnabas be sent by the consent of the Church, thither whither he had appointed them to be sent; whereby we gather that there is no lawful election of pastors, save only wherein God is chief."
3. "For, seeing the Lord doth pronounce that he had called him, what doth he leave for the Church, save only that they subscribe obediently? For men’s judgment is not here put as in a doubtful matter, neither have their voices and consents any freedom."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word translated ‘as they ministered’ was the general word used in the Old Testament for ‘priestly service.’ The writer of the ‘Acts’ here uses it to express generally the Christian divine service, including prayer, the singing of hymns and psalms, the office of preaching, the whole crowned by the solemn partaking of the Lord’s Supper." 
2. "It is not certain if this was the ordinary service of the Antioch church which the Christians were in the habit of attending the first day of the week, or if it was a special solemn gathering, called together in consequence of some intimation of the Holy Ghost to one of the inspired prophets, that a voice would come from God to the congregation." 
3. "The Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them...showing that He is coequal with God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The word liturgy grows out of this use." 
2. "Fasting was not obligatory on the Christians, but they were facing a great emergency in giving the gospel to the Gentile world." 
3. "Both had been called to ministry long ago, but now this call is to the special campaign among the Gentiles."

### John Gill:
1. "As they ministered to the Lord..." 
2. "Whether it was on one of those days, that these men were ministering and fasting, is not certain..."
3. "The work which the Holy Ghost had appointed, and called them to before this, was to go and preach the Gospel among the Gentiles..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them — This was not ordaining them."
2. "In consequence of this they fasted, prayed, and laid their hands on them, a rite which was used not in ordination only, but in blessing, and on many other occasions."
