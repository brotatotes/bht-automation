# Acts 13:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This account measures the time from God's choice of the Jewish fathers until the division of the land, not the duration of the judges. Though there were three years missing in the sum, the apostle's use of about was appropriate. Until Samuel the prophet does not imply a specific timeframe, but rather that after that time period, God raised up judges until Samuel, who was the last of them.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The time of the judges lasted 450 years." 
2. "Paul followed a chronology current among the Jews, and agreeing with the book of Judges itself, and that adopted by Josephus, but not with that of our present Hebrew text of 1 Kings 6:1."
3. "The objection to this view, that Josephus is not consistent with himself (Olsh.), but in Antt. xx. 10. 1, contra Apion. ii. 2 gives another chronology."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "about four hundred fifty years elapsed from the time of the covenant with Abraham until the period of the judges"
2. "this statement also will appear historically correct, if we include in it the interval of subjection to foreign powers which occurred during the period of the judges, and understand it to describe the whole period from the settlement of the tribes in Canaan to the establishment of royalty"
3. "from the Exodus to the building of the temple were five hundred ninety-two years; deduct forty years in the wilderness; twenty-five years of Joshua's rule; forty years of Saul's reign; forty of David's and the first four years of Solomon's reign, and there remain, just four hundred forty-three years; or, in round numbers, 'about four hundred fifty years.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He gave unto them judges - Men who were raised up in an extraordinary manner to administer the affairs of the nation, to defend it from enemies, etc."
2. "The difficulty has been to reconcile it with what is said in 1 Kings 6:1, 'And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel ...he began to build the house of the Lord.'"
3. "Paul would naturally use the chronology which was in current, common use among the Jews. It was not his business to settle such points; but he would speak of them as they were usually spoken of, and refer to them as others did."

### John Calvin:
1. "Under this name the Scripture comprehendeth rulers and governors; and here is another testimony of the infinite goodness of God toward the Jews, in that he pardoned so many backslidings in them."
2. "And we know what was the estate of the people during all that time, seeing that through untamed wantonness they did ever now and then shake off the yoke."
3. "They were often punished with most grievous plagues, yet so soon as they were once humbled, God delivered them from the tyranny of their enemies."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "These questions of obscure dates, especially in a period so confused as the times of the judges, are of little or no importance."
2. "The apparent discrepancy is done away with by the discovery of what is evidently the true reading."
3. "The only remaining question is, when did the four hundred and fifty years commence?"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "And after these things (κα μετα ταυτα). That is, the time of the Judges then began." 
2. "Until Samuel the prophet (εως Σαμουηλ προφητου). The terminus ad quem." 
3. "He was the last of the judges and the first of the prophets who selected the first king (Saul) under God's guidance."

### John Gill:
1. "This account respects not the time of the judges, or how long they were, but refers to all that goes before, and measures out the space of time from God's choice of the Jewish fathers, to the division of the land of Canaan."
2. "According to this account, there were three years wanting of the sum in the text; hence the apostle might with great propriety say, that it was about the space of so many years."
3. "The meaning of 'until Samuel the prophet' is not that there was such a space of time as before mentioned, from the distribution of the land of Canaan until the times of Samuel the prophet, during which space judges were given; but that after that term of time was expired, God gave them judges, or raised up one after another, until Samuel the prophet, who was the last of them."
