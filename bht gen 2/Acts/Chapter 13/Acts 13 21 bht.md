# Acts 13:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's provision of Saul for forty years, which includes the time when Samuel judged Israel, is discussed amongst scholars. While the Old Testament does not specifically mention the length of Saul's reign, the apostle Paul refers to this period in his writings. This aligns with the historical account given by Josephus, who also notes the duration of Saul's reign. The inclusion of Samuel's leadership within the forty-year timeframe further supports this understanding.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It may be not altogether irrelevant to notice that a Saul, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, was speaking; and to trace in this minute specification something characteristic and natural."
2. "The length of Saulâ€™s reign is not specified; 1Sa 7:2 gives no reason, as Bengel thinks, why Saulâ€™s reign should have been less than twenty years, as the twenty years there mentioned do not extend to the bringing up of the ark by David, but only to the circumstances mentioned in the following verses."
3. "Biscoe has well shewn (p. 399), that as Saul was a young man when anointed king, and Ishbosheth his youngest son (1Ch 8:33) was forty years old at his death (2Sa 2:10), his reign cannot have been much short of that period."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "God gave . . . them Saul . . . of the tribe of Benjaminâ€”That the speaker was himself of the same name and of the same tribe, has often been noticed as in all likelihood present to the apostle's mind while speaking."
2. "forty yearsâ€”With this length of Saul's reign (not mentioned in the Old Testament), JOSEPHUS coincides [Antiquities, 6.14.9]."

### John Calvin:

2. "The wicked and unlawful desire of the people was to God a new and incredible occasion to erect the kingdom whence Christ should afterward come."
3. "God, who knoweth how to use evil things well, turned that offense into safety."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Old Testament does not mention the length of Saulâ€™s reign."
2. "The statement here, however, agrees with Josephus, who speaks of Saul reigning eighteen years before Samuelâ€™s death and twenty-two after it."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They were tired of a theocracy."
2. "Paul mentions with pride that Benjamin was the tribe of Saul."
