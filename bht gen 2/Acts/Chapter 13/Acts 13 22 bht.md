# Acts 13:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God chose David to be the king of Israel, even though he came from humble beginnings as a shepherd. David was a man found by God, specifically chosen to sit on the throne and serve as a type of the Messiah. He was a man after God's own heart, loved and favored by Him. However, it is important to note that this designation does not imply perfection. David's heart was not always aligned with God's will, and he made mistakes. But overall, David sought to do God's will and was grateful and pleasing to Him.

1. "This refers, doubtless, rather to the public than to the private character of David; to his character as a king. It means that he would make the will of God the great rule and law of his reign, in contradistinction from Saul, who, as a king, had disobeyed God."
