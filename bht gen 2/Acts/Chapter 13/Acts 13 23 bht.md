# Acts 13:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Of David's lineage, as promised by God, the Messiah, Jesus, was sent to fulfill the prophecies. This fulfillment is significant as it demonstrates that Christ's arrival was not sudden but had been foretold since ancient times. Jesus was raised up not only for the people of Israel, but for all the chosen ones, both Jews and Gentiles, offering them salvation from sin, Satan, and the law. The apostle focuses on the history of Israel and the favors bestowed upon them to emphasize the special mercy that was promised and now fully realized through Jesus.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The very word ἄγω is used; not however excluding the many other promises to the same effect."
2. "The reading σωτηρίαν has probably arisen from the contracted way of writing Ἰησοῦν, thus: σωτηραῑν."
3. "Then from Act 13:26 σωτηρίαν was adopted."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Of this man's seed hath God, according to . . . promise, raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus—The emphasis on this statement lies: (1) in the seed from which Christ sprang—David's—and the promise to that effect, which was thus fulfilled"
2. "on the character in which this promised Christ was given of God—'a SAVIOUR.' His personal name 'JESUS' is emphatically added, as designed to express that very character."
3. "(See on  :-)."

### Albert Barnes:

### John Calvin:
1. "This clause doth also prove that which I have already said elsewhere, that in sending Christ, the Lord had respect only unto his own faithfulness and goodness; for he sent him because he had promised so to do."
2. "And as the promise doth testify that salvation was free, so it doth also purchase no small credit to the gospel; because it appeareth by this that Christ came not at a sudden, of whom there was never anything spoken; but that he who was promised from the beginning was now given in his time."
3. "He saith that Jesus was raised up to Israel; because, though salvation belong to the whole world, yet was he first a minister of circumcision to fulfill the promises made to the fathers."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Of this man’s seed. This was the first requisite, for unless He were descended from David, Jesus could not be the Messiah foretold by the prophets."
2. "God, according to his promise, raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus. The first part of the Antioch sermon spoke of the history of Israel under the protection and guidance of the unseen Messiah; the second part of the discourse tells of this Messiah’s appearance on earth."
3. "‘According to His promise.’ Paul returns to and speaks of the long looked-for promise in the thirty-second verse. Instead of the word translated ‘raised’ (unto Israel), the word contained in the older Mss. here signifies ‘brought’ (unto Israel). It is the very word used in the Messianic prophecy of Zechariah 3:8: ‘Behold, I will bring forth my servant the Branch.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Of this man's seed...from the (his) seed." 
2. "See the promise in 2 Samuel 7:2; Psalms 132:11; Isaiah 11:1; Isaiah 11:10; Jeremiah 23:5; Zechariah 3:8." 
3. "Paul goes no further than David because he suggests to him Jesus, descendant in the flesh from David."

### John Gill:
1. "...as God had promised that the Messiah should spring out of David's loins, so in the fulness of time he had sent him, or caused him to come by the assumption of human nature, or by taking flesh of a virgin..."
2. "...he was raised up for the mystical Israel of God, all the elect, whether Jews or Gentiles; and that to be the Saviour of them, from sin, Satan, and the law, and every enemy, with a spiritual and eternal salvation, and that both of body and soul..."
3. "...it was for the sake of this, that the apostle begins with the choice of the Jewish fathers, and relates so many favours bestowed upon the people of Israel; his view was to lead on to observe this special mercy promised them, and now fulfilled, on which he intended to enlarge in his discourse, as follows."
