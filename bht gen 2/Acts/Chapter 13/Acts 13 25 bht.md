# Acts 13:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As John was fulfilling his course, he wanted to make it clear that he was not the Messiah. His ministry was like a race that needed to be completed, and he had no doubt about his role. John willingly refused the honor offered to him, ensuring that Christ alone had the preeminence. John's humility was evident when he affirmed that he was not worthy to even untie the sandals of the Lord. His goal was to secure the honor and glory of Christ and prevent any mistaken opinions about his own identity.

### Albert Barnes:

2. "These are not the precise words which the evangelists have recorded, but the sense is the same."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Think ye [υπονοειτε] . Originally, to think secretly : hence to suspect, conjecture.

### John Calvin:
1. "This interrogation, Whom do ye think me to be?, is not a question of one that doubteth."
2. "His testimony doth deserve greater credit, in that he doth willingly refuse the honor offered him...There cannot, assuredly, be any suspicion of ambition, or of seeking after honor here, which may discredit his words."
3. "He meant to do that faithfully which was given him in charge, that Christ alone might have the preeminence...For though God’s servants have their dignity, yet being compared to Christ, they must all be as nothing, that he alone may excel."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "As John was fulfilling his course." (Imperfect active of πληροω) Paul uses this word δρομος (course) of his own race (Acts 20:24; 2 Timothy 4:7).
2. "What suppose ye that I am?" (Τ εμε υπονοειτε ειναι?) It is indirect discourse (the infinitive εινα and the accusative of general reference).
3. "I am not he." (ουκ ειμ εγω) These precise words are not given in the Gospels, but the idea is the same as the disclaimers by the Baptist in John 1:19-27 (cf. also Matthew 3:11; Mark 1:7; Luke 3:16).

### John Gill:
1. "The life of every Christian is a race, and especially of a minister of the Gospel, and which requires strength, courage, agility, patience, and perseverance."
2. "The way in which they run, is the way of their duty, the way of God's commandments; the mark they have in view, which they keep their eye on, and to which they direct their course, is Christ."
3. "John takes care to secure the honour and glory of Christ, and to prevent any low opinion that might be entertained of him from what he had said, by adding, whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to loose."

### John Wesley:
1. His course — His work was quickly finished, and might therefore well be termed a course or race. Luke 3:16.
