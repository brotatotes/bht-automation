# Acts 13:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The word salvation is used to describe the message of the Gospel, which offers salvation to both Jews and Gentiles. The Gospel is not just a proposal or set of terms, but a declaration of salvation itself. It is through the Gospel that salvation is applied to individuals, as it is through hearing the word that faith is born and sanctification is nurtured. The word of truth is instrumental in bringing about regeneration and growth in the life of a believer.
