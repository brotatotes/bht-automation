# Acts 13:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The rulers and people in Jerusalem, who were meant to be the custodians of God's truth, rejected Christ, as they were ignorant and did not recognize Him as the Messiah. This ignorance, although they constantly read the Scriptures, was due to their unwillingness to understand the true meaning of the prophecies. Their rejection of Him fulfills the words of the prophets and highlights their lack of understanding. Despite this, the apostle speaks of their guilt with wisdom and tenderness, seeking to mitigate their crime rather than incite further anger.

2. "The phrase 'τὰς φωνάς' is not governed by 'ἀγνοήσαντες', which makes the sentence an unusually harsh one in construction, requiring 'αὐτόν' to be supplied after 'κριν.' and 'αὐτάς' after 'ἐπλήρωσαν.'"
3. "The καί, as often, merely introduces, without the emphasis implied by our 'even,' a new element into the sentence."

2. "Seeing that Jerusalem knew not her good, it behoveth you to be the more awakened and inflamed, lest the same unthankfulness and forwardness be found in you."
3. "Seeing that the gospel standeth in the same state at this day, let us not be ashamed, with Paul, to confess that the proud princes of the world, and those who bear the greatest sway in the Church, are the deadly enemies of Christ, seeing that doth rather turn to Christ’s praise than reproach."
