## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Paul, in this compendious narrative, makes no distinction between friend and foe in what was done to our Lord, but regards both as fulfilling God’s purpose regarding him."
2. "There is also a contrast between what men did to Him, and ὁ δὲ θεὸς ἤγειρεν αὐτόν."
3. "Paul touches but lightly on the cross of Christ, and hastens on to the great point, the Resurrection, as the fulfillment of prophecy and seal of the Messiahship of Jesus."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### John Calvin:
1. "By this means is the stumbling-block (which the understanding of the flesh conceiveth by reason of the ignominy of the cross) taken away, that the Son of God was not laid open to the furious fury of the wicked; but he obeyed his fathers decree."
2. "Therefore, though Joseph and Nicodemus did bury Christ, (Matthew 27:57,) that is ascribed improperly, and yet not absurdly, to the Jews; because it is not Paul’s drift in this place to commend the good deed, but to prove Christ’s resurrection."
3. "Therefore he giveth us to understand that the body of Christ was not taken thence privily or by stealth, but that it was laid in a place both famous and known to the adversaries; and so, consequently, that even they were set to watch it; and yet for all this it was not found: whence we may gather the certainty of the resurrection."
