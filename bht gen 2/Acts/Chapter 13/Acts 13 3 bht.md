# Acts 13:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Their fasting was not to seek guidance, but rather to seek the empowerment and blessing of God as they embarked on their important mission. This act of fasting was not only a spiritual practice but also a way of expressing a desire for blessings and favor to be upon those who were being commissioned. Thus, after fasting, the church sent them off, not in an authoritative manner, but in a tender and supportive manner, bidding them farewell and entrusting them to the work they were divinely called to.
