# Acts 13:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus' death was the consequence of human action, and it left no doubt that he was truly dead and buried. Yet, the power of God transcended these earthly limitations, as Jesus could not be contained by the cords of death. It was through the remarkable act of raising him from the dead that God the Father demonstrated his mighty power. This resurrection not only displayed God's authority over death but also underscored the significance of Christ's sacrifice, paving the way for salvation.
