# Acts 13:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus was seen for many days by those who had accompanied him from Galilee to Jerusalem. This period of forty days was not only a continuation of his post-resurrection appearances, but also a significant time in which his disciples, who had journeyed with him throughout his ministry, were able to bear witness to his resurrection. These eyewitness testimonies, given by the apostles who had been in closest intimacy with Jesus, provided irrefutable proof of his Messiahship.
