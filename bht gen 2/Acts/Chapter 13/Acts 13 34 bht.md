## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But here the ὑποστρ. εἰς διαφθ. does not merely imply death, so that Jesus should have once undergone it, and no more hereafter, as the E. V. seems to imply: but we must supply ‘to die, and in consequence to’ before the words, understanding them as the result of death, if it had dominion over him: thus the clause answers even more remarkably to Romans 6:9." 
2. "τὰ ὅσια is the LXX rendering of חַסְדֵי, ref. Isa., which in 2 Chronicles 6:42, they have translated τὰ ἐλέη."
3. "The word ‘holy’ should have been preserved in the E. V., as answering to τὸν ὅσιόν σου below; the mercies of David, holy and sure: or my holy promises which I made sore unto David."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more, death hath no more dominion over him."
2. "The word rendered 'mercies' is peculiar, denoting the sanctity of them, as comprehending the whole riches of the new covenant; while the other word, 'sure,' points to the certainty with which they would, through David's Seed, be at length all substantiated." 
3. "They presuppose it; for since an eternal kingdom was promised to David, the Ruler of this kingdom could not remain under the power of death."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'corruption' is usually employed to denote 'putrefaction, or the mouldering away of a body in the grave; its returning to its native dust.' But it is certain that the body of Christ never in this sense saw corruption."
2. "The word 'mercies' here refers to the promise made to David; the mercy or favor shown to him by promising to him a successor that should not fail to sit on his throne... These mercies and promises are called 'sure,' as being true or unfailing; they would certainly be accomplished."
3. "And though he had been put to death, yet under that general promise there was a certainty that he would live again. It was impossible, the meaning is, that the Messiah, the promised successor of David, the perpetual occupier of his throne, should remain under the power of death."

3. "If the grace be eternal which God saith he will give in his Son, the life of his Son must be eternal, and not subject to corruption."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "The doctrine of the eternity of Christ’s existence is often urged by Paul (see especially Romans 6:9)."
3. "This ‘promise’ Paul tells them belongs ‘to them,’ that is, to them and all who accept the salvation he was offering them in his Master’s name; and the promise was, that a king Messiah should appear, whose reign should be perpetual."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "No longer about to return as Lazarus did. Jesus did not die again and so is the first fruits of the resurrection."

1. "Christ was raised up from the dead, never to die more, but to live forever, having in his hands the keys of hell and death, and being the triumphant conqueror over death and the grave."
