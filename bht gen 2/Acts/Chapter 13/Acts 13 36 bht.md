# Acts 13:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
David, fulfilling God's will in his time, passed away. In serving his own generation, he governed with righteousness, protected his people, and promoted worship. Falling asleep is a common metaphor for death. Though David's body rests, his spirit dwells with the Lord, singing praises in a way far surpassing his earthly days. The phrase added to his fathers alludes to the immortality of both body and soul, illustrating that death is not the end. As believers, we too are called to serve God's purpose in our own generation.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "His own generation (ιδια γενεα). Either locative case, 'in his own generation' or dative object of υπηρετησας (served)."
2. "The counsel of God (τη του θεου βουλη). So here, either the dative, the object of υπηρετησας if γενεα is locative, or the instrumental case 'by the counsel of God' which again may be construed either with υπηρετησας (having served) or after εκοιμηθη (fell on sleep). Either of the three ways is grammatical and makes good sense."
3. "Was laid (προσετεθη). Was added unto (first aorist passive indicative of προστιθημ). See the verb in Acts 2:47; Acts 5:14. This figure for death probably arose from the custom of burying families together (Genesis 15:15; Judges 2:10)."

3. "Thus, though David is fallen asleep in his body, he is present in spirit with the Lord; and that sweet psalmist of Israel is singing the songs of God in a much better manner than when here on earth."

### John Wesley:
1. "David, having served the will of God in his generation, fell asleep...the service of the Messiah to all generations, as his kingdom to all ages."
2. "Why art thou here thou who art yet in the world? Is it not that thou also mayest serve the will of God?"
3. "And was added to his fathers - Not only in body. This expression refers to the soul also, and supposes the immortality of it."
