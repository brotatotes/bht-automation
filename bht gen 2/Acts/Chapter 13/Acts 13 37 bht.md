# Acts 13:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, being raised from the dead, broke the chains of death, never again to be overcome by its power. His resurrection was not like any other, for he saw no decay, unlike the others who were subject to corruption. The fulfillment of the promise of an eternal kingdom to David necessitated that the ruler of this kingdom could not remain under the grave's control. Thus, the resurrection of Jesus not only fulfills the definite prediction of Isaiah but also provides a clear proof that he is indeed the long-awaited Messiah.
