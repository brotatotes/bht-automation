# Acts 13:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through this passage, we are reminded of the importance of forgiveness of sins for all humanity. It is through Christ, who was crucified and resurrected, that the message of forgiveness is proclaimed. This forgiveness is a central teaching of the Gospel, a result of God's grace and mercy. It cannot be obtained through the works of the law, repentance, or faith alone, but it is through the shedding of Christ's blood that we are forgiven. This act of forgiveness is made possible by Christ's deity and the power of His blood to cleanse us from sin.
