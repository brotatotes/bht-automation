# Acts 13:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through faith in Jesus Christ, believers are justified and absolved from all charges of the law, treating them as righteous in the sight of God. The Law, though it reveals God's standards, does not provide a way of pardon, which is the unique purpose of the gospel. By faith alone, believers obtain the righteousness of Christ, and through Him, they are pardoned and admitted to God's favor as if they had not offended. The righteousness brought by Christ surpasses the limitations of the law, offering complete forgiveness and justification for all their sins.
