# Acts 13:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Being led by the Holy Spirit, they set out on their journey, firmly guided by divine direction. The decision to go to Cyprus first was likely influenced by its proximity to the mainland and the fact that it was Barnabas' hometown. Cyprus, a fortified city known for its strategic location and connection to Rome, was a significant destination for the mission. The island, renowned for its agricultural abundance, was the birthplace of Barnabas, adding a personal element to their journey.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Under the guidance of the Spirit, who directed their course."
2. "A very strong fortified city, supposed impregnable."
3. "It was called seleucia ad mare, and Pieria, to distinguish it from other Syrian towns of the same name."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Four reasons may have induced them to turn in first to this island: (1) Its nearness to the mainland; (2) It was the native place of Barnabas, and since the time when Andrew found his brother Simon, and brought him to Jesus, and 'Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus,' family ties had not been without effect on the progress of the Gospel."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Being sent forth by the Holy Ghost - Having been called to this world by the Holy Spirit, and being under his direction."
2. "Seleucia united the two characters of a fortress and a seaport. Seleucus, who had named his metropolis in his father’s honor, gave his own name to this maritime fortress; and here, around his tomb, his successors contended for the key of Syria."
3. "Here, in the midst of unsympathizing sailors, the two missionary apostles, with their younger companion, stepped on board the vessel which was to convey them to Salamis. As they cleared the port, the whole sweep of the bay of Antioch opened on their left - the low ground by the mouth of the Orontes; the wild and woody country beyond it; and then the peak of Mount Casius, rising symmetrically from the very edge of the sea to a height of 5000 feet."

### Marvin Vincent:

3. "He saith, that they came first to Seleucia, which was a city of Syria."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "This city and harbour, to distinguish it, was called 'Seleucia on the sea.' It was from this port...that used to sail year by year, to Rome and Italy, that swarm of miserable and degraded beings Juvenal tells us of, when he writes of the corruption of Rome, and how much of it was due to Syria and its fatal influences."
3. "The beautiful island [Cyprus] was only a few hours’ sail from Seleucia... It was famous for its corn and oil and fruits." (1 - 45 words, 2 - 67 words, 3 - 29 words)
