# Acts 13:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The rejection and despising of God's word carries serious consequences. Throughout history, there have been repeated instances where God's warnings were not believed, resulting in calamities and destruction. Just as the people in Habakkuk's time faced the judgment of God for their unbelief, so too will those who refuse to believe the promises and works of God face the same fate. The fulfillment of God's word, even in the face of skepticism, is undeniable.
