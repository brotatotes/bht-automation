# Acts 13:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Paul and Barnabas finished preaching, there was a mixed congregation of Jews and proselytes. Some of the Jews requested that Paul and Barnabas continue proclaiming the truths they had shared, specifically to the Gentiles. After the synagogue dispersed, many Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas. These individuals had been impacted by the Gospel message and felt a connection to Paul and Barnabas. Their desire was to hear more from them during the time between Sabbaths. The phrase next Sabbath likely refers to the following week, as Luke's usage of the phrase in other instances indicates.

### Henry Alford:
1. "[The insertions in the rec. have been made] partly perhaps to remove the ambiguity in αὐτῶν, and to supply a subject to παρεκάλουν. But they confuse the sense."
2. "On the N.T. construction, παρεκάλουν λαληθῆναι, i.e. the passive inf. after verbs of commanding, exhorting, &c."
3. "τὸ μεταξὺ σάβ. appears, by the usage of Luke, to mean the next sabbath-day, not ‘the following week.’ This last rendering would hardly suit εἰς, which fixes a definite occasion, nor Acts 13:44, which gives the result."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The mixed congregation of Jews and proselytes...entreated to have another hearing of such truths; those of them, that is, who had been impressed."
2. "After the breaking up of the synagogue, many of both classes, Jews and religious proselytes, followed Paul and Barnabas."

2. "The meaning is fixed by ver. 44."
3. "Though the word does not occur in the New Testament elsewhere in the sense of next, it has that meaning sometimes in later Greek."

### John Calvin:
1. "For it is likely that they were gone out before the multitude was dispersed; and that is gathered out of the text because Luke saith shortly after, that when the synagogue was dissolved certain of the Jews did follow Paul and Barnabas."
2. "Therefore, to what end should they defer their desire and prayers until the eighth day? Yea, rather they covet to hear Paul whilst he is at leisure, and is not occupied in teaching the Jews."
3. "Luke expresseth the proselytes by name, who seeing they had embraced the doctrine of the law, and did worship the God of Israel, were not puffed up with that pride which hindered the Jews, who made boast of their long stock and race."
