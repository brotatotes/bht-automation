# Acts 13:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The unbelieving Jews, fueled by envy, were filled with wrath at the thought of the Gentiles receiving equal access to the word of God. In their opposition, they directed their malicious words against Paul and his preaching about Jesus as the Messiah. The Jews' blasphemy and reproach were indicative of the arrival of the Messiah, as it is often the case that precious and pure doctrines are vilified by professed believers who refuse to accept them.
