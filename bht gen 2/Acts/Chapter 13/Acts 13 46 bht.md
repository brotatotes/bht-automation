# Acts 13:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostles, undeterred by opposition, spoke boldly and freely, rebuking those who stood in the way of others receiving the message of salvation. They recognized the necessity of proclaiming the word of God first to the Jews, yet their preaching was not contingent on the response of their hearers. The rejection of the Gospel by the Jews led to a significant shift in focus, as the apostles turned their attention towards the Gentiles, an unexpected and remarkable turn of events.
