# Acts 13:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Scriptures justify Paul's course of ministry to the Gentiles, as he has been called by Christ Himself and appointed to carry out the work of spreading the unsearchable riches to all nations. This commission is in line with the prophecy in Isaiah that the Messiah would be a light to the Gentiles. The rejection of the Jews further solidifies Paul's conviction that his mission is meant for the Gentiles. In this way, Christ, our Savior, imparts His titles to His ministers, who speak on His behalf and continue His work of salvation and illumination.
