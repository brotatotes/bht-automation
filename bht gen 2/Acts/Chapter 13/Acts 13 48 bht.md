# Acts 13:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the Gentiles heard about the inclusion of all people in the grand scheme of salvation through Christ, they were filled with joy and gratitude. This message of grace and liberty from legalism was received by them as the gospel of God, which they recognized and honored. It is important to understand that faith is a result and effect of the divine decree of eternal life, not the cause or condition. Those who responded to the preaching of the Gospel at that time were ordained by God to believe in Him.
