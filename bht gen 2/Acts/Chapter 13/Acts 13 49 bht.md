# Acts 13:49 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The word of the Lord was not confined to one place, but spread throughout the entire region, carried in different directions by both the recent converts and the missionaries Paul and Barnabas. This spreading of the gospel was not in vain, as it resulted in the planting of churches, particularly in Antioch, which continued to grow and flourish. Even in later centuries, the truth of Christ was embraced in Pisidia, as evidenced by the presence of churches and the opposition to the worship of images expressed by Gregory, the bishop of Antioch.
