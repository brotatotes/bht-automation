# Acts 13:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Recognizing the significant Jewish presence in Salamis, the apostles prioritized preaching to the Jews before turning their attention to the Gentiles. John Mark, as a trusted companion, likely aided in baptisms and other necessary arrangements for the apostles. This duty, while primarily John Mark's, was a special rite rarely administered by the apostles themselves. The apostles faithfully adhered to the principle of preaching to the Jew first, acknowledging both the multitude of Jews in Salamis and the importance of John Mark's service in supporting their ministry.
