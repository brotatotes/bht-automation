# Acts 13:50 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The impact of women in the early days of Christianity cannot be overlooked. They held positions of influence and power, even among the Gentile communities. The opposition they faced, whether it was from chief men or from mobs incited against the apostles, did not deter the spread of the gospel. The apostles remained steadfast in their mission, valiantly resisting the threats and persecutions they encountered. Their example serves as a reminder to us to be vigilant in our faith and unwavering in our dedication to sharing the truth, even when faced with opposition.
