# Acts 13:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Paul began his ministry among the Gentiles, he embraced his Gentile name, Paul, instead of his Hebrew name, Saul. This change in name was a common practice among Hellenistic Jews with both Hebrew and Greek or Latin names. It is believed that as Paul transitioned to the apostle to the Gentiles, Luke, the writer of Acts, consistently referred to him as Paul. This change in name symbolized Paul's shift in focus from the Jews to the Gentiles. The name Paul had Roman origins and was likely adopted by the apostle to better connect with his Roman audience.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I do not regard it as indicative of any change of name at the time of this incident, or from that time: the evidence which I deduce from it is of a different kind, and not without interest to enquirers into the character and authorship of our history."
2. "The Œ∫Œ±ŒØ must not be understood as having any reference to Sergius Paulus, 'who also (as well as Sergius) was called Paul.'"
3. "It seems probable that Paul never entirely recovered his sight as before, after the Œ¥œåŒæŒ± œÑŒø·ø¶ œÜœâœÑ·Ω∏œÇ ·ºêŒ∫ŒµŒØŒΩŒøœÖ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Paul‚Äîand henceforward Paul only; a softening of his former name, in accommodation to Roman ears"
2. "filled with the Holy Ghost‚Äîthe Spirit coming mightily upon him."
3. "The whole soul of his great colleague, now drawn out, as never before, shoots, by the lightning gaze of his eye, through the dark and tortuous spirit of the sorcerer."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This is the last time that this apostle is called 'Saul.' Henceforward, he is designated by the title by which he is usually known, as 'Paul.'"
2. "The name is of Roman origin. In the Latin language, the name Paulus signifies little, dwarfish."
3. "Paul suffered himself to be called by this name, as he was employed chiefly among the Gentiles."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The most satisfactory seems to be that it was customary for Hellenistic Jews to have two names, the one Hebrew and the other Greek or Latin."
2. "As Paul now comes prominently forward as the apostle to the Gentiles, Luke now retains his Gentile name, as he did his Jewish name during his ministry among the Jews."
3. "It was most unlike Paul to assume the name of another man, converted by his instrumentality, out of respect to him or as a memorial of his conversion."

### John Calvin:
1. "For seeing that he was too much addicted to the magician, he could not embrace true doctrine as one that was free and at liberty."
2. "The devil keepeth those minds (which he hath entangled) in his slavery after a wonderful and incredible manner, that they cannot see even the most plain truth."
3. "Faith is so grounded in the word, that without this shore, it fainteth at every assault; yea, that it is nothing else but the spiritual building of the word of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This abrupt statement of the writer of the ‚ÄòActs‚Äô is the only explanation given of a change in the great apostle‚Äôs name."
2. "The question arises, Whence came this second name?"
3. "On the whole, the second explanation seems the more probable account of the two names of the Gentile apostle."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "By this remarkably brief phrase Luke presents this epoch in the life of Saul Paul."
2. "A special influx of power to meet this emergency."
3. "If one wonders why the Holy Spirit filled Paul for this emergency rather than Barnabas, when Barnabas was named first in Acts 13:2, he can recall the sovereignty of the Holy Spirit in his choice of agents and also the special call of Paul by Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "It is a rule with them that the Israelites out of the land, their names are as the names of the Gentiles."
2. "It is observable that Luke calls the apostle by his Jewish name Saul, whilst he was among the Jews, and only preached among them; but now he is got among the Gentiles, and was about to appear openly to be their apostle, he all along hereafter calls him by his Gentile name Paul."
3. "This name is by Jerom or Origen interpreted 'wonderful', as if it came from the Hebrew word 'pala'; and others derive it from 'paul', which signifies to work; and a laborious worker the apostle was, and a workman also which needed not to be ashamed."

### John Wesley:
1. "It is not improbable, that coming now among the Romans, they would naturally adapt his name to their own language, and so called him Paul instead of Saul."
2. "Perhaps the family of the proconsul might be the first who addressed or spoke of him by this name."
3. "And from this time, being the apostle of the Gentiles, he himself used the name which was more familiar to them."
