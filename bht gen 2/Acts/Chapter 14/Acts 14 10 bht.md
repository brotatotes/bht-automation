# Acts 14:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The man, a cripple from birth, heard Paul speaking and he leaped up with joy and began to walk. Paul's loud voice commanded attention and signaled the miracle that was about to happen. In the name of Jesus Christ, the man's glad consciousness of newfound power propelled him to stand upright on his feet and move about with ease, like other men whom he had longed to imitate. The sudden change in the lame man and his excitement were clear signs of the power of God at work.
