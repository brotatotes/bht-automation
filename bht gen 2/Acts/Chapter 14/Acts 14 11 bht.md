# Acts 14:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people's exclamation that the gods are come down reveals their belief in the frequent descent of gods in human form, as commonly held in the pagan Graeco-Roman mythology. The astonishment expressed in their native tongue reflects their amazement at the miraculous healing of the lame man, attributing it to a divine act beyond human capabilities. It is noteworthy how the unbelievers quickly deified mere men based on one miracle, while the Jews remained blind to Christ's divinity despite witnessing countless miracles. This highlights the delusion that can shroud the minds of those who do not believe.
