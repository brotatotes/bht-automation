# Acts 14:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The local people mistook Barnabas for Jupiter due to his impressive appearance, being the oldest and largest in stature. In contrast, they saw Paul as the embodiment of Mercury, the god of eloquence and oratory, as he was known for his preaching and speaking abilities. This was similar to the Jewish tradition of having a chief speaker in their schools.

He was the messenger of the gods, and of Jupiter in particular; he was the patron of travelers and shepherds; he conducted the souls of the dead into the infernal regions; he presided over orators, and declaimers, and merchants; and he was also the god of thieves, pickpockets, and all dishonest persons."
3. "The conjecture of Chrysostom is, that Barnabas was a large, athletic man, and was hence taken for Jupiter; and that Paul was small in his person, and was hence supposed to be Mercury."

3. "His face and figure appear to have been markedly of the Hebrew type."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
