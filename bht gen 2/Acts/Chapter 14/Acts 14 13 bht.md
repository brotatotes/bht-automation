## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. " τοὺς πυλῶνας are not the gates of the city, but the doors of the outer court of the house."


### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city—that is, whose temple stood before their city"
2. "brought oxen and garlands—to crown the victims and decorate, as on festive occasions, the porches."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word “which” here refers not to the priest, but to Jupiter. The temple or image of Jupiter was in front of their city, or near the gates."
2. "Ancient cities were supposed to be under the protection of particular gods; and their image, or a temple for their worship, was placed commonly in a conspicuous place at the entrance of the city."
3. "And here we have a remarkable and most affecting instance of the folly and stupidity of idolatry."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The God himself was regarded as present in his temple."
2. "What gates are intended is uncertain."
3. "Some say, the city gates; others, the temple gates; and others, the doors of the house in which Paul and Barnabas were residing."

### John Calvin:
1. "For this opinion would by and by have followed, that Jupiter was more delighted in the temple of Lystra than in any other."
2. "And so soon as such superstition hath once filled the minds of men, they spare no cost to offer sacrifice."
3. "And it is not to be doubted, but that the whole multitude was moved with ambition, to be so desirous to offer sacrifice to Paul under the name of Jupiter, that their city might be the more famous and noble."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The explanation of the words, ‘of Jupiter which was before their city,’ may be found in the Pagan conception that the gods themselves were present in their temples."
2. "Such floral crowns were also worn by those sacrificing. They were composed of the various plants and flowers sacred to the gods to whom the sacrifice was offered."
3. "The gates of the city are here evidently alluded to. Some commentators prefer to understand the expression as referring to the gates of the house where the apostles were lodging. This seems unlikely, as Paul and Barnabas evidently were quite ignorant of the preparations which were made to do them honour, until the report reached their ears, when they at once hurried out to stop the proceedings."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

### John Gill:
1. "Not that the priest was before the city, but Jupiter; and the phrase denotes either his presidency over the city... or the place where his image stood, which was out of the city."
2. "These were used in sacrifices, for different purposes; sometimes they crowned the gods, to whom they sacrificed, and these might be brought to be put upon the heads of Paul and Barnabas; and sometimes the priests wore them, and which seems to be in imitation of the mitre, wore by the high priest among the Jews."
3. "And would have done sacrifice with the people; that is, the priest and the people with him, would have offered sacrifice to Paul and Barnabas, as to two deities."

### John Wesley:
1. The priest of Jupiter — Whose temple and image were just without the gate of the city, brought garlands - To put on the victims, and bulls - The usual offerings to Jupiter.
