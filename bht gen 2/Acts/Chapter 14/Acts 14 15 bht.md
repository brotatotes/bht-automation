# Acts 14:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul and Barnabas passionately urged the people of Lystra to turn from their idolatrous practices and worship of false gods, emphasizing that they were just like them - mere mortals with the same human nature and frailties. They vehemently rejected the notion of receiving worship as gods and instead preached about the living God, who is the true object of adoration. The apostles implored the people to abandon these empty and futile idols, recognizing them as meaningless and incapable of providing any true benefit or salvation.

1. "Though the reason which they allege seemeth to be cold. For it were an easy matter to gather thence, that it is not unlawful to worship those who are delivered from human miseries by death."
