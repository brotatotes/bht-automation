# Acts 14:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God has allowed all nations to walk in their own ways, without extending to them the revelation vouchsafed to the seed of Abraham. This highlights the insufficiency of human reason and the need for divine guidance. The history of the Gentiles reflects the depravity of humanity and the consequences of following our own imaginations. The errors and idolatries chosen by these nations do not validate their falsehoods. As believers, we must remain vigilant against these false beliefs and cling to the truth of God's word when it is revealed to us.
