# Acts 14:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Rain from heaven, a precious gift from God, served as a witness to his existence and providence, which was not limited to those who had access to the Old Testament revelation. It was a testimony of God's goodness, surpassing the abilities of any false gods worshipped by the Gentiles. This divine provision of rain filled their hearts with both physical nourishment and joy, reinforcing the idea that God's benevolence extended to all of creation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The words οὐρανόθεν ὑετοὺς διδούς had a remarkable applicability in a country where we have seen from Strabo (on Act 14:6) that there was great scarcity of water." 
2. "He relates that in one city of Lycaonia, where water was reached by digging the wells very deep, it was sold for money."
3. "The idea of Mr. Humphry, that the conclusion of this speech is a citation from some lyric poet, seems improbable on other accounts, and is rendered more so by the above-noticed propriety."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Nevertheless he left not himself without witness—Though the heinousness of idolatry is represented as so much less in the heathen, by how much they were outside the pale of revealed religion, he takes care to add that the heathen have divine 'witness' enough to leave them 'without excuse.'"
2. "He did good—scattering His beneficence everywhere and in a thousand forms."
3. "Rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons—on which human subsistence and all human enjoyment depend. In Lycaonia, where, as ancient writers attest, rain is peculiarly scarce, this allusion would have all the greater effect."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Rain is one of the evidences of the goodness of God. Man could not cause it; and without it, regulated at proper intervals of time and in proper quantities, the earth would soon be one wide scene of desolation."
2. "It is remarkable, and a striking proof of the divine goodness, that so few seasons are unfruitful. The earth yields her increase; the labors of the farmer are crowned with success; and the goodness of God demands the expressions of praise."
3. "Filling our hearts with food, gladness - Joy; comfort the comfort arising from the supply of our constantly returning needs. This is proof of everwatchful goodness."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "All signs and portents whatever, that appear in the air, belong primarily to him, as does the genial sign of the rainbow."
2. "The mention of rain is appropriate, as there was a scarcity of water in Lycaonia."
3. "The rhythmic conclusion is not unaccordant with the style of his most elevated moods; and besides the appropriate appeal to God's natural gifts in a town not in itself unhappily situated, but surrounded by a waterless and treeless plain, we may naturally suppose that the 'filling our hearts with food and gladness' was suggested by the garlands and festive pomp which accompanied the bulls on which the people would afterward have made their common banquet."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul and Barnabas cut off this frivolous objection, when they show that God lay hid in such sort, that he [still] bare witness of himself and his divinity."
2. "And it is to be thought that they did, in such sort, set forth the magnificence and greatness of the works of God as became them; but it was sufficient for Luke to touch the (sums and) chief points of matters."
3. "Therefore, God hath not set man upon earth that he may be an idle beholder of his work, as being set upon a theater, but to exercise himself in praising the liberality of God, whilst that he enjoyeth the riches of heaven and earth."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This mention of 'rain from heaven' was an especial instance of Divine benevolence to the people of Lystra."
2. "In the Lycaonian country water was so extremely scarce."
3. "In many Eastern countries this 'rain from heaven' was a most precious boon."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This witness to God (his doing good, giving rains and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness) they could receive without the help of the Old Testament revelation."
2. "Paul does not talk about laws of nature as if they governed themselves, but he sees the living God 'behind the drama of the physical world.'"
3. "Cheerfulness should be our normal attitude when we consider God's goodness."

### John Gill:
1. "Nevertheless, he left not himself without witness.... they were not destitute of the law of nature; and had, besides, many instances of providential goodness, by which they might have known God."
2. "and gave us rain from heaven, which none of the gods of the Gentiles could do."
3. "filling our hearts with food and gladness; giving a sufficiency of food, and even an abundance of it, and that for pleasure and delight, as well as for support and refreshment."

### John Wesley:
1. "He left not himself without witness — For the heathens had always from God himself a testimony both of his existence and of his providence..."
2. "...in that he did good - Even by punishments he testifies of himself; but more peculiarly by benefits..."
3. "...giving rain - By which air, earth, and sea, are, as it were, all joined together; from heaven - The seat of God; to which St. Paul probably pointed while he spoke, filling the body with food, the soul with gladness."
