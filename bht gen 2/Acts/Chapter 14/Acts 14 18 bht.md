# Acts 14:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people were so fully convinced that the gods had appeared and were filled with zeal to honor them, to the point that it was difficult to restrain their idolatrous tendencies. Even though Peter had vehemently rejected such honor, the world's inclination to idolatry is strong. Despite the efforts to dissuade them, the people's intense devotion was not easily quelled. In the end, each person returned to his own house, with their misguided affections still lingering.
