# Acts 14:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These Jews were relentless adversaries of the apostle Paul, continuously opposing him and stirring up the people against him at every turn. They maliciously persuaded the crowd to reject his message, labeling him as a deceiver and deserving of severe punishment. In their fury, they not only stoned him, but also subjected his lifeless body to further humiliation by dragging it through the streets and discarding it outside the city walls. It is remarkable how easily they were able to sway the crowd from adoration to murder.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Bad people will often travel further to do evil than good people will to do good; and wicked people often show more zeal in opposing the gospel than professed Christians do in advancing it."
2. "Just before they were ready to adore him; now they sought to put him to death. Nothing is more fickle than popular favor. The unbounded admiration of a man may soon be changed into unbounded indignation and contempt."
3. "Such sufferings and trials it cost to establish that religion in the world which has shed so many blessings on man; which now crowns us with comfort; which saves us from the abominations and degradations of idolatry here, and from the pains of hell hereafter."

### John Calvin:
1. "The servants of God seek no other thing but to bring men under obedience of him, which is salvation and felicity alone."
2. "Therefore, in this history is most lively painted out unto us the forwardness of the world. Paul might have reigned under the title of Mercury, with the commendation of all men; he will not be a god."
3. "So that, what violence soever the wicked do to the servants of Christ, it is never called in question; the laws are whist, [silent;] judgments cease; the magistrate is asleep; there is no patron to be found."

### John Gill:
1. "These Jews were inveterate enemies of the apostles, and seemed to have followed them from place to place, on purpose to oppose them, and to stir up the people against them, and to hinder the success of their ministry all they could." 
2. "They persuaded the people not to hearken to them, told them that they were deceivers and jugglers, and instead of having honours conferred upon them, they ought to be severely punished; and to these Jews they hearkened, as appears by what follows."
3. "They not only stoned him until he was dead, as they supposed, but they dragged his body through the streets of their city, in contempt of him, and indignation against him, and cast him out of it, where they left him as unworthy of a burial."
