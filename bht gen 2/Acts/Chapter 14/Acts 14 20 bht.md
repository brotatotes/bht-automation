## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The prima facie, and I think the right impression is, that this recovery was supernatural."
2. "From Derbe not being enumerated, 2 Timothy 3:11, with Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra, as the scene of any of Paul’s sufferings, we may perhaps infer that none befell him there."
3. "They may have fled to Derbe, as being in a different jurisdiction from Lystra; the latter being comprised in the Roman province of Galatia, whereas Derbe seems to have belonged at this time to Antiochus, king of Commagene."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Disciples" had been gathered, who now rallied around the bleeding body.
2. It is possible that this recovery was natural; the insensibility occasioned by such treatment as he had received sometimes passing away of itself, and leaving the patient less hurt than appeared.
3. Noble intrepidity!

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They have maintained that he could not have risen so soon, and entered into the city, without the interposition of miraculous power."
2. "The probability is that he was stunned by a blow - perhaps a single blow and after a short time recovered from it."
3. "Having been seen by the disciples after his supposed death, their faith was confirmed, and he departed to preach in another place."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "Surely we must always mark what the Lord hath brought to our hand."
2. "Paul's invincible heart he bore against all evils and afflictions."
3. "The use of the Word consisteth not in instruction only, but also in confirmation of faith, in admonishing, exhorting, and reproving."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Different to the awful night in Gethsemane when all forsook the arrested Master and fled, the disciples of Paul, undismayed by their master’s arrest and execution, gathered round the poor scarred body of him they judged dead..."
2. "...the martyr rose up and walked among living men once more."
3. "Several commentators suggest with great probability, that among that group of mourning disciples gathered that day at Lystra round the apostle’s apparently lifeless body, was the young Timothy, who, no doubt, heard the story of the Cross from Paul’s lips during that first visit of the apostle; nor is it an unlikely surmise which dates the enthusiastic and lifelong devotion of the young disciple from that morning when Paul suffered as Christ’s faithful martyr."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The would-be murderers left and a group of disciples gathered round to see if Paul was dead or alive and, if dead, to bury him."
2. "Timothy, a lad of about fifteen, would not soon forget that solemn scene."
3. "Paul suddenly (apparently a miraculous recovery) rose up and entered the city to the surprise and joy of the disciples."

### John Gill:
1. "which shows their affection to their spiritual Father, and their constancy in the faith of Christ, notwithstanding this ill treatment of his servant" 
2. "and when it is considered what wounds and bruises he must receive by stoning, and his being dragged through the streets of the city, and left in such a miserable condition without it, that he should at once rise up in the midst of the disciples, and walk into the city as one in perfect health and strength, has something extraordinary and miraculous in it"
3. "and it shows great resolution, courage, and strength of mind, to go into the same city again, where he had been so ill used; though he did not choose to continue there, nor were the inhabitants worthy of such a favour"

### John Wesley:
1. "That he should be able to do this, just after he had been left for dead, was a miracle little less than a resurrection from the dead."
2. "The witnesses first threw as large a stone as they could lift, with all possible violence upon his head, which alone was sufficient to dash the skull in pieces."
3. "All the people then joined, as long as any motion or token of life remained."
