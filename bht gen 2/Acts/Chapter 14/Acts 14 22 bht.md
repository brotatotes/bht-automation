# Acts 14:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The ministry of the word does not target wicked individuals or those who rely on their own righteousness for justification, as it goes against its purpose. Rather, it aims to reach the souls and hearts of people, recognizing their tendency to be unstable. This ministry helps individuals enter into a Gospel church state, which may involve various challenges from within and without, or even into the heavenly glory, which is only reached through many tribulations.
