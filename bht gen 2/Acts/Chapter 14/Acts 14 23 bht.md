# Acts 14:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the apostles appointed elders, they were choosing individuals who had been gifted by the Holy Spirit to preach the Gospel and care for the churches. These elders were entrusted to the Lord, with the apostles praying for God's blessing and protection upon them. The Lord Jesus Christ, in whom they had faith and love, was fully able to answer this commendation and empower even new believers to edify and strengthen others in the faith.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The word will not bear Jerome’s and Chrys.’s sense of ‘laying on of hands,’ adopted by Roman Catholic expositors."
2. "Nor is there any reason here for departing from the usual meaning of electing by show of hands."
3. "The Apostles may have admitted by ordination those presbyters whom the churches elected."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Still, as there is no evidence in the New Testament that the word had then lost its proper meaning, as this is beyond doubt its meaning in Acts 14:23, and as there is indisputable evidence that the concurrence of the people was required in all elections to sacred office in the earliest ages of the Church, it is perhaps better to understand the words to mean, 'when they had made a choice of elders.'"
2. "For if 'ordination' was by prayer and fasting (see Acts 13:3), why should it be said they first 'ordained elders,' and after that 'prayed with fasting?' Whereas if the first clause refer to the choice and the second to the ordination, all is natural."
3. "They commended 'committed' them—that is, all these churches—to the Lord—Jesus."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'ordain' we now use in an ecclesiastical sense, to denote 'a setting apart to an office by the imposition of hands.' But it is evident that the word here is not employed in that sense."
2. "The word properly denotes 'to stretch out the hand'; and as it was customary to elect to office, or to vote, by stretching out or elevating the hand, so the word simply means 'to elect, appoint, or designate to any office.'"
3. "They were feeble, inexperienced, and exposed to dangers; but in his hands they were safe."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Ordained [χειροτονησαντες] . Only here and 2 Corinthians 8:19. Rev., more correctly, appointed."
2. "Elders [πρεσβυτεπους] . For the general superintendence of the church. The word is synonymous with ejpiskopoi, overseers or bishops (see on visitation, 1 Peter 2:12)."
3. "Commended [παρεθεντο] . See on set before, Luke 9:16; and commit, 1 Peter 4:19."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ did not only send his apostles to preach the gospel, but he commanded also that there should be pastors appointed, that the preaching of the gospel might be perpetual and in daily use."
2. "The Church cannot want an ordinary ministry, neither can any be counted Christians before God but those who, during their whole life, are willing to learn."
3. "These be the true signs and tokens of the godly to call upon the Spirit of God, that he may govern their counsels."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And when they had appointed for them elders, etc."
2. "The latter is the more probable, as in these new-formed communities, presbyters or elders chosen by Paul and Barnabas acting under the light of the Divine Spirit, would be more likely to command respect when the apostles were far away, than any elders chosen by popular voice."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Χειροτονεω (from χειροτονος, extending the hand, χειρ, hand, and τεινω, to stretch) is an old verb that originally meant to vote by show of the hands, finally to appoint with the approval of an assembly that chooses."
2. "Paul, like Jesus, constantly worshipped and spoke in the synagogues."
3. "It was a serious matter, this formal setting apart of these 'elders' in the churches. So it was done in a public meeting with prayer and fasting."

### John Gill:
1. "As the gifts, as well as the grace of the Holy Ghost, attended the ministry of the word, so among those that were converted, there were some that were honoured with ministerial gifts, qualifying them to preach the Gospel, and take upon them the care of the churches."
2. "They commended them to the Lord; both the elders and the churches, to be blessed by him with fresh supplies of grace, to be kept by his power, and to be preserved by him safe to his kingdom and glory."
3. "The Lord Jesus Christ seems to be intended by 'the Lord', to whom the apostles commended them; and who is every way qualified, and fully able to answer such a commendation."

### John Wesley:
1. "So soon can God enable even a babe in Christ to build up others in the common faith."
2. "They commended them to the Lord - An expression implying faith in Christ, as well as love to the brethren."
