# Acts 14:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the missionaries preached in Perga, it seems their efforts yielded little visible fruit. Attalia, a strategic seaport built by King Attalus Philadelphus, commanded trade from Syria and Egypt. The citizens of Attalia seemed apathetic and indifferent to the message. Attalia, known for its tapestry, derived its name from its founder, Attalus. Overall, Perga and Attalia were significant cities in Pamphylia, but the missionaries faced challenges in terms of receptivity and opposition.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The history of the 'Acts' says nothing of success, recounts no opposition. We conclude, therefore, that few converts were the result of the missionaries' labours."

1. "The Alexandrian copy, and others, and three manuscripts of Beza's, read, 'the word of the Lord'; as do the Vulgate Latin and Syriac versions."
2. "Attalia is a city of Pamphylia, on the sea coast; it was formerly the metropolis of it: it is now in the hands of the Turks, and is called Sattalia; near it is a bay, called Golfo di Sattalia, where there is a considerable mart for the whole country."
3. "It is famous for tapestry, which is made in it: it had its name from Attalus, king of Pergamus, the first founder of it."
