# Acts 14:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul and Barnabas spent a substantial period of time in Antioch, where they stayed with the disciples and fellow believers. This was a joyful time of fellowship, marked by a significant turning point in the history of Christianity. During their stay, they faced disputes with certain Christians who held to the importance of observing the law. While the exact duration of their stay is unclear, it is apparent that Paul and Barnabas were not idle, and they did not immediately report to Jerusalem. The details of these events and their outcomes are provided in the next chapter.
