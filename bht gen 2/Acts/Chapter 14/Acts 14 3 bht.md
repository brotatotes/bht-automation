# Acts 14:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul and Barnabas seized the opportunity and fearlessly preached the Gospel, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord and relying on His strength and support. The Gospel itself is a revelation of God's grace and favor towards humanity. The miraculous works performed were not due to the apostles' own power, but a manifestation of God's authority and power working through them as instruments. Though this season of peace and success could not last indefinitely, the impact of their preaching and the testimony of God's grace continued to resonate.
