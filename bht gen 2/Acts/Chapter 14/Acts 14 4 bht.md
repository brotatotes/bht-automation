# Acts 14:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of preaching the gospel, there was a division among the Gentile populace. Some people accepted the teachings and miracles of the apostles, while others condemned them as false. These divisions were not due to any fault in the gospel itself, but rather a result of the fallen nature of humanity. Our Lord Himself foretold that such divisions would occur, as the truth of the gospel often stirs up opposition and discord. We should not be surprised when factions and opposition arise, for the fault lies not in Christianity but in the hearts of those who resist it.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Such a split into two factions was a common occurrence, on far less important occasions, in these cities of Oriental Greeks."
2. "This is the first place where Paul and Barnabas are so called. St. Paul constantly vindicates the title in his Epistles."
3. "So that there were, widening the word beyond the Twelve, fifteen Apostles, usually so called."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A revival of religion often produces excitement by the bad passions of opposers."
2. "The enemies of the truth form parties, and organize opposition."
3. "It is no uncommon thing even now for such parties to be formed; but the fault is not in Christianity."

### John Calvin:
1. "If it be demanded what was the original of the discord, assuredly it flowed from the gospel, to which, notwithstanding, there is nothing more contrary than to cause discord."
2. "The same rule must we observe at this day, lest the gospel be burdened with false envy, if it bring not men together unto God, but the wicked rage against it."
3. "But as the unity is accursed which doth separate us all from God, so it were better that a few should depart an hundred times from all the whole world, and, in the mean season, come in favor again with God, than that disagreeing with him continually, they should have peace with the world."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This division was within the Gentile populace."
2. "The Jewish leaders made some impression on the Gentiles as at Antioch in Pisidia and later at Thessalonica."
3. "Paul claimed to be an apostle on a par with the twelve."

### John Gill:
1. "The multitude of the city was divided...some approving them, others condemning their doctrines as false, and their miracles as delusions."
2. "Divisions in families, towns, and cities...are not owing to any fault in that, but to the depravity and corruption of human nature."
3. "These divisions...are what our Lord declared was, and foretold would be the case."
