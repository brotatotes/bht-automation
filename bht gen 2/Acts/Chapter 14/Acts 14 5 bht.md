# Acts 14:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this situation, there was a strong inclination and intention to put the believers to death through stoning. It was clear that an assault had been planned, as they were aware of it. The Jews and Gentiles were driven by a biased mindset, with their leaders encouraging them. The believers, however, demonstrated their fearlessness by steadfastly preaching the gospel despite the danger. Stoning was a punishment reserved for blasphemy among the Jews. This violent reaction was a desperate resort after legal proceedings had failed. The believers wisely avoided the fury by remembering Christ's teaching on patience.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ὁρμή is not a rush (‘impetus,’ Vulg.: ‘assault,’ E. V.), but as Hesych βουλή, ἐπιθυμία."
2. "συνιδόντες, rightly rendered in E. V. they were ware of it; which it would be strange if they were not, if an assault had been made on them."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "an impetuous movement" with a view to stoning them
2. "Once I was stoned"
3. "fled"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "An assault made - Greek: a 'rush' - ὁρμή hormē. It denotes 'an impetuous excitement and aggression; a rush to put them to death.'"
2. "To use them despitefully - See the notes on Matthew 5:44. To reproach them; to bring contempt upon them; to injure them."
3. "And to stone them - To put them to death by stoning; probably as blasphemers, Acts 7:57-59."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Assault [ορμη] . Too strong, as is also the Rev., onset. In case an actual assault had been made, it would have been absurd for Luke to tell us that 'they were ware of it.' It is rather the purpose and intention of assault beginning to assume the character of a movement."
2. "To stone. Paul says he was stoned once (2 Corinthians 11:25). This took place at Lystra (see ver. 19)."

### John Calvin:
1. "Mark how far forth the holy champions of Christ did suffer... they go no further, but remembering the saying of Christ, wherein he warneth the faithful in patience to possess their souls, they avoid the fury of the enemy."
2. "Their constancy in preaching the gospel doth sufficiently declare that they feared not danger."
3. "This is the right kind of fear, when the servants of Christ do not run willfully into the hands of their enemies, of them to be murdered, and yet they do not foreslow [abandon] their duty; neither doth fear hinder them from obeying God when he calleth; and so, consequently, they can afford, if need be, to go even through death itself to do their duty."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Greek word hardly signifies an ‘assault,’ rather a ‘sudden movement,’ a ‘hostile movement’ or ‘impulse’ on the part of the Jews and Gentiles."
2. "In his Second Epistle to the Corinthian Church (chap. Acts 11:25), Paul writes: ‘Once was I stoned.’"
3. "Truth is necessarily consistent, but it is scarcely possible that independent accounts not having truth to guide them should thus advance to the very brink of contradiction without falling into it."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It probably denotes not an actual attack so much as the open start, the co-operation of both Jews and Gentiles."
2. "The plan to stone them shows that the Jews were in the lead and followed by the Gentile rabble."
3. "Legal proceedings having failed the only resource left for the Jews was illegal violence."

### John Gill:
1. "Or a strong bias and inclination were in the minds, both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews, with their rulers; who encouraged them in it."
2. "To use them despitefully, and to stone them; not only to give them reproachful language, but to smite, buffet, and scourge them, and to stone them for blasphemy."
3. "Which was a punishment among the Jews for such causes."
