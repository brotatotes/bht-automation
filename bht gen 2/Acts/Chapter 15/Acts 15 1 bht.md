# Acts 15:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The strong Judaizing party in the early church clung to their old beliefs regarding the necessity of adhering to the law of Moses, causing conflict and controversy. This debate was significant as it settled important principles and demonstrated how apostolic times resolved such disputes. The opposition between sects caused contention and strife, threatening the unity of the Christian community. It is vital to remain cautious and ensure that individuals involved do not hinder or deceive others during examination. These Judaizers went beyond the unbelieving Jews, making circumcision essential for salvation, a belief not even held by Jewish individuals.
