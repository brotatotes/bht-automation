# Acts 15:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage reminds us not to tempt or provoke God by imposing unnecessary burdens on ourselves or others. It is a call to recognize and appreciate God's grace and freedom, rather than trying to add additional obligations or requirements to His gift of salvation. It is a reminder that we should not place upon others what even the most devout among us were unable to bear.
