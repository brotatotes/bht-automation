# Acts 15:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We believe that salvation is through the grace of the Lord Jesus alone, not through any additional conditions or requirements. This applies to all, both Jews and Gentiles, as the ground of our trust in His grace is the same. The Lord Jesus, who is the Savior appointed by Jehovah, has obtained salvation for sinners through His sacrifice. Our salvation is completely dependent on His grace, not on our works or adherence to the ceremonial law.
