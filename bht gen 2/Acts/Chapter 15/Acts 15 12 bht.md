# Acts 15:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Upon hearing the speech of Peter, the assembly fell into a hushed silence, as his words carried great weight and authority. The signs and wonders performed by God among the Gentiles served as a seal of approval upon the ministry of Paul and Barnabas. These miracles included not only extraordinary events in nature, but also the miraculous transformation of countless lives through the power of the Gospel. Such evidence further solidified the truth and legitimacy of their mission.
