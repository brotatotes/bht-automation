# Acts 15:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When James rose up to speak, he began his oration by addressing the people as men and brethren, a common practice among the Jews. While it is uncertain whether he was now the bishop or pastor of the church at Jerusalem, it is clear that his authority was recognized as he was asked to preside over the council. Although the speeches made in the council were not directly addressed to him, his response carried weight and his words were considered.
