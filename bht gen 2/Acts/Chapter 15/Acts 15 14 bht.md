# Acts 15:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
James, in using the Hebrew variation of Simon to refer to Peter, emphasizes his connection to the Hebrew customs and beliefs of the Jewish Christians. This naming convention is important because it differentiates Peter from the Hellenistic influences that were present. The mention of God's visit to the Gentiles highlights the special favor that was shown to them, as it had been centuries since they had received such attention. This visitation involved God sending the Gospel and His Spirit to bring about a spiritual transformation among the Gentiles, choosing them to be a people who believed in and were called by His name.
