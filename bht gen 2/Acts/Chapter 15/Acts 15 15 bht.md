# Acts 15:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The prophecy in question, referred to by both Peter and James, supports their claim about the inclusion of Gentiles. By using the words of the prophet, James strengthens the argument made by Peter. And while he cites only one prophecy, it is enough to substantiate their point, as it is in accordance with the Jewish practice of citing Scriptures. Hence, the agreement between the apostles and the prophecies serves as a strong foundation for their message.
