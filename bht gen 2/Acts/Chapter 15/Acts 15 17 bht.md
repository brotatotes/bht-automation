# Acts 15:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The phrase 'the Gentiles on whom my name is called' refers to those who are called by God's name, His chosen people. It signifies that God's favor is not limited to the Jews, but extends to all who believe in Him. The name of God carries great significance, symbolizing a relationship, an affiliation with Him. To be called by His name is to be recognized as belonging to Him, as part of His family.
