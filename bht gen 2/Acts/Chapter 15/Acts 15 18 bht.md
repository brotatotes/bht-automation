# Acts 15:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's works are known to Him from the very beginning. What He has planned and accomplished is not a surprise to Him. The conversion of the Gentiles, as foreknown by God, is not a new or strange thing. It is a demonstration of His eternal purpose, extending His grace to all who call upon His name. This understanding of God's foreknowledge leads us to recognize that God knows future contingencies, even though there may be difficulties in comprehending this truth.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The sense, and account of the text seem to be this: the Apostle paraphrases the ὁ ποιῶν ( πάντα ) ταῦτα of the LXX, adding γνωστὰ ἀπ ʼ αἰῶνος , and intending to express ‘saith the Lord, who from the beginning revealed these things,’ viz. by the prophet (of old, see reff.) just cited."
2. "The addition in the rec. has been made to fill up the apparently elliptical γνωστὰ ἀπ ʼ αἰῶνος, which not being found in the passage of Amos, was regarded as a sentence by itself."
3. "These last words, κύρ . ὁ ποι . ταῦ . γν . ἀπ ʼ αἰ ., may perhaps be an allusion to the mystery of the admission of the Gentiles into the church, which was now being revealed practically, and had been from of old announced by the prophets: cf. Romans 16:25-26; Ephesians 3:5-6, &c."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Known unto God are all his works from the beginning." 
2. "He who announced these things so long before, and He who had now brought them to pass, were one and the same."
3. "So that they were no novelty."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "God sees everything future; he knows what he will accomplish; he has a plan; all his works are so arranged in his mind that he sees everything distinctly and clearly."
2. "As he foretold these, it was a part of his plan; and as it was a part of his plan long since foretold, it should not be opposed and resisted by us."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Known unto God, etc."
2. "The best texts join these words with the preceding verse, from which they omit all."

### John Calvin:
1. "James preventeth, showing that this was no new thing with God, though it fell out suddenly otherwise than men thought; because God saw, before the world was created, what he would do."
2. "Men do not take upon them to measure, with the small measure of their wit, the works of God, the reason whereof is oftentimes known to none but to himself."
3. "Let them cry, being astonished, that his ways are past finding out, and that his judgments are too deep a depth."

2. "All the things which God does...were all foreknown and predetermined by him: from the beginning of the world"

### John Wesley:
