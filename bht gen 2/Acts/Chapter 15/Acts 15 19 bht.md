# Acts 15:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
James gives his wise opinion that the Gentiles who have turned to God should not be burdened with the requirement of circumcision, as this would cause great trouble and distress for them. He emphasizes the importance of not imposing unnecessary rites and ceremonies on these new converts, allowing them to fully embrace God without the bondage of additional obligations. These Gentiles have turned away from idol worship and have chosen to follow the one true and living God, identifying with the message from Amos and Isaiah that God's purpose includes the inclusion of the Gentiles in His plan.
