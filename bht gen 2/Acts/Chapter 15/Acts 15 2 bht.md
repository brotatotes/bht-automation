# Acts 15:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When faced with differing opinions and potential divisions within the church, it is important for leaders to oppose false teachings and seek guidance from fellow believers. This enables them to establish and defend the truth of God's Word. The Antioch church understood the significance of addressing the issue and sought the counsel of the apostles and elders in Jerusalem. By involving multiple apostles, they ensured a fair and unified decision-making process that would be respected by both sides. This approach protected the integrity of the gospel and prevented potential schisms within the church community.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I assume here what seems to me to be almost beyond the possibility of question ... that this journey was the same as that mentioned Galatians 2:1-10."
2. "In this expression I cannot see it necessarily implied that the revelation was made to himself, but that there was some intimation of the Holy Ghost."
3. "Titus was one, and that, in all probability, in order to give an example of a Gentile convert of the uncircumcision endowed with gifts of the Holy Spirit."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Paul and Barnabas—now the recognized heads of the Church at Antioch had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined—that is, the church did." 
2. "Titus was one ( :-); probably as an uncircumcised Gentile convert endowed with the gifts of the Spirit. He is not mentioned in the Acts, but only in Second Corinthians, Galatians, Second Timothy, and the Epistle addressed to him [ALFORD]."
3. "That such a deputation should be formally despatched by the Church of Antioch was natural, as it might be called the mother church of Gentile Christianity."

### John Calvin:
1. "When the truth of God is assailed, let them refuse no combat for defense thereof; nor let them fear to oppose themselves valiantly, though heaven and earth go together."
2. "The name of peace is indeed plausible and sweet, but cursed is that peace which is purchased with so great loss, that we suffer the doctrine of Christ to perish."
3. "Let them cry till their throats be sore; Paul’s example is sufficient for us, that we must not be either cold or slack in defending the doctrine of godliness when the ministers of Satan seek to overthrow it with might and main; for their brainsick distemperature ought not to pass the constancy of the servants of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It has been suggested that not improbably these Judaizing teachers succeeded in persuading certain of the Antioch Christians to adopt at least some of their views." 
2. "On several occasions of Paul’s life a Divine revelation was vouchsafed to him, on the Damascus journey (Acts 9:0); again, when he was about to carry the gospel from Asia into Europe (Acts 16:9); in the temple of Jerusalem, when he received the commandment to preach to the Gentile world (Acts 22:18); when the ship in which he was being conveyed a prisoner to Rome was sinking in the tempest (Acts 27:23; see also 2 Corinthians 12:1-9)." 
3. "In the midst of the confusion excited in the Church of Antioch by the teaching of the extreme party at Jerusalem, we may well suppose that the Divine voice came to Paul, instructing him to propose the mission to Jerusalem."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul and Barnabas were not willing to see this Gentile church brow-beaten and treated as heretics by these self-appointed regulators of Christian orthodoxy from Jerusalem."
2. "Probably these Judaizers compelled Paul to think through afresh his whole gospel of grace and so they did Paul and the world a real service."
3. "The church clearly saw that the way to remove this deadlock between the Judaizers and Paul and Barnabas was to consult the church in Jerusalem to which the Judaizers belonged. Paul and Barnabas had won in Antioch. If they can win in Jerusalem, that will settle the matter."

2. "Indeed many of the Christians of Antioch would have acquiesced in the determination of Paul alone."
3. "But as many others might have prejudices against him, for his having been so much concerned for the Gentiles, it was highly expedient to take the concurrent judgment of all the apostles on this occasion."
