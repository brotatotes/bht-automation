# Acts 15:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Eating things sacrificed to idols was seen as an indifferent practice, but it had the potential to lead to idolatry and offend Jewish believers, so abstaining from it was appropriate. The prohibition against fornication was significant, even though it was not considered a fault by heathen philosophers. Fornication and idolatry were often intertwined in the worship of idols, which is why they are mentioned together. Lastly, abstaining from things strangled meant avoiding food that had been killed without properly draining the blood. This was a way to respect the sanctity of life.

"The association of fornication with three things in themselves indifferent is to be explained from the then moral corruption of heathenism, by which fornication, regarded from of old with indulgence, and even with favor, nay, practiced without shame even by philosophers, and surrounded by poets with all the tinsel of lasciviousness, had become in public opinion a thing really indifferent."
