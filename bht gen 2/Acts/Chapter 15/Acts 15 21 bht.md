# Acts 15:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In every city, the law of Moses is preached by those who uphold its teachings. The Jewish converts, who regularly hear the law read and explained every week, would naturally assume that the Gentile believers are also bound by its regulations. It is therefore necessary to assure them that they are no longer obligated to observe these ceremonial practices. The Jewish converts should understand that the Gentile Christians are not attempting to change or undermine their cherished customs.
