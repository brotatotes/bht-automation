It is important to note that this decision reflected the unanimous judgment of the apostles and all the members of the Church.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Such irregularities of case in words in apposition as we have here ( ἀποστόλοις .… ἐκλεξαμένους .… γράψαντες .…) will not surprise any one versed in Hellenistic Greek."
2. "The Silvanus ( 1Pe 5:12 ), by whom the first Epistle of Peter was carried to the churches of Asia Minor, seems to be the same person."
3. "Tradition however distinguishes Silas from Silvanus, making the former bishop of Corinth, the latter of Thessalonica."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Judas surnamed Barsabas—therefore not the apostle 'Judas the brother of James' (Acts 1:13), surnamed 'Thaddeus' (Matthew 10:3); nor can it be shown that he was a brother of 'Joseph called Barsabas' (Acts 1:23). But nothing is known of him beyond what is here said."
2. "and Silas—the same as 'Silvanus' in the Epistles. He became Paul's companion on his second missionary journey (Acts 1:23- :)."
3. "chief men among the brethren—selected purposely as such, to express the honor in which they held the church at Antioch, and the deputies they had sent to the council, and, as the matter affected all Gentile converts, to give weight to the written decision of this important assembly. They were 'prophets,' Acts 1:23- : (and see on Acts 15:1), and as such doubtless their eminence in the church at Jerusalem had been obtained."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It would seem that the apostles and elders deliberated on it, and decided it; but still, for the sake of peace and unity, they also took measures to ascertain that their decision agreed with the sentiment of the church."
2. "Men chosen for this purpose...Greater weight and authority would thus be attached to their message."
3. "Men of influence, experience, and authority in the church...They had, therefore, been engaged as preachers and rulers in the church at Jerusalem."


### John Calvin:
1. "That tempest was made calm not without the singular grace of God, so that after the matter was thoroughly discussed, they did all agree together in sound doctrine."
2. "The apostles did show some token of their equity, in that they set down nothing concerning the common cause of all the godly without admitting the people."
3. "When chief men come with the letters, that they may gravely dispute the whole matter in presence, all sinister suspicion is taken away."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The decrees of this primitive Council were agreed to by the united voice of the whole Church."
2. "Judas surnamed Barnabas...in the early Church he held the rank of 'a prophet'...one especially gifted with the power of preaching."
3. "Silas...well known in after years as the fellow-missionary and friend of St. Paul... Tradition speaks of him as subsequently Bishop of Corinth."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This Eirenicon of James commended itself to the whole assembly."
2. "But James was a practical leader and he did not stop with speeches and a vote."
3. "Judas called Barsabbas...The other, Silas, is probably a shortened form of Silvanus."

### John Gill:
1. "The opinion, judgment, and advice of James, being approved of by the whole body of the apostles, ministers, and brethren of the church assembled together on this occasion; they unanimously agreed, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch, with Paul and Barnabas."
2. "They thought fit to choose some persons from among themselves, out of that assembly, or who were members of the church at Jerusalem; and send them to Antioch, where the difference began, along with Paul and Barnabas, to give an account of the sense of the apostles, elders, and brethren, about the affair in controversy, and what was their advice upon the whole."
3. "They thought fit to send some indifferent persons along with them, to confirm their narrative, and to compose differences among them, and to bring back an account of the state of the church."

### John Wesley:
1. "With the whole Church - Which therefore had a part therein"
2. "To send chosen men - Who might put it beyond all dispute"
3. "That this was the judgment of the apostles and all the brethren."
