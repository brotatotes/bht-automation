# Acts 15:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The absence of St. Peter's name in the decision-making process and the subsequent letter highlights the early Church's lack of belief in his primacy. The decree was formulated based on Apostle James's guidance, not Peter's, and it was issued in the name of all the apostles, elders, and the entire Church. This illustrates the egalitarian nature of authority and decision-making within the early Church, emphasizing that Peter's supposed superiority as chief judge was not recognized or acknowledged.

### Henry Alford:
1. "The omission of Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ Œø·Ω∂ before ·ºÄŒ¥ŒµŒªœÜŒøŒØ, found (see var. read.) in all the first MSS., can (as Neander observes against De Wette) hardly have been occasioned by hierarchical considerations."
2. "It seems very much more probable to me that the words Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ Œø·º± were inserted to bring the decree into exact harmony with the beginning of Acts 15:22."
3. "This mention of churches in Cilicia, coupled with the fact of Paul‚Äôs stay at Tarsus, makes it probable that Paul preached the gospel there, and to Gentiles."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The combination here of written and oral transmission of an important decision reminds us of the first occasion of writing mentioned in the Old Testament, where a similar combination occurs." 
2. "But whereas there it is the deep difference between Israel and the Gentiles which is proclaimed, here it is the obliteration of that difference through faith in the Lord Jesus."
3. "Showing that churches then existed in Cilicia as well as Syria, which owed their existence, in all likelihood, to Paul's labors during the interval between his return to Tarsus and his departure in company with Barnabas for Antioch."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Send greeting - A word of salutation, expressing their desire of the happiness (œáŒ±ŒπÃÅœÅŒµŒπŒΩ chairein) of the persons addressed."
2. "And Syria - Antioch was the capital of Syria, and it is probable that the dispute was not confined to the capital."
3. "Cilicia was adjacent to Syria. Paul and Barnabas had traveled through it, and it is probable that the same difficulty would exist there which had disturbed the churches in Syria."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Greeting [œáŒ±ŒπœÅŒµŒπŒΩ]. The usual Greek form of salutation.
2. It occurs nowhere else in the salutation of a New Testament epistle save in the Epistle of James (i. 1).
3. It appears in the letter of Claudius Lysias (ch. 23 26).

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The apostles and elders constituted the Council, as far as the deliberative voice and definitive sentence were concerned; and therefore the decree was promulgated in their names."
2. "This geographical notice of the peoples mentioned specially in the decree of the Council gives us some idea how widely the preaching of Paul and his companions had extended, and how great had been the harvest of the Lord already in those early days."
3. "Successful missions had been carried on through that great and rich province, of which we have no record in the 'Acts,' missions, doubtless, conducted by men of the school of Paul and Barnabas; in Cilicia, too, the native country of Paul, congregations of believers in the Crucified had sprung up, and apparently were already flourishing communities."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This committee of four carried the letter which embodied the decision of the Conference."

### John Gill:

2. "the brethren or members of the several churches in these parts, who were Gentiles, are particularly sent to; and not the brethren who were Jews; because they were especially concerned, and to them is the advice directed"

### John Wesley:
1. "The whole conduct of this affair plainly shows that the Church in those days had no conception of St. Peter's primacy, or of his being the chief judge in controversies."
2. "For the decree is drawn up, not according to his, but the Apostle James's proposal and direction: and that in the name, not of St. Peter, but of all the apostles and elders, and of the whole Church."
3. "Nay, St. Peter's name is not mentioned at all, either in the order for sending to Jerusalem on the question, Acts 15:2, or in the address of the messengers concerning it, Acts 15:4, or in the letter which was written in answer."
