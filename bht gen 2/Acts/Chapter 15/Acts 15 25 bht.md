The church leaders commend Paul and Barnabas for their fervent zeal and courageous spirit, praising them for their willingness to lay down their lives for the sake of Christ. It is significant that Barnabas is mentioned first, as he held a position of respect in the church at Jerusalem.

The unanimous decision of the church at Antioch to send these two highly regarded individuals is a testament to their wisdom and approval of their teachings and actions.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
