# Acts 15:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By the guidance of the Holy Spirit, the church made a decisive determination on certain matters. These decisions, though not essential for salvation, were necessary for maintaining peace and unity in the churches at that particular time. However, it's important to note that some of these regulations were not meant to be permanent, as the Holy Spirit later repealed certain directives. Thus, we can see that the early church sought the wisdom and leading of the Holy Spirit in making decisions that impacted the life and unity of the believers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The decision of the Holy Spirit, given them as leaders of the Church, is laid down as the primary and decisive determination on the matter."
2. "Their own formal ecclesiastical decision follows, as giving utterance and scope to His will and command."
3. "The judgment as to what things were ἐπάναγκες is implied in ἔδοξεν, &c."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The One, inwardly guiding to and setting His seal on the decision come to: the other, the external ecclesiastical authority devoutly embracing, expressing, and conveying to the churches that decision:—a great principle this for the Church in all time."
2. "The whole language of these prohibitions, and of Acts 15:20, implies that they were designed as concessions to Jewish feelings on the part of the Gentile converts, and not as things which were all of unchanging obligation."
3. "The then state of heathen society in respect of all the four things seems the reason for so mixing them up."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost - This is a strong and undoubted claim to inspiration." 
2. "No greater burden - To impose no greater restraints, to enjoin no other observances."
3. "Necessary things - Necessary in order to preserve the peace of the church, to conciliate the minds of the Jewish converts, and in their circumstances particularly."

### John Calvin:
1. "They did set down, and decreed that which they write as he did indite it to them."
2. "For, as it were a sacrilegious partition, if faith should depend even but a very little upon man, so those men do openly mock God who feign that they have him to be their teacher, when they set nought by the ministers by whom he speaketh."
3. "That (say they) which the Church commandeth must be kept under pain of mortal sin, because the apostles say that that must necessarily be observed which they decree. But such a vain cavil is quickly answered. For this necessity reached no farther than there was any danger lest the unity should be cut asunder."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us...an apostolic statement of the true doctrine of inspiration."
2. "The decrees of the Council of Jerusalem were...very divine ordinances;...the churches were commanded everywhere to see them kept...as if Christ Himself had personally been the author of them."
3. "The cause why that Council was of so great authority and credit...is expressed in those words, 'Unto the Holy Ghost and to us it hath seemed good.'...the Council of Jerusalem...had authority greater than...any other council...no such persons are."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Definite claim that the church in this action had the guidance of the Holy Spirit."
2. "What a blessing it would be if this were always true!"
3. "Morality itself is a restraint upon one's impulses as is all law a prohibition against license."

### John Gill:
1. "By various things they had reason doubtless to conclude, that they were under the influence and direction of the Holy Ghost in this affair..."
2. "Not that they were necessary to salvation, but necessary to secure the peace of the churches, and at least were necessary, at that present time..."
3. "...since it appeared to be necessary to enjoin them for the present, they hoped they would not refuse to bear them..."

### John Wesley:
1. "These necessary things — All of these were necessary for that time."
2. "But the first of them was not necessary long."
3. "The direction concerning it was therefore repealed by the same Spirit, as we read in the former Epistle to the Corinthians."
