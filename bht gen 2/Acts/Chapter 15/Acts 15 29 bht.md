## BHT:
In Acts 15:20, the Bible instructs believers to abstain from meats offered to idols, from blood, and from things strangled. The prohibition of eating blood has roots in the very beginning, as it has always been forbidden for the people of God. This instruction is crystal clear and cannot be misunderstood. The truth is evident, regardless of any arguments that may arise. By heeding these guidelines and refraining from these practices, believers will do what is right and pleasing in the sight of God.
