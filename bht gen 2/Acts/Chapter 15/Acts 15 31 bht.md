# Acts 15:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The believers rejoiced over the exhortation or consolation given in the letter, which instructed them to abstain from certain practices without burdening them with additional requirements. Their joy stemmed not only from the unity among the apostles, elders, and brethren at Jerusalem, but also from the freedom they experienced from the heavy duties of the Mosaic law. They were grateful that the dispute among them was likely to be resolved and result in a positive outcome.
