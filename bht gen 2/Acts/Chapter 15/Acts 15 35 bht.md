# Acts 15:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, the Gospel of Christ. They were faithful in their proclamation, boldly speaking the truth even when it meant confronting others, as Paul did when he confronted Peter face to face for his separation from the Gentiles. This incident highlighted the importance of unity and the rejection of any form of division within the Church.
