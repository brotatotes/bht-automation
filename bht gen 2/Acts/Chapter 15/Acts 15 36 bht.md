# Acts 15:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Driven by love for his fellow believers, the apostle Paul intended to visit the young converts in the churches he had established. His purpose was twofold: to see how they were faring and to encourage their spiritual growth. This undertaking exemplifies the work of ministers of the Gospel. Although Paul initially planned a simple visit, God's providence led him beyond his intentions. Reflecting on Paul's example prompts us to evaluate our own spiritual progress and growth in faith. In ecclesiastical visitations, the question of how our souls are faring in their journey becomes essential.
