# Acts 15:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul made the decision not to take John Mark with them on their journey, as he had previously deserted them and showed an unwillingness to face the dangers and hardships of the work. Paul did not deem it proper to trust him again, as he had not shown evidence of repentance for his actions. Despite this, Paul still had a measure of respect for John Mark, recognizing him as a fellow worker and someone who had brought him comfort in the past.
