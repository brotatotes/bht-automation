# Acts 15:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The mighty grace of God overcomes all obstacles, sanctifies us, and preserves us despite the world's temptations. While Paul was recommended by the church at Antioch, Barnabas did not receive the same commendation, suggesting that the church supported Paul in their disagreement. Nevertheless, Paul and Barnabas later reconciled, and John Mark was once again welcomed as a companion in Paul's ministry. The incomparable grace of God prevails and brings about reconciliation, restoring relationships and guiding us in our mission to spread the Gospel.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He may perhaps have come down again to Antioch in Peterâ€™s company." 
2. "We find a Silvanus in 1 Peter 5:12, the bearer of that epistle to the congregations of Asia Minor."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "and departed, being recommended...to the grace of Godâ€”(No doubt by some solemn service; see Acts 13:3)"
2. "It does not follow from the historian's silence that Barnabas was not so recommended, too; for this is the last mention of Barnabas in the history, whose sole object now is to relate the proceedings of Paul."
3. "Nor does it seem quite fair...to conclude from this that the Church at Antioch took that marked way of showing their sympathy with Paul in opposition to Barnabas."

### Albert Barnes:
1. Being recommended - Being commended by prayer to God. See notes on Acts 14:26.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Recommended. Which was not the case with Barnabas, leading to the inference that the church at Antioch took Paul 's side in the dispute. 

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Silas was one of the deputies chosen to accompany Paul and Barnabas... he was able, from his own personal knowledge, to bear his testimony to the perfect accord which reigned between Paul and the older apostles."
2. "When Paul had selected his companion... he was especially commended by the brethren to the grace of God, thus receiving a solemn official sanction to his mission."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Chose (ÎµÏ€Î¹Î»ÎµÎ¾Î±Î¼ÎµÎ½Î¿Ï‚). First aorist middle (indirect) participle of ÎµÏ€Î¹Î»ÎµÎ³Ï‰, choosing for himself, as the successor of Barnabas, not of Mark who had no place in Paul's plans at this time."
2. "The church probably recalled how in the pinch Barnabas flickered and went to the side of Peter and that it was Paul who for the moment stood Paulus contra mundum for Gentile liberty in Christ against the threat of the Judaizers from Jerusalem."
3. "Silas had influence in the church in Jerusalem (verse Acts 15:22) and was apparently a Roman citizen (Acts 16:37) also. He is the Silas or Silvanus of the epistles (1 Thessalonians 1:1; 2 Thessalonians 1:1; 2 Corinthians 1:19; 1 Peter 5:12). It is remarkable that Peter mentions both Mark and Silas as with him (1 Peter 5:12) at the same time."

### John Gill:
1. "This being the design of the Holy Ghost in influencing his mind"
2. "The apostle having such a recommendation by the brethren of the church at Antioch"
3. "Nothing of this kind being said with respect to Barnabas"

### John Wesley:
1. "O how mighty is the grace of God! which in the midst of the world, in the midst of sin, among so many snares of Satan, and in spite of the incredible weakness and depravity of nature, yet overcomes all opposition, sanctifies, sustains, and preserves us to the end!"
2. "It appears not only that Paul and Barnabas were afterward thoroughly reconciled, but also that John was again admitted by St. Paul as a companion in his labours."
3. "The grace of God...overcomes all opposition, sanctifies, sustains, and preserves us to the end!"
