# Acts 15:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul's second mission tour was characterized by a mix of anticipation and concern. Leaving Cyprus to Barnabas and Mark, Paul embarked on a journey through Syria and Cilicia, where he had previously preached and converted many. In his visit to these regions, Paul sought to strengthen the newly established churches by teaching and reaffirming the truths and ordinances of the Gospel. It is clear that there were existing churches in Cilicia, with Tarsus serving as a prominent city among them. These ventures reflected the remarkable and rapid spread of the gospel in the early years following Christ's Ascension.
