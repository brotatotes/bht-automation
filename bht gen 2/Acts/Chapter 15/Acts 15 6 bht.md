### Henry Alford:
1. "The objection, that no one place could have held them, is nugatory: the official presence of all is assumed continually in such cases, where the assembly is open to all."
2. "The Apostles and elders only are mentioned as having assembled: in which case πᾶν τὸ πλῆθος (Act 15:12) must mean τῶν πρεσβυτέρων, and the decision of Act 15:22 must have been arrived at in a larger assembly."
3. "But most probably the deliberation of the Apostles and elders implied the presence of the brethren also, who are intended by πᾶν τὸ πλ., and there was but one assembly."

Of the twelve apostles, one we know had gone through martyrdom to his rest; others were perhaps in distant parts; and round those who still remained in the old Jerusalem home, gradually had gathered a company of presbyters or elders, who shared their responsibilities and took part in their deliberations."
