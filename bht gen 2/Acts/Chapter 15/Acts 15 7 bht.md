# Acts 15:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When much debate arose, Peter stood up to address the assembly, emphasizing the need for divine guidance and unity among the apostles. It is important to note that their discussions did not indicate a lack of certainty, as their final decision was guided by divine direction. Despite their inspiration, their process of deliberation allowed them to reach a unanimous conclusion. Peter's rising up in this context holds significance as it marks the final mention of him in the Acts.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "A promiscuous debate...as is implied in Acts 15:12, man disputing with man."
2. "Partly on account of the universal deference paid to him, but principally because of his peculiar fitness to open the apostolic decisions on the subject, from having been made the instrument of the first public and approved reception of the Gentiles."
3. "Such notices are important, as shewing that these reports are not only according to the sense of what was said, but the words spoken, verbatim."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This is the last mention of him in the Acts, and one worthy of his standing, as formally pronouncing, from the divine decision of the matter already in his own case, in favor of the views which all of Paul's labors were devoted to establishing."
2. "A good while ago—probably about fifteen years before this."
3. "Made choice . . . that the Gentiles by my mouth."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Much disputing - Or rather, much inquiry or deliberation. With our word disputing we commonly connect the idea of heat and anger. This is not necessarily implied in the word used here."
2. "Peter rose up and said - Peter was probably the most aged, and was most accustomed to speak... Besides, there was a particular reason for his speaking here, as he had been engaged in similar scenes, and understood the case."
3. "God made choice ... - That is, of all the apostles, he designated me to engage in this work... That the Gentiles - Cornelius, and those who were assembled with him at Caesarea. This was the first case that had occurred, and therefore it was important to appeal to it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. The word of the gospel [τον λογου του ευαγγελιου] . This phrase occurs nowhere else; and eujaggelion, gospel, is found only once more in Acts (ch. 20 24).

### John Calvin:
1. "He suffered (even in that company and assembly wherein he was chief) the principal point of Christian doctrine to be diversely tossed and handled, lest we should wonder, if at any time it so fall out, that men, who are otherwise learned and godly, do, through unskillfulness, fall into an error."
2. "And so soon as the authority of God is brought forth, all doubting is taken away, because this is all our wisdom, to stay ourselves upon the authority, government, and commandment of God, − (94) and to make more account of his beck and pleasure than of all reasons."
3. "But it is the Spirit of regeneration alone which distinguisheth the children of God from strangers."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The noble self-denial which Peter showed, the brave and independent position which he took no this momentous occasion, and which probably cost him much of his influence among the stricter Jewish Christians, must be reckoned among the famous apostle’s chiefest titles to honour."
2. "Only those speeches are reported which closed the debate, and which evidently expressed the general feeling of the majority of the Council. Peter’s words, of course, were exceedingly weighty, as the deliberate expression of opinion of one who had ever stood high in the Master’s friendship and confidence, and who, from the very first, had occupied a leading position among the brethren."
3. "Peter’s reminder was a grave rebuke to the extreme Pharisee party, who probably had forgotten the case of Cornelius, referred to by the apostle, which had taken place some eight or ten years before."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They were allowed plenty of time and there was no effort to shut off debate or to rush anything through the meeting."
2. "The wonder was that he had waited so long."
3. "His point is that what Paul and Barnabas have reported is nothing new. The Judaizers made objection then as they are doing now."

### John Gill:
1. "And when there had been much disputing... Peter rose up... and he stood up that he might be the better heard." 
2. "Ye know how that a good while ago... quickly after the effusion of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost: it is thought, by some, to be ten or eleven, and, by others, to be twenty years ago, or thereabout."
3. "God made choice among us... that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the Gospel, and believe."

### John Wesley:
1. "It does not appear that this was among the apostles themselves. But if it had, if they themselves had debated at first, yet might their final decision be from an unerring direction."
2. "For how really soever they were inspired, we need not suppose their inspiration was always so instantaneous and express, as to supersede any deliberation in their own minds, or any consultation with each other."
3. "Peter rose up — This is the last time he is mentioned in the Acts."
