# Acts 15:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The state of the heart is the real question for admission to the visible Church, and God, who knows the hearts, was able to judge the sincere conversion of these Gentiles. He testified to their acceptance by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as He had done for the Jews who believed in Jesus. This demonstration of God's well pleasedness was further confirmed by bestowing upon them extraordinary gifts. The essential message of Peter's speech was to emphasize that circumcision was not necessary for salvation.
