# Acts 15:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God does not make a distinction between Jews and Gentiles in matters of religion, neither because of their ancestry, circumcision, ceremonial law, nor national adoption. He has also ordained Gentiles to eternal life as Jews, based on their belief in Christ. This purification of their hearts occurs through implanting faith in them and leading that faith to the cleansing power of Christ's blood.
