# Acts 16:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage signifies the beginning of St. Luke's account of his journey with the apostle Paul. Interestingly, St. Luke never mentions his own name or what he did for the service of Christianity, maintaining a humble and modest approach. This trait is shared by the other biblical historians, demonstrating their selflessness and dedication to sharing the Gospel message.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "(1) That while we safely conclude from it that the writer was in company with Paul when he thus speaks, we cannot with like safety infer that he was not, where the third person is used."
2. "And again, the episodes where the chief person alone, or with his principal companion or companions, is concerned, would be many, in which the narrator would use the third person, not because he was not present, but because he was not concerned."
3. "On examining however one of the passages where this is done, we find that after the enumeration of Sopater, Aristarchus, Secundus, Gaius, Timotheus, Tychicus, and Trophimus, we are told, οὗτοι προελθόντες ἔμενον ἡμᾶς ἐν Τρωάδι: so that the writer evidently regards himself as being closely associated with Paul, and does not think it requisite to enumerate himself among the companions of the Apostle."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The 'we,' here first introduced, is a modest intimation that the historian himself had now joined the missionary party."
2. "Whether Paul's broken health had anything to do with this arrangement for having 'the beloved physician' with him, can never be known with certainty; but that he would deem himself honored in taking care of so precious a life, there can be no doubt."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This is the first instance in which Luke refers to himself as being in company with Paul."
2. "It is evident that he attended Paul in his travels, as recorded throughout the remainder of the Acts."
3. "Assuredly gathering - Being certainly convinced."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. We sought. Note the introduction, for the first time here, of the first person, intimating the presence of the author with Paul. Assuredly gathering [συμβιβαζοντες] . See on proving, ch. 9 22.

### John Calvin:
1. "Whereby it cometh to pass, that the bare vision leaveth man’s mind in doubt; but such as are divine indeed, those doth the Spirit seal by a certain mark, that those may not doubt nor waver whom the Lord will have certainly addicted to himself." 
2. "The Lord dealt far otherwise with his servant, so that he put him out of doubt, and left him not astonished with fear."
3. "The termination of the participle which is here used is active; and though it have divers significations, I do not doubt but that Luke’s meaning is, that Paul and the rest, after that they had conferred [compared] this vision with the former oracles, were fully persuaded that the Lord had called them into Macedonia."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "‘We endeavoured;’ from this it appears that Luke, the presumed author of these records, joined the missionary band first at Troas."
2. "Connecting the severe and dangerous illness of the apostle during the Galatian visit, from which he had so recently recovered, the supposition that the ‘beloved physician’ associated himself with his great master at this juncture and watched over his health is not without foundation."
3. "After the direct intimation given by the appearance of the ‘man of Macedonia,’ Paul seems to have had no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that his life-work lay for a time, at least, in Europe."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This sudden use of the plural, dropped in Acts 17:1 when Paul leaves Philippi, and resumed in Acts 20:5 when Paul rejoins Luke in Philippi, argues conclusively that Luke, the author, is in the party ('we' portions of Acts) and shows in a writer of such literary skill as Luke that he is not copying a document in a blundering sort of way."
2. "A very striking word, present active participle of συνβιβαζω, old verb to make go together, to coalesce or knit together, to make this and that agree and so to conclude."
3. "This word here gives a good illustration of the proper use of the reason in connection with revelation, to decide whether it is a revelation from God, to find out what it means for us, and to see that we obey the revelation when understood."

### John Gill:
1. "And after he had seen the vision,.... And considered it, and related it to his companions: and when they had well weighed it, and the circumstances of it..." 
2. "immediately we endeavored to go into Macedonia; they determined upon it, and took all the proper methods, and made the necessary provisions for it."
3. "they concluded from the vision with great certainty, that they had a manifest call from God to go into Macedonia, and preach the Gospel to the inhabitants of it, not doubting but that they should meet with success."

### John Wesley:
1. "This is the first place in which St. Luke intimates his attendance on the apostle."
2. "Nor does he throughout the history once mention his own name, or any one thing which he did or said for the service of Christianity."
3. "The same remark may be made on the rest of the sacred historians, who every one of them show the like amiable modesty."
