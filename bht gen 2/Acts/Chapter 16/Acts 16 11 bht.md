# Acts 16:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They had a fair wind on this occasion, sailing with a straight course. It was a nautical term for sailing before the wind. The apostle set sail from Troas and made a straight run to Samothracia. This journey demonstrated the Lord's exercise of faith and patience in bringing his people through great straits. The beginnings of the kingdom of Christ were intentionally humble, reflecting the humility of the cross. The servants of Christ must persevere and wrestle with obstacles, not being discouraged by apparent fruitlessness.
