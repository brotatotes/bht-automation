# Acts 16:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On the outskirts of the city, near the river, the Jews gathered together for their prayer assembly. This was their custom as they often sought to distance themselves from the influence of the surrounding heathen population. By the riverside, they found a place that allowed for the necessary purification rites. The meeting had not officially begun, so Paul and his companions engaged in conversation with the women, gradually leading into the preaching of the Gospel.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "From many sources we learn, that it was the practice of the Jews to hold their assemblies for prayer near water, whether of the sea, or of rivers: probably on account of the frequent washings customary among them." 
2. "That this is the meaning here, is plain from the use of ἐνομίζετο εἶναι, which could certainly not be said if the προσευχή were in this case a building dedicated to prayer."
3. "The close of the verse also agrees best with an open place of resort. There seem to have been few, if any, Jews in Philippi: this assembly consisting merely of women attached to the Jewish faith."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The meeting appears to have consisted wholly of women, and these not all Jewish."
2. "But here and thus were gathered the first-fruits of Europe unto Christ, and they were of the female sex, of whose accession and services honorable mention will again and again be made."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "By a river side - What river this was is not known. It is known, however, that the Jews were accustomed to provide water, or to build their synagogues and oratories near water, for the convenience of the numerous washings before and during their religious services."
2. "Places for prayer were erected by the Jews in the vicinity of cities and towns, and particularly where there were not Jewish families enough, or where they were forbidden by the magistrate to erect a synagogue. These proseuchoe, or places of prayer, were simple enclosures made of stones, in a grove or under a tree, where there would be a retired and convenient place for worship."
3. "And spake unto the women ... - This was probably before the regular service of the place commenced."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The number of Jews in Philippi was small, since it was a military and not a mercantile city; consequently there was no synagogue, but only a proseucha, or praying - place, a slight structure, and often open to the sky."
2. "It was outside the gate, for the sake of retirement, and near a stream, because of the ablutions connected with the worship."

### John Calvin:
1. "God, by their example, meant to teach us what great account we ought to make of the profession of faith; that we do not forsake it either for fear of envy or of dangers."
2. "They prefer the worship of God before their own quietness and commodity."
3. "We see that the holy men omit no occasion or opportunity, because they vouchsafed to offer the gospel even to women alone."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word προσευχή (proseucha) is well known as the designation of a slight and temporary structure, frequently open to the sky, erected for the purposes of Jewish worship."
2. "The 'proseucha,' or place of prayer by the river side, was the substitute for the ordinary Jewish meeting-house."
3. "These were very probably proselytes, not Jews...who, like Lydia of Thyatira, had learned to know the God of Israel in other cities."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "There was evidently no synagogue inside the city, but 'without the gates'...they had noticed an enclosure 'where we supposed'...was a place of prayer."
2. "The rule of the rabbis required ten men to constitute a synagogue, but here were gathered only a group of women at the hour of prayer."
3. "Paul did not have an inspiring beginning for his work in Europe, but he took hold where he could."

### John Gill:
1. "It looks as if there was no synagogue of the Jews in this place, or otherwise the apostle and his companions would have gone into that, according to their custom."
2. "They saw a place, which in their opinion looked like a religious house, or a place for prayer, and so made up to it, where they found some persons assembled together on that account."
3. "And worship not being begun, the apostle and his companions sat down among them, and entered into some religious conversation with them, and took the opportunity of preaching the Gospel."

### John Wesley:
1. "The Jews usually held their religious assemblies (either by choice or constraint) at a distance from the heathens."
2. "By a river side - Which was also convenient for purifying themselves."
3. "We spake — At first in a familiar manner. Paul did not immediately begin to preach."
