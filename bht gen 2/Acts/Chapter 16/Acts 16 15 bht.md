# Acts 16:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The mention of baptism here indicates its special importance in this first European baptism. It was customary to be baptized immediately after believing, and the presumption is that it included children, as in other cases of household baptism. Lydia's invitation to Paul and his companions shows her great hospitality and desire for further instruction in the doctrines of religion. This act also demonstrates her readiness to consecrate her family to God. The early practice of dedicating children to God, as seen in our Lord's action with children, supports the practice of baptizing infants.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The mention of baptism here for the first time in connection with the labors of Paul, while it was doubtless performed on all his former converts, indicates a special importance in this first European baptism."
2. "Whether it included children, also in that case baptized, is not explicitly stated; but the presumption, as in other cases of household baptism, is that it did."
3. "There is a beautiful modesty in the expression."

### Albert Barnes:

### John Calvin:
1. "This was a token of mere readiness; also, her holy zeal and godliness do therein show themselves, in that she doth also consecrate her family to God."
2. "The godly (as we have already said) must endeavor, with might and main, to drive from their houses all manner of superstition; secondly, that they have not profane families, but that they keep them under the fear of the Lord."
3. "Nevertheless, it is not to be doubted but that the Lord gave her such an affection, to the end Paul might be the more encouraged to proceed, not only because he saw that he was liberally and courteously entertained, but also because he might thereby judge of the fruit of his doctrine."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The practice, however, of infant baptism rests on surer ground than on the doubtful interpretation of any solitary text."
2. "Is it credible, asks Bengel, that in so many families there was no child? But our Lord‚Äôs action, when He laid His hands on the little child-heads (Matthew 19:15), is of all warrants for this most ancient practice the most authoritative."
