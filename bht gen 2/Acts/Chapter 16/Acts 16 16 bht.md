# Acts 16:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As they went to their usual place of public prayer by the river-side, they encountered a slave girl who was possessed by a spirit of divination, thought to be inspired by the Pythian Apollo. This girl, through her soothsaying abilities, brought much gain to her masters. The spirit in her deceived people by speaking out of her belly, pretending to have the power to divine and foretell the future. It is important to note that the phrase going to prayer used by the writers in this passage is a mere Anglicism and not commonly used by eastern writers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The fact of the spirit leaving the girl, and the masters finding the hope of their gains gone, is fatal."
2. "This was a case in which the presence of the spirit was a patent fact, recognized by the heathen possessors and consulters of this female slave, and by them turned to account; recognized also by the Christian teachers, as an instance of one of those works of the devil which their Lord came, and commissioned them, to destroy."
3. "It may be remarked that the E. V. of πορευομένων εἰς (τὴν) προσευχήν, 'as we went to prayer,' has given rise to a curious abuse of the expression 'going to prayer,' in the sense of 'beginning to pray,' among the lower classes in England." (89 words)

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The words imply that it was on their way to the usual place of public prayer, by the river-side, that this took place; therefore not on the same day with what had just occurred."
2. "A . . . damsel—a female servant, and in this case a slave."
3. "Possessed of a spirit of divination—or, of Python, that is, a spirit supposed to be inspired by the Pythian Apollo, or of the same nature. The reality of this demoniacal possession is as undeniable as that of any in the Gospel history."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He had temples on Mount Parnassus, at Delphi, Delos, Claros, Tenedos, etc., and his worship was almost universal."
2. "In the celebrated oracle at Delphi, the priestess of Apollo pretended to be inspired; became violently agitated during the periods of pretended inspiration; and during those periods gave such responses to inquirers as were regarded as the oracles of the god."
3. "It is plain that Paul regarded this as a case of demoniacal possession, and treated it accordingly."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Python, in the Greek mythology, was the serpent which guarded Delphi."
2. "The heathen inhabitants of Philippi regarded the woman as inspired by Apollo; and Luke, in recording this case, which came under his own observation, uses the term which would naturally suggest itself to a Greek physician, a Python - spirit, presenting phenomena identical with the convulsive movements and wild cries of the Pythian priestess at Delphi."
3. "Akin to mainomai, to rave, in allusion to the temporary madness which possessed the priestess or sibyl while under the influence of the God."

### John Calvin:
1. "Satan hath a double way to resist the gospel, to wit, because he doth sometimes rage openly, and sometimes he creepeth in craftily under lies, he hath also two kinds of lying and deceiving."
2. "Seeing that Satan hath a double way to resist the gospel... we must beware of his crafty subtilty, lest when he pretendeth the color of truth he deceive us under a vain show."
3. "Therefore, it is better for us to live without any religion at all, than, through the desire of religion, to run headlong into destruction. Neither do they object and pretend this fear for their excuse in earnest; but, seeing they desire nothing more than to wander carelessly, like beasts, without any fear of God, they can be content with any excuse, so they be not tied to any religion."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To be possessed by the spirit of Pythoness was, in other words, to be possessed by a prophetic spirit or demon."
2. "Paul, when he met her, and had had several opportunities of observing her, recognised that she was one of those many unhappy beings who, in the first days of Christianity, were afflicted with grievous soul maladies."
3. "In the Gospels, these wretched ones, called demoniacs, now and again came in contact with Jesus, and at once recognising His power, the indwelling demons set free the soul they were tormenting."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In the LXX those with familiar spirits are called by this word ventriloquists."
2. "It is possible that this slave girl had this gift of prophecy 'by soothsaying.'"
3. "Joint owners of this poor slave girl who were exploiting her calamity, whatever it was, for selfish gain."

### John Gill:
1. "And it came to pass as we went to prayer...the phrase of 'going to prayer', as used by us, for the act or duty of prayer, is a mere Anglicism, and unknown to the eastern writers."
2. "The spirit in her...pretended to divine and foretell things to come...this speaking out of their bellies might be done, without the possession of a real spirit, and much less was it from God."
3. "Which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying...great quantities were got by particular persons, who pretended to such a spirit, by which they told fortunes, and what should befall people hereafter."
