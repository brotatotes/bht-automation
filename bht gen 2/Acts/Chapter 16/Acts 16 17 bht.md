# Acts 16:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Although the recognition of Paul and his company by the spirit is a significant truth, St. Paul did not require nor accept such testimony.

The presence of this recognition from a demon serves more to highlight the power and authority of God and His servants than to benefit the afflicted individual. It is a reminder that in the early days of Christianity, testimonies from demons regarding God and His servants were not uncommon occurrences.
