# Acts 16:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul and his companions endured the woman's constant testimony not for their own benefit, but to emphasize the expulsion of the evil spirit and make it more evident. He was grieved and felt the need to dissociate himself from her and the spirit within her. Taking action, Paul turned and commanded the spirit, in the name of Jesus Christ, to come out. This incident showcased the authority and power bestowed upon the apostles by Christ to cast out demons, serving as a powerful testament to the superiority of the Christian faith and exposing the deceiving nature of the enemy.

1. "Against this extensive system of imposture and fraud Christianity must oppose itself; and this was a favorable instance to expose the delusion, and to show the power of the Christian religion over all the arts and powers of imposture."
