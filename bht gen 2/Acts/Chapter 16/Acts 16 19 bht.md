## BHT:
The masters of the possessed girl were enraged when they realized that their hope of profiting from her demonic power was gone. This reaction illustrates how people's love for wealth can blind them to spiritual realities and the evidence of God's presence. The opposition to the gospel often stems from its threat to unethical enterprises. The arrest of Paul and Silas, as the main figures involved, demonstrates the authorities' disregard for the rest of the group. The magistrates, who held both military and civil authority, apprehended and brought them into the marketplace.
