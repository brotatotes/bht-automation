# Acts 16:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Timothy, the young disciple, received a continuous witness to his piety and virtue from his brethren in Lystra and Iconium. This good report of his character and conduct was crucial for his ministry as it is important for ministers to have a good reputation among both those inside and outside the church. While external witnesses are valuable, the testimony of those within the church is especially significant.
