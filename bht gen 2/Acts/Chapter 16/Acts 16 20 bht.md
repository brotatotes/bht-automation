# Acts 16:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
- This accusation highlights the prejudice against Jews during this time, as they were seen as a troublesome and despised group by the Romans.
- Rather than addressing the specific incident of the dispossessing of the maid, the accusers use this opportunity to bring up concerns for the city's stability.

2. "The distinction between ὑπάρχων and ὤν seems to be, that the former is used of something which the speaker or narrator wishes to put forward into notice, either as unknown to his reader or hearer, or in some way to be marked by him for praise or blame: whereas the latter refers to facts known and recognized, and taken for granted by both." 
3. "'Versute composita fait hæc criminatio ad gravandos Christi servos: nam ab una parte obtendunt Romanum nomen, quo nihil erat magis favorabile; rursum ex nomine Judaico, quod tunc infame erat (especially if the decree of Claudius, expelling them from Rome, ch. Acts 18:2, had at this time been enacted) conflant illis invidiam.'"

3. "Worldly-minded people often thus complain that their neighborhoods are disturbed by revivals of religion; and the preaching of the truth, and the attacking of their vices, often arouses this hypocritical conscientiousness, and makes them alarmed for the laws, and for religion, and for order, which they at other times are the first to disturb and disregard."
