# Acts 16:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The accusations against the apostle and his companions stemmed from the fear of change and the introduction of a new religious belief. The Romans, being strict in their religious customs, deemed it unlawful to receive or observe any new deity without the approval of the senate. However, the message of salvation by Christ, which was seen as a new religious doctrine, posed a threat to the existing order and the established philosophies of the time. The world, having embraced the teachings of various philosophers, found the Gospel truth to be particularly challenging and unacceptable.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans—Here also there was a measure of truth; as the introduction of new gods was forbidden by the laws, and this might be thought to apply to any change of religion."
2. "But the whole charge was pure hypocrisy; for as these men would have let the missionaries preach what religion they pleased if they had not dried up the source of their gains, so they conceal the real cause of their rage under color of a zeal for religion, and law, and good order."
3. "So Acts 17:6; Acts 17:7; Acts 19:25; Acts 19:27."

### Marvin Vincent:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It was no very easy matter for these angry men to formulate their complaint against Paul and Silas, so they had recourse to the favourite accusation against men of a strange race and nationality they charged them with attempting to stir up political disturbances." 
2. "The accusation,’ Calvin, quoted by Gloag, strikingly remarks, ‘was craftily composed: on the one hand they boast of the name of Romans, than which no name was more honourable; on the other hand they excite hatred against the apostles and bring them into contempt by calling them Jews, which name was at that time infamous."
