# Acts 16:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The multitude, incited by the mention of unlawful customs, cried out tumultuously as Paul and Silas were handed over to the officers. The duumviri, instead of giving them a trial, commanded that their clothes be violently rent off, leaving them exposed to be beaten and whipped. This was a common practice when prisoners were to be scourged. Despite being Roman citizens, the duumviri saw Paul and Silas as disruptive Jews. This marked one of the three occasions when Paul endured such humiliation.
