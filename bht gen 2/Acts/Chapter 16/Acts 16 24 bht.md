# Acts 16:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The individuals in question were subjected to a dreadful imprisonment. They were confined to the innermost part of the prison, a dismal and suffocating dungeon. To intensify their suffering, their feet were cruelly restrained in stocks, an instrument designed to cause great pain by forcibly stretching their legs apart. Despite the harsh conditions and torment they endured, their unwavering faith led them to sing praises to God.
