# Acts 16:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As the earthquake shook, the keeper of the prison was stirred from his sleep, not only by the voices of Paul and Silas, but by the unusual movement of the earth. When he awoke, he noticed the prison doors standing open, a sight that struck fear into his heart. In his panic and desperation, he believed that the prisoners had escaped and, knowing the penalty he would face for such a lapse in his duty, he was about to take his own life. Such was the terror and despair gripping him in that moment.
