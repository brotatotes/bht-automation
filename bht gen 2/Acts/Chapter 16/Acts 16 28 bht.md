# Acts 16:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the darkness, Paul's primary concern was to save the jailer from eternal ignorance. Perhaps through divine revelation, he discerned the jailer's intentions and urgently advised him against self-harm. Paul's compassionate response towards someone who previously mistreated him displayed the essence of Christianity. The presence of all the prisoners, captivated by the apostles' prayers and awestruck by the supernatural events, suppressed any desire to escape. This demonstrated the power of God in their midst. The Christian faith not only offers eternal life but also prohibits self-inflicted harm, providing solace and preventing desperate actions.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "One thought filled the apostle's mind at that moment‚Äîanxiety to save a fellow creature from sending himself into eternity, ignorant of the only way of life."
2. "But how, it has been asked by skeptical critics, could Paul in his inner prison know what the jailer was about to do? In many conceivable ways, without supposing any supernatural communication."
3. "Not less flat is the question, why the other liberated prisoners did not make their escape:‚Äîas if there were the smallest difficulty in understanding how, under the resistless conviction that there must be something supernatural in their instantaneous liberation without human hand, such wonder and awe should possess them..."

2. "It enjoins upon people to do themselves no harm by self-murder, whether by the sword, the pistol, the halter; by intemperance, by lust, or by dissipation."
3. "In all cases, Christianity seeks the true welfare of man. In all cases, if it were obeyed, people would do themselves no harm. They would promote their own best interests here, and their eternal welfare hereafter."

### Philip Schaff:

1. "Do thyself no harm (ŒºŒ∑Œ¥ŒµŒΩ œÄœÅŒ±ŒæŒ∑ŒπœÇ œÉŒµŒ±œÖœÑœâ Œ∫Œ±Œ∫ŒøŒΩ). The usual construction (ŒºŒ∑ and the aorist subjunctive) for a prohibition not to begin to do a thing."

3. "For we are all here; not only Paul and Silas, but the rest of the prisoners also; who either being so intent upon hearing the prayers and praises of the apostles, or so terrified with the earthquake, that they took no notice of their bands being loosed, and so never thought or attempted to make their escape."

### John Wesley:
1. "Paul cried ‚Äî As they were all then in the dark, it is not easy to say, how Paul knew of the jailer's purpose; unless it were by some immediate notice from God, which is by no means incredible."
2. "With a loud voice ‚Äî Through earnestness, and because he was at some distance."
3. "Do thyself no harm ‚Äî Although the Christian faith opens the prospect into another life, yet it absolutely forbids and effectually prevents a man's discharging himself from this."
