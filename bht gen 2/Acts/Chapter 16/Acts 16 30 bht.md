The jailer, once filled with fear and distress, now seeks salvation by posing the question, What must I do to be saved? His encounter with Paul and Silas has profoundly impacted him, leading him to a genuine desire to learn how to obtain deliverance.

Faced with his own sinful condition and the impending judgment, he eagerly implores for direction on how to be saved from the guilt he feels and the vengeance he fears.
