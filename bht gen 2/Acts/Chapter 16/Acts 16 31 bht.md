## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Not without allusion to the κύριοι, by which name he had just addressed them." 
2. "Considering who the person was that asked the question, a heathen in the depths of ignorance and sin, and how indisputably therefore the answer embraces all sinners whatever, there perhaps does not stand on record in the whole book a more important answer than this of Paul: or, I may add, one more strikingly characteristic of the Apostle himself and his teaching."
3. "καὶ ὁ οἶκός σου does not mean that his faith would save his household, but that the same way was open to them as to him: ‘Believe, and thou shalt be saved: and the same of thy household.’"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved—The brevity, simplicity, and directness of this reply are, in the circumstances, singularly beautiful."
2. "Enough at that moment to have his faith directed simply to the Saviour, with the assurance that this would bring to his soul the needed and sought salvation."
3. "The how being a matter for after teaching."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ - This was a simple, plain, and effectual direction. They told him to believe at once; to commit his agitated, guilty, and troubled spirit to the Savior, with the assurance that he should find peace."
2. "And thy house - That is, the same salvation is equally adapted to, and offered to your family. It does not mean that his family would be saved simply by his believing, but that they might be saved as well as he."
3. "His attention was called at once, as every man’s should be, to his family. He was reminded that they needed salvation, and he was presented with the assurance that they might unite with him in the peace and joy of redeeming mercy." (150 words)

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ alone hath all the parts of blessedness and eternal life included in him, which he offereth to us by the gospel; and by faith we receive them."
2. "Christ is the mark whereat faith must aim; and, therefore, men’s minds do nothing else but wander when they turn aside from him."
3. "The faith is not a light or dry opinion concerning unknown things, but a plain and distinct knowledge of Christ conceived out of the gospel."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They reply to him by telling him at   once of One, even the Lord Jesus, in whom alone there is salvation."
2. "They demand from him, if he would indeed be saved, ‘a faith of which His Person is the object nothing more than faith, nothing less."
3. "This Roman, who believed from that hour with all his heart,  showed  his faith by rendering all the services to these persecuted servants which gratitude and adoring love to their Master could suggest."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "To be saved (ινα σωθω). Final clause with ινα and first aorist passive subjunctive. What did he mean by 'saved'? Certainly more than escape from peril about the prisoners or because of the earthquake, though these had their influences on him."
2. "Believe on the Lord Jesus (Πιστευσον επ τον κυριον Ιησουν). This is what Peter told Cornelius (Acts 10:43). This is the heart of the matter for both the jailor and his house."

### John Wesley:
1. Thou shalt be saved and thy household — If ye believe. They did so, and were saved.
