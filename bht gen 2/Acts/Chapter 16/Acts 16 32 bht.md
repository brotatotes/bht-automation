# Acts 16:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They passionately conveyed the message of the Lord to him, expounding on the Gospel of Jesus Christ, which is not only preached by Him but also pertains to Him. This is the word of salvation, reconciliation, peace, life, righteousness, and faith. It is the means by which faith is obtained and contains essential truths to be believed. The individuals addressed were mature enough to comprehend the word of the Lord, to hear it, believe in it, and rejoice in it, as faith is received through hearing.
