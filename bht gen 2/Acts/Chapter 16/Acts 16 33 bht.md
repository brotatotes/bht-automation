# Acts 16:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The jailer took the apostles and washed their wounds, cleansing them from the blood caused by their beatings. This act demonstrates the jailer's kindness and compassion, as well as his newfound faith. Their wounds were not miraculously healed, showing that the apostles did not use their miracles for personal gain. This event also serves as a reminder of the transformation that can occur through conversion, as the jailer goes from being indifferent to the apostles' suffering to being deeply concerned for their well-being.
