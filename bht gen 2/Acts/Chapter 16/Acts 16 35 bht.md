# Acts 16:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The earthquake not only scared the prison guards, but also caused the magistrates to rethink their actions. In the aftermath of the earthquake, they decided to release the prisoners, realizing the injustice they had done. This change of heart brought relief to the jailer and ultimately led to the freedom of the apostles. The power of God's intervention not only shook the physical foundations but also moved the hearts of those in authority.
