# Acts 16:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Their bold declaration highlights the injustice they suffered publicly and the need for a public reparation. It is important to note that although Paul and Silas were Roman citizens, Paul did not always rely on this privilege when faced with persecution. However, in this case, their Roman citizenship emphasized the severity of their mistreatment, especially since they were foreigners in this particular region. By insisting that the authorities themselves come and escort them out, Paul and Silas not only sought their freedom but also aimed to expose the unlawful nature of their imprisonment, ultimately safeguarding the spread of the Gospel.

3. "It does not follow, because ἐκβάλλω has no such sense in ch. Acts 9:40, &c., that therefore it has not here.
