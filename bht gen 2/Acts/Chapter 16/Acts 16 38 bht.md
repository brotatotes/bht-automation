# Acts 16:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the sergeants relayed the news to the magistrates, their hearts trembled with fear upon learning that the men they had mistreated were Romans. Their fear stemmed not from remorse for the harm they had caused or concern for divine judgment, but rather from the potential consequences of their actions. They realized that their deeds could be scrutinized by the Roman senate, leading to a loss of their positions and personal repercussions. This fear was not rooted in a genuine desire for justice, but rather in self-interest and the preservation of their own power and privilege.
