# Acts 16:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The authorities, who had mistreated the apostles the day before, now approached them in a supplicating manner, urging them to forgive and exit the prison peacefully. The officials, being fearful of the mob's potential change in temperament, complied with the apostles' request to be escorted out. They justified their actions by claiming that it was for the safety of the apostles, attributing the previous events to the uncontrollable rage of the people. In reality, however, their true motivation may have been their own preservation and fear of reprisal.
