# Acts 16:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostles delivered the decrees, which were like laws or edicts, to the churches in the cities they visited. These decrees were given to guide the churches and ensure that they would follow the sentiments and determinations prescribed by the apostles from Jerusalem. Among these determinations were guidelines for the Gentile believers to abstain from things offered to idols, blood, things strangled, and fornication. By delivering these decrees, the apostles aimed to foster unity and peace among the churches and maintain the freedom granted to the Gentile converts.
