# Acts 16:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle Paul, accompanied by Silas and Timothy, was guided by the Spirit of God as they traveled through the vast region of Asia. They first passed through the province of Galatia, known for its mixed population of Gauls and Greeks. However, the Spirit hindered them from preaching the word in Asia at that time. It was not yet the appointed moment for them to proclaim the gospel there. Instead, they faithfully traveled through Phrygia, fulfilling their mission to spread the message of salvation.

### Albert Barnes:

### John Calvin:

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This verse is hotly disputed at every point by the advocates of the North Galatian theory as represented by Chase and the South Galatian theory by Ramsay."
2. "Does Luke mean to use 'of Galatia' in the same ethnographic sense as 'of Phrygia' or does he here add the province (Galatia) to the name of the Region (Phrygia)? In itself either view is possible and it really matters very little."
3. "The only natural meaning of κωλυθεντες is that Paul with Silas and Timothy 'passed through the region of Phrygia and Galatia' because they were hindered by the Holy Spirit from speaking the word in Asia."

### John Gill:
1. "According to Josephus, the original of the Phrygians was Togarmah the son of Gomer, and grandson of Japheth, whom he calls Thygrammes, and his people from him, Thygrammeans, and who, adds he, as it seems by the Greeks, are called Phrygians."
2. "The inhabitants of Galatia were originally Gauls, who under Brennus their captain, came out of some parts of France, and invaded Italy, and came to Rome, and took it all but the capitol."
3. "The reasons why it was prohibited to be preached here, at this time, cannot be said, and must be referred to the sovereign will of God; it seems, that at this instant, there were no chosen ones to be called by grace, and there was work for the apostle and his companions to do elsewhere, namely, in Macedonia."
