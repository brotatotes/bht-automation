# Acts 16:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As the apostle continued his journey, he chose to bypass Mysia, a province of Asia Minor. Their next attempt was to enter Bithynia, but they were prevented by the Holy Spirit. This guidance of the Spirit, referred to as the Spirit of Jesus by some, is significant as it indicates a new direction for the Gospel's spread. Despite the initial hindrance, it is worth noting that Bithynia would later receive the preaching of the Gospel and establish churches. In our own lives, we should not disregard strong impressions or divine guidance that we may not fully understand.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The expression πν. Ἰησοῦ is remarkable, as occurring in all the great MSS., and from its peculiarity bearing almost unquestionable trace of genuineness."
2. "the idea being quite untenable that the word Ἰησοῦ has been inserted here, and no where else, on doctrinal grounds."
3. "If the report of this journey came from an unusual source, an unusual expression would be accountable."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This is the first time that the Holy Ghost is expressly spoken of as determining the course they were to follow in their efforts to evangelize the nations, and it was evidently designed to show that whereas hitherto the diffusion of the Gospel had been carried on in unbroken course, connected by natural points of junction, it was now to take a leap to which it could not be impelled but by an immediate and independent operation of the Spirit."
2. "Though primarily, this intimation of the Spirit was only negative, and referred but to the immediate neighborhood, we may certainly conclude that Paul took it for a sign that a new epoch was now to commence in his apostolic labors."
3. "By the end of the first century, as testified by PLINY the governor, Bithynia was filled with Christians."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Mysia - This was a province of Asia Minor, having Propontis on the north, Bithynia on the east, Lydia on the south, and the Aegean Sea on the west."
2. "They assayed - They endeavored; they attempted."
3. "Into Bithynia - A province of Asia Minor lying east of Mysia."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This journey would take him directly through Phrygia and the North Galatian country (the real Gauls or Celts). This is, to my mind, the strongest argument for the North Galatian view in these verses Acts 16:6; Acts 16:7." 
2. "The grammar and the topography bring Paul right up to Bithynia (north of the old Galatia). It is verses Acts 16:6; Acts 16:7 that make me pause before accepting the plausible arguments of Ramsay for the South Galatian theory." 
3. "But shall we smash Luke's grammar to pieces to bolster up a theory of criticism?"

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle was willing to preach to the wise and unwise, and disdained not to carry the Gospel to the meanest part of mankind."
2. "The Spirit suffered them not; the Alexandrian copy, and Beza's most ancient copy, and some others, and the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Ethiopic versions read, 'the Spirit of Jesus.'"
3. "However, the Gospel was preached here afterward, and churches formed."

### John Wesley:
1. "Coming to Mysia, and passing it by, as being a part of Asia..."
2. "...they attempted to go into Bithynia; but the Spirit suffered them not."
3. "Sometimes a strong impression, for which we are not able to give any account, is not altogether to be despised."
