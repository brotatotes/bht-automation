# Acts 16:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul and his companions continued their journey, passing by Mysia without preaching there. They arrived at Troas, a significant city in Proconsular Asia and a Roman colony. Troas held historical significance as a region associated with the Trojan war. Interestingly, it was once called Antigonia by King Antigonus of Asia. In Troas, they would have the opportunity to take a ship to Philippi, which was their intended destination.
