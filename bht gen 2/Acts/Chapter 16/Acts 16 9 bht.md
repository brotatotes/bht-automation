# Acts 16:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a vision by night, a cry for help came to Paul, not in the form of a dream, but a supernatural revelation. This is distinct from other dreams mentioned in the New Testament. The plea for help was not only directed towards Paul, but it encompassed a larger spiritual battle against the forces of evil, ignorance, and sin.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The vision seems to have appeared in the same way as that sent to Peter in ch. 10. It was an unreal apparition, designed to convey a practical meaning. The context precludes our understanding it as a dream."
2. "Μακεδών] known probably by the affecting words spoken by him. There would hardly be any peculiarity of dress by which a Macedonian could be recognized."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This visional Macedonian discovered himself by what he said. But it was a cry not of conscious desire for the Gospel, but of deep need of it and unconscious preparedness to receive it."
2. "God had left the Gentile peoples to walk in their own ways. They had sought to gain salvation for themselves; but those who had carried it farthest along the paths of natural development were now pervaded by the feeling that all had indeed been vanity."
3. "This voice cries from heathendom still to the Christian Church, and never does the Church undertake the work of missions, nor any missionary go forth from it, in the right spirit, save in obedience to this cry."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The will of God was at different times made known in both these ways."
2. "This was a call to preach the gospel in an extensive pagan land, amid many trials and dangers."
3. "From all portions of the earth a similar call is now coming to the churches."

### John Calvin:
1. "And it is not said that this vision was offered in a dream, but only in the night season. For there be certain night visions which men see when they be awake."
2. "The gospel is the power of God to salvation, those which are the ministers of God are said to help those who perish; that having delivered them from death, they may bring them unto the inheritance of eternal life."
3. "Again, all people unto whom the gospel is brought are taught reverently to embrace the ministers thereof as deliverers, unless they will maliciously reject the grace of God; and yet this commendation and title is not so translated unto men, that God is robbed even of the best part of his praise; because, though he by his ministers give salvation, yet is he the only author thereof, as if he reached out his hands to help."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Twice Paul had been hindered by the Holy Spirit from going where he wanted to go. Most men would have gone back home with such rebuffs, but not so Paul."
2. "A man of Macedonia... Ramsay follows Renan in the view that this was Luke with whom Paul had conversed about conditions in Macedonia."
3. "Help us... It was the cry of Europe for Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "Macedonia was a very large country in Europe; which formerly consisted, as Pliny o says, of a hundred and fifty people, or nations, and was called Emathia."
2. "This shows what a miserable condition this country was in; and that God had some chosen people among them to gather in, whose time was now come."
3. "This angel presided over the whole country, and was their tutelar angel, as some think."

### John Wesley:
1. "A vision appeared to Paul by night — It was not a dream, though it was by night."
2. "No other dream is mentioned in the New Testament than that of Joseph and of Pilate's wife."
3. "Help us — Against Satan, ignorance, and sin."
