# Acts 17:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Paul and Silas traveled from Philippi to Thessalonica, they made their way through Amphipolis and Apollonia. These cities were significant in their own right, but there is no record of Paul preaching in either of them. It is possible that they may have stayed only briefly in these places. It is interesting to note that there is no mention of synagogues in Amphipolis or Apollonia, suggesting that the Jewish community in these cities may have been small or nonexistent. Despite not preaching in these cities, the impact of the gospel still spread from Thessalonica throughout Macedonia and Achaia.

"And toward the nation itself Paul ceaseth not to do his embassage; by which example we are taught, that we ought to make so great account of the calling of God, that no unthankfulness of men may be able to hinder us, but that we proceed to be careful for their salvation, so long as the Lord appointeth us to be their ministers."
