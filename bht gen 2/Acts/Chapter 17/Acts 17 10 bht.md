# Acts 17:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The believers in Thessalonica, the young converts, were full of love and affection towards Paul and Silas, their spiritual fathers. After facing severe persecution, Paul and Silas were sent by the brethren to Berea, under the cover of night, to protect them from the raging mob. There, Paul and Silas continued their mission by going into the synagogue of the Jews, eager to spread the gospel.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The general character of the narrative seems to be, that where Paul, or Paul and Silas, are alone or principally concerned, all mention of the rest is suspended, and sometimes so completely as to make it appear as if they were absent."
2. "I believe Timotheus to have been with them at Thessalonica the first time, because it does not seem probable that Paul would have sent to them one to confirm and exhort them concerning their faith who had not known them before, especially as he then had Silas with him."
3. "Both these facts, especially the last, seeing that the distance from Philippi was 100 Roman miles, make it very improbable that his stay was so short as from three to four weeks: nor is this implied in the text."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It would have been as useless as rash to attempt any further preaching at that time."
2. "The conviction of this probably made his friends the more willing to pledge themselves against any present continuance of missionary effort."

### John Calvin:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The magistrates, dreading a fresh outbreak on the part of these suspected Orientals, and the Christian community knowing the bitter and sleepless hostility of the Jews, determined it was best for the peace and wellbeing of the growing community of believers in Jesus that the great and hated teacher should, for a time at least, absent himself."
2. "Berea. A city of no great fame in history, about sixty miles from Thessalonica. It was a favourite dwelling-place for the Jews. Its modern name is Verria, or Kara-Verria, a corruption of the old appellation, and contains still about 18,000 inhabitants."
