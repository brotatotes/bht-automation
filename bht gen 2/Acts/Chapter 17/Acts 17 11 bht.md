# Acts 17:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bereans were known for their noble disposition and their eagerness to examine and inquire about the word of God. They received the word with open minds and sincere desire to be taught aright, unlike others who rejected it without examination. Their constant searching of the Scriptures demonstrated a rare efficacy and working of the Spirit, enabling them to bear the cross and prioritize the reproach of Christ over worldly glory. The Beroeans' genuine spirit of inquiry and teachability reveal their generosity of soul and their consistent readiness to receive and examine the truth.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Searched. Or examined. See on Luke 23:14.

### John Calvin:
1. "The remembrance of Christ might have been thought to have been buried by the departure of Paul, and surely it is a wonder that that small light, which began to shine, was not quite put out."
2. "Luke saith that they were of the chief families. For the nobility whereof he maketh mention is referred not unto the mind, but unto the nation."
3. "Luke commendeth the rare efficacy and working of the Spirit of God, when he saith that these noblemen were no whit hindered by the dignity of the flesh, but that embracing the gospel, they prepared themselves to bear the cross, and preferred the reproach of Christ before the glory of the world."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is worthy of remark that, even in the brief summary of Paul’s work these ‘Acts’ contain, we can see that the great teacher neither expected nor desired that men should be converted to his Master’s creed without first carefully examining it, and the proofs upon which it was based."
2. "The genuine, honest spirit of inquiry is ever allied to true gospel teaching."
3. "The ‘nobility of soul’ which Paul’s chronicler so highly praised in the men of Berea consisted not merely in their readiness of mind to receive the word, but also in that patient loving spirit of inquiry which led them daily to read the Scriptures to see whether those things Paul told them of were so."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "With all readiness of mind (μετα πασης προθυμιας). Old word from προθυμος (προ, θυμος) and means eagerness, rushing forward." 
2. "The Beroeans were eagerly interested in the new message of Paul and Silas but they wanted to see it for themselves. What a noble attitude. Paul's preaching made Bible students of them."

### John Gill:
1. "The one were more candid, and ingenuous, and open to conviction and susceptive of the word, than the other."
2. "This is to be understood not of the essential word Christ; though as it is true of him, that he is the word, and he is said to be received, and that readily and willingly, so these Bereans did receive him by faith, they believed in him, and made a profession of him."
3. "They were neither backward to hear and receive the word, nor slothful to examine it."
