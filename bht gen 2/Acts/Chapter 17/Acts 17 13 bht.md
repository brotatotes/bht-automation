# Acts 17:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The unbelieving Jews, stirred by the knowledge that the word of God was being preached by Paul, followed him to Berea and agitated the crowds against the apostles. These wicked men, enemies to all laws, both human and divine, sought to undermine the work of God and incite trouble wherever the gospel was proclaimed. Their relentless pursuit of Paul reveals the bitter hatred and opposition faced by the apostles as they faithfully served Christ and advanced His kingdom.
