# Acts 17:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The believers in Berea quickly made arrangements to send Paul away, knowing that he was at risk of being targeted by the Jews who opposed his teachings. They cleverly gave the impression that Paul was heading towards the sea, when in reality he intended to travel to Athens by foot to avoid any harm. Meanwhile, Silas and Timothy stayed behind in Berea to continue supporting and strengthening the new converts in their faith.
