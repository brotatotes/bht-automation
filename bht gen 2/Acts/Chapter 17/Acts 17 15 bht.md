# Acts 17:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Athens, a renowned city of wisdom and learning, known for its great history and cultural contributions, was the destination for Paul's messengers, Silas and Timotheus. It was a city that had witnessed various conquests and changes in power throughout the ages. With the earnest command and purpose to come quickly, they left Paul in Athens and returned to Berea. Their journey was not only for their safe arrival but to ensure that they could join Paul in continuing the important work of spreading the Gospel message.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The course of Timotheus appears to have been, as far as we can follow it from the slight notices given, as follows: when Paul departed from Berœa, not having been able to revisit Thessalonica as he wished (1Th 2:18), he sent Timotheus (from Berœa, not from Athens) to exhort and confirm the Thessalonians, and determined to be left at Athens alone (1Th 3:1), Silas meanwhile remaining to carry on the work at Berœa."
2. "Paul, on his arrival at Athens, sends (by his conductors, who returned) this message to both, to come to him as soon as possible. They did so, and found him (ch. Act 18:5) at Corinth."
3. "Ἀθηνῶν] See a long and interesting description of the then state of Athens, its buildings, &c., in C. and H. chap. 10 vol. i. pp. 407 ff.; and Lewin, i. pp. 268 ff. It was a free city."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He probably wished their company and aid in addressing himself to so new and great a sphere as Athens."
2. "He "waited for them" there, as if unwilling to do anything till they came."
3. "For though Paul himself says to the Thessalonians that he "thought it good to be left at Athens alone," he immediately adds that he "sent Timotheus to establish and comfort them" meaning, surely, that he despatched him from Athens back to Thessalonica."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Athens was the most celebrated city of Greece, and was distinguished for the military talents, the learning, the eloquence, and the politeness of its inhabitants."
2. "No city of Greece, or of the ancient world, was so much distinguished for philosophy, learning, and the arts."
3. "In the revolutions of ages it has been ordered that people should bear the torch of learning to Athens from a land unknown to its ancient philosophers, and convey the blessings of civilization to them by that gospel which in the time of Paul they rejected and despised."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The once famous centre of Greek thought and culture, long the dominant power among the varied states of which ancient Greece was made up, whose name and influence at one time was all-powerful in so many rich and flourishing cities round the Mediterranean coast, in Asia as well as in Europe."
2. "In this quiet still city of memories, wherever he turned he beheld statues of deified heroes, and temples, and sanctuaries of gods. Every god in Olympus, we read, found a place in the 'Agora.'"
3. "Never, in the long and eventful story of the City of the Violet Crown, as Aristophanes termed it, was Athens so empty of all life as it was at that particular juncture."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "To Athens (εως Αθηνων). To make sure of his safe arrival."
2. "That they should come to him with all speed (ινα ως ταχιστα ελθωσιν προς αυτον). Note the neat Greek idiom ως ταχιστα as quickly as possible (good Attic idiom)."
3. "The indirect command and purpose (ινα-ελθωσιν, second aorist active subjunctive) is also neat Greek (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1046)."

### John Gill:
1. "Athens, a city in Achaia, dedicated to the studies of philosophy, which though but one, is always used to be called in the plural number; its haven, called the Piraeum, is described as fortified with seven walls." 
2. "This city has gone through different fates: it was burnt by Xerxes, about 480 years before Christ; some years after that it was taken by Lysander; and after that restored to its ancient liberty by Demetrius; after this the Romans were possessed of it; and now it is in the hands of the Turks, and goes by the name of Setines."
3. "And receiving a commandment; or 'a letter from him' as one copy and the Syriac version read; that is, the brethren from Paul: unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed; to Athens, where he now was: they departed; from Paul at Athens, and came back to Berea."
