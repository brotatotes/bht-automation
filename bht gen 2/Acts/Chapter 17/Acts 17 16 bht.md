# Acts 17:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul's arrival in Athens stirred his spirit deeply. The city was filled with statues and temples to various gods, a sight that troubled him greatly. He recognized the prevalence of idolatry and the binding influence it had on the people. Despite the grandeur of Athens, Paul's concern lay with the souls of those who had turned their affections away from the true and living God. Inspired by his zeal, Paul felt compelled to share the truth and preach, even in an unfamiliar place, without waiting for his companions to arrive.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The multitude of statues and temples to the gods in Athens is celebrated with honour by classic writers of other nations, and with pride by their own."
2. "The strongest perhaps is from Xen. de Repub. Ath [83], who calls Athens ·ΩÖŒªŒ∑ Œ≤œâŒºœåœÇ, ·ΩÖŒªŒ∑ Œ∏·ø¶ŒºŒ± Œ∏ŒµŒø·øñœÇ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ·ºÄŒΩŒ¨Œ∏Œ∑ŒºŒ±."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The first impression which the masterpieces of man's taste for art left on the mind of St. Paul was a revolting one, since all this majesty and beauty had placed itself between man and his Creator, and bound him the faster to his gods, who were not God."
2. "Upon the first contact, therefore, which the Spirit of Christ came into with the sublimest creations of human art, the judgment of the Holy Ghost‚Äîthrough which they have all to pass‚Äîis set up as 'the strait gate,' and this must remain the correct standard for ever."


### Albert Barnes:
1. "His spirit was stirred in him - His mind was greatly excited."
2. "The city wholly given to idolatry - Greek: Œ∫Œ±œÑŒµÃÅŒπŒ¥œâŒªŒøŒΩ kateidoÃÑlon. It is well translated in the margin, 'or full of idols.'"
3. "So should every pious man feel who treads the streets of a splendid and guilty city. The Christian will not despise the productions of art, but he will feel, deeply feel, for the unhappy condition of those who, amidst wealth, and splendor, and outward adoring, are withholding their affections from the living God, and who are going unredeemed to eternal woe."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "We learn from Pliny that at the time of Nero, Athens contained over three thousand public statues, besides a countless number of lesser images within the walls of private houses." 
2. "In one street there stood before every house a square pillar carrying upon it a bust of the God Hermes."
3. "Another street, named the Street of the Tripods, was lined with tripods, dedicated by winners in the Greek national games, and carrying each one an inscription to a deity."

### John Calvin:
1. "The whole world was then full of idols; the pure worship of God could be found nowhere; and there were everywhere innumerable monsters of superstitions."
2. "Whence we gather what man‚Äôs wit can do in matters which concern God... and that man‚Äôs wisdom is nothing else but a shop of all errors."
3. "Paul was wroth when he saw the name of God wickedly profaned, and his pure worship corrupted, he did thereby declare, that nothing was to him more precious than the glory of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The whole aspect of Athens was strangely repugnant to Paul... idolatry was closely bound up with all the pleasures and the occupations of the citizen."
2. "The word here would be translated more accurately, 'full of idols.' The epithet certainly seems to have been singularly appropriate."
3. "Petronius remarks satirically how at Athens one could find a god easier than a man. Pausanias states how Athens had more images than all the rest of Greece put together."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul, like any stranger was looking at the sights as he walked around. This adjective Œ∫Œ±œÑŒµŒπŒ¥œâŒªŒøŒΩ (perfective use of Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ± and ŒµŒπŒ¥œâŒªŒøŒΩ is found nowhere else, but it is formed after the analogy of Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±ŒºœÄŒµŒªŒøœÉ, Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±Œ¥ŒµŒΩŒ¥œÅŒøŒΩ), full of idols."
2. "The idolatry and sensualism of it all glared at him (Romans 1:18-32). Renan ridicules Paul's ignorance in taking these statues for idols, but Paul knew paganism better than Renan."
3. "The superstition of this centre of Greek culture was depressing to Paul. One has only to recall how superstitious cults today flourish in the atmosphere of Boston and Los Angeles to understand conditions in Athens."

### John Gill:
1. "His spirit was stirred in him; not only his soul was troubled and his heart was grieved, but he was exasperated and provoked to the last degree."
2. "He had a burning fire in his bones, and was weary with forbearing, and could not stay; his zeal wanted vent, and he gave it."
3. "They had so many of them, that one jestingly said to them, our country is so full of deities, that one may more easily find a god than a man."

### John Wesley:
1. "Having no design, as it seems, to preach at Athens, but his zeal for God drew him into it unawares, without staying till his companions came."
