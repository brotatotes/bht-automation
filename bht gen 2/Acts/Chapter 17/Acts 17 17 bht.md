## BHT:
The apostle, following his usual practice, entered the place and began preaching the Gospel to the Jews first, before turning his attention to the Gentiles. In his discourse, he engaged in a dispute not about idolatry, which the Athenians were not prone to, but about Jesus as the Son of God and the Messiah. He took the time to converse with the people, discussing religious matters and addressing their idolatry, vanity, and superstition.
