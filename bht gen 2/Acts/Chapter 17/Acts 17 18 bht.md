## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Epicurean philosophy was antagonistic to the gospel, as holding the atomic theory in opposition to the creation of matter, the disconnexion of the Divinity from the world and its affairs, in opposition to the idea of a ruling Providence, and the indissoluble union, and annihilation together, of soul and body, as opposed to the hope of eternal life, and indeed to all spiritual religion whatever."
2. "Their philosophy, while it approached the truth in holding one supreme Governor of all, compromised it, in allowing of any and all ways of conceiving and worshipping Him and contravened it, in its pantheistic belief that all souls were emanations of Him."
3. "The abuse to which such a doctrine was evidently liable, gave rise to a pseudo-Epicureanism, which has generally passed current for the real, and which amply illustrated the truth, that 'corruptio optimi est pessima.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The two enemies it has ever had to contend with are the two ruling principles of the Epicureans and Stoics—Pleasure and Pride."
2. "What will this babbler say?—The word, which means 'a picker-up of seeds,' bird-like, is applied to a gatherer and retailer of scraps of knowledge, a prater; a general term of contempt for any pretended teacher."
3. "A setter forth of strange gods—'demons,' but in the Greek (not Jewish) sense of 'objects of worship.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Both in principle and practice, therefore, they devoted themselves to a life of gaiety and sensuality, and sought happiness only in indolence, effeminacy, and voluptuousness."
2. "They were stern in their views of virtue, and, like the Pharisees, prided themselves on their own righteousness."
3. "They supposed that matter was eternal, and that God was either the animating principle or soul of the world, or that all things were a part of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Epicureans...acknowledged God in words, but denied his providence and superintendence over the world."
2. "Stoics...denied the universal and perpetual immortality of the soul."
3. "Babbler: a bird which picks up seeds in the streets and markets; hence one who picks up and retails scraps of news."

### John Calvin:
1. "For it is not always in our choice to make choice of those with whom we will deal; but the Lord doth often suffer stubborn and importunate men to arise to exercise us, that by their gainsaying the truth may more plainly appear."
2. "And thus must we do, that by refuting meekly and modestly vain cavillings, we may utter that which is sound and true; and we must always avoid this danger, that ambition or desire to show our wit do not unwrap us in superfluous and vain contentions."
3. "Therefore there was in Paul wonderful force of the Spirit, who standing amidst such beasts, which sought to pull him to and fro, stood firm in the sound sincerity of the gospel, and did valiantly withstand and endure, as well the dogged malapertness [petulance] of the former sect, as the pride and crafty cavillings of the other."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Epicurean...believed in no Providence, in no accountability, in neither reward nor retribution in the life to come." 
2. "The ideal life proposed to the disciples of Zeno was a far higher one than the Epicurean ideal, a proud self-denial, an austere apathy, untouched by human passion, unmoved alike by joy or sorrow."
3. "The name of 'Jesus,' whom Paul preached, was to them a new name and strange. Many, perhaps the majority, of the hearers mistook the 'Resurrection' for the name of a goddess, a word that Paul seems to have used frequently."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Both sects were eager for argument and both had disdain for Paul, but they were the two rival practical philosophies of the day, succeeding the more abstruse theories of Plato and Aristotle."
2. "In Epicureanism, it was man's sensual nature which arrayed itself against the claims of the gospel; in Stoicism it was his self-righteousness and pride of intellect."
3. "Paul had the only true philosophy of the universe and life with Jesus Christ as the centre, the greatest of all philosophers."

### John Gill:
1. "The principal tenets of [Epicureanism] were... that the world was not made by any deity, or with any design, but came into its being and form, through a fortuitous concourse of atoms...and that the world is not governed by the providence of God." 
2. "The Stoics...believed that there is but one God, and that the world was made by him, and is governed by fate...that happiness lies in virtue, and virtue has its own reward in itself; that all virtues are linked together, and all vices are equal." 
3. "The reason why they thought the apostle was for bringing in other gods, than which nothing was more foreign from him, was because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection."

### John Wesley:
1. "The apostle levels his discourse at some of the most important errors... gives a plain summary of his own religious principles."
2. "Such is the language of natural reason, full of, and satisfied with itself."
3. "This city was a seminary of philosophers, who have ever been the pest of true religion."
