# Acts 17:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the chosen passage, Paul is brought to the Areopagus, the hill of Mars, where the Athenians held their supreme court of judicature. This was a significant place for a discourse on religious matters, as the hill was dedicated to Mars, the heathen god of war. The Athenian court was known for its fair and impartial decisions, and the judges were esteemed for their integrity. Paul's invitation to speak before this esteemed audience was not a trial, but an opportunity to further expound upon the religious doctrines he had been proclaiming.

2. "For in any other place it had been a crime worthy of death, to speak in the market or in any other public place, having gathered a company of people together; but there, because those who did carry about trifles had liberty granted them to prate, by reason of the immoderate desire they had to hear news, Paul was permitted to intreat of the mysteries of faith, being requested."
