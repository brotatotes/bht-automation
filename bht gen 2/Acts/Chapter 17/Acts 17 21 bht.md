# Acts 17:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Athenians were known for their constant pursuit of new information, as they spent their time telling and hearing some new thing. This desire for novelty was not limited to the Athenians alone, as even strangers and foreigners in the city would engage in the same inquiries. The Athenians' obsession with newness was so pervasive that even the latest news quickly became stale, and they sought out something even newer. This restless pursuit of the latest thing was not unique to the people of Athens, as others, like the Jewish doctors, were also caught up in the same mindset.
