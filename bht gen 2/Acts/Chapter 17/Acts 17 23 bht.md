# Acts 17:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul noticed an altar inscribed with the words TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Some speculate that this altar was the work of Socrates, who, while mocking the polytheistic beliefs of the Greeks, secretly worshipped the one true God. It is possible that the unknown god referred to on this altar was the God of Israel, whose name, Jehovah, was not known to the Gentiles. By drawing attention to this inscription, Paul seizes the opportunity to proclaim an unknown yet not unfamiliar God to these philosophers, redirecting their focus toward the truth.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "καί ] over and above the many altars to your own and foreign deities." 
2. "To an (not, the) unknown God." 
3. "That on the occurrence of any remarkable calamity or deliverance not assignable to the conventionally-received agency of any of the recognized deities, an unknown God was reverenced as their author."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "as I passed by and beheld your devotions—rather, 'the objects of your devotion,' referring, as is plain from the next words, to their works of art consecrated to religion."
2. "Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship—rather, 'Whom, therefore, knowing Him not, ye worship,' alluding to 'The Unknown God.'"
3. "His subject is not, as in the synagogues, the Messiahship of Jesus, but THE LIVING GOD, in opposition to the materialistic and pantheistic polytheism of Greece, which subverted all true religion."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The worship of an idolatrous people will be an object of intense and painful interest to a Christian."
2. "It does not denote that Paul saw them engaged in the act of worship, but that he was struck with the numerous temples, altars, statues, etc., which were reared to the gods, and which indicated the state of the people."
3. "There is remarkable tact in Paul's seizing on this circumstance; and yet it was perfectly fair and honest. Only the true God could deliver in the time of the pestilence. This altar had, therefore, been really reared to him, though his name was unknown."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The compound verb [διερχο. μενος] denotes a very attentive consideration."
2. "The most rational explanation is unquestionably that of those who suppose these altars to have had their origin in the felling of uncertainty...and their consequent desire to avoid the anger of any still unacknowledged God who might be unknown to them."
3. "You are correct in acknowledging a divine existence beyond any which the ordinary rites of your worship recognize; there is such an existence. You are correct in confessing that this Being is unknown to you; you have no just conceptions of his nature and perfections."

### John Calvin:
1. "He said that he brought doctrine concerning an unknown god."
2. "God cannot be worshipped rightly unless he be first made known."

2. "It seems that in the city there were several altars set up in different situations, each with the inscription, ‘To an Unknown God.’"
3. "The Athenians, Paul saw, evidently recognised something Divine which ought to be adored  outside  the known gods. This unknown Deity he proceeded to declare to them."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul was quick to use this confession on the part of the Athenians of a higher power than yet known to them."
2. "By this master stroke he has brushed to one side any notion of violation of Roman law or suspicion of heresy and claims their endorsement of his new gospel, a shrewd and consummate turn."
3. "He has their attention now and proceeds to describe this God left out of their list as the one true and Supreme God."

3. "Thus he fixes the wandering attention of these blind philosophers; proclaiming to them an unknown, and yet not a new God."
