# Acts 17:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage highlights the importance of recognizing the true God, who is the creator of the world. It refutes idolatry and emphasizes the significance of the doctrine of creation in refuting false beliefs. The Old Testament doctrine of creation serves as the foundation for understanding the New Testament doctrine of redemption. By acknowledging God as the creator, we can have a proper understanding of His sovereignty over all things.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "No wonder, that the devil, in order to diffuse idolatry, has blotted out among all heathen nations the recognition of Creation."
2. "The true doctrine of Creation is the proper refutation of all idolatry."
3. "Only on the firm foundation of the Old Testament doctrine of Creation can we rightly build the New Testament doctrine of redemption."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The apostle sets out with a sharp statement of the fact of creation as the central principle of all true religionâ€”not less needed now, against the transcendental idealism of our day."
2. "Seeing he is Lordâ€”or Sovereign. of heaven and earthâ€”holding in free and absolute subjection all the works of His hands; presiding in august royalty over them, as well as pervading them all as the principle of their being."
3. "This thought, so familiar to Jewish ears (1 Kings 8:27; Isaiah 66:1; Isaiah 66:2; Acts 7:48), and so elementary to Christians, would serve only more sharply to define to his heathen audience the spirituality of that living, personal God, whom he 'announced' to them."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The main object of this discourse of Paul is to convince them of the folly of idolatry." 
2. "He speaks of him as the Creator of the world, and thus opposes the opinion that matter was eternal; that all things were controlled by Fate; and that God could be confined to temples."
3. "Lord of heaven and earth - Proprietor and Ruler of heaven and earth. It is highly absurd, therefore, to suppose that he who is present in heaven and in earth at the same time, and who rules over all, should be confined to a temple of an earthly structure, or dependent on man for anything."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word is used here in the classical sense of the visible creation, which would appeal to the Athenians."
2. "Paul's statement strikes at the belief of the Epicureans, that the world was made by 'a fortuitous concourse of atoms,' and the Stoics, who denied the creation of the world by God."
3. "Made with hands. Probably pointing to the magnificent temples above and around him. Paul's epistles abound in architectural metaphors."

### John Calvin:
1. "For this is the true rule of godliness, distinctly and plainly to know who that God whom we worship is."
2. "Hereby it came also to pass, that one temple was more holy than another. They ran to Delphos that they might fetch the oracles of Apollo thence. Minerva had her seat and mansion at Athens. Now we see that Paul doth touch that false opinion, whereby men have always been deceived; because they feigned to themselves a carnal God."
3. "Only he useth middle signs and tokens, whereby he doth insinuate himself with slow men, until they may ascend into heaven by degrees (and steps)."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "...the remarkable reminiscence of the dying speech of Stephen before the Sanhedrim, which the Pharisee Saul must have listened to, and which so powerfully influenced his future life."
2. "These words, uttered in full view of the magnificent fanes of the gods of which Athens was so proud, must have rung with a strange emphasis on the ears of the listening Areopagites."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The one God who made the Universe... all the details in the universe were created by this one God."  
2. "This one God was not to be confounded with any of their numerous gods save with this 'Unknown God.'"  
3. "Dwelleth not in temples made with hands... Stephen denied that God dwelt alone in the temple in Jerusalem."

### John Gill:
1. "God that made the world, and all things therein... condemns both the notion of the Epicurean philosophers, who denied that the world was made by God... and the notion of the Peripatetics, or Aristotelians, who asserted the eternity of the world."
2. "Seeing that he is the Lord of heaven and earth... supports them in their being, and governs all creatures in them by his providence."
3. "Dwelleth not in temples made with hands... but he dwells in temples that are not made with hands, as in the temple of Christ's human nature... and in the hearts of his people, who are the temples of the Holy Ghost."

### John Wesley:
1. God who made the world â€” Thus is demonstrated even to reason, the one true, good God; absolutely different from the creatures, from every part of the visible creation.
