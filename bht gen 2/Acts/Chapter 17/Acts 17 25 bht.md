# Acts 17:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The worship of God is not about meeting His needs, for He is self-sufficient and requires nothing from us. This distinguishes the true worship of the one true God from the ceremonial worship offered to false gods. The God Paul proclaims is not only the Creator but also the Preserver of all things. He is the source of life itself, including the breath that fills our lungs. Our dependence on God is absolute, as we live, move, and find our being in Him.

2. "He is the Preserver, as well as the Creator, of all; and all things come to us from Him." 
3. "There is a verse in 2Ma 14:35, remarkable, as compared with the thoughts and words of Paul here: σύ, κύριε, τῶν ὅλων ἀπροσδεὴς ὑπάρχων, εὐδοκήσας ναὸν τῆς σῆς κατασκηνώσεως ἐν ἡμῖν γενέσθαι."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "The Giver of all cannot surely be dependent for aught upon the receivers of all. This is the culminating point of a pure Theism."

### Albert Barnes:

### John Calvin:
1. "The faithful did never properly place the worship of God in ceremonies; but they did only count them helps wherewith they might exercise themselves according to their infirmity."
2. "God himself saith plainly in many places, that he doth not pass for any external or visible thing, that ceremonies are of themselves of no importance, and that he is worshipped no otherwise but by faith, a pure conscience, by prayer and thankfulness."
3. "For whereas he saith, that alms and the duties of love are sweet-smelling sacrifices, that must be distinguished from the matter which we have now in hand, where Paul doth only intreat of the ceremonies which the unbelievers put in place of the spiritual worship of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Paul’s words were the outcome of a mind steeped in the often-repeated reminders and reproaches of the prophets, that the God of Israel was not to be worshipped with sacrifice and incense, but with a pure, noble life."
2. "The higher minds among the Epicurean teachers, rising above the popular notion of worship, grasped this lofty conception, which the old Hebrew prophets so nobly set forth, of Deity being above the loves and passions of mortals, dwelling in a sphere far removed from earth and earthly needs."
