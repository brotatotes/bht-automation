# Acts 17:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The purpose of our existence on Earth was for us to seek God and come to know His existence and character. However, many fail to recognize Him due to ignorance and wickedness. God desires to reveal Himself and is not far from any of us, but sin blinds us. We must diligently search for God, for He is ready to be found. Even though our understanding may be limited and we may grope in the dark, we must realize that God is near and accessible to us.
