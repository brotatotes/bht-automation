# Acts 17:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In him, we find our constant and necessary dependence, for we exist and thrive because of his presence within us. This truth speaks to the intimate connection we have with God, who is the ultimate source of our being and the force behind all our actions. It is a reminder of our reliance on the divine, a theme that resonates in both philosophy and theology. These words even echo a hymn from ancient times that celebrated the supreme being, illustrating the universal nature of this understanding of our relationship with God.

3. "But as it giveth the same Spirit divers names because of his manifold graces, so no marvel if the word sons be diversely taken. All mortal men are called sons in general, because they draw near to God in mind and understanding; but because the image of God is almost blotted out in them, so that there appear scarce any slender lines, [lineaments,] this name is by good right restrained unto the faithful."
