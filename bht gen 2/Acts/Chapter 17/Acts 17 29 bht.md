# Acts 17:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As children of God, we should not diminish the divine nature by comparing it to lifeless images made of gold, silver, or stone. If even we, as his creation, surpass the work of human art, then surely God, the creator of humanity and all things, cannot be equated to such things. Not only are these images unworthy of representing God, but they lack any resemblance or connection to him. We must remember that God is far greater and more noble than anything we can conceive or create.
