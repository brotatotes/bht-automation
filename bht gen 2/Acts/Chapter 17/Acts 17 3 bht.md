# Acts 17:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle Paul, like Jesus, opened and explained the Scriptures of the Old Testament, giving the true sense and making it clear that Jesus of Nazareth fulfilled all that was spoken of the Messiah. By preaching and arguing from Scripture and his own experience, he demonstrated that Jesus was the only Savior and Redeemer of lost sinners.

(3) For the same reason, his resurrection from the dead proved that he was the Messiah."
