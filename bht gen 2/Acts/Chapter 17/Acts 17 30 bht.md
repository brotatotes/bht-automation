# Acts 17:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the past, God did not punish the ignorance and idolatry of the nations, but rather overlooked their actions. He allowed them to continue in their spiritual darkness and degradation. However, a new era has dawned, where God no longer tolerates such ignorance. Now, it is his command for all people, everywhere, to repent. This is not just a suggestion or invitation, but a solemn duty that every person must fulfill. It is a call to turn away from sin and turn towards God, embracing the message of repentance and receiving forgiveness through Jesus Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In this word lie treasures of mercy for those who lived in the times of ignorance." 
2. "God overlooked them: i.e. corrected not this ignorance itself as a sin, but the abuses even of this, by which the heathen sunk into deeper degradation."
3. "The genuine reading gives the emphatic πάντας πανταχοῦ, following on the foregoing assertion of Acts 17:25-26, its proper place."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The times of this ignorance God winked at, that is, bore with, without interposing to punish it, otherwise than suffering the debasing tendency of such worship to develop itself."
2. "A new light was risen upon the world."
3. "That duty—all along lying upon man estranged from his Creator, but hitherto only silently recommending itself and little felt—is now peremptory."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "God passed over those times without punishing them, as if he did not see them... he suffered the nations to live without coming forth in direct judgment against them."
2. "The barrier was broken down, and the call to repentance was sent abroad into all the earth."
3. "If God commands all people to repent, we may observe: That it is their duty to do it... It can be done... It is binding on all... It must be done, or the soul lost... We should send the gospel to the pagan."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Winked at [υπεριδων] . Only here in New Testament. Originally, to overlook; to suffer to pass unnoticed. So Rev., overtooked.

### John Calvin:
1. "Men went astray so long therefore, because God did not reach out his hand from heaven, that he might bring them back again into the way."
2. "It may seem an inconvenient [a strange] thing, that men endued with reason and judgment should err so grossly and filthily in a most weighty matter. But Paul’s meaning is, that men do never make an end of erring, until God do help them."
3. "Therefore, so oft as the voice of the gospel doth sound in our ears, let us know that God doth exhort us unto repentance."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The English translation of the Greek word υ ̔ περιδω ̀ ν, winked at, utterly fails to give the sense of the original, which should be rendered ‘having overlooked.’"
2. "God had allowed those ages of ignorance to pass by without any special revelation or stern rebuke."
3. "He had left them alone to the teachings of nature and the promptings of their own consciences; but now the time of forbearance was over, now He called men to repentance, to a change of mind and heart."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The times of ignorance (τους χρονους της αγνοιας). The times before full knowledge of God came in Jesus Christ."
2. "God has all the time objected to the polytheism of the heathen, and now he has made it plain."
3. "All is changed now that Christ has come with the full knowledge of God."

### John Gill:
1. "He despised this, and them for it, and was displeased and angry with them; and as an evidence of such contempt and indignation, he overlooked them, and took no notice of them, and gave them no revelation to direct them..."
2. "He hath given orders, that the doctrine of repentance, as well as remission of sins, should be preached to all nations, to Gentiles as well as Jews..."
3. "Repentance being represented as a command, does not suppose it to be in the power of men, or contradict evangelical repentance, being the free grace gift of God, but only shows the need men stand in of it, and how necessary and requisite it is..."

### John Wesley:
1. "God overlooked — As one paraphrases, 'The beams of his eye did in a manner shoot over it.' He did not appear to take notice of them, by sending express messages to them as he did to the Jews." 
2. "But now — This day, this hour, saith Paul, puts an end to the Divine forbearance, and brings either greater mercy or punishment."
3. "Now he commandeth all men every where to repent - There is a dignity and grandeur in this expression, becoming an ambassador from the King of heaven."
