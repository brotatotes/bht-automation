# Acts 17:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The doctrine of the resurrection of the dead seemed incredible and absurd to the Greeks, who mocked and ridiculed the teachings of Christianity. Paul, in his speech, demonstrated prudence and tact by not needlessly offending his hearers, and even recognized their piety towards their gods. He showed wisdom in using the inscription to the unknown God and citing their own poets. Despite the mockery and rejection, there were some who were willing to hear more and consider the possibility of the resurrection. However, many still took offence at this central teaching, denying it because of their pride and reason.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Perhaps here, 'when they heard of a resurrection of dead men,' viz. of that of Christ, νεκρῶν being generic."
2. "I would rather take them here to mean that they inferred the general possibility of the resurrection of the dead, as a tenet of Paul’s, from the one case which he mentioned."
3. "The hearing not having taken place is no proof that it was not intended at the time: and the distinction between these and the mockers seems to imply that they were in earnest."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Resurrection, which presupposes the vanity of the present life, and is nothing but life out of the death of all that sin has blighted, could have no charm for the true Greek."
2. "It gave the death blow to his fundamental and most cherished ideas; nor until these were seen to be false and fatal could the Resurrection, and the Gospel of which it was a primary doctrine, seem otherwise than ridiculous."
3. "They probably, like Felix, feared to hear more, lest they should be constrained to believe unwelcome truths."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The doctrine of the resurrection of the dead was believed by none of the Greeks; it seemed incredible; and they regarded it as so absurd as not to admit of an argument."
2. "It has not been uncommon for even professed philosophers to mock at the doctrines of religion, and to meet the arguments of Christianity with a sneer."
3. "People who defer inquiry on the subject of religion seldom find the favorable period arrive. Those who propose to examine its doctrines at a future time often do it to avoid the inconvenience of becoming Christians now, and as a plausible and easy way of rejecting the gospel altogether, without appearing to be rude, or to give offence."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In this remarkable speech of Paul are to be noted: his prudence and tact in not needlessly offending his hearers; his courtesy and spirit of conciliation in recognizing their piety toward their gods; his wisdom and readiness in the use of the inscription 'to the unknown God,' and in citing their own poets" 
2. "His meeting the radical errors of every class of his hearers, while seeming to dwell only on points of agreement; his lofty views of the nature of God and the great principle of the unity of the human race"
3. "His boldness in proclaiming Jesus and the resurrection among those to whom these truths were foolishness; the wonderful terseness and condensation of the whole, and the rapid but powerful and assured movement of the thought."

### John Calvin:
1. "By this we see how great the carelessness of men is, whom neither the tribunal-seat of God, nor the majesty of the highest [supreme] Judge, doth make afraid."
2. "Though the wicked do laugh and mock, yet this doctrine, which they go about to make of none effect, shall so gird them, that they shall at length perceive that they have striven in vain with their snare."
3. "And yet Paul’s sermon was not altogether without fruit; because there were some of the hearers which were desirous to profit and go forward."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Some mocked, and others said, We will hear thee again of this matter." 
2. "The mockers... prevailed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They had listened with respect till Paul spoke of the actual resurrection of Jesus from the dead as a fact, when they did not care to hear more."
2. "In contempt at Paul's statement they declined to listen further to 'this babbler' (verse Acts 17:18) who had now lost what he had gained with this group of hearers."
3. "It is a sad story--the noblest of ancient cities and the noblest man of history--and he never cared to look on it again."
