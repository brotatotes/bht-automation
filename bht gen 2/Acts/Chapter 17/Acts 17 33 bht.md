# Acts 17:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
So Paul, having faced scoffing and ridicule from some, departed from the Areopagus. While the audience was divided in their judgment of his message, there seemed to be little hope of real success in that moment. It was a departure marked by mixed reactions and uncertain outcomes.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

### Albert Barnes:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In the lofty and serene Deity who disdained to dwell in the earthly temple and needed nothing from the hand of man, the Epicurean might almost suppose that he heard the language of his own teacher."
2. "But the next sentence which asserted the providence of God as the active creative energy, as the conservative, the ruling, the ordaining principle, annihilated at once the atomic theory and the government of blind chance to which Epicurus ascribed the origin and preservation of the universe."
3. "It is interesting to remember that Paul was alone at Athens, and that therefore the report of the speech must have been given to the writer of the â€˜Actsâ€™ by the apostle himself."
