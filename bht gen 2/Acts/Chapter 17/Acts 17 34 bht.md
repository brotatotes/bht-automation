# Acts 17:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Dionysius the Areopagite, one of the judges of the court in Athens, was among those who believed in the Gospel. It is important to note that there have been later false writings attributed to him, which are filled with empty and nonsensical ideas. These writings should not be regarded as genuine or reliable.

2. "The writings which go by his name are undoubtedly spurious."
3. "Not, as Chrys., de Sacerd. iv. 7, vol. i. p. 412, seems to infer from the form of the expression, ἠκολούθησεν αὐτῷ μετὰ τῆς γυναικός, the wife of Dionysius: this would have been ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The conversion of one man was worth the labor of Paul, and that conversion might have had an extensive influence on others."
2. "Christians, amidst the splendor and gaieties of such cities, should have their hearts deeply affected in view of the moral desolations of the people."
3. "A discourse, even in the midst of such wickedness and idolatry, may be calm and dignified; not an appeal merely to the passions, but to the understanding."
