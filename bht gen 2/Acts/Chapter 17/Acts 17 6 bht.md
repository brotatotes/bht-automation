# Acts 17:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The accusations against the apostles suggest that Christianity had caused chaos and disruptions everywhere they went, leading to a complete failure. However, it is important to note that Christianity indeed brings about significant changes and challenges to established religious practices. The apostles' actions are not aimed at causing disorder, but rather to spread the gospel and bring people to a new way of worship. The accusations highlight the revolutionary nature of Christianity and its impact on societies.
