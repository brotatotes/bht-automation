# Acts 17:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The accusation against these Christians, like Paul and Silas, was that they were going against the decrees of Caesar, claiming that there is another king, Jesus. However, it's important to note that this charge was based on false pretenses and misunderstandings. These believers were not advocating for a temporal kingdom or rebelling against earthly authorities; rather, they were proclaiming the spiritual reign of Christ, a kingdom separate from worldly powers. The accusations made against them were rooted in fear and jealousy, as their teachings posed no threat to the Roman Empire or to the authority of Caesar.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "All these people, i.e. Christians, wherever found."
2. "This false charge seems to have been founded on Paul’s preaching much at Thessalonica concerning the triumphant παρουσία of Christ."
3. "He refers to his having often told them of these things, viz. the course, and destruction of Antichrist, by whom these Jews might perhaps misrepresent Paul as designating Cæsar."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "All do contrary to the decrees of Cæsar, &c.—meaning, probably, nothing but what is specified in the next words."
2. "Saying . . . there is another king, one Jesus."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Whom Jason hath received - Has received into his house, and entertained kindly."
2. "These all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar - The charge against them was that of sedition and rebellion against the Roman emperor."
3. "Saying that there is another king - This was probably a charge of mere malignity."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The accusation substituted is that of treason against the emperor; that of which Jesus was accused before Pilate."
2. "The law of treason, by which the ancient legislators of the republic had sought to protect popular liberty from the encroachments of tyranny,... was gradually concentrated upon the emperor alone, the sole impersonation of the sovereign people."
3. "The definition of the crime itself was loose and elastic, such as equally became the jealousy of a licentious republic or of a despotic usurper."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul and Silas sought to erect the kingdom of Christ, which is spiritual."
2. "The Jews catch at the pretense of treason, that they may oppress the innocent with the envy of the crime alone."
3. "If at any time religion enforces us to resist tyrannical edicts and commandments which forbid us to give due honor to Christ, and due worship to God; we may then justly say for ourselves, that we are not rebellious against kings, for they be not so exalted, that they may go about like giants to pull God out of his seat and throne."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The complaint did not touch the real ground of discontent, viz. the supposed injury which the teaching of Paul would do to their religion."
2. "The Jews here charged Paul and his companion with a political offence of a like nature to the crime of which Jesus was accused before Pilate."
3. "The royal state of Christ’s second advent seems to have been a favourite topic with Paul in his preaching in this city."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This was the very charge that the smart student of the Pharisees and Herodians had tried to catch Jesus on."
2. "It is plain that Paul had preached about Jesus as the Messiah, King of the Kingdom of God over against the Roman Empire, a spiritual kingdom, to be sure, but the Jews here turn his language to his hurt as they did with Jesus."
3. "Clearly here in Thessalonica Paul had faced the power of the Roman Empire in a new way and pictured over against it the grandeur of the reign of Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "Whom Jason hath received,.... Into his house in a private manner, and has entertained, contrary to law, which forbids men to receive and entertain persons of seditious principles, and practices..."
2. "These all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar; both the apostle and those with him, and Jason, and the brethren, whom they now had set before the magistrates, who were all of the same sentiments and practices; and which were opposite to the decrees of the Roman emperor, and the Roman senate, who suffered none to be called a king but whom they pleased..."
3. "...there is another king, one Jesus; but then though they said he was a king, yet not a temporal one, but one whose kingdom was spiritual, and not of this world; and therefore asserted nothing contrary to the decrees of Caesar, or what was in the least prejudicial to his worldly interest and glory."
