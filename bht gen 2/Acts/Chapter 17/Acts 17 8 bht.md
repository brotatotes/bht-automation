# Acts 17:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people's envy of the influence of the Jews led them to stir up commotion and alarm. The rulers, in turn, feared the tumult and the potential consequences from the Roman government. Despite there being no disposition to persecute the apostles, the officials and the people were swayed by the representations of the Jews and the mob they had collected. This feeling of insecurity ultimately led to Paul's withdrawal, as they were unable to disprove the charge of treason and were not present to defend themselves.
