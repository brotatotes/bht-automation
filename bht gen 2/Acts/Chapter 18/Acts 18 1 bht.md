# Acts 18:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Corinth was a prominent and opulent Roman city, serving as the capital of Achaia. It was known for its wealth, commerce, and indulgent lifestyle. The city's temples, including one dedicated to Venus, endorsed licentious behavior. Despite these challenging circumstances, the Apostle Paul embarked on the arduous task of establishing a church in Corinth. Through the power of the Spirit, Paul persevered, undeterred by the city's extravagance and immorality. His determination bore fruit, as the Corinthian church flourished and became a steadfast and devoted community, comparable to other renowned Christian centers of the time.
