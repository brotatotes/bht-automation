# Acts 18:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul's stay in Corinth was significant, lasting a year and six months, a lengthy period for the apostle. During this time, he not only preached the Gospel diligently and fearlessly, but he also faced various challenges caused by the pride and ungratefulness of the people. The arduous task of establishing a solid foundation for the church in Corinth was evident, as Paul's two epistles to the Thessalonians were written during this time. It is clear that building the Church is a laborious and time-consuming endeavor, and both teachers and hearers bear responsibility for the progress made.
