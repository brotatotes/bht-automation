# Acts 18:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They falsely accused him of persuading people to worship God in a way that went against the law. This could refer to the Roman law, which prohibited the introduction of new gods without senate approval, or to the Mosaic law. However, these accusations were baseless, as the law of Moses actually pointed towards Christ and instructed the Israelites to listen to him.
