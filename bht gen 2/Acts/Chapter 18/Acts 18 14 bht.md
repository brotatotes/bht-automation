# Acts 18:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Gallio, as a noble Roman, deemed the Christians as dissenters from ancestral superstitions, deserving of tolerant and protective contempt. Thus, if the accusation against Paul involved any wrong or wickedness, he would have considered it seriously. However, Paul was ready to open his mouth in self-defense, for there was no crime implicated in the accusation. In his defense, Paul was prepared to plead his own cause and answer the charges against him, as it would be according to right reason and the judge's duty to hear the case patiently and fairly.
