# Acts 18:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, it is emphasized that engaging in debates over words and names is a futile and contemptible pursuit. The focus is on the significance of the name of Jesus, which holds more weight than any other names or disputes. It is noted that the Christian faith is unique, as human reason tends to shy away from exploring its depths. The underlying message is to prioritize what truly matters and avoid getting entangled in trivial matters or arguments.

1. "The plural expresses contempt: If it is questions, &c.: as we should say, â€˜a parcel of questions.â€™"

2. "Yet Gallio is not worthy to be excused who doth mock the holy law of God together with their curiosity."
3. "For as it behooved him to cut off all occasion of vain contentions in words, so we must, on the other side, know that when the worship of God is in hand, the strife is not about words, but a matter of all other most serious is handled."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If the question turned merely upon a word and upon certain names, Gallio had most likely in Rome or elsewhere heard the name of Jesus, and how the Christians termed Him Christ, the Anointed One, their expected king Messiah."
2. "But as the Roman state records related how this Person had been put to death by the Procurator of Judea, Pilate, the Proconsul looked upon the whole matter as a harmless superstition on the part of Paul and his fellow-Christians."
