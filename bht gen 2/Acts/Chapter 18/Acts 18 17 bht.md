# Acts 18:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The mob, consisting of the Gentiles present, expressed their rage by taking Sosthenes, who was not the same Sosthenes mentioned as the apostle's brother, and beating him. This beating was a result of the Jews' failed attempt to persecute Paul, and Sosthenes, who had caused them trouble before the judgment seat, became the target of their frustration. However, this incident had a positive outcome as Sosthenes himself eventually became a Christian.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Apparently, all the mob, i.e. the Gentile population present."
2. "The carelessness of Gallio about the matter clearly seems to be a further instance of his contempt for the Jews, and indisposition to favour them or their persecution of Paul."
3. "So little did the information against Paul prosper, that the informers themselves were beaten without interference of the judge."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is very improbable that this was the same Sosthenes as the apostle afterwards calls 'his brother'."
2. "And Gallio cared for none of those things—nothing loath, perhaps, to see these turbulent Jews, for whom probably he felt contempt, themselves getting what they hoped to inflict on another."
3. "Religious indifference, under the influence of an easy and amiable temper, reappears from age to age."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Greeks would feel no small measure of indignation at these disturbers of the public peace, and they took this opportunity to express their rage."
2. "By the testimony of ancient writers he was a most mild and amiable man, arid an upright and just judge. There is not the least evidence that he was indifferent to the religion of his country, or that he was of a thoughtless and skeptical turn of mind."
3. "That he did not deem it to be his duty, or a part of his office, to settle questions of a theological nature that were started among the Jews."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Cared for none of these things. Not said to indicate his indifference to religion, but simply that he did not choose to interfere in this case.

### John Calvin:
1. "It is to be thought that he [Sosthenes] was then one of Paul’s companions and advocates."
2. "There is no cause why such unjust dealing should trouble us at this day when we see the miserable Church oppugned on every side."
3. "This looseness must be imputed not so much to the sluggishness of the deputy as to the hatred of the Jewish religion."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The better MSS. simply read, ‘Then all took,’ etc.; the Greeks was a later interpolation."
2. "There is little doubt that ‘all’ refers here to the Gentile or Greek populace, who, ever ready to show their hatred to the Jews dwelling among them, took this opportunity...of venting their dislike upon the Jewish leader."
3. "The utter indifference of these great Roman officials to all religion is well painted in these few words."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Here is violent hostile reaction against their leader who had failed so miserably."
2. "The beating did Sosthenes good for he too finally is a Christian."
3. "Gallio looked the other way with a blind eye while Sosthenes got the beating which he richly deserved."

### John Gill:
1. "These were not the Greeks or Gentiles that were devout persons, or converted to Christianity, and were on the side of Paul, and fell foul on Sosthenes, as being his chief accuser..."
2. "...the profane and unconverted Greeks, who observing that Gallio sent the Jews away, with some resentment and contempt, were encouraged to fall upon the principal of them, and use him in a very ill manner..."
3. "...and Gallio cared for none of these things; which might not be owing to any sluggishness in him, but to an ill opinion he had of the Jews, as being a turbulent and uneasy people..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Then they all took Sosthenes...and beat him."
2. "It seems because he had occasioned them so much trouble to no purpose, before the judgment seat."
3. "And it seems to have had a happy effect. For Sosthenes himself was afterward a Christian."
