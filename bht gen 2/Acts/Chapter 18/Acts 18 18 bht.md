# Acts 18:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After spending a significant amount of time in Corinth, Paul decided to leave and continue his journey, but not before fulfilling a vow he had made. This vow involved shaving his head, as was customary in such situations. Once this was done in Cenchrea, a nearby seaport town, Paul bid farewell to the Corinthian brethren and embarked on his next mission, leaving behind a strong foundation for the flourishing church he had established during his time there.

### Henry Alford:
1. "For, although this vow differed from that of the Nazarite, who shaved his hair at the end of his votive period, in the temple at Jerusalem, and burnt it with his peace-offering (Num 6:1-21), Josephus gives us a description of a somewhat similar one..." 
2. "That he should do so apologetically, to shew that the Apostle still countenanced conformity with the law, is a view which I cannot find justified by any features of this book."
3. "There need be no enquiry what danger can have prompted such a vow on his part, when we recollect the catalogue given by him in 2 Corinthians 11:0."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Paul planted other churches in Achaia (2 Corinthians 1:1)."
2. "In this order the names also occur in 2 Corinthians 1:1- : (according to the true reading); compare Romans 16:3; 2 Timothy 4:19, which seem to imply that the wife was the more prominent and helpful to the Church."
3. "It was probably one made in one of his seasons of difficulty or danger, in prosecution of which he cuts off his hair and hastens to Jerusalem to offer the requisite sacrifice within the prescribed thirty days [JOSEPHUS, Wars of the Jews, 2.15.1]."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A 'vow' is a solemn promise made to God respecting anything."
2. "This vow generally lasted eight days, sometimes a month, sometimes during a definite period fixed by themselves, and sometimes during their whole lives."
3. "In accordance with the custom of the nation, and in compliance with a law which was not wrong in itself, he might have made this vow, not for a time-serving purpose, but in order to conciliate them, and to mitigate their anger against the gospel."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Took his leave [αποταζαμενος] ."
2. "Having shorn his head."
3. "A private vow, such as was often assumed by the Jews in consequence of some mercy received or of some deliverance from danger."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul's constancy appeareth in this, in that he is not driven away with fear, lest he should trouble the disciples."
2. "He had rather sting and nettle them, than by departing minister unto them any new occasion of rage."
3. "When better hope to do good is offered us than we were wont to have, we are drawn unto divers affairs, as it were, by the hand of God, that we may learn to give over ourselves to be governed at his pleasure."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "During this period, after the Proconsul Gallio’s dismissal of the complaint, Paul no doubt worked unhindered by his enemies and laid the foundations of one of the most flourishing churches at Corinth."
2. "There is no doubt that it was Priscilla's influence and powers, not her husband's, which gave the couple a prominent position in the early Christian Church."
3. "St. Paul's early association and training had familiarized him with the old cherished practices, and in seasons of fasting and prayer, he had found special refreshment and help. He was glad when he could show his Jewish brethren that he did not despise the law."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Vindicated as Paul was, there was no reason for haste in leaving, though he usually left after such a crisis was passed."
2. "The participle is masculine and so cannot refer to Priscilla. Aquila comes next to the participle, but since mention of Priscilla and Aquila is parenthetical and the two other participles (προσμεινασ, αποταξαμενος) refer to Paul it seems clear that this one does also."
3. "It is not clear what sort of a vow Paul had taken nor why he took it. It may have been a thank offering for the outcome at Corinth (Hackett)."
