## BHT:
Ephesus, the ancient capital of Ionia and the Roman province of Asia, was renowned for its commerce and the grand temple of Artemis. After returning from Jerusalem, Paul spent three years in Ephesus. It is said that the synagogue may have been outside the town, and Paul may have entered it alone.
