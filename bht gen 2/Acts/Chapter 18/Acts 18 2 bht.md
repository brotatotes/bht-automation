# Acts 18:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The emperor Claudius had commanded all Jews, regardless of their religious beliefs, to depart from Rome. This edict was likely a response to the constant disputes between the Jews and Christians. Aquila and Priscilla, who were Jewish by birth, were among those affected, finding themselves in a time of uncertainty. However, the apostle Paul sought them out and stayed with them, indicating a strong bond. Despite the challenging circumstances, this Christian friendship endured and was a testament to their faith.

3. "The estate of that nation was then very miserable, so that it is a wonder that they did not almost all depart from the worship of God.
