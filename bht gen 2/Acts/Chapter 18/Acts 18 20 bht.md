# Acts 18:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jews, stirred up by the successful preaching of the gospel, rarely opposed it. However, in Ephesus, there was a disposition to receive the gospel, perhaps because it was one of the churches founded by Paul himself. When the people there asked him to stay longer, either Aquila and Priscilla or the Jews with whom he had reasoned, Paul did not consent. He did not grant their request, likely because he had already fulfilled his promise and had no further knowledge to impart or because he wanted to confound their attempts to challenge him.
