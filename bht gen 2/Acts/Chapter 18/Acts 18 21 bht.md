# Acts 18:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
I must keep this feast that comes in Jerusalem, not out of any religious obligation, but because it provided Paul with the opportunity to reach a large number of his fellow Israelites. Although he expressed his intention to return, Paul recognized that his plans were ultimately subject to God's will. And so, with his mind set on spreading the Gospel and meeting his people, Paul sailed from Ephesus towards Jerusalem, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The omission of the words here inserted in rec., δεῖ με πάντως τὴν ἑορτὴν τὴν ἐρχομένην ποιῆσαι εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα, seems necessitated on the principle of being guided in doubtful cases by the testimony of our most ancient MSS."
2. "Not at the Passover: for the ordinary duration of the ‘mare clausum’ was (Livy xxxvii. 9) till the vernal equinox."
3. "It remains, then, that the feast should have been Pentecost; at which Paul also visited Jerusalem, ch. Acts 20:16."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 21. I must . . . keep this
	feast—probably Pentecost, presenting a noble opportunity of
	preaching the Gospel. 
	but I will return—the
	fulfilment of which promise is recorded in  :-.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Why he was so anxious to celebrate that feast at Jerusalem, the historian has not informed us."
2. "It is probable, however, that he wished to meet as many of his countrymen as possible, and to remove, if practicable, the prejudices which had everywhere been raised against him."
3. "Perhaps, also, he supposed that there would be many Christian converts present, whom he might meet also."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem. The best texts omit.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "If God will. This expression occurs also in 1 Corinthians 4:19; 1 Corinthians 16:7; James 4:15. Such phrases were common among Jews, Greeks, and Romans, and are today. It is simply a recognition that we are in God's hands."
2. "The Textus Receptus has here a sentence not in the best MSS.: 'I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem.' This addition by D and other documents may have been due to a desire to give a reason for the language in verse Acts 18:22 about 'going up' to Jerusalem."
3. "Whether Paul said it or not, it was in the spring when he made this journey with a company of pilgrims probably going to the feast of Pentecost in Jerusalem. We know that later Paul did try to reach Jerusalem for Pentecost (Acts 20:16) and succeeded."

### John Gill:
1. "I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem...either because of his vow or because he knew he should have an opportunity of preaching the Gospel to great numbers." 
2. "I will return again unto you, if God will...as knowing that he was altogether subject to the will of God, who disposes and orders all things according to his sovereign pleasure."
3. "He sailed from Ephesus...which was near the Aegean sea."

### John Wesley:
1. "This was not from any apprehension that he was obliged in conscience to keep the Jewish feasts; but to take the opportunity of meeting a great number of his countrymen to whom he might preach Christ, or whom he might farther instruct, or free from the prejudices they had imbibed against him."
2. "But I will return to you."
3. "So he did, Acts 19:1."
