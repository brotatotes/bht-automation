# Acts 18:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Upon arriving at Jerusalem, the apostle Paul first went up and greeted the church, as was his custom. This visit to the mother church of Christianity was not a lengthy one, perhaps because the events did not unfold as he had expected. After expressing his affection and regard for the believers in Jerusalem, Paul left and made his way to Antioch. This journey included strengthening all the disciples he encountered, demonstrating his commitment to the founding of various churches. Ultimately, his second missionary journey came to an end, consuming approximately three years of his ministry.
