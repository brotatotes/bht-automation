# Acts 18:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Apollos, filled with fervor, possessed a deep understanding of the gospel, having been instructed in the way of the Lord. His ministry was marked by affection, warmth, and liveliness, as he spoke freely and taught diligently. While he had knowledge of the baptism of John, his understanding of Christ's doctrine was not yet complete, as he had not yet grasped the significance of the Cross, the Resurrection, and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The mistake of supposing that he did not know Jesus to be the Messiah, has arisen from the description of his subsequent work at Corinth, Acts 18:28, but by no means follows from it: this he did before, but not so completely."
2. "The same mistake has led to the alteration of Ἰησοῦ into the κυρίου of the rec., it having been well imagined that he could not teach ἀκριβῶς τὰ π . τοῦ Ἰησοῦ if he did not know him to be the Messiah."
3. "ἐπιστ. . μόνον] Meyer well remarks, that it is not meant that he was absolutely ignorant of the fact of there being such a thing as Christian baptism, but ignorant of its being anything different from that of John: he knew, or recognized in baptism only that which the baptism of John was: a sign of repentance."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He was instructed, probably, by some disciple of the Baptist, in the whole circle of John's teaching concerning Jesus, but no more: he had yet to learn the new light which the outpouring of the Spirit at Pentecost had thrown upon the Redeemer's death and resurrection."
2. "His heart warm, and conscious, probably, of his gifts and attainments, he burned to impart to others the truth he had himself received."
3. "He spake and taught diligently—rather, 'accurately' (it is the same word as is rendered 'perfectly' in Acts 19:3)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He had correct views of the Messiah to come - views which he had derived from the study of the Old Testament. He was expecting a Saviour that would be humble, obscure, and a sacrifice."
2. "Being fervent in the spirit - Being zealous and ardent."
3. "Defended with zeal and earnestness his views of the Messiah."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Fervent, which is formed from the participle of the Latin ferveo, to boil or ferment, is an exact translation of this word, which means to seethe or bubble, and is therefore used figuratively of mental states and emotions."
2. "Accurately; so far as his knowledge went. The limitation is given by the words following: knowing only the baptism of John."
3. "The kindred verb, inquired diligently, Matthew 2:7, where Rev. renders learned carefully/y."

### John Calvin:
1. "Nevertheless, these two agree very well together; that he understood the doctrine of the gospel, because he both knew that the Redeemer was given to the world, and also was well and sincerely instructed concerning the grace of reconciliation."
2. "Surely, seeing that he carried the light before Christ, and did highly extol his power, his disciples are for good causes said to have had knowledge of Christ."
3. "Doctrine without zeal is either like a sword in the hand of a madman, or else it lieth still as cold and without use, or else it serveth for vain and wicked boasting."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The grand thought, that the dwellers in the countless isles of the Gentiles, too, were now fellow-heirs of the kingdom, was a thought which never occurred to one trained like Apollos."
2. "A short intercourse with souls like Priscilla and Aquila, on whom a portion of Paul’s broad generous spirit had fallen, threw a flood of light into the heart of Apollos."
3. "He spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord. Or, as in the more ancient authorities, 'the things concerning Jesus.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Being fervent in spirit (ζεων τω πνευματ)... Boiling like boiling water or yeast." 
2. "He taught accurately what he knew, a fine gift for any preacher."
3. "Apollos knew only what the Baptist knew when he died, but John had preached the coming of the Messiah, had baptized him, had identified him as the Son of God, had proclaimed the baptism of the Holy Spirit, but had not seen the Cross, the Resurrection of Jesus, nor the great Day of Pentecost."

### John Gill:
1. "This man was instructed in the way of the Lord....and being fervent in the spirit."
2. "His ministry was very affectionate, warm, and lively."
3. "He spake out freely and fully, and taught the people with great industry, and with all the exactness he could."

### John Wesley:
1. "This man had been instructed — Though not perfectly, in the way of the Lord - In the doctrine of Christ."
2. "Knowing only the baptism of John — Only what John taught those whom he baptized, namely, to repent and believe in a Messiah shortly to appear."
