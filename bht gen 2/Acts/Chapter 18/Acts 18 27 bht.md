# Acts 18:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Apollos, driven by the Holy Spirit, desired to go to Achaia to share his newfound light and knowledge. The brethren, recognizing his sincerity and fervor, wrote a letter of introduction to the Corinthians, recommending and commending him. Although Paul himself needed no such letter, Apollos greatly contributed to the believers in Achaia, encouraging and strengthening their faith through the gracious gift he possessed. His unique ability to engage with the Jews made him particularly effective in convincing them. Ultimately, it is the grace of God that empowers and enables any gift to be of value to others.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "After προτρεψ . not Apollos, but the disciples (at Corinth) must be understood as an object."  
2. "It may have been from their account of the Corinthian church, that he was desirous to go to Achaia."
3. "His coming was a valuable assistance to the Christians against the Jews, in the controversies which had doubtless been going on since Paul’s departure."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "We had not before heard of such gathered at Ephesus. But the desire of the Jews to whom Paul preached to retain him among them for some time and his promise to return to them seem to indicate some drawing towards the Gospel, which, no doubt, the zealous private labors of Priscilla and Aquila would ripen into discipleship."
2. "Wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him—a beautiful specimen of 'letters of recommendation'; by which, as well as by interchange of deputations, &c., the early churches maintained active Christian fellowship with each other."
3. "When he was come, helped them much—was a great acquisition to the Achaian brethren."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He had heard of the success of Paul there; of the church which he had established; of the opposition of the Jews; and it was doubtless with a desire to establish that church, and with a wish to convince his unbelieving countrymen that their views of the Messiah were erroneous" 
2. "Many of the Greeks at Corinth were greatly captivated with his winning eloquence and his going there was the occasion of some unhappy divisions that sprung up in the church."
3. "Paul was superior to envy, and that great success by one minister need not excite the envy, or alienate the confidence and good will of another."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Encouraged him. I prefer the former. Hackett very sensibly remarks that Apollos did not need encouragement, as he was disposed to go." 
2. "He threw himself into the work along with them."
3. "I prefer the latter, principally for the reason urged by Meyer, that 'the design of the text is to characterize Apollos and his work, and not those who believed.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "For it had been an absurd thing to entreat a man to depart to another place, whose faithful industry they already used, and did know that they should have need of him afterward, unless there had been some better recompense offered."
2. "This is holy commendation indeed, when we study to extol every good man with our testimony and consent, [suffrage,] lest the gifts of the Holy Ghost, which he hath given to every man for the edifying of the Church, lie buried."
3. "Furthermore, Luke seemeth to note that the brethren were helped with this stoutness and constancy, when as he saith that he disputed publicly with the Jews. For this was a sign of zeal and boldness not to fly the light."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He felt that there was a great work for him to do."
2. "These letters of commendation...guaranteed at once his soundness in the faith and his personal character."
3. "The real assistance...was owing neither to his winning eloquence nor deep learning, but to the grace of God, to the Divine influence."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Since Apollos wanted to go into Achaia, the brethren wrote a letter of introduction to the disciples in Corinth to receive him, a nice letter of recommendation and a sincere one also." 
2. "But Paul will refer to this very letter later and observe that he himself needed no such letter of commendation." 
3. "Priscilla and Aquila were well known in Corinth and their approval would carry weight."

### John Gill:
1. "What disposed him to go thither, after he had received a greater degree of light and knowledge, was no doubt that he might communicate it, to the good of others, to which he was moved by the Holy Ghost."
2. "he greatly helped and contributed much to the advantage of the believers in those parts; as to the encouragement of their faith, and the increase of the joy of it; for the quickening, and comforting, and establishing them in the truths and doctrines of the Gospel."
3. "faith is not of nature, nor the produce of man's free will, but is the gift of God's grace; it is a fruit of electing grace, an instance of distinguishing grace, it is owing to efficacious grace, and comes along with effectual calling grace, through the word preached, the means of grace; and is supported and maintained by the grace of God."

### John Wesley:
1. "It is through grace only that any gift of any one is profitable to another."
2. "Apollos did not plant, but water. This was the peculiar gift which he had received."
3. "He was better able to convince the Jews, than to convert the heathens."
