# Acts 18:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Apollos, equipped with his extensive knowledge of the Scriptures, was able to powerfully convince and confute his opponents. With forceful arguments supported by relevant passages, he left no room for objection or rebuttal. Apollos' expertise in the Old Testament allowed him to demonstrate convincingly that Jesus is the long-awaited Messiah. He skillfully used the Scriptures to overthrow opposing arguments, leaving his hearers without a valid response. Apollos' ministry greatly complemented the work of Paul, strengthening the faith of the Corinthian believers and building upon the solid foundation that had already been established.
