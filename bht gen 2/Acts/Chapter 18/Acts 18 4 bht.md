# Acts 18:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On the Sabbath day, Paul went to the synagogue and took the opportunity to reason with those present about Christ. He spoke to them about the Scriptures, explaining the person and offices of Christ, as well as his incarnation, obedience, sufferings, and death, and the redemption and salvation that come through him. Paul's diligence and determination are evident as he diligently preached Christ to both Jews and Greek proselytes who attended the synagogue, leading some of them to be convinced and embrace his message.
