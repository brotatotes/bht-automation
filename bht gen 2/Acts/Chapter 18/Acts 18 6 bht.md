# Acts 18:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Paul encountered resistance from the Jews, he symbolically shook off his raiment, denouncing their rejection of the truth. He made it clear that they would bear the responsibility for their own destruction. In response, Paul declared his innocence, having fulfilled his duty to preach the gospel. Although he chose to focus on the Gentiles, Paul did not sever all ties with the Jews, continuing to teach them outside the synagogue. This episode serves as a reminder to guard against wicked desires and to heed the consequences of resisting the truth.
