# Acts 18:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul departed from the synagogue and started going to the house of a Gentile proselyte named Justus, showing his separation from the Jews. Justus' house, being close to the synagogue, allowed Paul to attract a mixed audience and provide a more familiar space for engaging with Gentiles. From this moment, conversions increased rapidly, leading to the growth of the Christian faith.
