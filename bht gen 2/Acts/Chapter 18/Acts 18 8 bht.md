# Acts 18:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The conversion of Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, and many others in Corinth played a significant role in the growth of the Christian faith in the city. The gospel proved its power by transforming sinners in a place as immoral as Corinth. The fact that whole families, such as Crispus and his household, embraced the faith demonstrated the widespread impact of the gospel. The establishment of the church in Corinth, which endured for generations, was built on the belief and baptism of those who were deeply impacted by the powerful preaching of the word of God.
