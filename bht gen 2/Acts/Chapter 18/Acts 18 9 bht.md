# Acts 18:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do not be afraid; it is likely that both Jews and Gentiles were angry after the baptisms in Corinth, and Paul may have considered leaving or hiding. However, the Lord appears to him, telling him to not be fearful or silent. Instead, he is to speak boldly and not let fear hinder the preaching of the Gospel.

2. "and might be advised to it by his friends, or at least that he should be incognito, and not be seen publicly: wherefore the Lord appears to him, and bids him not indulge any fears, or conceal himself and be silent,"
