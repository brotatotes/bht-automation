# Acts 19:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Paul arrived in Ephesus, he encountered a group of disciples who were lacking in the deeper understanding and experience of the Christian faith. These individuals, similar to Apollos, seemed to have only been followers of John the Baptist. It is unclear whether they were natives of Ephesus or visitors. However, Paul recognized their incomplete knowledge and guided them towards a fuller understanding of the faith in Jesus Christ. It is evident that their encounter with Paul and the subsequent miracles that occurred in their midst had a profound impact on the growth and strengthening of the Church in Ephesus.

2. "τινας μαθητάς" - These seem to have been in the same situation as Apollos.
3. "They cannot have been mere disciples of John, on account of πιστεύσαντες, which can bear no meaning but that of believing on the Lord Jesus."

1. "While Apollos was at Corinth—where his ministry was so powerful that a formidable party in the Church of that city gloried in his type of preaching in preference to Paul's."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is probable that he remained there a considerable time."
2. "They were evidently in the same situation as Apollos."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Better, as Rev., 'the upper country;' lit., parts or districts."

### John Calvin:
1. "Luke showeth here that the Church of Ephesus was not only confirmed and increased by Paul's return, but also that there was a miracle wrought there, because the visible graces of the Spirit were given to certain rude and new disciples."
2. "Furthermore, it is not known whether they were inhabitants of the city or strangers; neither doth it greatly skill."
3. "It is not to be doubted but that they were Jews, because they had received the baptism of John; also, it is to be thought that they dwelt at Ephesus when Paul found them there."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The word for 'upper' (ανωτερικα) is a late form for ανωτερα (Luke 14:10) and occurs in Hippocrates and Galen. It refers to the highlands and means that Paul did not travel the usual Roman road west by Colossae and Laodicea in the Lycus Valley, cities that he did not visit."
