# Acts 19:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God worked extraordinary miracles through Paul, miracles that were not common or ordinary. These miracles were remarkable and displayed the extraordinary power of God. Even garments taken from Paul were endued with miraculous power. These miracles were not mere coincidences or chance happenings, but were rare and uncommon, showing the visible display of God's power. It is important to note that the miracles performed by Paul were not to be misconstrued as power residing in Paul himself, as some people superstitiously believed. These miracles were a testament to the extraordinary power of God.
