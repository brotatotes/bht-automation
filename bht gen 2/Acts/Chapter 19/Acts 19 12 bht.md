# Acts 19:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle Paul worked miracles by the hands of God, using garments such as handkerchiefs and aprons to convey supernatural healing. These objects served as signs and evidence of the miraculous power given to Paul. The miracles were not based on superstition or magic, but were an exertion of God's direct power, suspending his ordinary laws. God met the people in their ignorance and weakness, using Paul as his instrument to exalt him as the herald of the gospel and lay a strong foundation for his church. Such extraordinary miracles displayed divine power beyond human comprehension.
