# Acts 19:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When it comes to the expulsion of evil spirits, those who rely on their own abilities or rely on superstitions are bound to fail. Satan, the master of deception, cannot be defeated by human wisdom or strength alone. It is only through the power of divine faith that we can hope to overcome his cunning schemes and resist his influence. Therefore, let us trust in the Spirit of God and the power of our faith to confront and conquer the forces of darkness.
