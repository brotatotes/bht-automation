# Acts 19:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
While the specific rank of Sceva remains unclear, his association with the sacerdotal order suggests a high position within the Hebrew hierarchy. However, it is unlikely that he held the esteemed position of high priest given his involvement in the dubious occupation of exorcism. Instead, his affiliation may have been more local, possibly within the synagogue of Ephesus. The fact that his seven sons joined him in this venture reflects the decline of Judaism in a city known for its superstitious practices. Despite their efforts to command demons in the name of Jesus, their lack of genuine authority is evident.
