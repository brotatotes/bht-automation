# Acts 19:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The evil spirit's response reveals a distinction between his knowledge of Jesus and Paul. He acknowledges Jesus as the Son of God, with authority to cast out demons, and recognizes Paul as a servant of the most high God, who also performs miracles. In contrast, the evil spirit questions the identity and authority of those attempting to expel him, recognizing them as outsiders who lack power over evil spirits. Their encounter highlights the spiritual realm, where supernatural forces operate, and the importance of understanding and aligning with God's power.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "No difference between γινώσκω and ἐπίσταμαι must be pressed: the two verbs are apparently used as separating Jesus and Paul, so that they do not stand together in the same category..."
2. "...the One being God in heaven, the other man on earth."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 15. the evil spirit answered, Jesus
	I know—"recognize." 
	and Paul I know—"know
	intimately," in contrast to them, whom he altogether disowns. 
	but who are ye?

### Albert Barnes:

2. "Paul I know - Paul’s power to cast out devils, Acts."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The possessed man, like the Gadarene demoniac of the Gospel, identifying himself with the evil spirits, replied: ‘Jesus, whom ye invoke, I know: I know Him well, and His authority, and His power; and Paul too, the servant of the Highest, I am acquainted with; but who are ye?’" 
2. "They certainly treated the unhappy ones as positively possessed by evil spirits; and on more than one occasion a dialogue was held between the Saviour and the lost spirit. On many grounds we must reject (2)."
3. "We live in a spiritual world; there are powers and agencies around us and within us; and in the case of mental disease especially, it is impossible to say whether the mere derangement of the physical organs or some spiritual disorder is the cause of the disease."
