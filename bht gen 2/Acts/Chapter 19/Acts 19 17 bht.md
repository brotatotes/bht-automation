# Acts 19:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, there is a notable victory over the powers of evil in Ephesus. The miracles performed by Paul in the name of Jesus proved the truth of his teachings and distinguished him from impostors. The fear that fell upon the people and the magnification of the name of Jesus confirmed the power and authority behind his works. It is a reminder that Christ is great in himself and is made even greater when his name is declared and treated as such. Even the malice of the devil can unknowingly contribute to the advancement of the Gospel.
