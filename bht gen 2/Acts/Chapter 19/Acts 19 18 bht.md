# Acts 19:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Upon hearing the word of God, many who believed were moved to openly confess their past deeds, acknowledging the wickedness they had been involved in. These confessions were not forced, but voluntary actions that revealed the inner transformation brought about by the power of God's word. Their sincere repentance demonstrated the genuine work of the Spirit and the undeniable impact of the gospel in their lives.
