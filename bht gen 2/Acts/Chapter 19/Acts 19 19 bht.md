# Acts 19:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Ephesus, there were those who practiced magical arts and tricks, known as curious arts. These practices were highly esteemed and the books that contained their secrets held great value. However, when the people turned to Christ, they renounced these practices and chose to gather their books together and burn them, rather than selling them for profit. This act symbolized their sincere repentance and complete rejection of their former sinful ways, demonstrating their commitment to embrace the truth of the Gospel and leave behind the darkness of magic and deception.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Magical formul√¶, or receipt-books, or written amulets."

3. "The workers of evil were put to scorn, like Baal's priests on Carmel, and the word of God mightily grew and prevailed [HOWSON]."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word used here (œÄŒµœÅŒπÃÅŒµœÅŒ≥Œ± perierga) denotes properly 'those things that require care or skill,' and was thus applied to the arts of 'magic, jugglery, and sleight of hand' that were practiced so extensively in Eastern countries."
2. "Their arts and offenses had been public, and they sought now to undo the evil, as much as lay in their power, as extensively as they had done it."
3. "The value [of the burned books] would be about 8,500 [1,875 British pounds]. The precise value is not material. It was a large sum; and it is recorded to show that Christianity had power to induce people to forsake arts that were most lucrative, and to destroy the means of extending and perpetuating those arts."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Curious arts [œÑŒ± œÄŒµœÅŒπŒµœÅŒ≥Œ±] . The word means, literally, overwrought, elaborate, and hence recondite or curious, as magical practices."

1. "Luke doth not only speak of magical jugglings, but of frivolous and vain studies, whereof the more part of men is for the most part too desirous."
2. "They burn their books, that they may cut off all occasion of erring, both for themselves and for others. And whereas the greatness of the price doth not call them back from endamaging themselves so much, they do thereby better declare the study [zeal] of their godliness."
3. "But because the Grecians take Œ±œÅŒ≥œÖœÅŒπŒøŒΩ for all kind of money, it is uncertain whether Luke doth speak of pence or sestertians."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Many of these nominal Christians, some no doubt by way of trade and commerce, others because they shrank from giving up their old belief in incantation, love philtres, and other dark and superstitious arts, still while worshipping in the assembly of believers in Jesus..." 
2. "These books were, no doubt, parchment or papyrus volumes, filled with these partly Jewish, partly heathenish incantations, recipes for love philtres, formulas more or less ancient to be used in casting out evil spirits, and the like."
3. "These ‚ÄòEphesian letters‚Äô were small slips of parchment in silk bags, on which were written strange cabalistic words and sentences, mysterious and often apparently meaningless. These, men and women were in the habit of carrying about on their persons as charms or amulets to shield them from danger and from harm, or to procure them good fortune in their undertakings."

### John Wesley:
1. "Curious arts ‚Äî Magical arts, to which that soft appellation was given by those who practised them."
2. "Ephesus was peculiarly famous for these. And as these practices were of so much reputation there, it is no wonder the books which taught them should bear a great price."
