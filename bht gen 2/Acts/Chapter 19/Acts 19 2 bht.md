# Acts 19:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul's question about receiving the Holy Ghost when believing refers not to the regenerating and sanctifying grace of the Spirit, but to the extraordinary gifts given by the Spirit. The disciples' response of not even hearing about the Holy Ghost indicates their lack of knowledge regarding the supernatural manifestations and gifts.
