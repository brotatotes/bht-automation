# Acts 19:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The early Christians caused quite a stir with their beliefs and teachings, referred to as the way. This term, which originated from Christ's claim to be the Way, the Truth, and the Life, served as a mutual designation for the disciples before the term Christian became widely used. The doctrines and ordinances of the Gospel grew and prevailed, attracting numerous followers. The excitement and consequences surrounding the way were significant as many people embraced its teachings.
