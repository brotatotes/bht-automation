# Acts 19:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people's belief that the images themselves were gods, as evidenced by their testimonies and reports, emphasizes the impressive influence of Paul's preaching. His success in turning people away from idolatry is further affirmed by the widespread adoption of Christianity in Ephesus and throughout Asia. Demetrius' vehement defense of idol worship reveals the deep attachment and financial interest that the artisans had in their trade. However, the apostle's teachings, supported by reason and revelation, challenged the prevailing beliefs and exposed the idols as mere representations lacking true divinity.
