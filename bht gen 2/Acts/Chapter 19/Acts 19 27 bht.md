# Acts 19:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
There is a significant risk that our trade and the grand temple of the revered goddess Diana will be disparaged and lose their prestige. The magnificence of her worshippers and the influence she holds over not just Asia, but the entire world, is truly remarkable. It is truly lamentable how easily such a grand majesty, capable of commanding the devotion of countless people, can be destroyed.
