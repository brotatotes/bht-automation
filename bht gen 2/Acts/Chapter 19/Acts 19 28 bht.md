# Acts 19:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The goddess in question, often called Diana of the Ephesians, was known for her renowned temple in Ephesus and to distinguish her from other Dianas. The temple also served as a sanctuary, offering protection to those seeking refuge and release from bondage. This declaration of greatness and the loud outcry were likely used to gather and stir up a mob against the apostle and his companion, fueling their anger and resistance.
