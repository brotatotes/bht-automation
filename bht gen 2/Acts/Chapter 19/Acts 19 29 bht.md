# Acts 19:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The mob, comprising of Demetrius and his group, hurriedly went to the theater, which was a place where criminals were usually thrown to the wild beasts. They forcefully took along Gaius and Aristarchus, unable to find Paul. It is likely that their intention was to force them into combat with the wild animals, as some believe Paul had done before.
