# Acts 19:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These believers were asked, Into what were ye baptized? It seems they had received a baptism in the name of John the Baptist. They were followers of him and believed what he taught. However, the apostle Paul recognized that their understanding was incomplete. They had not grasped the significance of being baptized into the name of Jesus Christ. Therefore, it was necessary for them to be baptized again, but this time in the name of Jesus Christ.
