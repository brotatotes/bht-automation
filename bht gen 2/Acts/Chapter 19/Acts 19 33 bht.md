# Acts 19:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jews, seeking to deflect blame, put forward a man named Alexander, possibly a Christian convert or at least accused of being one, to defend themselves against the accusations of causing the tumult. They urged him forward, through the crowd, towards the angry mob, perhaps hoping that by distancing themselves from the disturbance, they would avoid further consequences. Alexander bravely tried to speak in his own defense, holding up his hand to call for silence, but the chaos was too great, and his words were drowned out.
