# Acts 19:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The mob, consumed by their fervent devotion to Diana, were united in their cry: Great is Diana of the Ephesians. Their clamorous confession, though lacking any soundness, arose from an unwavering defense of an error they had embraced. For two hours, their frenzied voices echoed throughout the theater, demonstrating the constancy and zeal of their misguided beliefs. In their relentless shouting, the rioters sought not only to drown out any opposition but also to offer fervent worship to the goddess they believed brought prosperity and riches to Ephesus.
