# Acts 19:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The significance of the town-clerk is highlighted in this passage, as he was the most influential person in Ephesus, responsible for drafting decrees and communicating with the proconsul. His presence brought a temporary calm to the turmoil. The worshipper or νεωκόρον was a temple-sweeper, a lowly position, but it eventually became a title of honor. The questionable origins of the image of Diana, which was believed to have fallen down from Jupiter, further illustrate the power of superstition in the midst of the tumult.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The town-clerk is the keeper of the archives and public reader of decrees, &c., in the assemblies."
2. "The title 'νεωκόρος' is found on inscriptions as belonging to Ephesus: η φιλοσεβαστος Εφεσιων βουλη και ο νεωκορος δημος καθιερωσαν επι ανθυπατου Πεδουκαιου Πρεισκεινου ψηφισαμενου Τιβ . Κλ . Ιταλικου του γραμματεως του δημου."
3. "To give peculiar sanctity to various images, it was given out that they had fallen from heaven."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The word means 'temple-sweeper'; then, 'temple-guardian.' Thirteen cities of Asia had an interest in the temple, but Ephesus was honored with the charge of it." 
2. "With this we may compare various legends concerning images and pictures in the Romish Church, such as the traditional likenesses of Christ, which were said to be 'not made with hands.'"


### Albert Barnes:
1. "This officer had a seat in their deliberative assemblies, and on him it seems to have devolved to keep the peace." 
2. "He little knew the power of that religion which had been the innocent cause of all this tumult."
3. "The word used here does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament. It is derived from νεὼς neōs, for ναὸς naos, a temple, and κορέω koreō, to sweep, to cleanse."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The town-clerk... had charge of the city-archives and... draw up official decrees." 
2. "Next to the commander, he was the most important personage in the Greek free cities." 
3. "Worshipper [νεωκορον]... originally applied to the lowest menials of the temple, became a title of honor."

### John Calvin:
1. "Luke showeth in this place that the tumult was so appeased, that yet, notwithstanding, superstition prevailed with the mad people, and the truth of God was not heard."
2. "For though the town-clerk had not been by him commanded to speak thus, yet it should have been treacherous dissimulation in a public witness and preacher of heavenly doctrine."
3. "Could he have holden his peace, but he must needs by his silence have allowed his false excuse? And this had been to shake hands with idolatry."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This official was a personage of great importance in these free Greek cities."
2. "The Greek word rendered ‘worshipper’ is a remarkable one (νεωκο ́ ρον). Its literal meaning is ‘temple-sweeper' (Lat. aedituus)."
3. "Like many other venerated idols of the old Pagan world, the strange and hideous statue of the Ephesian Artemis was supposed to have fallen from the skies."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The town-clerk (ο γραμματευς) was the most influential person in Ephesus who drafted decrees, had charge of the city's money, and communicated directly with the proconsul."
2. "His very presence as the city's chief officer had a quieting effect on the billowy turmoil and a semblance of order came."
3. "The recorder soothed the vanity of the crowd by appealing to the world-wide fame of Ephesus as sacristan of Artemis and of her heaven-fallen image."

### John Gill:
1. "This person seems to have been more than a 'town clerk', as we render it; or a common 'scribe', as the Vulgate Latin, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions render it; rather as the Syriac version, 'a chief man of the city'..." 
2. "And of the image which fell down from Jupiter; or 'of Diopetes'; so the Palladium, or image of Pallas, was called, because it was supposed to fall down from heaven..." 
3. "This image, Pliny says, it was doubted of what it was made; some said of the vine tree, others of ebony; but Athenagoras says, the old image of Diana of the Ephesians was made of olive."

### John Wesley:
1. "The register — Probably the chief governor of the public games."
2. "The image which fell down from Jupiter — They believed that very image of Diana, which stood in her temple, fell down from Jupiter in heaven."
3. "Perhaps he designed to insinuate, as if falling down from Jupiter, it was not made with hands, and so was not that sort of idols which Paul had said were no gods."
