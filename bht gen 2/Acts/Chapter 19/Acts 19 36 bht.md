# Acts 19:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is necessary for you to be quiet and refrain from any rash actions, as these statements are undeniable and widely accepted. The city's very existence is intertwined with these beliefs, and it would be foolish to think that a group of traveling speakers could overturn them. The town clerk is keen to prevent any riotous behavior that could incur Rome's displeasure. Therefore, it is best to look before you leap and calmly accept these truths.
