# Acts 19:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul and his companions had not robbed temples or blasphemed their gods. They opposed idolatry but did so with wisdom, avoiding harsh or reproachful language. Instead, they preached the truth while respecting the customs and beliefs of those they addressed. This caution in addressing the worship of Artemis is a valuable lesson for missionaries and ministers today. It shows the importance of being respectful and considerate in sharing the message of God's truth, not seeking to insult or offend others, but rather to guide them towards a deeper understanding of the one true God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "From this verse it appears that Paul had proceeded at Ephesus with the same caution as at Athens, and had not held up to contempt the worship of Artemis, any further than unavoidably the truths which he preached would render it contemptible."
2. "Chrysostom, however, treats this assertion of the town-clerk merely as a device to appease the people: 'τοῦτο ψεῦδος · ταῦτα μὲν πρὸς τὸν δῆμον.'"
3. "'and this caution is not unneeded, for &c.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess." This is a remarkable testimony, showing that the apostle had, in preaching against idolatry, studiously avoided insulting the feelings of those whom he addressed—a lesson this to missionaries and ministers in general.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Paul and his companions had not been guilty of robbing the temple of Diana, or any other temple... The charge of sacrilege could not be brought against them."
2. "They had opposed idolatry; had reasoned against it; and had endeavored to turn the people from it. But there is not the least evidence that they had ever done it in harsh or reproachful language."
3. "People gain nothing by bitter and reviling words; and it is much to obtain the testimony of even the enemies of religion as Paul did of the chancellor of Ephesus - that no such words had been used in describing their crimes and follies."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Robbers of churches [ιεροσυλους] . The A. V. puts a droll anachronism into the mouth of the town - clerk of a Greek city. Render, rather, as Rev., robbers of temples.

### John Calvin:
1. "For seeing that all superstition is profane and polluted, it followeth that those be sacrilegious persons who translate the honor which is due to God alone unto idols."
2. "But the wisdom of the town-clerk, and that carnal, is here commended, and not his godliness."
3. "He calleth them deputies, in the plural number, not that Asia had more than one, but because legates did sometimes keep courts in the place of the deputies."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "St. Paul’s address to the Athenians on the Hill of Ares (Mars) was an instance of his treatment of the ancient superstition. He hurt no ancient prejudices, no time-honoured customs, by rude invective."
2. "He was no blasphemer of the ancient gods of Greece and Rome, but led men to the knowledge of the truth by gentle but far more effective means."
3. "St. Paul and his immediate followers no doubt owed not a little of their wonderful influence over men’s hearts to their winning and graceful courtesy, to their chivalrous consideration for the feelings of others."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The word is found also on inscriptions in Ephesus."
2. "The Jews were sometimes guilty of this crime (Romans 2:22), since the heathen temples often had vast treasures like banks."
3. "Paul had used tact in Ephesus as in Athens in avoiding illegalities."

### John Gill:
1. "For ye have brought hither these men... which are neither robbers of churches."
2. "They have not stolen anything out of the temple of Diana, nor any other."
3. "They have not made mention of her name, much less said anything against her."

### John Wesley:
1. Nor blasphemers of your goddess — They simply declared the one God, and the vanity of idols in general.
