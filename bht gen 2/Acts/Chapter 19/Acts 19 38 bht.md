## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The grammarians distinguish ἀγοραῖος, ‘circumforaneus,’ an idler in the market, and ἀγόραιος, as in our text: so Suidas: but Ammonius vice versâ: and the distinction is now believed to be mere pedantry" (ἀγόραιοι).
2. "The Latin phrase for ἀγοραίους ἄγειν was conventus agere, or peragere, or convocare" (ἀγόραιοι).
3. "may not the ‘consiliarii’ of the proconsul who were his assessors at the ‘conventus,’ held in the provinces, have themselves popularly borne the name?" (ἀνθύπατοι).

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If Demetrius have a matter... against any man, the law is open... the court days are being held."
2. "There are deputies... the proconsul and his council, as a court of appeal."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The law is open - See the margin. Ἀγόραιοι Agoraioi ἄγονται agontai, that is, ἡμέραι hēmerai... There are court-days; days which are open, or appointed for judicial trials, where such matters can be determined in a proper manner."
2. "And there are deputies - Roman proconsuls... The cause might be brought before them with the certainty that it would be heard and decided."
3. "Let them implead one another - Let them accuse each other in the court. The laws are equal, and impartial justice will be done."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The law is open."
2. "The court-days are being kept."
3. "Deputies, proconsuls, by whom Asia was governed."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If some trade law, some civic regulation, had been infringed, let Demetrius and the others proceed against Paul and his friends."
2. "‘The law is open;’ literally, ‘court days are now going on.’ Ephesus was what we should now term an assize town, and the Roman officials held courts at intervals in all these."
3. "It is not improbable but that the words of the town-clerk signified, ‘At this instant the proconsul is on circuit, and is just now at Ephesus.’"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The town-clerk names Demetrius and the craftsmen (τεχνιτα) as the parties responsible for the riot." 
2. "The courts are open (αγοραιο αγοντα). Supply ημερα (days), court days are kept, or συνοδο, court-meetings are now going on." 
3. "The town-clerk makes a definite appeal to the mob for orderly legal procedure as opposed to mob violence in a matter where money and religious prejudice unite, a striking rebuke to so-called lynch-law proceedings in lands today where Christianity is supposed to prevail."

### John Gill:
1. "The law is open; or court days are kept; there are certain times fixed for the hearing and trying of causes, where and when such an affair should be regularly brought; and not use such disorderly methods."
2. "They are tradesmen, and it does not belong to them, nor should they take upon themselves to judge and determine what is right or wrong."
3. "Let the plaintiff bring his accusation, and charge, and let the others defend themselves, and let things proceed in a due course of law, and so issue."

### John Wesley:
1. There are proconsuls — One in every province. There was one at Ephesus.
