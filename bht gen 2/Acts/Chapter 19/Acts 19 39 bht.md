# Acts 19:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When seeking answers or resolutions on matters other than the alleged wrong suffered by Demetrius, it is important to bring them before a lawful assembly. This means convening a properly authorized gathering that has the jurisdiction to address both religious and political issues. It is worth noting that this lawful assembly should not resemble the chaotic and unruly crowd that assembled in the theatre, as their gathering lacked the proper authority.
