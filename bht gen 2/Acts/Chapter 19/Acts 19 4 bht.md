# Acts 19:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
John the Baptist played a crucial role in preparing the way for Jesus Christ. He baptized with water as a sign of repentance, pointing to the need for people to turn away from their sins. However, the ultimate purpose of John's baptism was to lead people to believe in the Messiah, who was Jesus. John's ministry reached its fulfillment when he directed people to place their faith in Christ. From that point on, John stepped aside as he recognized that Jesus was the true focus and the one who would bring salvation to the world.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This peculiar inversion of words, see reff., seems to mark the hand of Paul."
2. "ἵνα does not give (as Meyer) the mere purpose of his baptism (saying that he baptized in order that …), but combines, as in similar uses of προσεύχομαι ἵνα and the like, the purport and purpose together."
3. "‘He commanded them that they should (purport) and he spoke to them, that they might (purpose)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The point of contrast is not between John and Christ personally, but between the water baptism of John unto repentance, and the promised baptism of the Spirit from the hands of his coming Master unto new life."
2. "As to all the facts, or at least the significancy, of this baptism, which made the whole life and work of Christ another thing from what it was conceived to be before it was vouchsafed, these simple disciples were unenlightened."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "John did indeed baptize, having special reference to repentance, or as a profession that they did repent of their sins."
2. "The design of his preaching was to turn the people from their sins, and to prepare them for the coming of the Messiah."

### John Calvin:
1. "Before Christ was glorified, this power of his did not appear in the world; when he was ascended into heaven he would have his kingdom to flourish thus."
2. "The sum cometh to this end, as if Paul had said Before Christ was glorified, this power of his did not appear in the world; when he was ascended into heaven he would have his kingdom to flourish thus."
3. "Paul showeth plainly that that was the baptism of regeneration and renovation as is ours."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "John, indeed, preached repentance and a Saviour to come... but the Messiah whom he announced has appeared in Jesus, and ye are now to believe on Him, as John has directed."
2. "The whole purpose of John’s baptism was to prepare for another and more complete baptism, a rite far higher, and one that would confer, indeed, a grander blessing."
