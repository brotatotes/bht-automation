# Acts 19:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This gathering of people, described as a concourse, was indeed a dangerous situation. The Roman authorities had strict laws against riots and public disturbances, and those involved in such activities were liable to face severe consequences. The lack of a justifiable reason for this assembly only heightened the risk, as it could easily be interpreted as a riot or sedition. It was clear that the city officials were well aware of the potential repercussions and the need to address this matter to preserve the peace and their own positions of authority.
