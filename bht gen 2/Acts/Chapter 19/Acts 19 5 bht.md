# Acts 19:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These disciples were rebaptized by Paul, as their previous baptism by John the Baptist did not align with Christian baptism. Paul then laid his hands upon them, signifying their reception of the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghost. While baptism is not intended to be repeated, these disciples had never truly experienced the baptism as prescribed by the Lord Jesus. Their willingness to be rebaptized indicated their understanding that John's baptism was temporary and preparatory. Through their submission to Christian baptism, they acknowledged the higher doctrines and significance of Jesus' death, resurrection, and the Trinity.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is evident that these persons were rebaptized by the direction of Paul. For: (1) This is the obvious interpretation of the passage - what would strike all persons as correct, unless there were some previous theory to support."
2. "If it be the sense of the passage that John baptized them in the name of Jesus, then this verse is a mere repetition of Acts . Acts 19:4; a tautology of which the sacred writers would not be guilty."
3. "The disciples of John were rebaptized, not because baptism is designed to be repeated, but because they never had been, in fact, baptized in the manner prescribed by the Lord Jesus."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The willingness on the part of these followers of John the Baptist to be baptized anew in the name of the Lord Jesus, tells us that they had committed no error in doctrine, no mistake in looking upon their master John as Messiah; they confessed by submitting to the Christian rite that the baptism of John was simply provisional and preparatory."
2. "And so these passed in Ephesus, as doubtless did many another disciple of the great Forerunner in other lands, from the imperfect to the perfect Christianity, giving up nothing of their former belief, only adding to it the higher doctrines, especially those relating to the results worked by the death and resurrection of the Messiah and the later outpouring of the Holy Spirit."
3. "The plain meaning of the text is generally received, and all expositors now agree that these disciples of John were re-baptized with the Christian baptism."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The point here is simply that these twelve men were grossly ignorant of the meaning of John's baptism as regards repentance, the Messiahship of Jesus, the Holy Spirit."
