# Acts 19:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Upon being baptized by John or one of his disciples in the name of the Lord Jesus, the Samaritans experienced the laying on of hands by Paul, which signified the coming of the Holy Spirit in supernatural power. This was evidenced by the manifestation of speaking in tongues and prophesying, which indicated that they had received the Holy Spirit's extraordinary gifts. These tongues were not learned languages, but rather an ecstatic utterance of rapturous devotion. It is essential to recognize that the baptism in water did not convey the Holy Spirit or forgiveness of sins.
