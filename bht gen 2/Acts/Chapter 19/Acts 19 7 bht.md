# Acts 19:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This passage tells us about a group of individuals who were won over to the true Church of the Lord Jesus through the preaching of Paul and his school. It was a small number of people, but the historian was certain about it. This group may have been the first materials of a Gospel church at Ephesus, which later became large and flourishing. It is possible that some of them even became elders of the church.
