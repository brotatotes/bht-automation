# Acts 19:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Christian way of worshipping God involves encountering opposition from those who resist and blaspheme the gospel. Separation from those who contradict and slander the truths of God's Word is justifiable. This allows for the continuation of proclaiming the transformative power of Christ in private synagogues, like the school of one Tyrannus. Through these gatherings, the truth of the gospel can penetrate the hearts of those who embrace it, even amidst the hostility of the unbelieving world.
