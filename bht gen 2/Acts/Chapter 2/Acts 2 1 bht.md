# Acts 2:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the appointed time had fully come, and the fiftieth day from the Passover was reached, which was known as the day of Pentecost, the events unfolded. This day, historically significant for the giving of the law, was chosen to coincide with the outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon the disciples. It was on this first day of the week that the Gospel was preached to all nations and a great harvest of souls was gathered in.

1. "Was fully come [συμπληρουσθαι] . Used by Luke only. Lit., as Rev., margin, was being fulfilled. The day, according to the Hebrew mode, is conceived as a measure to be filled up. So long as the day had not yet arrived, the measure was not full. The words denote in process of fulfillment."

### Philip Schaff:
