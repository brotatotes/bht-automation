# Acts 2:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostles, though initially ignorant and humble, fervently delved into divine matters and heavenly wisdom. They were granted new tongues, enabling them to speak in various languages. This miracle served to awe and captivate the converts, who were eager to learn. The inclusion of Cretans and Arabians in the list of languages spoken may have been an afterthought, emphasizing the widespread reach of the gospel. The apostles' proclamation of the wonderful works of God encompassed the miracles, death, resurrection, ascension of Christ, and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, which were central to the message of grace.
