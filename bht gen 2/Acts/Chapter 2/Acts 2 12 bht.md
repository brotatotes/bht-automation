# Acts 2:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They were all astonished at this; unable to understand or explain it. They were in doubt, hesitating and anxious about the event. Some even speculated that it was merely the effect of new wine. It is baffling to think that people could witness such a powerful display of God's work and respond with mockery and jest. This has been a recurring theme throughout history, as only a few truly comprehend and appreciate God's revelations. The spectators were completely perplexed, unable to comprehend the true significance of what they were witnessing.
