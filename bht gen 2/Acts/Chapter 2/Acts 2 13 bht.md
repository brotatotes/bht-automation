# Acts 2:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The mockery faced by the disciples, accused of being drunk with new wine, is not uncommon when the Holy Spirit's power is manifested. This mocking reflects a pattern where ridicule, threats, and persecution often arise against those who experience God's revival. The mockers in this case were likely locals from Jerusalem, failing to recognize that the disciples were filled not with physical wine but with the spiritual gifts of the Holy Spirit. Their accusation of drunkenness was baseless, as it was still early in the day and new wine was not yet available during the feast of Pentecost.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Sweet wine, not necessarily new wine"
2. "Perhaps made of a remarkably sweet small grape, which is understood by the Jewish expositors to be meant by שׂרֵק or שׂרֵקָה"
3. "Suidas interprets it, τὸ ἀποστάλαγμα τῆς σταφυλῆς πρὶν πατηθῇ"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There has seldom been a revival of religion, a remarkable manifestation of the power of the Holy Spirit, that has not given occasion for profane mockery and merriment."
2. "Derision, and mockery, and a jeer, have been far more effectual in deterring people from becoming Christians than any attempts at sober argument."
3. "When people fail in argument, it is common to attempt to confute a doctrine or bring reproach upon a transaction by 'giving it an ill name.' Hence, the names Puritan, Quaker, Methodist, etc., were at first given in derision, to account for some remarkable effect of religion on the world."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Others [ετεροι] . Of a different class."
2. "The first who commented on the wonder did so curiously, but with no prejudice."
3. "Mocking (diacleuazontev; so the best texts). From cleuh, a joke."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Mocking (διαχλευαζοντες). Old verb, but only here in the N.T., though the simple verb (without δια) in Acts 17:32. Χλευη means a joke." 
2. "With new wine (γλευκους). Sweet wine, but intoxicating. Sweet wine kept a year was very intoxicating."
3. "Tanked up with new wine, state of fulness."

### John Gill:
1. "These men are full of new wine; a very foolish and impertinent cavil this."
2. "They were indeed filled with wine, but not with wine, the juice of the grape, either new or old; but with spiritual wine, with the gifts of the Spirit of God, by which they spake with divers tongues."
3. "They might hope this insinuation, that they were drunk with wine, would take and be received, since it was a feasting time, the feast of Pentecost; though, as Peter afterwards observes; it was too early in the day to imagine this to be their case."

### John Wesley:
1. "The world begins with mocking, thence proceeds to cavilling, threats, imprisoning, blows, to slaughter."
2. "These mockers appear to have been some of the natives of Judea, and inhabitants of Jerusalem."
3. "They are full of sweet wine — So the Greek word properly signifies. There was no new wine so early in the year as pentecost."
