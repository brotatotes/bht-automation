# Acts 2:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These believers are not drunk, as you suppose. It is only the third hour of the day, or nine in the morning, when it is uncommon to be intoxicated. The suggestion of their drunkenness is unfounded and unreasonable, especially during a time when it is not customary for religious individuals to have consumed anything yet. Such an accusation does not align with the facts of the situation and should be dismissed.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Before which no pious Jew might eat or drink: 'Non licet homini gustare quidquam, antequam oraverit orationem suam.'" 
2. "But perhaps we need not look further than the ordinary intent of such a defence the improbability of intoxication at that hour of the morning."

### Albert Barnes:

3. "The apostle could appeal to it with confidence, as a full refutation of the charge of drunkenness at that hour."

### Marvin Vincent:

### Philip Schaff:

2. "On Sabbath days and festivals, it was unusual for the Jews to eat or drink until the hour of morning prayer had expired."
3. "Hence the extreme improbability of these many persons being already drunk at such an early hour of the day, and that day, too, a high festival, when it was not the custom even to touch food or drink till later."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "The third hour (ωρα τριτη). Three o'clock in the day Jewish time, nine Roman."
3. "Drunkenness belongs to the night (1 Thessalonians 5:7). It was a quick, common sense reply, and complete answer to their suspicion."

### John Gill:
1. "For these are not drunken...the unreasonableness of which supposition and suggestion the apostle argues from the time of day: seeing it is but the third hour of the day; or nine of the clock in the morning."
2. "Now whereas they that are drunken are drunken in the night, and not in the day, and much less so soon in the day, when it was not usual, at least with religious men, to have tasted anything by this time... it was unreasonable to suppose anything of this kind in them."

### John Wesley:
1. "It is but the third hour of the day - that is, nine in the morning."
