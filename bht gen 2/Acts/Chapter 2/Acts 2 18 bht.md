# Acts 2:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The phrase upon my servants refers not to their civil state, but their religious character as those who obediently follow God's will through divine grace. God's pouring out of the Spirit disregards social and material distinctions, making no difference between bond or free, rich or poor. This pouring out of the Spirit has the effect of bestowing wondrous gifts and enabling these individuals to declare God's will.
