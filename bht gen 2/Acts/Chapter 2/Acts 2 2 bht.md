# Acts 2:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The coming of the Son of man to judgment will be as sudden and unexpected as the rushing of a mighty wind, filling the whole house and leaving no part untouched. Just as the wind fills the atmosphere, the Spirit of God fills the hearts of believers with His power and grace, bringing down strongholds of sin and manifesting His presence in the temple of their bodies.
