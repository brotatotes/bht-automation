# Acts 2:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage speaks of a significant event, characterized by the sun turning into darkness and the moon into blood. This symbolism is not to be interpreted literally, but rather represents calamity and divine judgment. It foreshadows a notable day of the Lord, the second coming of Jesus, accompanied by signs and wonders. On this day, God will manifest His glory and take vengeance on His adversaries, specifically referring to the destruction of the Jewish nation, city, and temple. This display of His greatness and power will be awesomely terrible to those who oppose Him.
