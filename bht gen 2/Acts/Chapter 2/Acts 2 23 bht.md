# Acts 2:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's love for the world prompted His determined counsel to redeem mankind through the death of His Son. Some may question why God allowed such treatment and if He had the power to prevent it. Indeed, He knew the intentions of the wicked, and He had the power to thwart their plans instantly, but He chose not to exercise that power. His greater plan of redemption required the sacrifice of Jesus and the fulfillment of prophecy.
