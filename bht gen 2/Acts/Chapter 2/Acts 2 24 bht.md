# Acts 2:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Resurrection of Jesus brought about the abolishment of death, freeing Him from its hold and delivering humanity from its curse. This was the first public proclamation of this incredible fact, as early Christian writers interpreted the Resurrection as a birth out of death. By loosing the pains of death, Jesus removed its sting and fulfilled the Scripture, making it impossible for Him to remain held under its power.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For ὠδῖνας θαν. must mean the pains of death, i.e. the pains which precede and end in death; a meaning here inapplicable."
2. "The fact may be, that Peter used the Hebrew word חֶבְלֵי, 'nets,' or 'bands,' i.e. the nets in which death held the Lord captive; and that, in rendering the words into Greek, the LXX rendering of the word in that place and Psalms 114:3, viz. ὠδῖνες, has been adopted."
3. "It has been attempted in vain by Olshausen and others to show that ὠδῖνες sometimes in Hellenistic Greek signifies bands."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Glorious saying! It was indeed impossible that 'the Living One' should remain 'among the dead' (Luke 24:5)."
2. "But here, the impossibility seems to refer to the prophetic assurance that He should not see corruption."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "God had also raised him up; had thus given his attestation to his doctrine; and had sent down his Spirit according to the promise which the Lord Jesus made before his death."
2. "The word 'loosed'... means to free or to liberate... It is used in this sense here... the idea of untying or loosing a band is retained, because the word translated 'pains' often means 'a cord or band.'"
3. "Pain, mighty pain, will encompass us all like the constrictions and bindings of a cord which we cannot loose, and will fasten our limbs and bodies in the grave."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The figure being that of escape from the snare of a huntsman."
2. "Others suppose that death is represented in travail, the birth - pangs ceasing with the delivery; i e., the resurrection."
3. "It is better, perhaps, on the whole, to take the expression in the sense of the A. V., and to make the pains of death stand for death generally."

### John Calvin:
1. "That inward fear of conscience, which made him so afraid that he sweat blood, did more vex him, and brought upon him greater horror, than all the torments of the flesh."
2. "By this it cometh to pass that the faithful ought not now to be afraid of death; for death hath not the like quality now which was in Adam; because by the victory of Christ the curse is swallowed up."
3. "He added a reason, because it was impossible that Christ should be oppressed by death, who is the author of life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Lord whom they had known on earth, was indeed risen from the dead and was ruling from His throne."
2. "The resurrection of Jesus, in the eyes of His first preacher, chased away all the mist and darkness which hung over the future."
