# Acts 2:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
I saw the Lord always before me; because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved. This powerful statement in Psalm 16 portrays the deep intimacy and unwavering faith of the psalmist in the constant presence of the Lord. By acknowledging God's nearness and protection, the psalmist finds assurance and stability in the midst of life's challenges. This passage not only reflects the personal experience of the psalmist, but it also anticipates the Messiah, who would exemplify perfect trust in God's guidance and unfailing presence. It reminds us to cultivate a similar mindset of unwavering reliance on God's constant care.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "To say, with De Wette, that Peter‚Äôs proof lies not in any historical but only in an  ideal meaning of the Psalm, is  entirely beside the subject ."
2. "Whether the Messiah was  present or not to the mind of the Psalmist , is of very little import: in some cases He plainly  was : in others, as here, David‚Äôs words, spoken of himself and his circumstances, could only be in their highest and literal sense true of the  great Son of David who was to come."
3. "David often spoke  concerning himself ; but THE SPIRIT WHO SPOKE IN DAVID,  Œµ·º∞œÇ œÑ·Ω∏ŒΩ œáœÅŒπœÉœÑœåŒΩ ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "a man approved of God‚Äîrather,
	"authenticated," "proved," or "demonstrated
	to be from God."
2. by miracles . . . which God
	did by him‚ÄîThis is not a low view of our Lord's miracles, as
	has been alleged, nor inconsistent with ‚Ä¶ but is in strict accordance with His progress from
	humiliation to glory, and with His own words in ‚Ä¶ 
3. This view of Christ is here dwelt on to exhibit to the Jews
	the whole course of Jesus of Nazareth as the ordinance and doing of
	the God of Israel [ALFORD]."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To foresee the Lord always before us conveys no idea, though it may be a literal translation of the passage. The word means 'to foresee,' and then 'to see before us,' that is, 'as present with us, to regard as being near.' It thus implies 'to put confidence in one; to rely on him, or expect assistance from him.'" 
2. "In our dependence on God we should exalt him. We should not merely regard him as our help, but should at the same time give him the highest place in our affections."
3. "That I should not be moved - That is, that no great evil or calamity should happen to me; that I may stand firm. The phrase denotes 'to sink into calamities, or to fall into the power of enemies.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "I foresaw [œÄœÅŒøœâœÅœâŒºŒ∑ŒΩ] . Not to see beforehand, but to see before one's self, as in Psalms 16:8." 
2. "I should not be moved [ŒºŒ∑ œÉŒ±ŒªŒµœÖŒ∏œâ] . Or be shaken. Generally so rendered in the New Testament."
3. "See Matthew 11:7; Matthew 24:29; Hebrews 12:26, etc."

### John Calvin:
1. "Peter denieth that that agreeth with David which is said in this place: 'Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption,' because David‚Äôs carcass was corrupt in the grave."
2. "What man soever shall be of sound judgment shall easily know that this is a good argument. God did put all mankind under corruption; therefore, David, inasmuch as he was of the number of men, could not be free from the same."
3. "Faith, in hoping for the help of God, ought to prevent and overgo all experience, and whatsoever is perceived by the sense; but so soon as it shall give this glory to God, that it doth behold him in his Word, although he be absent, and so, consequently, invisible, it shall be overcome with the effect of the thing."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To show it was no new idea of his, that death could not hold the ‚ÄòHoly One of God,‚Äô St. Peter quotes the words of Psalms 16:0, where David writes of the sure hope of a joyous future life with God."
2. "This sure hope of immortality is the spirit of the Psalm; but as St. Peter shows (and also St. Paul, Acts 13:36), the first and primary instance of one entering into eternal life must be sought in the person of one so raised from the dead before corruption could seize upon the dead one‚Äôs body."
3. "‚ÄòI foresaw‚Äô signifies simply, ‚ÄòI saw the Lord always before me.‚Äô"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "David is giving his own experience which is typical of the Messiah."
2. "The Lord Jehovah like a defender or advocate stands at David's right hand."
3. "Moved, to shake like an earthquake."

### John Gill:
1. "The whole psalm belongs to the Messiah, and everything concerning the person in it agrees with him."
2. "Christ always had Jehovah in view throughout the whole of his life."
3. "His nearness to him, his presence with him, his readiness to assist him, and his protection of him."

### John Wesley:
1.  Psalm 16:8.
