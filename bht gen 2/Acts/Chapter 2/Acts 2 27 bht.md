# Acts 2:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's promise to not leave the soul in the realm of the dead, known as hades or the invisible world, is a reassuring truth. This means that when the soul and body are separated, the soul does not go to hades but to paradise. Furthermore, this promise extends to the physical body, ensuring it will not undergo decay or corruption. It is a remarkable affirmation that no worm or maggot will have dominion over the Holy One. This passage serves as a powerful reminder of God's unwavering faithfulness in preserving both body and soul.
