# Acts 2:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples witnessed a remarkable sight as distinct tongues, resembling flames of fire, appeared before them. These flames were not actual fire but symbolized the Holy Spirit's purifying and enlightening power. They represented the diverse languages in which the disciples would proclaim the Gospel. This display of cloven tongues, like fire, signified God's divine touch on their tongues, empowering them with words that were active and penetrating, akin to the nature of flaming fire.
