# Acts 2:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The prophecies of the Messiah in the Psalms of David are significant, as he was a foreteller of future events inspired by the Holy Spirit. His words carried great credibility as he wrote in the Spirit, and the psalmist king connected his descendant with the idea of the Messiah. These prophecies encompassed not only the sufferings, death, resurrection, and ascension of Christ but also his session at the right hand of God. The unique characteristic of David as king, reigning over the people of God, is echoed in the Messiah sitting on the throne of David.
