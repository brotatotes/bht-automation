# Acts 2:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
David, as a prophet, had distinct views of the great doctrines pertaining to the Messiah. He foresaw, through the spirit of prophecy, that the Messiah would be raised up and come from his seed, while also foreseeing that the Messiah would suffer, die, and be laid in the grave. In Psalm 16:10, David spoke of the resurrection of Christ from the dead. The words in Psalm 16:10 indicate that Christ's soul and body were not left in hell or in the grave until they decayed. This shows David's prophetic consciousness and insight into the future events surrounding the Messiah.
