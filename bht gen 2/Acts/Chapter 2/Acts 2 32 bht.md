# Acts 2:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The prophecy of David about the resurrection of Christ was not about himself, but rather pointed to Jesus rising from the dead. This fulfilled the promise of a kingdom that would endure forever, as Jesus had to rise in order to receive this eternal kingdom. The witnesses, including Jesus' disciples, testified to the truth of his resurrection, validating the prophecy and the significance of his victory over death.
