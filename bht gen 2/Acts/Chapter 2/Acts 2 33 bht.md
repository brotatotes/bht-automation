# Acts 2:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Being exalted by the right hand of God, our Lord demonstrated his victory over death and the authority bestowed upon him as the Prince and Savior. Through his ascension, he fulfilled the promises made to his followers, reigning as the Lord, Head, and King. As part of this fulfillment, Jesus received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father. In line with his pledge, Jesus then poured out this long-awaited Spirit and bestowed spiritual gifts upon his disciples. This outpouring served as a clear and undeniable sign that Jesus was indeed the promised Messiah, chosen by God.

2. "Wordsw. denies that the Î´ÎµÎ¾Î¹á½° Î¸ÎµÎ¿á¿¦ is ever specified in the N. T. as the instrument by which He works... And in the LXX the use of Godâ€™s right hand as the instrument is very frequent."
3. "Î²Î»Î­Ï€ÎµÏ„Îµ need not imply, as Dr. Burton thinks, that 'there was some visible appearance, which the people saw as well as the apostles': very much of the effect of the descent of the Spirit would be visible."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The right hand among the Hebrews was often used to denote 'power'; and the expression here means, not that he was exalted to the right hand of God, but by his power."
2. "He was raised from the dead by his power, and borne to heaven, triumphant over all his enemies."
3. "The Holy Spirit was promised to the disciples before his deathâ€¦ It was expressly declared: 'Jesus would riseâ€¦ The fulfillment of this promise was a rational way of accounting for the scene before them.

### John Calvin:
1. "For this is his drift, to declare that it was a wonderful work of God, in that he had exalted his Christ (whom men thought to be quite destroyed by death) unto so great glory."
