# Acts 2:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The exaltation of Christ is proven through prophecy and the passage that Jesus used to silence His enemies. David did not ascend into the heavens, whereas Christ sits at the right hand of God, representing supreme rule. This sitting reflects the highest honor bestowed upon individuals and symbolizes triumph over defeated enemies. The mention of Psalm 110:1 supports the Messianic nature of the passage, emphasizing that David's reign was not eternal. St. Peter's words are grounded in Scripture, demonstrating the enduring kingdom of Christ. These references highlight Christ's exalted status and eternal reign.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This exaltation of Christ is also proved from prophecy and from the same passage with which Jesus Himself had silenced His enemies."
2. "Œ¥Œ≠ is not 'for,' which would destroy the whole force of the sentence: the Apostle says, 'For David himself is not ascended into the heavens,' as he would be if the former prophecy applied to him: BUT he himself says, removing all doubt on the subject, &c."
3. "The rendering Œ¥Œ≠, 'for,' makes it appear as if the ·ºÄŒΩŒ≠Œ≤Œ∑ Œµ·º∞œÇ œÑ. Œø·ΩêœÅ. were a mistaken inference from Psalms 110:1, whereas that passage is adduced to preclude its being made from the other."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "For these words, to 'sit at the right hand of God,' import as much as to bear the chief rule, as we shall afterward more at large declare."
2. "But this doth not appertain unto David, who was never extolled unto so great dignity. Therefore he speaketh this of Christ."
3. "Surely, although I grant that the name of such an honorable sitting may be applied unto earthly lordship: yet do I deny that David did reign until such time as all his enemies were subdued. For we do hereby gather that the kingdom of Christ is eternal."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Ascended not (ŒøœÖ--Œ±ŒΩŒµŒ≤Œ∑). It is more emphatic than that: For not David ascended into the heavens."
2. "No passage in the O.T. is so constantly quoted as Messianic as this."
3. "St. Peter does not demand belief upon his own assertion, but he again appeals to the Scriptures, and to words which could not have received a fulfilment in the case of David."

### John Gill:
1. "David is not ascended into the heavens...though in his soul he was ascended to heaven." 
2. "His Spirit had returned to God that gave it, and was among the spirits of just men made perfect."
