This passage highlights the enduring authority of Christ as Mediator until His enemies are subjected to His rule. It reinforces Peter's message that the very One whom they crucified, God exalted as both Lord and Messiah. The critics are perplexed by Luke's ability to capture the profound essence of this impromptu and impassioned address. As suggested by the words of David, their prophetic monarch, it underscores the impending doom that awaits those who persist in opposing Christ. The reference to Psalm 110:1 further emphasizes the unmatched power and dominion of Jesus over His adversaries.
