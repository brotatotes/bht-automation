## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The word imports change of mind; here, change from thinking Jesus an impostor, and scorning Him as one crucified, to being baptized in His name, and looking to Him for remission of sins, and the gift of the Spirit."
2. "The miserable absurdity of rendering μεταν ., or 'pœnitentiam agite,' by 'do penance,' or understanding it as referring to a course of external rites, is well exposed by this passage in which the internal change of heart and purpose is insisted on, to be testified by admission into the number of Christ's followers."
3. "Before, there had been the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins, by John, Luke 3:3; but now we have the important addition ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόμ . Ἰησοῦ χριστοῦ, on the Name i.e. on the confession of that which the Name implies, and into the benefits and blessings which the Name implies."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Repent—The word denotes change of mind, and here includes the reception of the Gospel as the proper issue of that revolution of mind which they were then undergoing."
2. "baptized . . . for the remission of sins—as the visible seal of that remission."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Repentance implies sorrow for sin as committed against God, along with a purpose to forsake it. It is such a view of sin, as evil in itself, as to lead the mind to hate it and forsake it."
2. "True repentance is the only thing in such a state of mind that can give any relief. An ingenuous confession of sin, a solemn purpose to forsake it, and a true hatred of it, is the only thing that can give the mind composure."
3. "Baptism is the application of water, as expressive of the need of purification, and as emblematic of the influences from God that can alone cleanse the soul. It is also a form of dedication to the service of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Repent. See on Matthew 3:2. In the name [επι τω ονοματι] . Lit., upon the name. See on Matthew 28:19. Remission. See on Luke 3:3; James 5:15.

### John Calvin:
1. "Hereby we see that those do never go away empty which ask at the mouth of the Lord, and do offer themselves unto him to be ruled and taught."
2. "Whosoever shall be rightly prepared to learn, the Lord will not suffer his godly desire to be in vain; for he is a most faithful master, so that he hath scholars which are apt to be taught and studious."
3. "Let us suffer ourselves to be governed by the counsel and authority of those men whom he offereth unto us to teach us, for this ready obedience cometh thence so suddenly in those which addict themselves unto the apostles, because they are persuaded that they are sent of God, to show them the way of salvation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The rite of baptism was well known to the Jews: they used to baptize proselytes and their children." 
2. "Their belief in Jesus was the ground on which they were to be baptized."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Change your mind and your life. Turn right about and do it now. You crucified this Jesus. Now crown him in your hearts as Lord and Christ."
2. "The first thing to do is make a radical and complete change of heart and life. Then let each one be baptized after this change has taken place, and the act of baptism be performed 'in the name of Jesus Christ'."

### John Wesley:
1. "Repent - And hereby return to God: be baptized - Believing in the name of Jesus - And ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost."
2. "The gift of the Holy Ghost does not mean in this place the power of speaking with tongues. For the promise of this was not given to all that were afar off, in distant ages and nations. But rather the constant fruits of faith, even righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost."
3. "Whomsoever the Lord our God shall call - (Whether they are Jews or Gentiles) by his word and by his Spirit: and who are not disobedient to the heavenly calling."
