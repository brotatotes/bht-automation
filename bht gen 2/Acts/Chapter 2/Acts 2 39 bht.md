# Acts 2:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The promise of Christ and His grace extends not only to those who were called at that time, but also to their children, as the Lord God wills. This promise is not limited by location or time, but includes all who are afar off, whether they are scattered among different nations or living in future generations. It is a promise that encompasses both Jews and Gentiles, and it applies to all individuals, regardless of their position or the extent of their sins.

### Marvin Vincent:

3. "It was already revealed in the Old Testament that they should be received, and Christ himself had commanded the apostles to preach to all nations."

### John Calvin:
1. "We must always look unto this, because [that] we cannot otherwise know the will of God save only by his word."
