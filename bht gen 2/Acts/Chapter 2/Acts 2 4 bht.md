# Acts 2:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples began speaking in various languages, uttering praises of God in tongues previously unknown to them. This miraculous event was a result of the Holy Spirit filling them and enabling them to speak real, living languages. The gift of speaking in tongues was essential for their mission to preach to all nations, as they would encounter people who spoke different languages. It demonstrated the supernatural power of the Holy Spirit and served as a sign that the disciples were indeed filled with divine inspiration.

1. "There can be no question in any unprejudiced mind, that the fact which this narrative sets before us is, that the disciples began to speak in VARIOUS LANGUAGES, viz. the languages of the nations below enumerated, and perhaps others."
2. "I believe the event related in our text to have been a sudden and powerful inspiration of the Holy Spirit, by which the disciples uttered, not of their own minds, but as mouth-pieces of the Spirit, the praises of God in various languages, hitherto, and possibly at the time itself, unknown to them."
3. "But, to set aside, argumenti gratiÃ¢, higher considerations, is it at all probable that Luke, who must have conversed with many eye and ear-witnesses of this day's events, would have been misinformed about them in so vital a point as the very nature of the gift by which the descent of the Spirit was accompanied?"
