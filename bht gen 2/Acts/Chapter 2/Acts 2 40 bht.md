# Acts 2:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, it is emphasized that individuals must take action to save themselves from the corrupt and obstinate generation surrounding them. God expects people to actively preserve themselves and seek their own redemption. The call is for those who are awakened to separate from evil companions and fully commit themselves to Christ and His followers. This requires a deliberate decision to turn away from the ways of the world and dedicate one's life to God's purposes.

### Henry Alford:
1. "œÉœéŒ∏Œ∑œÑŒµ is improperly rendered in E. V. 'save yourselves': it is not œÉœéŒ∂ŒµœÑŒµ ·ºëŒ±œÖœÑŒøœçœÇ, as in Luke 23:35; Luke 23:37; Luke 23:39; be saved, Lasset euch retten, is the true sense."
2. "œÉŒ∫ŒøŒªŒπ·æ∂œÇ see reff. Peter alludes to ref. Deut."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Thus we have here but a summary of Peter's discourse; though from the next words it would seem that only the more practical parts, the home appeals, are omitted."
2. "Save yourselves from this untoward generation‚Äîas if Peter already foresaw the hopeless impenitence of the nation at large, and would have his hearers hasten in for themselves and secure their own salvation."
3. "BEAUTIFUL BEGINNINGS OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Save yourselves - This expression here denotes, preserve yourselves from the influence, opinions, and fate of this generation. It implies that they were to use diligence and effort to deliver themselves. God deals with people as free agents."
2. "Unless they put forth their own strength, they will never be saved. When they are saved, they will ascribe to God the praise for having inclined them to seek him, and for the grace whereby they are saved."
3. "Those who are awakened should resolve at once to break off from their evil companions, and unite themselves to Christ and his people. They should forsake the world, and give themselves up to God, and resolve to have only so much contact with the world, in any respect, as may be required by duty, and as may be consistent with a supreme purpose to live to the honor of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Save yourselves [œÉœâŒ∏Œ∑œÑŒµ] . More strictly, be ye saved."
2. "The opposite is froward (fromward). So Shakespeare : "'Tis a good hearing when children are toward, But a harsh hearing when women are froward.""
3. "Untoward, therefore, meant intractable, perverse."

### John Calvin:
1. "The sum was this, that they should beware of that froward generation. For they could not be Christ‚Äôs unless they would depart from his professed enemies."
2. "Peter plainly declareth that they are a froward generation, howsoever they may boast of the title of the Church. For which cause he commandeth his hearers to separate themselves from them, lest they entangle themselves in their wicked and pestiferous fellowship."
3. "For it were not sufficient to have Christ set before us, unless we were also taught to flee those things which do lead us away from him. And it is the duty of a good shepherd to defend his sheep from the wolves."


### Philip Schaff:
1. "The words cited appear to be the concluding and inclusive summary of St. Peter's many exhortations."
2. "Be ye saved (by God), Lasset each rotten."
3. "From this untoward generation, that is, from that wicked Jewish people who had filled up the cup of their iniquity by the murder of the Holy One and Just, and who were doomed to destruction."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Not necessarily 'different,' but 'further,' showing that Luke does not pretend to give all that Peter said."
2. "He testified... to make solemn attestation or call to witness... it should be translated 'protested solemnly' to the Jews."
3. "Literally, Be ye saved... a perversity for turning off from the truth."

### John Gill:
1. "Luke does not give the sermons of the apostles at length, but a compendium, or specimen of them, and some of the more remarkable things in them."
2. "The word used signifies to comfort as well as to exhort."
3. "The apostle exhorts to separate from them, and not partake of their sins, lest they should also of their plagues; but come out from among them, and so, in a temporal sense, save themselves from the destruction that would quickly come on their nation, city, and temple."

### John Wesley:
1. "In such an accepted time we should add line upon line, and not leave off, till the thing is done."
2. "Save yourselves from this perverse generation ‚Äî Many of whom were probably mocking still."
