# Acts 2:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Upon the powerful preaching of the apostles, a significant number of people were added to the existing community of believers, totaling around three thousand individuals. These new converts were seen as a testament to the power and effectiveness of Christ's grace, marking the beginning of the expansion of the early Church. Their baptism served as a significant step in their journey of faith, as they were first immersed or sprinkled, and then united with the larger body of believers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The infancy of the Church in this respect corresponded to the infancy of the individual mind; the simplicity of faith came first, the ripeness of knowledge followed."
2. "Among such a multitude, admitted by a confession which allowed of so wide an interpretation, were probably many persons who brought into the church the seeds of that Judaizing form of Christianity which afterwards proved so hostile to the true faith."
3. "Almost without doubt, this first baptism must have been administered, as that of the first Gentile converts was, by effusion or sprinkling, not by immersion."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is difficult to say how three thousand could be baptized in one day, according to the old practice of a complete submersion..." [OLSHAUSEN].
2. "The difficulty can only be removed by supposing that they already employed sprinkling, or baptized in houses in large vessels" [OLSHAUSEN].
3. "Fitting inauguration of the new kingdom, as an economy of the Spirit!" [OLSHAUSEN].

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Religion is not compulsion. They who become Christians do it cheerfully; they do it rejoicing in the privilege of becoming reconciled to God through Jesus Christ."
2. "Their conversion was instantaneous. The demand on them was to yield themselves at once to God. And their profession was made, and the ordinance which sealed their profession administered without delay."
3. "It was the first great work of grace under the gospel. It was the model of all revivals of religion. And it was doubtless intended that this should be a specimen of the manner in which the ministers of religion should act in regard to admissions to the Christian church."

### John Calvin:
1. "Faith must begin with this readiness and willing desire to obey."
2. "We must neither be slow to obey, nor yet swift to leap back; but we must stick fast, and stand stoutly to that doctrine which we did forthwith embrace."
3. "For whereas there was a great multitude converted unto Christ with one sermon, an hundred sermons can scarce move a few of us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Several commentators remark here, that as during the course at least of that day three thousand persons received baptism, this great multitude could not have been immersed, especially in a city like Jerusalem, where the supply of water was not abundant."
2. "This first baptism probably was administered by sprinkling or pouring."
3. "We may see it was not dogmas (as a preparation for baptism) upon which the apostles laid stress, but the disposition and bent of the mind."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Luke means that the 3,000 were added to the 120 already enlisted."
2. "It is not stated they were all baptized by Peter or the twelve or all on the same day, though that is the natural implication of the language."
3. "Furneaux warns us that all the 3,000 may not have been genuine converts and that many of them were pilgrims at the passover who returned home."

### John Gill:
1. "These converts were the dew of Christ's youth, as well as instances of his powerful and efficacious grace."
2. "The number of those that were added to them were about three thousand souls; or persons, men, and women; and their number is no objection to their being baptized by immersion."
3. "Let the order be observed, they were first baptized, and then added to the church."

### John Wesley:
1. And there were added â€” To the hundred and twenty.
