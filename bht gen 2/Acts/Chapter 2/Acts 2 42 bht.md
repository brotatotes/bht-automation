The early believers devoted themselves to the apostles' teachings, persistently seeking to grow in their understanding of the faith. They cultivated a sense of fellowship, coming together in a shared interest and actively participating in one another's lives.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "community: the living together as one family, and having things in common."
2. "the κοιν . τῶν ἀποστ . must signify fellowship  with the Apostles, or fellowship  with that Society of which the Apostles were the chief"
3. "To these ἀγάπαι , accompanied as they were at this time by the celebration of the Lord’s Supper, the κλάσις τοῦ ἄρτου refers, from the custom of the master of the feast breaking bread in asking a blessing"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine—'teaching,' giving themselves up to the instructions which, in their raw state, would be indispensable to the consolidation of the immense multitude suddenly admitted to visible discipleship."
2. "fellowship—in its largest sense."
3. "breaking of bread—not certainly in the Lord's Supper alone, but rather in frugal repasts taken together, with which the Lord's Supper was probably conjoined until abuses and persecution led to the discontinuance of the common meal."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They persevered...adhered to the doctrines and duties of the Christian religion." 
2. "One evidence of conversion is a desire to be instructed in the doctrines and duties of religion, and a willingness to attend on the preaching of the gospel."
3. "The effect of a revival of religion is to unite Christians more and more, and to bring those who were before separated to union and love."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Fellowship [κοινωνια] . From koinov, common. A relation between individuals which involves a common interest and a mutual, active participation in that interest and in each other."
2. "Fellowship is the most common rendering. Thus Philippians 1:5 : 'your fellowship in the gospel,' signifying co - operation in the widest sense; participation in sympathy, suffering, and labor."
3. "Breaking [κλασει] . Used by Luke only, and only in the phrase breaking of bread. Hence used to designate the celebration of the Lord 's Supper."

### John Calvin:
1. "Luke doth not only commend in them the constancy of faith or of godliness, but he saith, also, that they did constantly give themselves to those exercises which serve to the confirmation of faith; to wit, that they studied continually to profit by hearing the apostles; that they gave themselves much to prayer; that they did use fellowship and breaking of bread very much."
2. "Wheresoever the pure voice of the gospel doth sound, where men continue in the profession thereof, where they exercise themselves in hearing the same ordinarily that they may profit, without all doubt there is the Church."
3. "And the Supper is added unto doctrine instead of a confirmation. Wherefore, Luke doth not in vain reckon up these four things, when as he will describe unto us the well-ordered state of the Church."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The teaching of the apostles would especially consist in rehearsing the sayings of Jesus and explaining the doctrines of the faith so far as they were at that time revealed to them."
2. "This word should not be coupled with the apostles' doctrine, as in the Authorized Version; the rendering should be, 'and in fellowship.' Three significations have been proposed for this difficult word."
3. "There is no doubt these words refer to a meal taken in common by the brethren, accompanied by the celebration of the Eucharist, following here the example of the last supper of the Lord."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This partnership involves participation in, as the blood of Christ or co-operation in the work of the gospel or contribution for those in need." 
2. "There can be no doubt that the Eucharist at this period was preceded uniformly by a common repast, as was the case when the ordinance was instituted." 
3. "To simply explain τη κλασε του αρτου as 'The Holy Communion' is to pervert the plain meaning of words, and to mar the picture of family life, which the text places before us as the ideal of the early believers."

### John Gill:
1. "They were constant hearers of it; they continually attended on the ministry of the apostles, and held fast the form of sound words they had received from them; and stood fast in the faith of the Gospel, notwithstanding all the reproach cast upon it, and the afflictions they endured for it."
2. "And so expresses their constant contributions towards the support of the apostles, as ministers of the word and of the poor members of the church; a duty which, in both its branches, is incumbent on those who have it in their power to perform, and which these first Christians were remarkable for."
3. "It seems rather therefore to design, that they were constant at the Lord's table, kept their places there, and duly attended whenever the ordinance was administered."

### John Wesley:
1. "Their daily Church communion consisted in these four particulars: 1. Hearing the word; 2. Having all things common; 3. Receiving the Lord's Supper; 4. Prayer."
2. "Ye diff'rent sects, who all declare, Lo here is Christ, and Christ is there; Your stronger proofs divinely give, And show me where the Christians live!"
