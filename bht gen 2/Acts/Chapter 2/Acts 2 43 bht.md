The extraordinary signs, wonders, and miracles performed by the apostles, coupled with the remarkable preaching of Peter, left a deep impression on the entire community. This reverential fear, born out of witnessing the transformative work of God, restrained opposition and created an atmosphere of solemnity and thoughtfulness. Even those who did not believe in the Gospel were not immune to this sense of awe, which played a crucial role in preserving and advancing the growth of the church.
