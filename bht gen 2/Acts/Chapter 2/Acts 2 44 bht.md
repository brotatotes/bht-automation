# Acts 2:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers in this passage were united not only in their doctrines and religious beliefs but also in their affections and support for one another. They were truly of one heart and soul, assisting each other both spiritually and materially. In fact, they held all their possessions in common, freely sharing and using whatever they had as if it belonged to everyone. This sense of unity and selflessness was unique to the early believers in Jerusalem and served as a powerful example of love and generosity.
