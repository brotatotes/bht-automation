# Acts 2:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The early Christians exhibited an extraordinary level of selflessness and generosity in their approach to possessions. They willingly sold their land and disbursed the proceeds to meet the various needs of the community. This practice was not limited to a particular timeframe but persisted among many believers even after the fall of Jerusalem. Though there was no explicit commandment requiring such action, their love for one another and their commitment to advancing the Gospel compelled them to share their resources willingly. If the entire Christian Church had embraced this mindset, this form of communal sharing could have endured throughout history.
