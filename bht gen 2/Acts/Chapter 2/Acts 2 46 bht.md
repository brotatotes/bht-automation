# Acts 2:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Every day, the disciples would gather in the temple, not forsaking the customs of their fathers but seeking to bring others unto Christ. They also met in private homes, breaking bread together in the context of their meals, not necessarily referring to the Lord's Supper. Their meals were marked by gladness and unity of heart, a reflection of the joy that comes from living a life centered on God. Such a joyful disposition extended to all areas of their lives, as they were constantly devoted to God, even in their simplest actions like eating and working.
