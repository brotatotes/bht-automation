# Acts 2:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Lord daily added to the church those who were saved, not just in a physical sense but in a spiritual sense as well. These were individuals who had been redeemed by the precious blood of Jesus Christ and had been regenerated and sanctified by the Holy Spirit. It is important to understand that it is God who adds people to the church, not men. This highlights the significance of being saved from sins and the power that the Lord has to transform lives.
