# Acts 2:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These devout men, both residents and visitors, had come from various nations, showing their solemn and reverential attention to God in their religious exercises. They were not mere listeners, but people of piety and weight, who had permanently settled in Jerusalem or came on a temporary visit. This diverse gathering of Jews, through the providence of God, had come to Jerusalem for worship, to learn the Hebrew language, and to increase their spiritual knowledge and piety. They were men of religion, piety, faith, and holiness, with the fear of God in their hearts.

1. "The Greek word used here (ϰατοιϰοῡτες) would convey the notion that the foreign Jews here alluded to were ‘residents’ in the city; but the context of the passage forbids us to limit it to residents merely... It includes, then, those who dwelt there permanently, and strangers on a visit to the city."
