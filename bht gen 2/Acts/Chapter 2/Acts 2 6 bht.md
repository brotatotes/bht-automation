# Acts 2:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The loud sound of the rushing wind could not be ignored, reaching even the farthest corners of Jerusalem and grabbing the attention of the entire city. The people were bewildered and uncertain, their minds in a state of chaos as they struggled to make sense of what was happening. These uneducated men, who had no prior knowledge of foreign languages, were now speaking fluently in languages they had never learned. It was a moment of astonishment and wonder, leaving the crowd both confused and amazed at the extraordinary display of God's power.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Whatever τῆς φωνῆς ταύτης may mean, one thing is clear, that it cannot mean, ‘this rumour’... We have then to choose between two things to which φωνή might refer: (1) the ἦχος or Acts 2:2, to which it seems bound by the past part. γενομένης, and (2) the speaking with tongues of Acts 2:4... we may safely decide for the former reference." 
2. "The noise of the rushing mighty wind was heard over all the neighbourhood, probably over all Jerusalem."
3. "Each one heard λαλούντων αὐτῶν, i.e. either various disciples speaking various tongues, each in some one only: or the same persons speaking now one now another tongue. The former is more probable, although the latter seems to agree with some expressions in 1 Corinthians 14:0."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "When this was noised abroad - When the rumor of this remarkable transaction was spread, as it naturally would be.Were confounded - συνεχύθη sunechuthē̄. The word used here means literally 'to pour together,' hence, 'to confound, confuse.'" (29 words)
2. "They did not understand this; they could not account for it.Every man heard them speak ... - Though the multitude spoke different tongues, yet they now heard Galileans use the language which they had learned in foreign nations." (31 words)
3. "The effect of what they saw was to confound them, to astonish them, and to throw them into deep perplexity... So the effect of a revival of religion is often to convince the multitude that it is indeed a work of the Holy One; to amaze them by the display of his power; and to silence opposition and cavil by the manifest presence and the power of God." (82 words)
