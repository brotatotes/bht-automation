# Acts 2:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The enumeration of nations in this passage serves to emphasize the universality of the miraculous event taking place in Jerusalem. By mentioning Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and Jews from different regions, the magnitude of the miracle is showcased. The list is not based on languages but on territorial divisions, with Judea representing the Aramaic language spoken by the disciples. This diverse representation of languages and regions underscores the widespread impact of the Gospel message. It is a reminder that the power of the Holy Spirit transcends linguistic and geographical boundaries, reaching people from all walks of life.
