# Acts 20:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul, like Elijah and Elisha, fell on the man and embraced him with prayer, a sign of tenderness and compassion. This act, reminiscent of the resurrection stories in the Old Testament, not only aimed to restore the man's life but also to comfort and reassure the believers present. The scene was marked by passionate outcries and deep sorrow, yet Paul's unwavering faith and calmness stood in stark contrast. Ultimately, the man's life was returned to him, confirming the power of prayer and God's work through his chosen servants.

1. "The example here of Elijah when he restored to life the dead son of the widow of Zarephath (1 Kings 17:21), and of Elisha when he raised from the dead the only child of his kind Shunammite hostess (2 Kings 4:34), is here closely imitated by this other favoured servant of the Eternal God."
2. "The accurate and vivid picture given us here by the compiler of the ‘Acts,’ tells us how lasting an impression the whole scene made upon the companion of Paul."

2. "Embracing" - (συνπεριλαβων). Second aorist active participle of συνπεριλαμβανω, old verb to embrace completely (take hold together round), but only here in the N.T. In Ezra 5:3.
3. "Make ye no ado" - (μη θορυβεισθε). Stop (μη and present middle imperative of θορυβεω) making a noise (θορυβος) as the people did on the death of Jairus's daughter (Matthew 9:23 θορυβουμενου and Mark 5:38 θορυβου) when Jesus asked Τ θορυβεισθε? For his life is in him - (η γαρ ψυχη αυτου εν αυτω εστιν).
