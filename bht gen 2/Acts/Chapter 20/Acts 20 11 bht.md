# Acts 20:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After the accident, the breaking of bread had been postponed, but they eventually gathered again in the upper room to continue their fellowship. The bread for the meal was truly broken, symbolizing their unity and sharing in the faith. This breaking of bread mentioned here is different from the celebration of the Lord's Supper. The disciples spent a long time talking together, discussing the teachings of the Gospel and sharing their spiritual experiences until dawn, without knowing when to stop. Even after such a long discourse, Paul did not rest but departed to continue his mission.
