# Acts 20:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When individuals choose to passively listen to the Word without truly internalizing its meaning or allowing it to transform their lives, they are akin to those who fall into a deep sleep during a sermon. Just as these people unknowingly distance themselves from the reality of the message, they also risk drifting further from the truth and entering into a state of eternal death, from which there is no awakening. It is crucial for each person to actively engage with the Word, embrace its teachings, and allow it to deeply impact their lives.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "As in the raising of Jairus‚Äôs daughter, our Lord commanded that something should be given her to eat, that nature might be recruited, so doubtless here rest and treatment were necessary, in order that the restored life might be confirmed, and the shock recovered."
2. "The time indicated by Œ±·ΩêŒ≥ŒÆ must have been before or about 5 A.M.: which would allow about four hours since the miracle."
3. "Paul, we learn afterwards, Acts 20:13, intended to go afoot. And accordingly here we have it simply related that he started away from Troas before his companions, not remaining for the reintroduction of the now recovered Eutychus in Acts 20:12."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 10-12. Paul . . . fell on him‚Äîlike

3. "They felt, then, these Christians of Troas, in a way possibly they had never felt before, that, when two or three were gathered together, there the Lord was indeed in the midst."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They brought the lad alive...He had been taken up dead and now they brought him living." 
2. "Not a little...that is a great deal." 
3. "This reading pictures the joyful scene over the lad's restoration as Paul was leaving."

### John Gill:
1. "And they brought the young man alive....and presented him alive to the disciples..."
2. "...the disciples, at the sight of the young man, who was taken up dead, not only for his sake, but chiefly because by this miracle the Gospel, which the apostle preached, and who was about to depart from them, was greatly confirmed to them."
