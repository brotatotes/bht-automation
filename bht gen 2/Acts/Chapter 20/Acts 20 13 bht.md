# Acts 20:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul chose to walk alone to Assos, while his companions went ahead by ship. This decision allowed him to spend more time with the believers in Troas. Despite having a sleepless night, Paul valued the fellowship of his Christian brethren. The journey to Assos by land was not an easy one, as the city was difficult and dangerous to access. However, Paul's determination to be with the believers outweighed the challenges of the route.
