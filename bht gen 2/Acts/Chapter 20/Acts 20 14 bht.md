The apostle Paul arrived in Mitylene, the capital city of the beautiful and classical island of Lesbos. Mitylene, renowned for its picturesque setting and magnificent architecture, was located about thirty miles from Assos. It held historical significance as the birthplace of notable figures like Sappho and the poet Alcaeus. In Mitylene, Paul met the brethren and embarked on his journey. The city's rich history included being the native place of Pittacus, one of Greece's seven wise men, and its mention in the Chalcedon council in the fifth century attested to its religious and political importance.
