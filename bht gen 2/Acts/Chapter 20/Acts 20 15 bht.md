# Acts 20:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Chios, an island of extraordinary beauty, was located between Lesbos and Samos. It had a reputation for its remarkable wines. As the journey continued, they sailed past Ephesus to save time, possibly because Paul had some authority over the ship. Miletus, an ancient city near the mouth of the Meander river, was once a powerful and influential city but had been declining in importance. It is now mostly a swamp with few ruins, and it seemed that at the time of Paul's visit, there were no brethren, elders, or church present.
