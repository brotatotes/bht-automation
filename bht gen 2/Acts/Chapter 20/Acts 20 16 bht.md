# Acts 20:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul had made up his mind to sail past Ephesus and not stop there, as he was concerned that he would be delayed by the people there. His intention was to avoid spending time in Asia because he was in a hurry to reach Jerusalem for the upcoming day of Pentecost. It wasn't just about keeping the feast, but rather Paul's desire to preach the Gospel to a large gathering of Jews from various countries who would be present at the feast.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We see here that the ship was at Paul’s disposal, and probably hired at Philippi, or rather at Neapolis, for the voyage to Patara."
2. "The separation of Paul and Luke from the rest at the beginning of the voyage may have been in some way connected with the hiring or out-fit of this vessel."
3. "The expression κεκρίκει is too subjectively strong to allow of our supposing that the Apostle merely followed the previously determined course of a ship in which he took a passage."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For Paul had determined to sail by—or "sail past." Ephesus—He was right opposite to it when approaching Chios."
2. "because he would not spend time in Asia—the Asian province of which Ephesus was the chief city."
3. "for he hasted, if . . . possible . . . to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost—as a suitable season for giving in the great collection from all the western churches, for keeping the feast, and clearing his apostolic position with the Church, then represented in large number at Jerusalem."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To sail by Ephesus - The word 'by' in our translation is ambiguous. We say to go by a place, meaning either to take it in our way and to go to it, or to go past it. Here it means the latter. He intended to sail past Ephesus without going to it."
2. "For he hasted ... - Had he gone to Ephesus, he would probably have been so delayed in his journey that he could not reach Jerusalem at the time of Pentecost."
3. "The day of Pentecost - See the notes on Acts 2:1."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "To spend time [χρονοτριβησαι] . Only here in New Testament."
2. "The word carries the suggestion of a waste of time, being compounded with tribw, to rub; to wear out by rubbing."
3. "The sense is nearly equivalent to our expression, fritter away time."

### John Calvin:
1. "Forasmuch as he did hope that he might do some good in such a great assembly, he would not foreslow [neglect] the opportunity."
2. "Let us know that the worship of the law − (409) was not the cause that he made so great haste, but he set before his eyes the edifying of the Church."
3. "Moreover, it appeareth more plainly by the text, [context] that those are called elders, not which were grey-headed, but such as were rulers of the Church."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He would not himself revisit the old scene of his ‘two years’ labour, lest the many friends and their pressing solicitations, and the varied questions they would of course have laid before him, should have delayed his voyage." 
2. "He knew such a mark of respect for the sacred Hebrew custom would be pleasing to the stricter Jewish Christians."
3. "He was also especially desirous to present the generous gifts contributed by the Gentile churches to their distressed brethren of the Holy City in presence of the vast concourse of foreign Jews who would, of course, be present at the great Pentecostal feast, and thus spread abroad in all lands the great fact that even the Gentile members of the new and suspected sect of Christians loved, with a deep love, their Jewish brethren."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul clearly felt (Acts 20:15) that the presentation of this collection at Pentecost to the Jewish Christians would have a wholesome influence as it had done once before (Acts 11:30)." 
2. "If it were possible for him (ε δυνατον ειη αυτω). Condition of the fourth class (optative mode), if it should be possible for him. The form is a remote possibility. It was only some thirty days till Pentecost." 
3. "The day of Pentecost (την ημεραν της πεντηκοστης). Note the accusative case. Paul wanted to be there for the whole day."

### John Gill:
1. "For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus,.... That is, to sail by it, without calling at it, as he did, for it lay by the shore before he came to Miletus; but he chose not to stop there, fearing he should be detained by the brethren there:" 
2. "because he would not spend the time in Asia; of which Ephesus was the metropolis:for he hasted, if it were possible, for him to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost: which was near at hand"
3. "And his great desire to be at the feast of Pentecost was not in order to keep that feast, according to the usage of the Jews; but that he might have an opportunity of preaching the Gospel to a great number of Jews, out of all countries, whom he knew would come to that feast."
