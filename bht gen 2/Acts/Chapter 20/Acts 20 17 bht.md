# Acts 20:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Sending for the elders of the Church in Ephesus, who are also referred to as bishops in Acts 20:28, Paul emphasized the importance of their role. These elders, who may have also served as bishops, were entrusted with the responsibility of leading the Church. It is possible that during this time, the terms elder and bishop were used interchangeably, similar to the modern-day distinction between a parish rector and their curates.
