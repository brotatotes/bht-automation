## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The evidence furnished by this speech as to the literal report in the Acts of the words spoken by Paul, is most important."
2. "It is a treasure-house of words, idioms, and sentiments, peculiarly belonging to the Apostle himself."
3. "He reminds the elders of his conduct among them: announces to them his final separation from them: and commends earnestly to them the flock committed to their charge, for which he himself had by word and work disinterestedly laboured."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Ye know ... after what manner I have been with you at all seasons."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The discourse which follows is one of the most tender, affectionate, and eloquent which is anywhere to be found."
2. "No man can read it without being convinced that it came from a heart full of love and kindness."
3. "It is strong evidence of the holiness of the character of the apostles, and proof that they were not impostors, that they could thus appeal with the utmost assurance to those who had every opportunity of knowing them."

### John Calvin:
1. "For that is the true kind of censure, and by this means is authority purchased to doctrine, when the teacher prescribeth nothing − (412) which he himself hath not done indeed before."
2. "There is nothing less tolerable in the servants of Christ than ambition and vanity; but forasmuch as all men knew full well what modesty and humility was in the holy man, he needed not to fear lest he should incur the suspicion of vain boasting."
3. "He doth, indeed, greatly extol his labors, patience, fortitude, and other virtues, but to what end? Surely not that he may purchase commendation at the hands of his auditory, but that his holy exhortation may pierce more deeply, and may stick fast in their minds."

### Philip Schaff:
