### John Calvin:
1. "He reckoneth up first not only in what straits he was, but most of all his humility, coupled with contempt of the world, and rebukes, and other afflictions; as if he should say , that he was not honorably received or with commendation; but he was conversant among them under the contemptible form of the cross."

1. "The intense sympathy and love among the early Christians is most noteworthy.

2. "The revelation that God could so care for men as to weep for them, taught men the glorious beauty of mutual sympathy. Paul‚Äôs intense sorrow for ‚Äòsouls that will not be redeemed‚Äô has been imitated and copied faithfully by many a noble heart in the long eventful story of Christianity."
