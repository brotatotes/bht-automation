# Acts 20:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As ministers of the gospel, we must judge what is profitable for our congregation, not withholding any truths from fear of offense. It is not sufficient to simply preach publicly; we must also teach privately, thoroughly instructing our flock to lead them to salvation. Following the example of Paul, who openly and candidly taught in different settings, we should promote the welfare of our people, confirm their knowledge of the doctrines, and encourage the practice of every virtue. By doing so, we ensure their spiritual growth and profit, leaving no room for error or immorality.
