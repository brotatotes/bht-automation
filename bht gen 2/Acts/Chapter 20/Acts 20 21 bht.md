# Acts 20:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Repentance toward God is not a legalistic response, but a response that stems from experiencing the love and grace of God, accompanied by hopeful faith in Christ. On the other hand, faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ is not simply a mental acknowledgement of truth, but a deep spiritual act of the soul that looks to, depends on, and trusts in Jesus for every aspect of salvation. These two elements, repentance and faith, form the essence of the apostle's ministry and are foundational to the Christian faith.

2. "FAITH is said to be 'toward our Lord Jesus Christ,' because in that frame of mind just described it eagerly credits the testimony of relief divinely provided in Christ, gladly embraces the overtures of reconciliation in Him, and directs all its expectations of salvation, from its first stage to its last, to Him as the one appointed Medium of all grace from God to a sinful world."

### John Gill:
1. "The former of these is not a legal repentance, but an evangelical one; which flows from a sense of the love of God, and an application of pardoning grace and mercy, and is always attended with hope, at least of interest in it, and as here with faith in Christ Jesus."
2. "And the latter of these is not an historical faith, or an assent of the mind to whatsoever is true concerning the person, office, and grace of Christ; but is a spiritual act of the soul upon him; it is a looking and going out to him, a laying hold and leaning on him, and trusting in him, for grace, righteousness, peace, pardon, life, and salvation."
3. "Now these two were the sum of the apostle's ministry; this is a breviary or compendium of it; a form of sound words held fast and published by him."
