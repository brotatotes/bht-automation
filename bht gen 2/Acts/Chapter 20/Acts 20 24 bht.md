# Acts 20:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is remarkable that the apostles' expressions of disregarding the world were not made by individuals with full affluence and abundance, such as Seneca or Antoninus, but rather by those who endured great hardships and risked their lives to proclaim the truth. This adds significant weight to their words and demonstrates their true commitment to their purpose. It serves as a reminder for us to prioritize the eternal things of Christ over the passing pleasures of this world.
