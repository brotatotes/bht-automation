## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "If he could regard the elders as the representatives of the various churches, of which there can be no doubt, why may not he similarly have regarded the Ephesian elders as representatives of the churches of proconsular Asia, and have addressed all in addressing them?"
2. "Or may not these words have even a wider application, viz., to all who had been the subjects of his former personal ministry, in Asia and Europe, now addressed through the Ephesian elders?"
3. "I may remark here, that the word οἶδα, in the mouth of Paul, does not necessarily imply that he spoke from divine and unerring knowledge, but expresses his own conviction of the certainty of what he is saying."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I know that ye all . . . shall see my face no more—not an inspired prediction of what was certainly to be, but what the apostle, in his peculiar circumstances, fully expected."
2. "Whether, therefore, he ever did see them again, is a question to be decided purely on its own evidence."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I have no expectation of seeing you again; I have every reason to suppose that this is my final interview with you."
2. "The parting of a minister and people is among the most tender and affecting of the separations that occur on earth."
3. "Making known the nature of the reign of God on earth by the Messiah."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. I know. The I is emphatic : I know through these special revelations to myself (ver. 23).

### John Calvin:
1. "And, behold, now I know. He doth now utter that plainly which he had insinuated covertly."
2. "For we know what great force the words and speeches of men have which are uttered at their departure or death."
3. "Also, he would have them beware by this forewarning, that they do not depend upon his presence, and so their faith should faint through wearisomeness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Here Paul expresses his own conviction that he will no more look in life on the faces of his Ephesian brothers in the faith."
2. "We must, however, by no means suppose that even an apostle was gifted at all times with Divine and unerring knowledge. Here it is almost certain he was mistaken in his foreboding."
3. "We can even trace the gradual fading away of these fond hopes of the Christians of the first day, who only came gradually to see that the return of the Master in judgment was no event of the immediate future, but that the time of His coming was hid in the dim far future."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "And now, behold...I know...Ye all." 
2. "Twice Paul will write from Rome...but that is in the future, and here Paul is expressing his personal conviction and his fears." 
3. "There need be no surprise that Paul's fears turned out otherwise. He had reason enough for them."

### John Gill:
1. "I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more; the sense is, that none of them should ever see him again, none of the churches of Asia, or the members of them."
2. "Among whom he had been some years preaching the Gospel, the things concerning the Messiah, his kingdom and glory, and the meetness of the saints for, and their right unto the heavenly inheritance, prepared by God, and given by him to all that love him."
3. "Beza's ancient copy reads, 'the kingdom of Jesus': this the apostle knew by divine revelation, by the same spirit in which he was going bound to Jerusalem, though he knew not whether he should die there or elsewhere; however, he knew, and was persuaded, he should visit these parts no more."

### John Wesley:
1. Ye shall see my face no more — He wisely inserts this, that what follows might make the deeper impression.
