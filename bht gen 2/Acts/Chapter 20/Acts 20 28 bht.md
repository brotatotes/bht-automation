# Acts 20:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Take heed therefore, as Paul emphasizes, to the responsibility of caring for yourselves and the flock entrusted to you. The Holy Spirit has appointed you as overseers, not by human authority, but by His divine calling. The analogy of the flock likens the precious people of God, gathered together in the Church, to sheep under the care of shepherds appointed by Christ. This flock, small in size but dear to God, requires special attention and nurturing. Remember that the Church of God, purchased at a great cost with the blood of Christ, is to be fed and guided with utmost care.
