# Acts 20:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After his departure, two distinct classes of false teachers were predicted by Paul. The first, referred to as grievous wolves, would come from other cities to Ephesus. These wolves were described as heavy and rapacious, indicating their violent and sneaky nature. The second class would arise from within the community itself, speaking perverse things and seeking to draw a party after them. Paul exhorted the pastors to be watchful, as their duty is to protect the Church against all who seek to corrupt it.

2. "Grievous wolves - Heavy βαρεῖς bareis, strong, mighty, dangerous wolves - so strong that the feeble flock would not be able to resist them. The term 'wolves' is used to denote 'the enemies of the flock - false, and hypocritical, and dangerous teachers.'"
3. "Not sparing the flock - Seeking to destroy the church. The Jews would regard it with special hostility, and would seek to destroy it in every way. Probably they would approach them with great professed friendship for them, and expressing a desire only to defend the laws of Moses."
