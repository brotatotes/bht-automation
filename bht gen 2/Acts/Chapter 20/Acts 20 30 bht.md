# Acts 20:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage warns about the dangers of false teachers emerging from within the church community itself. These individuals pervert the true teachings of the Gospel, leading others astray and causing division within the church. It is crucial for believers to be vigilant and discerning, recognizing the subtle deceptions that can arise even among those who were once part of their own flock. The impact of false teachings can have far-reaching consequences, both on the individual disciples and the unity of the body of Christ.
