## BHT:
Believers are encouraged to place their trust in God and His grace, which is communicated through His Word. The Word of His grace serves as a means to supply the spiritual needs of both believers and non-believers.

It is important for believers to recognize that even after coming to know Christ, they still benefit from the teachings and guidance of human teachers.
