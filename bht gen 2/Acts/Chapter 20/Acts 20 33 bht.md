# Acts 20:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, the apostle Paul is not only defending himself against accusations of avarice, but also providing guidance to fellow elders. He warns against the sin of covetousness, emphasizing that it has no place in the ministry of the word. Additionally, he is highlighting the character of false teachers who would exploit others for personal gain. This message is reminiscent of Samuel's farewell speech to the Israelites in which he too acknowledged his integrity.
