# Acts 20:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle Paul, in his humility and dedication to his ministry, worked with his own hands to provide for his needs and the needs of those with him. He did not seek to depend on others for support but instead set an example of self-sufficiency. These hands, worn and calloused from labor, testify to his integrity and serve as a rebuke to those who may envy or question the sincerity of such a dedicated servant of God.
