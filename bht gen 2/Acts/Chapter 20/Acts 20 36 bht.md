# Acts 20:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Kneeling down in prayer is not the only proper posture, but it is certainly fitting. The act of kneeling was a common gesture used by Christ and others. It appears that during the time between the Passover and Pentecost, which is when this event took place, the custom of not kneeling in prayer had not yet been established. In this particular instance, the apostle and the elders prayed together, undoubtedly for the welfare of all those present.
