# Acts 20:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As their departure loomed, there was a great weeping among them, for they knew they would see him no more. This outpouring of tears was not meaningless, but a reflection of their profound grief at losing a truly cherished man. They embraced him tightly and repeatedly kissed him, a customary sign of affection. The intensity of their emotions was not to be dismissed as mere sentimentality; rather, it revealed the deep love and respect they felt for him. These displays of affection are not weaknesses, but rather beautiful demonstrations of the bonds that unite the body of Christ.
