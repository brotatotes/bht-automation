# Acts 20:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is a deeply solemn occasion when ministers and their congregations have to part ways, filled with tenderness and affection. True faith softens the heart, making friendships more sacred and love stronger. When ministers bid farewell, they should do so with the same fidelity and love expressed by Paul. It is no wonder that the people who accompanied Paul to his departure were sorrowful, as his words touched their hearts. Such partings remind us of the profound sorrow that will accompany those who are told they will never see the face of God again.
