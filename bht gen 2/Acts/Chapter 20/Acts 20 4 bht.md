# Acts 20:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Some of Paul's companions left him in Asia, but Trophimus remained with him all the way to Jerusalem, as mentioned in Acts 21:29. Aristarchus, on the other hand, stayed with Paul until they reached Rome, as we can read about in Acts 27:2.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is not hereby implied that they went no further than to Asia."
2. "The name Πύῤῥου has been erased as that of an unknown person, and because the mention of the father is unusual in the N. T."
3. "The Gaius here is not the Gaius of ch. Acts 19:29, who was a Macedonian."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The mention of his father was to distinguish him from Sosipater mentioned in Romans 16:21 but that they were the same person seems more probable."
2. "Though the Gaius of Acts 19:29 is said to be of 'Macedonia,' and this one 'of Derbe,' there is no sufficient reason for supposing them different persons; on the contrary, Romans 16:23 seems to show that though he spent an important part of his Christian life away from his native Derbe, he had latterly retired to some place not very far from it."
3. "They seem to have put themselves, from this time forward, at the apostle's disposal, and to the very last been a great comfort to him."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was usual for some of the disciples to attend the apostles in their journeys."
2. "Tychicus... [was] high in the confidence and affection of Paul."
3. "Trophimus... [was] from Ephesus."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "So pater. The best texts add, the son of Pyrrhus. Compare Romans 16:21."
2. "Aristarchus. Compare Acts 19:29."
3. "Gaius. Not the one mentioned in ch. 19 29, who was a Macedonian. Tychicus and Trophimus. See Colossians 4:7, Colossians 4:8; Ephesians 6:21, Ephesians 6:22; 2 Timothy 4:12; Titus 3:2; Acts 21:29; 2 Timothy 4:20."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Of these companions of the apostles three were natives of Macedonia and four of Asia Minor."
2. "The supposition that they acted as a bodyguard to St. Paul, and that they were seven in number, to correspond with the number of the deacons (chap. Acts 6:3-5), must be dismissed as purely fanciful."
3. "The names of the persons of this little company with which he found himself so intimately associated were graven on the mind of the compiler of the memoir."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The phrase could apply only to Sopatros." 
2. "It is not clear though probable that Luke means to say that these seven brethren, delegates of the various churches... started from Corinth with Paul."
3. "Paul took the utmost pains to remove any opportunity for scandal in the handling of the funds."

### John Gill:
1. "Sopater of Berea...is thought to be the same with Sosipater in Romans 16:21...he is so called here" 
2. "Aristarchus... appears to be of Thessalonica" 
3. "Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus...should be of the same place"

### John Wesley:
1. To Asia — There some of them left him. But Trophimus went with him to Jerusalem, Acts 21:29. Aristarchus, even to Rome, Acts 27:2.
