# Acts 20:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul and his companions set sail from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, which is mentioned to indicate the time of year. The voyage from Philippi to Troas typically took two days, but due to adverse winds, it took them five days. During their stay in Troas, which lasted seven days, Paul and his companions took the opportunity to engage in fellowship and preach the Word to the local believers. St. Luke rejoined Paul during this period, as indicated by the passage's wording.
