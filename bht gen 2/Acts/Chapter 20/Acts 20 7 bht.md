# Acts 20:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On this day, the apostles and early churches gathered for religious exercises, including the celebration of the Lord's Supper. The disciples in Troas met on the first day of the week, and the apostle Paul, along with others, joined them in this assembly. During this gathering, Paul passionately delivered a lengthy discourse, indicative of his deep affection and desire to edify these believers. It is evident that the breaking of bread in the context of the Lord's Supper and the fervent continuation of the discourse were essential aspects of their worship.
