# Acts 20:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Eutychus was sitting in a window, most likely left open to provide relief from the heat of the lamps and the crowd. It is unlikely that he purposely chose such a dangerous spot to fall asleep in. While it may appear that Satan had a hand in this event, seeking to harm Eutychus and bring reproach upon the church and the Gospel, it is clear that God's providence was also at work. Eutychus was truly dead, and this should come as no surprise.

3. "I would ask any unbiassed reader, taking these details into consideration, which of the two is the natural interpretation, and whether there can be any reasonable doubt that the intent of Luke is to relate a miracle of raising the dead, and that he mentions the falling on and embracing him as the outward significant means taken by the Apostle to that end?"
