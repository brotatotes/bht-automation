# Acts 21:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The departure from Miletus was a deeply emotional separation, similar to the tearing away of loved ones or the separating of limbs from a body. Such was the unbreakable bond of Christian love. The journey continued to the island of Cos, known for its renowned medical school and vibrant trading community, including a large population of Jews. The next destination was Patara, a port city with a temple dedicated to Apollo, whose oracle was esteemed as highly as the one in Delphi. This voyage held both physical and spiritual significance, illustrating the strength and determination of the early Christians.
