# Acts 21:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Paul and his companions stayed in Caesarea for an extended period of time, they were visited by a prophet named Agabus, who had also prophesied about a famine in the past. This prophet had been traveling and prophesying for several years, and now he came down to Caesarea to meet Paul. The predictions of Agabus served as a preparation for Paul, allowing him to be ready for the event that was soon to take place.

2. "So this spectacle, mentioned by Luke, did no less move Paul’s companions, than if they had seen him bound in deed."
