# Acts 21:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Agabus, the Christian prophet, imitated the symbolic acts of the Old Testament prophets by binding his own feet and hands, using a vivid and dramatic gesture to reveal to Paul the specific danger that awaited him in Jerusalem. This prophetic action, led by the Holy Spirit, predicted the binding and imprisonment of Paul by the Jews, which ultimately came to pass as foretold. The use of symbolic acts and gestures by prophets, such as the binding of feet and hands, was a common practice in the Old Testament to deliver powerful prophecies.
