## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The τότε, which has been changed in the rec. for the ordinary copula, gives solemnity to the answer about to be related: q. d. It was then that Paul said."
2. "The present part. does not imply the endeavour merely, here or anywhere else, but as Meyer quotes from Schaefer, Eurip. Phœn. 79, ‘Vere incipit actus, sed ob impedimenta caret eventu.'"
3. "Either, 'your proceeding is in vain, for …' or 'cease to do so, for .…'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Beautiful union of manly resoluteness and womanly tenderness, alike removed from mawkishness and stoicism!"
2. "If that is all, let it come."
3. "It was well he could add this, for he had that also to do."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Expressions of tenderness among friends are proper. Tears may be inevitable at parting from those whom we love. But such expressions of love ought not to be allowed to interfere with the convictions of duty in their minds."
2. "If they have made up their minds that a certain course is proper, and have resolved to pursue it, we ought neither to attempt to divert them from it, nor to distract their minds by our remonstrances or our tears."
3. "We should cheerfully and confidently commit them to the protection of the God whom they serve, and remember that the parting of Christians, though for life, will be short."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. I am ready [ετοιμως εχω] . Lit., 1 hold myself in readiness.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But Paul, in spite of these reiterated prophecies, notwithstanding the loving and affectionate entreaties of his friends, saw clearly the Divine will and his own plain duty through all this cloud of hindrances, and held on to his first purpose without flinching."
2. "He was an old man, wearied with ceaseless toils and worn with sickness and anxiety. The chance of meeting so great a concourse of Jews in the Holy City might never occur again; so for his work’s sake, for the sake of the many flourishing churches he had founded, he would do his best to disprove the false rumours so widely disseminated concerning his teaching."
3. "Far down the stream of Christian centuries, another famous Christian leader, an ardent and devoted follower of Paul, when similarly warned of coming danger, resolutely replied to his friends in the spirit of Paul."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Breaking my heart (συνθρυπτοντες μου την καρδιαν). The verb συνθρυπτω, to crush together, is late Koine for αποθρυπτω, to break off, both vivid and expressive words. So to enervate and unman one, weakening Paul's determination to go on with his duty."
2. "I am ready (Εγω ετοιμως εχω). I hold (myself) in readiness (adverb, ετοιμως). Same idiom in 2 Corinthians 12:14."
3. "Not only to be bound (ου μονον δεθηνα). First aorist passive infinitive of δεω and note ου μονον rather than μη μονον, the usual negative of the infinitive because of the sharp contrast (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1095). Paul's readiness to die, if need be, at Jerusalem is like that of Jesus on the way to Jerusalem the last time."

### John Gill:
1. "For they were crying about him, both his companions and the disciples of Caesarea; which affected him, and gave him great uneasiness, even more than the prophecies of Agabus did."
2. "Yet their tears and importunity greatly afflicted him, and the more because he could by no means comply with their request."
3. "Bonds were so far from distressing his mind, and deterring him from his intended journey, that death itself could not do it; which showed great intrepidity, courage, and firmness of mind."

### John Wesley:
1. "Breaking my heart - For the apostles themselves were not void of human affections."
2. "I am ready not only to be bound, but to die - And to him that is ready for it, the burden is light."
