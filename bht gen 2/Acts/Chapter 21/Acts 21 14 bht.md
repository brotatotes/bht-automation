# Acts 21:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The friends' response to Paul's determination to go to Jerusalem may seem stubborn, but it is in fact a strong display of Christian resolve. They understood that the ultimate authority lies in the will of the Lord, and they were willing to submit to it, even if it meant facing difficulties. Their unwavering faith in God's plan exemplifies the level of trust and obedience that we, as believers, should strive to emulate in our own lives.
