# Acts 21:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As the events leading up to this moment unfolded, Paul's companions made the decision to care for the safety of the Church over their own lives. Despite facing resistance, they did not shy away from sharing in the danger with Paul. In their commitment to God, they acted to please Him, unyielding in their efforts. The carriages they took up referred to the baggage they carried, not only consisting of physical belongings but also the precious alms collected for the Church in Jerusalem.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The rec. ἀποσκευασάμενοι (which may perhaps have arisen from the mixture of ἀποταξάμενοι (D) with ἐπισκευασάμενοι), would mean, not, ‘having deposited our (useless) baggage,’ but, ‘having discharged our baggage,’ ‘unpacked the matters necessary for our journey to Jerusalem, from our coffers.’ But ἐπισκ. is the better supported reading, and suits the passage better: having packed up, made ourselves ready for the journey."
2. "'Carriages' in the E. V. is used, as at Judges 18:21 (where it answers to τὸ βάρος, LXX-B), for baggage, things carried."
