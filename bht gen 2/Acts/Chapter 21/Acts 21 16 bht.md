# Acts 21:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The early Christians showed great hospitality, especially when it came to introducing visitors to important figures in the faith. This was the case when the disciples accompanied Paul to Jerusalem to introduce him to Mnason, an old disciple and possibly one of the original followers of Jesus. Mnason, originally from Cyprus, was not just a resident of Jerusalem, but an esteemed member of the Jerusalem Church. His presence served as a reminder that discipleship extended beyond the boundaries of Galilee and Judæa, and that the early believers continued to honor those who had walked with Jesus during his ministry.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The probability of Mnason being a resident at Jerusalem, and of the Cæsarean brethren going to introduce the company to him, seems to favour the  latter."
2. "Of Mnason nothing further is known."
3. "ἀρχαίῳ probably implies that he had been a disciple ἐξ ἀρχῆς , and had accompanied our Lord during His ministry."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "One Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, c.—not an 'aged' disciple, but probably 'a disciple of old standing,' perhaps one of the three thousand converted on the day of Pentecost, or, more likely still, drawn to the Saviour Himself during His lifetime."
2. "The apostle was full of anxiety about this visit to Jerusalem, from the numerous prophetic intimations of danger awaiting him."
3. "Hence we find him asking the Roman Christians to wrestle with him in prayer, 'for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that he might be delivered from them that believed not in Judea,' as well as 'that his service which he had for Jerusalem (the great collection for the poor saints there) might be accepted of the saints'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "An old disciple - An early convert to Christianity - perhaps one who was converted before the crucifixion of the Saviour."
2. "The rites of hospitality were shown in a distinguished manner by the early Christians."
3. "It is evident that, though Mnason was originally of Cyprus, yet he was now an inhabitant of Jerusalem, and was well known to the disciples at Caesarea."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Bringing with them, etc. This would imply that Mnason was at Caesarea, and accompanied Paul and his companions to Jerusalem."
2. "It seems better to suppose that the disciples accompanied the apostle in order to introduce him to Mnason, whom they knew."
3. "The rendering old might be taken to mean aged; whereas the word means of long standing."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The chief object apparently of the Cæsarean brethren in accompanying Paul to Jerusalem, was to introduce them to this Mnason, who was prepared to receive them as his guests."
2. "Mnason was no doubt an important person in the Jerusalem Church; he is styled ‘an old or an early disciple,’ and was possibly converted during the life of our Lord Himself."
3. "If so, it is interesting as showing that our Lord’s disciples were not limited to the natives of Galilee and Judæa."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "The use of αρχαιω for 'early' may refer to the fact that he was one of the original disciples at Pentecost."
