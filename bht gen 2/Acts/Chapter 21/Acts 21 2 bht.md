# Acts 21:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Having found a ship sailing over unto Phoenicia, Paul and his companions embarked. However, it appears that their original ship stopped at Assos, not continuing on the same path as the apostle. But fortuitously, they came across another ship bound for Phoenicia, specifically the city of Tyre, which was adjacent to the land of Israel. This unexpected turn of events ensured that not a day was lost in Paul's mission to reach his destination.
