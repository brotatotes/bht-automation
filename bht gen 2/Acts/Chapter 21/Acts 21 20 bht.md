# Acts 21:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The believers in Jerusalem praised and glorified God when they heard about the incredible spread of the Gospel among the Gentiles and the countless conversions. It was remarkable to them to see such a large number of Jews embracing the Christian faith. Despite this, many were still zealous for the law, holding on to the observance of the Mosaic rituals. It is puzzling why they continued in this way, especially since the apostles themselves understood that the old dispensation was being abolished.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "While they praised God for, and fully recognized, the work wrought by him among the Gentiles, they found it requisite to advise him respecting the suspicion under which he laboured among the believing Jews."
2. "They, led, naturally perhaps, but incorrectly, by some passages of Paul’s life (and of his already written Epistles?), in which he had depreciated legal observances in comparison with faith in Christ, and spoken strongly against their adoption by Gentile converts, apprehended that he advised on the part of the Hellenistic believers, an entire apostasy from Moses and the ordinances of the law."
3. "θεωρεῖς This can hardly be a reference to the elders present, as representatives of the μυριάδες of believing Jews; but refers to Paul’s own experience, and knowledge of the vast numbers of the Jews who believed at Jerusalem, and elsewhere in Judæa."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 20-25. they glorified the Lord,
	&c.—constrained to justify his course, notwithstanding the
	Jewish complexion of the Christianity of Jerusalem.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "True piety will rejoice in the spread of the gospel, and in the conversion of sinners, by whatever instrumentality it may be effected."
2. "The number of converts at this time must have been very great... The assertion that there were then 'many thousands,' implies that the work so signally begun on the day of Pentecost in Jerusalem had not ceased, and that many more had been converted to the Christian faith."
3. "It may seem remarkable that they should still continue to observe those rites, since it was the manifest design of Christianity to abolish them. But we are to remember... that, in the arrangement of Divine Providence, the time was drawing near which was to destroy the temple, the city, and the nation, which was to put an end to sacrifices, and effectually to close forever the observance of the Mosaic rites."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Thus the Jerusalem elders and James, when they heard the story of the successful missionary apostle, reverently gave thanks to Almighty God for the great work done by the hand of His servant Paul."
2. "We must bear in mind that James was speaking not of the Christian Jews of Jerusalem only, but of that vast multitude which was in the habit of coming up yearly to keep the feast of Pentecost in the Holy City, and who at that moment were present in Jerusalem."
3. "The Jews of the first century in great numbers were willing to acknowledge as Messiah, that Crucified One whom so many had seen after He was risen from the dead; but they were reluctant to give up their privileges as a chosen race, and so they clung to their law and its stern restrictions with an attachment more devoted than ever."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "How many thousands (ποσα μυριαδες). Old word for ten thousand (Acts 19:19) and then an indefinite number like our 'myriads'... But it is a surprising statement even with allowable hyperbole."
2. "Zealots (substantive) rather than zealous (adjective) with objective genitive (του νομου). The word zealot is from ζηλοω, to burn with zeal, to boil."
3. "It is important to understand the issues in Jerusalem. It was settled at the Jerusalem Conference...Paul won freedom for them, but it was not said that it was wrong for Jewish Christians to go on observing it if they wished."

### John Gill:
1. "And when they heard it,.... The narrative of the wonderful spread of the Gospel among the Gentiles, and the numerous conversions of them:they glorified the Lord..."
2. "...thou seest, brother; for so he was to James, both as a believer, and a minister of the word, and as an apostle:how many thousands of Jews there are which believe..."
3. "...and they are all zealous of the law; of the law of Moses, of the ceremonial law, as Paul might see by their being at Jerusalem, to keep this feast..."

### John Wesley:
1. "They are all zealous for the law - For the whole Mosaic dispensation."
2. "Did none of the apostles, beside St. Paul, know that this dispensation was now abolished?"
3. "And if they did both know and testify this, how came their hearers not to believe them?"
