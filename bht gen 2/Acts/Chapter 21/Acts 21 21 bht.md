# Acts 21:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Reports have circulated that Paul is teaching the Jews not to circumcise their children or follow customary practices. The Jewish Christian community is uneasy because Paul's teachings challenge their deeply ingrained beliefs. Paul's letters to the Galatians also emphasize that circumcision is no longer necessary, even for Jews. It's astonishing that the Jewish Christians didn't openly acknowledge the burdensome nature of the Mosaic law or speak out about it. They should have recognized this truth and shared it with every Jewish convert in Jerusalem.

### Albert Barnes:
1. " Reports respecting the conduct of Paul would be likely to be in circulation among all at Jerusalem. His remarkable conversion, his distinguished zeal, his success among the Gentiles would make his conduct a subject of special interest."
2. "The truth appears to have been, that he did not enjoin the observance of those laws on the Gentile converts; that the effect of his ministry on them was to lead them to suppose that their observance was not necessary...and that he argued with the Jews themselves, where it could be done, against the obligation of those laws and customs since the Messiah had come."
3. "The Jews depended on their observance for justification and salvation. This Paul strenuously opposed; and this view he defended at length in the Epistles which he wrote."

### Marvin Vincent:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A widespread feeling existed in Jewish Christian communities that the famous apostle of the Gentiles taught the chosen people 'to forsake Moses,' to give up their cherished rites and ceremonies, to discontinue in their children that peculiar and time-honored custom of circumcision."
2. "Paul never taught the Jewish Christian to abandon the law and the customs of his fathers. He himself, on the contrary, on several occasions conspicuously observed the strictest rites of Judaism."
3. "Yet, as it has been well observed, 'fanaticism is sometimes clear-sighted in its bitterness, and the Judaisers felt that when it was proclaimed that circumcision was nothing in its bearing on man's relations to God,' the day would come at no far distant date when circumcision would cease to be practiced, and the time-honored ceremonial law of Moses, which enjoined it as the initial and principal rite, would become a dead letter."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In Paul's long absence from Jerusalem, since Acts 18:22, they have had a free hand, save what opposition James would give, and have had great success in prejudicing the Jerusalem Christians against Paul." 
2. "That thou art teaching all the Jews among the Gentiles apostasy from Moses." 
3. "The point is not that Paul stated what the Jewish Christians in the dispersion do, but that he says that they are not to go on circumcising their children."

### John Gill:
1. "That he taught the Gentiles not to regard the rituals of the law of Moses gave them no uneasiness; but that he should teach the Jews that were scattered among the Gentiles, and as many of them that believed in Christ, to disregard and drop the observance of them, who had been always brought up in them, this they could not bear." 
2. "The apostle taught that circumcision was abolished, and that it was nothing; yea, that to submit to it as necessary to salvation, was hurtful and pernicious."
