# Acts 21:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
There were four weak believers in Christ from the church in Jerusalem who were zealous for and bigoted to the law, and they had voluntarily taken a vow of the Nazarites. The elders, meaning well, advised Paul to associate with these men to counteract the prejudice against him. However, one might question whether it was necessary to defer so much to the judgment of others.

1. "It is evident that James and the elders meant to say that these men were connected with them in the Christian church; and the fact shows that the Christians at Jerusalem did not disregard the institutions of Moses, and had not been so far enlightened in the doctrines of Christianity as to forsake yet the ceremonial rites of the Jews."
2. "From the mention of shaving the head (in Acts 21:24), it is evident that the vow which they had taken was that of the Nazarite; and that as the time of their vow was about expiring, they were about to be shaven, in accordance with the custom usual on such occasions."
