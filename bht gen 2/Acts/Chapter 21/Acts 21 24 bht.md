# Acts 21:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul should have boldly declared that he does not observe the Mosaic law, just as Peter did not observe it when God commanded him to associate with uncircumcised men and eat with them, which the law strictly prohibits. Paul's compliance with the law regarding the Nazarite vow should not be construed as a validation of the slanderous accusations against him, but rather as a demonstration of his respectful approach towards the Jewish customs.
