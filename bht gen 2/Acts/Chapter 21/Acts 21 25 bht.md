# Acts 21:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This passage serves as a reminder that the Jewish Christians were not offended by Paul's decision regarding the observance of certain customs by Gentile believers. James reiterated the main points of agreement to prevent any confusion or stumbling block for the Gentiles. The purpose was to emphasize that Gentiles were not obligated to follow the Mosaic law, including practices like the Nazarite vow. This had already been clearly determined in a previous council, where it was unanimously agreed upon that Gentiles were not required to observe such customs.
