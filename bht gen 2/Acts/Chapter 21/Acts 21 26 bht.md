# Acts 21:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul, in his desire to accommodate the weaker brethren, willingly participated in the vow with the four men. Though he did not consider the vow necessary for salvation, he did so to alleviate any concerns. As the days of purification approached their end, Paul went to the priests in the temple to inform them. He wanted to show his adherence to the Mosaic law by making the required offering. Even though his actions might be misconstrued as being based on worldly wisdom, he humbly followed the counsel of others to dispel any false accusations.
