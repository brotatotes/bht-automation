# Acts 21:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the seven days were coming to an end and Paul was preparing to complete his vow, he was seized by some Jews from Asia. These Jews, who may have been from Ephesus, had a strong animosity towards Paul and were quick to accuse him of defiling the temple and opposing Moses and his laws. In a violent manner, they grabbed Paul and dragged him out of the temple, interrupting the completion of his vow. This incident took place at the beginning of the seven-day period, as Paul observed the time appointed for his consecration.
