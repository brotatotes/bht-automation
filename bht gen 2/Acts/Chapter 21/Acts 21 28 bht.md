# Acts 21:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The accusations against Paul are twofold: first, that he is teaching against the Jewish nation and the law of Moses, and second, that he has defiled the temple by bringing Greeks into its inner court. In their attempt to create a sense of urgency, the accusers call upon all men to help them, claiming that the very fabric of religion is at stake. However, we should be cautious not to be swayed by blind passions and prejudices, as these can lead us to unjustly accuse the innocent.
