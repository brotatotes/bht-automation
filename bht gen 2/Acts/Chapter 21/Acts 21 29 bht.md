# Acts 21:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Trophimus, an Ephesian, was known to the Asiatic Jews. The accusations against Paul and Trophimus were based on assumptions and inferences rather than facts. The mob-mind and the prejudiced nature of the Jews played a significant role in their hasty conclusions. These accusations were ill-grounded and lacked credibility, as it was highly unlikely that Paul would purposely violate Jewish customs and introduce a Gentile into the holy place. The Jews' readiness to seize any opportunity to oppose Paul reflected their deep-seated hostility towards him.

2. "Thus the temple was really looked upon as including all the courts and buildings which were surrounded by the Court of the Gentiles."

2. "They simply argued that, if Paul was willing to be seen down street with a Greek Christian, he would not hesitate to bring him into the temple, that is into the court of Israel and therefore both Paul and Trophimus were entitled to death."
3. "This is the way of the mob-mind in all ages. Many an innocent man has been rushed to his death by the fury of a lynching party."

### John Gill:
1. "They concluded from thence, that he took him with him into the temple, which was a very rash and ill grounded conclusion..."
2. "...which shows the malignity and virulence of their minds, and how ready they were to make use of any opportunity, and take up any occasion against him..."
3. "...a bare surmise, and which had no show of probability in it; for it can never be thought, that while Paul was using methods to remove the prejudices of the Jews against him, he should take such a step as this, to introduce a Gentile into the holy place, which he knew was unlawful, and would greatly irritate and provoke them."
