# Acts 21:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The metropolis of Phoenicia, Tyre, was located near Caesarea Philippi, and it was known for its production of purple and shellfish. Once an island, it became connected to the mainland by Alexander the Great. In Hebrew, it is called Tzur, meaning rock, or Tzor, which signifies brightness. Sur or Suri is its present name, but it lies abandoned, serving as a haven for criminals. The prophecies in Psalm 87:4 and the biblical references to the Philistines and Ethiopians parallel the diverse geographical connections found in Acts 8:40 and Acts 27:4, highlighting the integration of different regions in the biblical narrative.
