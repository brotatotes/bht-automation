# Acts 21:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The incident in the temple caused a commotion that quickly spread throughout the city. The people took hold of Paul and removed him from the temple to prevent any defilement of the holy place. The doors were shut to prevent Paul from seeking refuge at the altar and to keep the Gentiles from entering. This event serves as a reminder of the hasty judgment and actions of the common people, as well as the need for believers to be prepared to endure opposition and persecution.
