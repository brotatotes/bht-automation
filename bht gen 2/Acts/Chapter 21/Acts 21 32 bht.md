# Acts 21:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The chief captain, or tribune of the Roman cohort, displayed remarkable vigilance and quick action, with evident divine providence at work. The mention of a severe beating reflects the punishment for rebellion and obstinacy, distinct from regular whippings. This form of punishment was inflicted on various offenders, particularly those who disregarded warnings or committed forbidden acts. These actions demonstrate both the tribune's authority and the severe consequences faced by those who challenged the established order.
