# Acts 21:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul, assumed to be a criminal, was commanded to be bound with two chains by the chief captain to keep the peace and show that he had no intention of rescuing anyone from justice. This act of binding Paul not only demonstrated the captain's determination for justice to be done, but also fulfilled the prophecy of Agabus. Despite being in custody, this imprisonment served as a means of preserving Paul's life and giving him the opportunity to safely preach the Gospel amidst the tumultuous circumstances.
