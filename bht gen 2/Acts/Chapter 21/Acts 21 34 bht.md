# Acts 21:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The raging crowd at the fortress of Antonia betrayed their madness and confusion, echoing the cries heard in Ephesus. Their misguided desire to put him to death, despite his innocence, stemmed from a blind zeal for the law and temple. Amidst the chaotic shouts, it became impossible to determine the truth. Thus, Paul was brought into the castle as a safeguard against the angry multitude, into the fortress built by King Herod and named after his friend Antony, the Roman general.
