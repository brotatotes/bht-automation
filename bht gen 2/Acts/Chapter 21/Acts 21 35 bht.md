# Acts 21:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The steps leading up into the tower, the castle of Antonia, were situated at the corner where the western and northern porticos of the temple joined. This fortified castle, built with large stones, served to protect the areas surrounding the temple. Perched on a rock fifty cubits high, it provided a strategic vantage point. The castle, equipped with sharp darts and various instruments, was a formidable stronghold on a great eminence. Such was the intensity of the people's rage against Paul that the soldiers were compelled to carry him, ensuring his safety from their violent intentions.
