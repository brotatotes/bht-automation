# Acts 21:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The crowd, cheated of their purpose to lynch Paul, was determined to have his blood and followed him as the captain and the soldiers carried him to the castle. They cried, Take him away, and insisted that he be crucified, just as they had said about Christ. Paul learned what it meant to share in the sufferings of Christ as he listened to the sullen roar of the mob's yells.
