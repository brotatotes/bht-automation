# Acts 21:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Finding disciples, Paul and his companions stayed in Tyre for a week, taking the opportunity to worship with the believers there. These disciples, gifted with extraordinary spiritual insight, warned Paul through the Spirit that great tribulations awaited him in Jerusalem. Though the disciples' warning was well-intentioned, it seemed that they understood it as a guidance from the Spirit, giving Paul the choice to avoid danger by not going to Jerusalem. Nevertheless, Paul's commitment to his calling was unwavering, as he pressed forward, dedicated to fulfilling the work entrusted to him by God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The notice here is very important, that these Tyrian disciples said to Paul by the Spirit, that he should not go to Jerusalem, and yet he went thither, and, as he himself declares, δεδεμένος τῷ πνεύματι, bound in spirit by the leading of God." 
2. "We thus have an instance of that which Paul asserts 1 Corinthians 14:32, that the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets, i.e., that the revelation made by the Holy Spirit to each man’s spirit was under the influence of that man’s will and temperament, moulded by and taking the form of his own capacities and resolves."
3. "But he paid no regard to the prohibition, being himself under a leading of the same Spirit too plain for him to mistake it."
