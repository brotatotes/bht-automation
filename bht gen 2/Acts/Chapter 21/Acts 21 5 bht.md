# Acts 21:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The believers in Tyre showed their deep attachment and genuine concern for Paul and his fellow travelers as they accompanied them out of the city with their families. This act demonstrated their love and support, as well as their willingness to publicly associate themselves with Christ and his messengers. Furthermore, their prayer on the shore highlighted the Jewish custom of praying by the sea, and exemplified the vivid scenes that eyewitnesses like Luke were able to capture in their accounts. These details provide an intimate glimpse into the early Christian community's devotion and unity.
