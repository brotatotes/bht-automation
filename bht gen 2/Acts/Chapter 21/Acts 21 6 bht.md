# Acts 21:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After finding out the disciples and perhaps not many among them, they took leave from one another in a tender scene, not caring that it was in public. Having prayed, they saluted each other with a kiss, before they returned to their own homes, as seen in Acts 20:37. This departure, reminiscent of the Beloved Disciple and Jesus in John 19:27 and John 1:11, signifies the bonds of long comradeship and the clinging love that was absent in this farewell.
