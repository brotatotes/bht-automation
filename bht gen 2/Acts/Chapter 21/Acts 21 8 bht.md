# Acts 21:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Philip, known as the evangelist, joined Paul's company the next day as they departed. They entered the house of Philip, who was a preacher of the Gospel to those who had never heard it. He had previously preached to the Samaritans, the Ethiopian eunuch, and towns from Azotus to Caesarea. It is possible that he spent the following years preaching in Tyre, Sidon, and other heathen cities near Galilee, as his house was conveniently located in Caesarea.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The office of Evangelist, see reff., seems to have answered very much to our missionary..."
2. "εὐαγγέλιον in these times the peculiar meaning of a narrative of the life of Christ, but rather embraced the whole good tidings of salvation by Him, as preached to the Jews and Heathens."
3. "The fact of Philip being settled at Cæsarea, and known as ὁ εὐαγγελιστής, seems decisive against regarding the occurrence of ch. Acts 6:3 ff. as the establishment of any permanent order in the church."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Philip the evangelist—a term answering apparently very much to our missionary [HOWSON], by whose ministry such joy had been diffused over Samaria and the Ethiopian eunuch had been baptized."
2. "He and Paul now meet for the first time, some twenty-five years after that time."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is evident, however, that it is used to denote the office of preaching the gospel; and as this title is applied to Philip, and not to any other of the seven deacons, it would seem probable that he had been entrusted with a special commission to preach, and that preaching did not pertain to him as a deacon, and does not properly belong to that office."
2. "The business of a deacon was to take care of the poor members of the church, Acts 6:1-6."
3. "The office of preaching was distinct from this, though, as in this case, it might be conferred on the same individual."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. We that were of Paul 's company. The best texts omit. Philip. See ch. 8. The seven. The first deacons. See ch. Acts 6:5.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Their route led them round Carmel along the coast for some thirty to forty miles to Cæsarea."
2. "The first of these, Stephen, after acquiring a fame unequalled in the first years of the faith, endured a martyr’s death, and thus followed his Master."
3. "We can thus trace how, when the story of the life of Christ at first only told orally by the evangelist or missionary was written down in the form of narrative, the inspired writers became known as the evangelists."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Caesarea is the political capital of Judea under the Romans where the procurators lived and a city of importance, built by Herod the Great and named in honour of Augustus."
2. "The word 'evangelist' was used of him in Acts 8:40. The earliest of the three N.T. examples of the word 'evangelist.' ... As used here the meaning is a travelling missionary who 'gospelized' communities."
3. "What a joyful time Paul had in conversation with Philip. He could learn from him much of value about the early days of the gospel in Jerusalem. And Luke could, and probably did, take notes from Philip and his daughters about the beginnings of Christian history."

### John Gill:
1. "And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed."
2. "We entered into the house of Philip the evangelist."
