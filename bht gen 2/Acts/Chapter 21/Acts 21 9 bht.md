# Acts 21:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Philip, a married man, had four daughters who were virgins, not because of any vow of virginity but because they had not yet changed their state of life. These daughters were blessed with the gift of prophecy, which involved foretelling future events. This gift was in fulfillment of the promise made in the Old Testament that in Gospel times, men and women would be endowed with the ability to prophesy. It is important to note that their prophesying did not involve preaching or interpreting Scripture publicly.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The four daughters had the gift of προφητεία: see on ch. Acts 11:27."
2. "To find an argument for the so-called 'honour of virginity' in this verse, only shows to what resources those will stoop who have failed to apprehend the whole spirit and rule of the gospel in the matter."
3. "They are met however on their own ground by an argument built on another misapprehension (that of Philip being a deacon in the ecclesiastical sense): ὥστε οὖν καὶ τῷ κοινωνήσαντι γάμων διακονεῖν ἔξεστι."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "the same man had four daughters." 
2. "which did prophesy—fulfilling (see Acts 2:18)."
3. "This is mentioned, it would seem, merely as a high distinction divinely conferred on so devoted a servant of the Lord Jesus, and probably indicates the high tone of religion in his family."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That females sometimes partook of the prophetic influence, and foretold future events, is evident from various places in the New Testament."
2. "See the notes on Acts 2:17; Acts 11:27."
3. "See the notes on Acts 2:17."

### John Calvin:
1. "By this means the Lord meant to beautify the first beginnings of the gospel, when he raised up men and women to foretell things to come."
2. "Seeing that prophesying, which was in a manner quite ceased, doth now after long time return again, it was a token of a more perfect state."
3. "And forasmuch as he doth not suffer women to bear any public office in the Church, it is to be thought that they did prophesy at home, or in some private place, without the common assembly."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This is an example of the fulfilment of the prophecy of Joel quoted by St. Peter in the early days of the faith (Acts 2:17)."
2. "It is improbable that any 'order of virgins' existed at this early period."
3. "It is very likely that these 'four' foretold the apostle's coming captivity, and showed him the dangers he would meet with in Jerusalem."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Philip had the honour of having in his home four virgin daughters with the gift of prophecy which was not necessarily predicting events, though that was done as by Agabus here."
2. "It was more than ordinary preaching and was put by Paul above the other gifts like tongues."
3. "The whole problem is difficult and calls for restraint and reverence."

### John Gill:
1. "And the same man had four daughters.... So that he was a married man, which may be observed against the Papists, who forbid marriage to ecclesiastics." 
2. "And they were, virgins: not under any vow of virginity, but they had not as yet changed their state of life, and were pure and incorrupt." 
3. "Which did prophesy; not explain and interpret Scripture, or preach in public assemblies; but they were endowed with a gift of foretelling future events, as was promised such should have in Gospel times, Joel 2:28."
