2. "Thirdly, that he did not change his sect unadvisedly; but that being tamed and convict by an oracle from heaven, he gave his name to Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The accurate translation of the Greek word would be simply, ‘Brethren and fathers.’"

In order to refute this charge, he addresses them in Hebrew; he dwells on his Jewish education, and on his early zeal for the law; he shows how at his conversion he was guided by Ananias, a man devout according to the law, and of good report among the Jews at Damascus, and how he subsequently worshipped in the temple at Jerusalem."
3. "So far they listen to him; but he no sooner touches on the promulgation of the gospel among the heathen (Acts 22:21) than he is interrupted, and his fate would probably have been the same as Stephen’s, had he not been under the protection of the Roman captain."

2. "...this shows how ready the apostle was to put up with affronts, and to forgive injuries done him..."
