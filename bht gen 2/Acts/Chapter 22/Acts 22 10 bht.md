# Acts 22:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Laying away all fierceness and fury, I willingly bow down my neck to bear His yoke and am ready to do whatever He commands. Moreover, I understand that asking the mouth of God is the beginning of well-doing, for labor is lost when considering repentance without His word. God does not blind all those whom He will enlighten, but there is a general rule for all: those who seek wisdom apart from Him become foolish with themselves. And so, I ask, What shall I do, Lord?
