# Acts 22:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When faced with the blinding light, the apostle's sight was taken away, leaving him unable to see. In his state of darkness, he needed assistance and guidance from his companions, who led him by the hand. This act of leading by the hand was significant, as it symbolized the apostle's dependence and reliance on others in his vulnerable state. Previously, Paul had journeyed to Damascus to persecute the saints but now, in a complete turnaround, he entered the city seeking understanding and instruction from those whom he had previously persecuted.
