# Acts 22:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Baptism is a visible seal of remission, symbolizing the washing away of sins. It is not the external rite itself that purifies the soul, but rather an ordinance divinely appointed to express the cleansing of sins. When being baptized, it is important to approach it with profound prayer and solemn religious exercises. The act of baptism should be seen as more than just a symbol; it is a means and seal of pardon, a way for God to bestow His grace upon those who truly repent.

2. "Though we must also note this, that there is no bare figure set before us in baptism, but that the giving of the thing is thereto annexed; because God promised nothing deceitfully, but doth, indeed, fulfill that which under the signs he doth signify."
3. "For the sacraments have neither any power of salvation included in them, neither are they anything worth of themselves.
