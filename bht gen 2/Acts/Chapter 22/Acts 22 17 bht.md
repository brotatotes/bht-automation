# Acts 22:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Paul returned to Jerusalem, he did not abandon his devotion to the temple, recognizing it as a place of prayer. Interestingly, while praying in the temple, he fell into a state of ecstasy or trance, unaware of whether he was in his physical body or separated from it. This remarkable experience, which Paul refers to as a vision or revelation of the Lord, further strengthens his commitment to his ministry, where he would go on to passionately spread the message of Christ to the Gentiles.
