# Acts 22:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ commanded Paul to quickly leave Jerusalem because he had important work elsewhere that needed to be done urgently. He knew that the Jews in Jerusalem were full of hardness and unbelief and would not receive or believe any testimony from Paul. The Jews saw him as an apostate and would hate and persecute him. Even the Jewish Christians in the Holy City would be suspicious of him, remembering his past persecutions. It was important for Paul to depart quickly to preach where people would be more receptive to his message.
