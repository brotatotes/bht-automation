# Acts 22:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the Jews heard someone speaking in their own Hebrew tongue, they were moved to silence. Paul's choice to address them in their mother tongue was intentional. He knew that by speaking in the language they best understood, he would be able to captivate their attention and gain their favor. The use of the Hebrew language, as opposed to the Hellenistic language, was significant as it resonated more with the Jewish audience and helped to establish a connection between Paul and his listeners.
