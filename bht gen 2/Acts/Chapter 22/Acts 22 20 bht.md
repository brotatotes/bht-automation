## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The present meaning of the word martyr did, however, become attached to it at a very early period, and is apparently of apostolic authority: e.g. Revelation 17:6, and Clem. Rom 1 Corinthians 5:0."  
2. "They almost all suffered: hence to witness became a synonym for to suffer; while the suffering was in itself a kind of testimony.” (Mr. Humphry.)  
3. "Bp. Wordsworth well designates this introduction of the name of Stephen 'A noble endeavour to make public reparation for a public sin, by public confession in the same place where the sin was committed.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed" - See Acts 7:58; Acts 8:1.
2. "And kept the raiment" - The outer robes or garments, which were usually laid aside when they engaged in running or labor. See Acts 7:58.
3. "These circumstances are mentioned here by him as reasons why he knew that he would not be received by Christians as one of their number, and why it was necessary, therefore, for him to turn to the Gentile world."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The special sense of the word [martyr] was probably not in use at this time." 
2. "Standing by." 
3. "Consenting [συνευδοκων]."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It would therefore be more strictly accurate to render here, ‘the blood of thy witness Stephen.’"
2. "Probably the transition from the general sense of ‘witness’ to the specific meaning of ‘martyr’ is traceable to its use in such passages as this and Revelation 2:13; Revelation 11:3; Revelation 17:6."
3. "The transition from the first sense (witness) to the second sense (martyr) may be easily accounted for. Many, who had only seen with the eye of faith, suffered persecution and death as a proof of their sincerity."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Was shed (εξεχυννετο). Imperfect passive of εκχυννω (see on Matthew 23:35), was being shed."
2. "I also was standing by (κα αυτος ημην εφεστως). Periphrastic second past perfect in form, but imperfect (linear) in sense since εστωσ=ισταμενος (intransitive)."
3. "Consenting (συνευδοκων). The very word used by Luke in Acts 8:1 about Paul. Koine word for being pleased at the same time with (cf. Luke 11:48)."

### John Gill:
1. "Stephen was a martyr for Christ, both by confession with his mouth, and by the effusion of his blood."
2. "These things he mentions to suggest that surely the Jews would receive his testimony, since they knew what a bitter enemy he had been to this way."
3. "It also shows what an affection the apostle had for the Jews, and how much he desired their spiritual welfare, for which reason he chose to have stayed, and preached among them."

### John Wesley:
1. "A real convert still retains the remembrance of his former sins."
2. "He confesses them and is humbled for them."
3. "All the days of his life."
