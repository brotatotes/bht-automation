# Acts 22:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul received a clear command from God to depart and go far away to preach the gospel to the Gentiles. The repetition of this call in different instances confirms the divine origin of his mission. This shift in focus to the Gentiles reflected God's will and became Paul's life's work as the appointed apostle to the Gentiles.
