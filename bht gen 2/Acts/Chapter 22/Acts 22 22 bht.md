## BHT:
The audience initially listened to Paul patiently, with respect and attention. However, their demeanor quickly changed when he mentioned his mission to the Gentiles. This notion was deeply offensive and provocative to the Jews who wanted to keep the blessings exclusively for themselves. They became hostile towards Paul, believing that his teachings could harm them and advocating for his elimination.
