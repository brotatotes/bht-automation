# Acts 22:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The crowd, overcome with anger, cried out in a furious manner, casting off their clothes as a display of their uncontrollable rage. Some even flung dust into the air, unable to contain their indignation. These dramatic acts were not mere preparations for stoning, but rather expressions of abhorrence and fury, a striking exhibition of their deep-seated hatred towards the one who uttered such words. It was a moment of uncontrolled excitement, described as a spasm of wild rage that captivated the onlookers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Not 'flinging off their garments,' as preparing to stone him, or even as representing the action of such preparation: the former would be futile, as he was in the custody of the tribune, the latter absurd, and not borne out by any known habit of the Jews." 
2. "But shaking, jactitantes, their garments, as shaking off the dust, abominating such an expression and him who uttered it."
3. "The casting dust into the air was part of the same gesture."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Cast off their clothes - Their outer garments. Probably they did it now intending to stone him." 
2. "And threw dust into the air - As expressive of them abhorrence and indignation. This was a striking exhibition of rage and malice." 
3. "Paul was guarded by Roman soldiers so that they could not injure him; and their only way of expressing their wrath was by menaces and threats, and by these tokens of furious indignation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The throwing off their clothes was not...a preparation for the stoning of the blasphemer...The tearing off the garments...was simply...an oriental way of giving some outward expression of their uncontrollable rage." 
2. "These acts, which proclaimed the bitter indignation of the brethren and fathers who were standing near enough to hear Paul’s words, were well calculated to inflame the populace who were crowding doubtless into the temple area."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "As they cried out (κραυγαζοντων αυτων). Genitive absolute with present active participle of κραυγαζω, a rare word in the old Greek from κραυγη (a cry)."
2. "Two other genitive absolutes here, ριπτουντων (throwing off, present active participle, frequent active variation of ριπτω) and βαλλοντων (present active participle of βαλλω, flinging)."
3. "These present participles give a lively picture of the uncontrolled excitement of the mob in their spasm of wild rage."

### John Gill:
1. "And as they cried out,.... In this furious manner:and cast off their clothes;"
2. "either like madmen, that knew not what they did, or in order to stone him;"
3. "and threw dust into the air either with their hands, or by striking the earth, and scraping it with their feet, through indignation and wrath, like persons possessed, or mad."

### John Wesley:
1. "They rent their garments — In token of indignation and horror at this pretended blasphemy."
2. "Cast dust into the air - Through vehemence of rage, which they knew not how to vent."
