# Acts 22:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The chief captain, fearing for Paul's safety, had him brought into the castle to protect him from the angry crowd. Wanting to uncover the truth, he ordered a centurion and soldiers to scourge Paul until he revealed the full extent of his supposed crimes. Though the chief captain lacked understanding, he believed that Paul's vehemently accused must have committed a grave offense, hence resorting to torture to extract a confession.
