# Acts 22:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Christians, we should not feel obligated to give up our civil privileges, which we are to receive and value as gifts from God, to anyone who rudely challenges them. We have the freedom to insist on our rights, with gratitude to God and a sense of duty to others, in order to preserve and enhance them for future generations.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I (besides having the privilege like thee of being a Roman citizen) was also born one."
2. "How was Paul a Roman citizen by birth? Certainly not because he was of Tarsus... It remains, therefore, that his father or some ancestor must have obtained the civitas, either as a reward for service or by purchase."
3. "He may have acquired his freedom and the citizenship afterwards."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Roman citizenship was bought and sold in the reign of Claudius, we know, at a high price: at a subsequent date, for next to nothing."
2. "But to put in a false claim to this privilege was a capital crime."
3. "I was free born—born to it, by purchase, or in reward of services, on the part of his father or some ancestor."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The argument of the tribune in this case is this: 'I obtained this privilege at a great price. Whence did you, Paul, thus poor and persecuted, obtain the means of becoming a Roman citizen?'"
2. "Paul had informed him that he was a native of Tarsus Acts 21:39; and the chief captain supposed that that was not a free city, and that Paul could not have derived the privilege of citizenship from his birth."
3. "Free cities were permitted in the Roman empire to use their own laws, customs, and magistrates, and they were free from being subject to Roman guards. They were required only to acknowledge the supremacy and authority of the Roman people, and to aid them in their wars."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The purchase of Roman citizenship was an investment."
2. "It was obtained only at large cost and with great difficulty."
3. "Later, it was sold for a trifle."

### John Calvin:
1. "How can it be that thou, being some base fellow of the country of the Cilicians, shouldst obtain this honor, for which I paid sweetly?"
2. "Paul maketh answer, that he was free born, who never saw the city, yea, whose father it may be was never there, there is no cause why this should trouble any man."
3. "For those who are skillful in the Roman history know that certain were made free of the city who dwelt in the provinces, if, having deserved well of the commonwealth, or in war, or in other weighty affairs, they did desire and crave this reward of the deputies, [proconsuls] so that it is no absurdity to say that he was born a citizen of Rome, who, descending by his ancestors of some province far distant from Rome, did never set foot in Italy."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word, as Plumptre well remarks, expressing not the transition from bondage to freedom, but from the position of an alien to that of a citizen."
2. "Under the first Cæsars the freedom of Rome was obtained with great difficulty, and cost a large sum of money..."
3. "It has been asked how Paul obtained this ‘freedom;’ for Tarsus, the city of his birth, although possessing many great and important privileges, was a metropolis and a free city, and did not confer the rights of the Roman citizenship upon its citizens."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The use of κεφαλαιου (from κεφαλη, head) for sums of money (principal as distinct from interest) is old and frequent in the papyri."
2. "There is calm and simple dignity in this reply and pardonable pride."
3. "Paul's family was of good social position. 'He was educated by the greatest of the Rabbis; he was at an early age entrusted by the Jewish authorities with an important commission; his nephew could gain ready access to the Roman tribune; he was treated as a person of consequence by Felix, Festus, Agrippa, and Julius' (Furneaux)."

### John Gill:
1. "For, it seems, he was not a Roman born, but very likely a Grecian, or Syrian, by his name Lysias; and as all things were now venal at Rome, the freedom of the city was to be bought with money..."
2. "This the chief captain said, as wondering that so mean a person, and who he understood was a Jew by birth, should be able to procure such a privilege, which cost him so much money..."
3. "And Paul said, but I was free born; being born at Tarsus; which, as Pliny says l, was a free city, and which had its freedom given it by Mark Antony, and which was before the birth of Paul; and therefore his parents being of this city, and free, he was born so."

### John Wesley:
1. "We learn hence, that we are under no obligation as Christians to give up our civil privileges (which we are to receive and prize as the gift of God) to every insolent invader."
2. "In a thousand circumstances, gratitude to God, and duty to men, will oblige us to insist upon them; and engage us to strive to transmit them improved, rather than impaired to posterity."
