# Acts 22:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The centurion believed Paul's word, knowing that false claims carried the penalty of death. The soldiers were about to violate Roman law by binding Paul with thongs to scourge him. However, when they learned that Paul was a Roman citizen, they immediately stopped binding him and feared the consequences of their actions. The chief captain not only commanded Paul to be bound and scourged, but also had initially bound him with two chains, a serious offense against a Roman citizen.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "'The centurion believed Paul’s word, because a false claim of this nature, being easily exposed, and punishable with death (Suet. Claud. 25), was almost an unprecedented thing.’" 
2. "His fear was on account of his first false step; but it was now too late to reverse it: and the same reason which leads him to continue it now, operates afterwards (ὁ δέσμιος Π., ch. Act 23:18) when the hearing was delayed."
3. "That ἦν δεδεκώς cannot, as Bloomfield and Wordsworth suppose, refer only to the binding before scourging, its immediate juxtaposition with ἔλυσεν in the next verse sufficiently shews."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 29. chief captain also was afraid,
	&c.—See on Acts 22:1.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They saw that by scourging him they would have violated the Roman law, and exposed themselves to its penalty."
2. "That it was unlawful to bind a man with this intent, who was uncondemned, appears from an express declaration in Cicero (against Verres): 'It is a heinous sin to bind a Roman citizen; it is wickedness to beat him; it is next to parricide to kill him, and what shall I say to crucify him?'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is noticeable how the word rendered 'should have examined' had acquired the sense of 'examining by torture.'"
2. "The old magical power of the words, Civis Romanus sum, 'I am a Roman citizen,' was by no means gone when Paul spoke to the soldiers of the tower of Antonia."
3. "Although the stern rules which once forbade torture to be applied to any citizen of Rome had been violated even so early as the time of Tiberius, still we imagine for a long while provincial officials would stand in awe of the old name which once was so venerated and still bore with it many precious privileges."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Second aorist active indicative (intransitive) of αφιστημ, stood off from him at once." 
2. "Ingressive aorist passive indicative of φοβεομα, became afraid. He had reason to be."
3. "Causal οτ here after declarative οτ just before. Periphrastic past perfect active of δεω, to bind."

### John Gill:
1. "By scourging; namely, the soldiers, who under the inspection of the centurion, and by the order of the chief captain, were binding him with thongs to scourge him, and thereby extort from him his crime."
2. "But hearing that he was a Roman, either of their own accord, or rather at the order of their officers ... left binding him, and went their way."
3. "Not only had commanded him to be bound with thongs to a pillar, in order to be scourged, but he had bound him with two chains when first seized him; and, as before observed, it was a heinous crime to bind a Roman."
