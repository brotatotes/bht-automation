# Acts 22:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the tribune brought Paul down to the meeting-place of the Sanhedrim, he did so in order to ascertain the truth about the accusations against him, which he should have known earlier instead of binding and ordering him to be scourged. Recognizing that it was a religious matter, the tribune handed over Paul to the Jewish council for examination and judgment. He presented Paul before them, allowing him the opportunity to respond to the charges brought against him.
