# Acts 22:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In his former life, the apostle Paul passionately persecuted the believers, exhibiting the same zealousness that his present audience displays. He pursued this way with great fervor, not only targeting men but also seeking to imprison women. However, his current state is vastly different as he reflects on how much better it is to be bound to the cause of Christ instead.
