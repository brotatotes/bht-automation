# Acts 22:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The high priest, who is still living at the time of Paul's account, along with the entire body of the Sanhedrin, can bear witness to his testimony. Paul refers to the Jews as his brethren, demonstrating his close connection to his fellow countrymen. His journey to Damascus is driven by his mission to apprehend and punish those who oppose him, reflecting his relentless pursuit not only within Palestine but also beyond. Paul's zeal in persecution mirrors his later fervor in spreading the gospel throughout the Roman empire, as he establishes a strong presence for the message of Christ.
