# Acts 22:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Saul heard the voice from heaven, he fell to the ground along with those who were with him. The voice addressed Saul by repeating his name twice, emphasizing the personal nature of the encounter. The question asked to Saul, Why persecutest thou me? echoed in his mind and left a lasting impact. This powerful experience was imprinted in his memory, as Paul later recounted the same call before Agrippa and Bernice. The repetition of Saul's name and the piercing question demonstrated the significance of this encounter and its transformational effect on his life.
