# Acts 22:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They were with Paul, but they did not understand the voice that spoke. The distinction here lies in the fact that they heard the sound but did not understand the words. It is as if they heard an obscure voice but were unable to discern its meaning. Similarly, they saw Paul surrounded by light but could not perceive the voice speaking from heaven.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 9-11. they that were with me—(See
	on Acts 9:7, &c.)

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Heard not [ουκ ηκουσαν] . The verb is to be taken in the sense of understood, as Mark 4:33; 1 Corinthians 14:2, which explains the apparent discrepancy with ch. 9 7.

### John Calvin:
1. "Surely it is no absurd thing to say that they heard some obscure voice; yet so that they did not discern it as Paul himself, whom alone Christ meant to stay and tame with the reprehension."
2. "Therefore, they hear a voice, because a sound doth enter into their ears, so that they know that some speaketh from heaven; they hear not the voice of him that spake to Paul, because they understand not what Christ saith."
3. "Moreover, they see Paul compassed about with the light, but they see none which speaketh from heaven."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There is a distinction between hearing a voice speak and hearing what it says, as nothing is more common in our public bodies than the complaint that the speaker is not heard, i.e. that his words are not distinguished, though his voice may be audible and even loud." 
2. "It might be said with equal truth, that Paul’s companions heard the voice, i.e. knew that it was speaking, and that they did not hear it, i.e. did not know what it said."
3. "Here as there, the Divine Voice to the ordinary bystander was a voice, but not one uttering articulate words."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The accusative here may be used rather than the genitive as in verse Acts 22:7 to indicate that those with Paul did not understand what they heard..."
2. "The difference in cases allows this distinction, though it is not always observed..."
3. "It is one of the evidences of the genuineness of this report of Paul's speech that Luke did not try to smooth out apparent discrepancies in details between the words of Paul and his own record already in ch. 9."

### John Gill:
1. "The suddenness, greatness, and extraordinariness of the light surprised them, for it was even miraculous." 
2. "They heard the voice of Saul, but not the voice of Christ; at least they did not hear it so as to understand it."

### John Wesley:
1. They did not hear the voice — Distinctly; but only a confused noise.
