## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἀτενίσας seems to describe that peculiar look, connected probably with infirmity of sight, with which Paul has already been described as regarding those before him: and may perhaps account for his not knowing that the person who spoke to him was the high priest."
2. "The purport of Paul’s assertion seems to be this: being charged with neglecting, and teaching others to neglect the law of Moses, he at once endeavours to disarm those who thus accused him, by asserting that up to that day he had lived a true and loyal Jew, obeying, according to his conscience, the law of that divine πολιτεία of which he was a covenant member."
3. "Thus πεπολίτευμαι τῷ θεῷ will have its full and proper meaning: and the words are no vain-glorious ones, but an important assertion of his innocence."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Paul, earnestly beholding the council—with a look of conscious integrity and unfaltering courage, perhaps also recognizing some of his early fellow pupils."
2. "I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day—The word has an indirect reference to the 'polity' or 'commonwealth of Israel,' of which he would signify that he had been, and was to that hour, an honest and God-fearing member."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He would naturally observe the appearance, and endeavor to ascertain the character of his judges."
2. "He doubtless meant to say that as he had been conscientious in persecution, so he had been in his conversion and in his subsequent course."
3. "He had lived to God, or with reference to his commands, so as to keep a conscience pure in his sight."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Some, who hold that Paul's eyesight was defective, explain this steadfast look in connection with his imperfect vision."
2. "He addresses the Sanhedrim as an equal."
3. "He means that he has lived as a true and loyal Jew."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul beginneth with the testimony of a good conscience, that all the whole multitude may understand that he is unjustly charged with such an heinous offense." 
2. "Paul meant at the first, only with this excuse, to mollify their nettled minds, that he might the better be heard." 
3. "This preface teacheth that no man can rightly handle the doctrine of godliness, unless the fear of God reign and bear the chief sway in him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He defends himself before the Great Council, 1-10."
2. "Paul more than once refers in a similar way to conscience... Paul teaches us that a man must never act against the dictates of his conscience, though, however, he plainly demonstrates from his own early experience that conscience is by no means an infallible guide; it requires light from on high."
3. "He shows us again, by his own example, from what 'good conscience before God' proceeds: 1. From true faith in Christ, by which the remission of sins is obtained. 2. From the assurance of Divine grace. 3. From the faithful performance of the duties of our calling."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He had lived as God's citizen, as a member of God's commonwealth" (Rackham). God is the dative of personal interest.
2. "The word simply means consciousness of one's own thoughts, or of one's own self, then consciousness of the distinction between right and wrong with approval or disapproval."
3. "He means to say to the Sanhedrin that he persecuted Christians as a conscientious (though mistaken) Jew (Pharisee) just as he followed his conscience in turning from Judaism to Christianity."

### John Gill:
1. "Paul earnestly beholding the council... looked wistly and intently at them... discovering a modest cheerfulness, and a becoming boldness, confidence, and intrepidity."
2. "He [Paul] lived before God, or unto God, in all good conscience, though an erroneous and mistaken one; he thought he ought to do what he did."
3. "The apostle has here respect to his outward moral conversation, which, before and after conversion, was very strict, and even blameless, at least unblemished before men."
