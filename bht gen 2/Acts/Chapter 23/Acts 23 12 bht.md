# Acts 23:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These conspirators made a solemn oath to kill Paul. They invoked God's curse upon themselves if they were to break their vow. This kind of violent zeal and hypocrisy blinded them, leading them down a path of treachery and cruelty. It is a sobering reminder of how zealous hypocrites can be, driven by their lust and disregarding what is lawful or moral. In their rash and wickedness, they delayed their own destruction, but it also exposes our own sluggishness in defending the glory of God.
