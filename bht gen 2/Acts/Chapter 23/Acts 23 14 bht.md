# Acts 23:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The conspirators went to the leaders of the Sanhedrin, the chief priests and elders, to inform them of their wicked plans. These religious authorities, instead of acting justly, should have apprehended and punished the men. However, given their likely affiliation with the Sadducees, the group that Paul had recently offended, it seems they were pleased with the scheme. This aligns with Jesus' warning that those who persecute believers may think they are serving God.
