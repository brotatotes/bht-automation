# Acts 23:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul's nephew entered the castle where Paul was held, demonstrating both duty and affection towards his uncle. It is uncertain whether he lived in Jerusalem or had come specifically to see Paul, but his actions show the privileges Paul had as a Roman citizen. Despite Paul's temporary imprisonment, there seemed to be no difficulty in accessing him, and the courtesy shown by the Roman officials is noteworthy. The Lord's providence is evident in how he crossed the plans of the ungodly, ensuring the safety of his servant.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is quite uncertain whether Paul’s sister’s son lived in Jerusalem, or had accompanied him thither."
2. "The knowledge of the plot, which presupposes other acquaintances than he would have been likely to make if he had come with Paul."
3. "I should suppose him to have been domiciled at Jerusalem, possibly under instruction, as was formerly Paul himself."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Paul's sister's son—(See on Acts 9:30)."
2. "If he was at this time residing at Jerusalem for his education, like Paul himself, he may have got at the schools those hints of the conspiracy on which he so promptly acted."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Paul had the privileges of a Roman citizen, and as no well-founded charge had been laid against him, it is probable that he was not very closely confined, and that his friends might have free access to him."
2. "It is possible that Paul might have a sister residing there; though, as Paul himself had been sent there formerly for his education, it seems more probable that this young man was sent there for the same purpose."


### John Calvin:
1. "We see in this place how the Lord doth cross the purposes of the ungodly."
2. "The Lord doth show that his life is most safely kept, so that whatsoever men go about all is in vain."
3. "Let us learn to lean unto and stay ourselves upon the Lord, though we see no ordinary way to save ourselves, who shall find a way even through places where nothing can pass."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is singular that this is the only mention in the ‘Acts’ of any of Paul’s relations."

3. "Here, as in several other places, the courtesy of the higher Roman officials towards the seemingly friendless and persecuted missionary is noticeable."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He came (παραγενομενος). Second aorist middle participle of παραγινομα. It may mean, 'having come upon them' and so discount their plot, a graphic touch."
2. "Told Paul (απηγγειλεν τω Παυλω). This nephew is not known otherwise. He may be a student here from Tarsus as Paul once was."
3. "Anyhow he knows what to do when he catches on to the conspirators. He had enough address to get into the barracks where Paul was. He ran the risk of death if discovered."

### John Gill:
1. "Paul's sister's son...went and entered into the castle; the Alexandrian copy reads, 'the synagogue'; but Paul was not there, but in the castle of Antonia; the Ethiopic version renders it, 'the prison'; though it is plain that he was not very closely confined, it was easy to have access to him."
2. "The reason might be, not only because he was a Roman, but because he was uncondemned, nor was any charge proved against him."
3. "This was an instance both of duty and affection to his uncle, and worthy of imitation, whether it proceeded from natural relation, or from religion, or both."
