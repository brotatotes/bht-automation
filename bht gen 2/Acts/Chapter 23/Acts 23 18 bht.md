# Acts 23:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul, as a prisoner, was bound to a soldier in military custody. This arrangement allowed him some freedom to see his friends, but it was still confining. The centurion in charge of Paul showed kindness and readiness to do a kind office for him. Although he did not seek to acquire any secrets from Paul or the young man, he took on the responsibility honorably and performed it well.
