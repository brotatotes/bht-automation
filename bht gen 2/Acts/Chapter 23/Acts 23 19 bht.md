### John Calvin:
1. "A man trained up in the wars might no less have given this young man the repulse, whom he knew not, than have despised Paul’s suit. Therefore, the Lord, who hath in his hand the hearts of men, did frame the profane man to give ear unto him."
2. "Those who are in authority are taught by this example what a great virtue courtesy is. If it had been a hard matter to come to him, he might, through ignorance, have delivered Paul to the Jews to be put to death."
3. "We must so consider the wisdom of the chief captain, that our faith lift up her eyes into heaven: and understand that God doth guide the heart of a profane man by a secret instinct, and that he is at length a guide to Paul and the soldiers, that he may come safe to Cesarea."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is evident that the Roman commander was favourably impressed with something in Paul’s bearing, and probably with his words."
2. "His sympathies are evidently with Paul, not with his priestly foes, as years before Pilate’s had been with another prisoner greater than Paul."

1. "Took him by the hand (επιλαβομενος της χειρος αυτου). Kindly touch in Lysias, ut fiduciam adolescentis confirmaret (Bengel)." 
2. "Note genitive with the second aorist middle (indirect, to himself) of επιλαμβανω as in Luke 8:54 with κρατησας which see." 
3. "Asked him privately (κατ' ιδιαν επυνθανετο). Imperfect middle, began to ask (inchoative)."

### John Gill:
1. "Some have thought that the reason of this was, that he expected that the young man had brought him a present in his hand, from Paul; but this is to represent him as a sordid mercenary man, which ought not to be said, without sufficient proof."
2. "Rather this should be considered as an instance of civility and humanity, and what showed him to be a man of breeding and good manners."
3. "It was acting a wise and prudent part to take him into a private room, and hear what he had to say."
