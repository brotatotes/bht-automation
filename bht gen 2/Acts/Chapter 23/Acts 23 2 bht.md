# Acts 23:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Ananias, known for his bad character, ordered his men to slap Paul on the face, as a way of silencing him and showing contempt. This may have been because Paul did not address him in the expected flattering manner or because Paul boldly declared his innocence. It is possible that Ananias was the same high priest who was a Sadducee, given the large number of Sadducees in the Sanhedrin.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Ananias was then at Jerusalem; and as the office of high priest was vacant, and as he was the last person who had borne the office, it was natural that he should discharge, probably by common consent, its duties, so far, at least, as to preside in the Sanhedrin."

And no marvel, for they had estranged themselves from God; they had most reproachfully rejected Christ; all their religion was set to sale.
