# Acts 23:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The young man, possibly a relative of Paul, somehow gained knowledge of the conspiracy against him, most likely from the Jewish authorities or through his education in Jerusalem. The group of conspirators represented the prevailing sentiment towards Paul in the city. It is possible that the young man, being a student under a Jewish teacher, obtained information about the plot. They planned to bring Paul before the council the next day.
