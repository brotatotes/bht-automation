# Acts 23:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A group of over 40 men, bound by an oath, lie in wait for Paul, refusing to eat or drink until they have killed him. Their determination and dedication to their cause is evident. They are looking for a promise from Paul, that he would bring him down according to their request. This resolve must not be attributed to the pride of the young man involved, but rather to his strong affection for his uncle. Despite the danger that Paul faces, he is warned not to yield to their demands.
