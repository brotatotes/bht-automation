# Acts 23:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A Roman cohort of soldiers, consisting of heavy-armed footmen, spearmen, and light-armed troops, were tasked with guarding and protecting Paul as a Roman citizen. The large number of soldiers chosen reflects the importance Roman officials placed on preserving public peace and ensuring the safety of prisoners. The chief captain, suspecting a hidden agenda, aimed to deliver Paul safely to a superior authority, given the tense and troubled state of the country. Thus, a powerful and covert escort of nearly 500 men was selected to leave Jerusalem in secrecy during the late hours of the night.
