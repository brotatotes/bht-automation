# Acts 23:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Felix and his brother Pallas were originally slaves who were freed by Antonia, the mother of Emperor Claudius, and then went on to hold important positions in the Roman government. Despite his elevated status, Felix was notorious for his corruption, cruelty, and licentiousness. Tacitus describes him as wielding the power of a tyrant but possessing the temperament of a slave. Josephus also highlights his oppressive governance during his time in Judea. These characteristics paint a picture of Felix as an unrighteous and despised ruler, whose actions and reputation were far from virtuous.
