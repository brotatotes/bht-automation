# Acts 23:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The accusation against Paul was centered around religious matters, rather than a civil case. It was clear that Paul's actions did not warrant death or imprisonment according to Roman law. The Roman authorities recognized that there was no legitimate reason to charge him with a crime. This not only confirmed Paul's innocence, but also indicated that the issue at hand was primarily a religious dispute among the Jewish people.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Amidst all his difficulty in getting at the charges laid against Paul, enough, no doubt, come out to satisfy him that the whole was a question of religion."
2. "There was no case for a civil tribunal."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Questions of their law - So he understood the whole controversy to be."
2. "Worthy of death - By the Roman law. He had been guilty of no crime against the Roman people."
3. "Or of bonds - Of chains, or of confinement."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Questions. See on ch. Acts 14:2. Nothing - worthy of death or of bonds. Every Roman magistrate before whom the apostle is brought declares him innocent.

### John Calvin:
1. "For among the people of God it is an offense worthy of no less punishment, to corrupt the doctrine of godliness with wicked, and false opinions, than to do injury to, or commit wickedness among men."
2. "But as the chief captain careth not for the Jewish religion, so the false accusations and slanders of the Jews are refuted, wherewith they would gladly have burdened Paul."
3. "The Lord saith far otherwise, who doth more sharply punish the violating of his worship, than any injuries done to men."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds."
2. "Death the highest, and bonds the lowest penalty of the law. Thus Claudius Lysias for his part, from a Roman’s point of view, expressed his belief in Paul’s innocency."
3. "But, thought Claudius Lysias, a Roman citizen surely did not deserve death, or even bonds, for such trivial offences."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Concerning questions of their law. The very distinction drawn by Gallio in Corinth."
2. "To have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds. Literally, 'having no accusation (or crime) worthy of death or of bonds.'"
3. "Lysias thus expresses the opinion that Paul ought to be set free and the lenient treatment that Paul received in Caesarea and Rome (first imprisonment) is probably due to this report of Lysias."

### John Gill:
1. "Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law..."
2. "...to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death, or of bonds..."
3. "...he bears a full testimony to the innocence of the apostle."
