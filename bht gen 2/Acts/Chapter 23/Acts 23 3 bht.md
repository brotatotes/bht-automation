# Acts 23:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
May God punish you, you hypocrite, for your unjust actions. You appear righteous on the outside but are filled with corruption within. Your punishment shall match your own wickedness and come upon you just as you have brought injustice upon others. Beware, for God's retribution is certain and shall not be delayed.
