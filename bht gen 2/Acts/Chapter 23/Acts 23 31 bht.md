# Acts 23:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The soldiers obeyed the command and took Paul to Antipatris during the night, covering a distance of about thirty-eight miles. Antipatris, established by Herod the Great and named after his father Antipater, was a thriving city with fertile soil, abundant rivers, and lush woods. Although Paul did not have the opportunity to preach the Gospel there, Antipatris held its own place in history as a significant town mentioned alongside Gaza, Lydda, and Emmaus.
