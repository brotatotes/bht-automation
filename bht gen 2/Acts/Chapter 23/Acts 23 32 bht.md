# Acts 23:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After being safely escorted forty miles from Jerusalem, Paul was accompanied by seventy horsemen for the remaining twenty-six miles of his journey to Caesarea, where he would be presented to the procurator, Felix. The two hundred soldiers and spearmen, who had accompanied Paul thus far, left the horsemen to ensure his safe passage. As they reached Antipatris, all fears of danger from the Jews were dispelled. Hence, the soldiers and spearmen returned to the castle Antonia in Jerusalem, satisfied that their task was complete.
