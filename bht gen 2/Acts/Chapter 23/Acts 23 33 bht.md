# Acts 23:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
At Caesarea, a city located twenty-six miles from Antipatris, a group of seventy horsemen delivered an epistle. This letter, sent by Claudius Lysias, the chief captain, accurately detailed the circumstances surrounding Paul's case. In Caesarea, Paul's friends, Philip and his daughters, must have marveled at how quickly the prophecy of Agabus had come to pass, as they witnessed the fulfillment of it right before their eyes.
