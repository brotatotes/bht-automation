# Acts 23:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Felix received the letter, he immediately opened and read it, recognizing the importance and potential consequences of not doing so. Inquiring about the prisoner's province was crucial for Felix to determine whether he had jurisdiction over the case. It appeared that the governor of Syria might have had more authority over the matter. Although the crimes were committed in Judea, the specific charge of defiling the temple was significant.
