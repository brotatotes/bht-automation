# Acts 23:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In conformity with Roman law, the governor desired to give the accused a complete and searching investigation, hearing both sides in the palace of Herod, which served as the official dwelling of the Roman governor. Here, Paul was not held in a prison, but kept with much liberty by a guard of soldiers. It is likely that a part of the palace or a tower attached to it served as a place of security for those awaiting trial.
