# Acts 23:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle's words were not just a prediction, but a strong expression of condemnation. The seriousness of the offense is emphasized by the fact that the person being reviled was not just any priest, but a high priest of God. It should be noted, however, that at that time, there was no high priest of God other than Jesus Christ.
