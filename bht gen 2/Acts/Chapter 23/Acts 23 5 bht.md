# Acts 23:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In that moment of prophetic transport and righteous indignation, I did not realize that it was the high priest to whom I spoke, either because of my long absence from Jerusalem or because his appearance did not reflect that of a true high priest. However, I acknowledge my error and hastiness, for I did not consider that I was addressing someone whom God had commanded me to respect. My intention was not to show disrespect, but rather my deep concern for upholding the dignity and honor of all forms of authority, including the high priesthood.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The ordinary interpretation of these words since Lightfoot, adopted by Michaelis, Eichhorn, Kuinoel, and others, is, that Ananias had usurped the office during a vacancy, and therefore was not recognized by Paul."
2. "Chrys. and most of the ancient Commentators supposed that Paul, having been long absent, was really unacquainted with the person of the high priest."
3. "Calvin, Camerar., al., take the words ironically: ‘I could not be supposed to know that one who conducted himself so cruelly and illegally, could be the high priest.’"


### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The high priesthood was in a state of great confusion and constant change at this time."
2. "The apostle's long absence from Jerusalem, and perhaps the manner in which he was habited or the seat he occupied, with other circumstances to us unknown, may account for such a speech."
3. "If his conduct in yielding to the momentary impulse was not that of Christ Himself under a similar provocation, certainly the manner in which he atoned for his fault was Christ-like."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I acknowledge my error and my haste. I did not consider that I was addressing him whom God had commanded me to respect."
2. "The true interpretation, therefore, I suppose, is what is derived from the fact that Ananias was not then properly the high priest; that there was a vacancy in the office, and that he presided by courtesy, or in virtue of his having been formerly invested with that office."
3. "Paul declares here that he would not be guilty of showing disrespect for it, or of using reproachful language in regard to it."

### John Calvin:
1. "Therefore, subscribing to Augustine, I do not doubt but that this is a taunting excuse."
2. "For seeing there be two sorts of ironies, one which is covered with subtilty and means to deceive, another which doth so figuratively note out the thing which is in hand, that it doth prick sorer; in this second, there is nothing which doth not well beseem the servants of Christ."
3. "Therefore all dignity, which is appointed for maintenance of civil government, ought to be reverenced and had in honor. For whosoever he be that rebelleth against or resisteth the magistrate, or those who are appointed to rule, and are promoted unto honor, he would have no government."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Paul on this occasion 'spoke unadvisedly with his lips,' a fault which the noble-hearted man was himself, as we shall see, swift to acknowledge."
2. "Paul, at once recognizing he was wrong, simply and truthfully confesses that when he had uttered the reviling angry words, he had not considered that it was the high priest of Israel whom he was addressing."
3. "I spake the angry words without reflection. I thought at that moment of bitter indignation nothing of high priest or president of the supreme council of Israel."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Greek naturally means that Paul did not know that it was the high priest who gave the order to smite his mouth."
2. "Paul had been away so long that he may not have known Ananias on sight."
3. "Paul was so indignant, even angry, at the command that he spoke without considering who it was that gave the order."

### John Gill:
1. "I did not know him; and the sense is, that he did not really know him, either because he had been long absent from Jerusalem... or chiefly because he was not, in his habit, an high priest."

### John Wesley:
1. "I did not advert to it, in the prophetic transport of my mind"
2. "This answer admirably shows the situation of mind he was then in, partly with regard to the bystanders, whom he thus softens, adding also the title of brethren, and justifying their reproof by the prohibition of Moses"
3. "After that singular transport subsided, was again under the direction of the general command"
