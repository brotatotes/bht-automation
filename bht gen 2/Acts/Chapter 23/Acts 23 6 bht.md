# Acts 23:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul identifies himself as a Pharisee, emphasizing his deep-rooted connection to the belief in the resurrection of the dead. By doing so, he subtly brings attention to the core issue that led to his questioning. Although not explicitly stated, it is clear that the hope of resurrection is at the center of the dispute. This strategic move highlights Paul's familiarity with the teachings of the Pharisees and their shared belief in the resurrection, ultimately positioning himself in a way that aligns him with a significant portion of the council.

3. "This was, of course, quite warrantable, and the more so as it was already evident that no impartiality in trying his cause was to be looked for from such an assembly."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He saw, from the conduct of Ananias, and from the spirit manifested... that they... had prejudged the case, and were driven on by blind rage and fury." 
2. "Knowing, therefore, how sensitive they were on the subject of the resurrection, he seems to have resolved to... enlist a large part, perhaps a majority of the council, in his favor. Whatever may be thought of the propriety of this course, it cannot be denied that it was a masterstroke of policy, and that it evinced a profound knowledge of human nature."

1. "He knew that his own conscience was clear; and it had been an easy matter for him to prove his cause good before just judges. Yet because he seeth them cry out on him clamorously, and that he had no place granted to defend himself, he setteth his enemies together by the ears."
2. "For the end doth show, that those are not guided with reason or judgment, who are carried out of the way by mutual discord."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Surely no defence of Paul for adopting this course is required, but our admiration is due to his skill and presence of mind."
2. "He well knew, from past and present experience, that personal odium would bias his judges, and violence prevail over justice; he therefore uses in the cause of truth the maxim so often perverted to the cause of falsehood, Divide et impera."
3. "My only crime, he urged with passionate earnestness, is that I preach with a strange success that great doctrine of the resurrection, the maintaining of which at all risks, in an unbelieving and faithless generation, is the reason of existence of the whole Pharisee sect."
