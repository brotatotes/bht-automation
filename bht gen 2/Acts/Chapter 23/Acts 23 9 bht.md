# Acts 23:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disagreement between the Pharisees and Sadducees showed the harm and chaos that divisions can bring. Their disputes stemmed from ambition, leading to contention and stubbornness. In their heated contention, they lost the ability to judge and moderate properly, becoming blind to the truth. The Pharisees' hatred for the Sadducees blinded them to see that they shared a common foe in Paul. This reminds us of the danger of becoming consumed by disputes, which can disrupt everything. We must be cautious not to let the heat of contention cloud our judgment and understanding of the truth.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The sentence is an aposiopesis, not requiring any filling up: answering to our Engl."
2. "But what if a spirit (genus) or an angel (species) have spoken to him?"
3. "Perhaps in this they referred to the history of his conversion as told to the people, ch. 22."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee—The true reading seems to be, 'the son of Pharisees,' that is, belonging to a family who from father to son had long been such."
2. "of the hope and resurrection of the dead—that is, not the vague hope of immortality, but the definite expectation of the resurrection."
3. "By this adroit stroke, Paul engages the whole Pharisaic section of the council in his favor; the doctrine of a resurrection being common to both, though they would totally differ in their application of it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The importance of this doctrine, in their view, was so great as to throw into the background all the other doctrines that Paul might hold; and, provided this were propagated, they were willing to vindicate and sustain him." 
2. "The true solution of their conduct doubtless is, that they were so inflamed with hatred against the Sadducees that they were willing to make use of any argument against their doctrine."
3. "Men are not always very careful about the exact correctness of their statements when they wish to humble a rival."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Pharisees' hatred of the Sadducees was greater than their hatred of Christianity."
2. "The words form a broken sentence, followed by a significant silence, which leaves the hearers to supply the omission for themselves."
3. "The words which the A. V. supplies to complete the sentence, let us not fight against God, are spurious, borrowed from ch. 5 39."

### John Calvin:
1. "This place doth teach what mischief disagreements bring with them. For because they take their beginning for the most part of ambition, men proceed thence unto contention, and straightway stubbornness breaketh out. When they be come thither, because there is no place left either for judgment or moderation, they can no longer judge of the cause."
2. "But because they inveigh against the Sadducees, they are so inflamed with hatred against them, that they be blind in Paul's matter. For which cause we must beware of heat of contention, which disturbeth all things."
3. "Notwithstanding, we see again that those stand in doubt who take not good heed, and are not careful to mark the word of God; and that they waver so often as any thing is brought to light, because they be unworthy to understand the certain truth."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "These recognise now that the Christian teacher was not the enemy they should fear: they and Paul had another and a common foe in the sceptic Sadducees."
2. "If a spirit spoke to him or an angel that is not an impossible thing: the matter then assumes importance."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Strove (διεμαχοντο). Imperfect middle of διαμαχομα, old Attic verb, to fight it out (between, back and forth, fiercely)."
2. "The Pharisees definitely take Paul's side."
3. "And what if a spirit hath spoken to him or an angel? (ε δε πνευμα ελαλησεν αυτω η αγγελοσ?). This is aposiopesis, not uncommon in the N.T., as in Luke 13:9; John 6:62 (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1203)."

### John Gill:
1. "They began to be very noisy, and to talk loud, and in high spirits, one against another."
