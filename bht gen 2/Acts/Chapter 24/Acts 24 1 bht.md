# Acts 24:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The high priest and the elders, aware of their illegal actions and knowing that their conspiracy against Paul's life had been exposed, employed a Roman lawyer familiar with Roman legal procedure and well-versed in the language and forms of the Roman courts. This lawyer, an eloquent orator, was intended to plead their cause and present their accusations against Paul confidently. However, the providence of God was at work in Paul's life, allowing him to endure the adversities and defend himself against these fierce attacks.
