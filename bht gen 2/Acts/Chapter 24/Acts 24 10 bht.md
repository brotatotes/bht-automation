# Acts 24:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul confidently speaks before the governor, Felix, who has been a judge over the nation for many years and is well-versed in their customs and religious rites, making him capable of understanding and deciding the case fairly. Paul refutes the accusation by stating that he has not had enough time in Jerusalem to form a party and incite insurrection, and he challenges them to provide any evidence of such claims. Furthermore, Paul openly acknowledges his Christian faith but argues that it aligns with the law and the prophets, deserving a fair consideration.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The contrast between Tertullus’s and Paul’s ‘captatio benevolentiæ’ is remarkable."
2. "The Apostle, using no flattery, yet alleges the one point which could really win attention to him from Felix, viz. his confidence arising from speaking before one well skilled by experience in the manners and customs of the Jews."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Thou hast been many years a judge to this nation—He had been in this province for six or seven years, and in Galilee for a longer period."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Paul did not begin his speech... by any of the arts of rhetoric. He founded his plea on the justice of his cause, and on the fact that Felix had had so much experience in the affairs of Judea that he was well qualified to understand the merits of the case, and to judge impartially."
2. "Paul was well acquainted with his character (see the notes on Acts 24:25), and would not by flattering words declare what was not strictly true."
3. "This address indicated great confidence in the justice of his cause, and was the language of a man bold, fearless, and conscious of innocence."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "He doth the more willingly answer for himself before Felix, because he had long time been governor of Judea; because, peradventure, some new governor − (573) would have been sore moved hearing such things laid to his charge."
2. "This is surely a sincere and free manner of defending, to set matter against words."
3. "For want of skill doth make judges too credulous, and doth enforce them to make too much haste."

1. "Paul’s defence was a strange contrast to the lying flatteries and the distorted accusations which made up the speech of the Sanhedrim advocate Tertullus."
2. "The prisoner then passed to the second charge, the being a 'Nazarene ringleader.' He certainly did belong to that sect, but he worshipped no strange Gods."
3. "Where were these men who had brought such strange meaningless charges against him? Surely they ought to have been present in person. If they, the real accusers, however, have for some unknown reason not chosen to present themselves, let these, pointing to the Sanhedrim representatives, say plainly what evil they have found me doing or saying, except that one assertion of mine respecting the resurrection of the dead."
