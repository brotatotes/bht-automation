# Acts 24:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul mentions that it has only been twelve days since he went up to Jerusalem for the purpose of worship. He emphasizes this to highlight the short amount of time he had spent in Jerusalem before being accused. Not only does this refute the idea that he had enough time to commit the alleged offenses, but it also contradicts the notion that he had come to Jerusalem with the intention of stirring up trouble. In fact, Paul asserts that his visit to Jerusalem was solely for the purpose of worshiping, specifically during the feast of Pentecost.
