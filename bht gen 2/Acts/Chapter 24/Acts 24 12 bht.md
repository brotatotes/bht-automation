Throughout the city, Paul firmly denied the accusations brought against him, stating that he had not engaged in any form of sedition among the Jews. He emphasized that he never entered into conversations with them or raised the people, inciting them to rebellion against the Roman government. Additionally, he made it clear that he had not caused any disturbances in the city or engaged in public disputes or discussions in the streets or markets. Paul adamantly maintained that the charges against him were false and unjust, as there was no evidence to support them.
