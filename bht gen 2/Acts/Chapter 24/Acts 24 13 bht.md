# Acts 24:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The accusers have failed to provide any substantial evidence to support their accusations against me. They have been unable to present a clear case or provide any testimony or proof for their claims. It is their responsibility to demonstrate the truth, but they have fallen short in doing so. This challenges and dares them to validate their assertions if they are to prove my guilt.
