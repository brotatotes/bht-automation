# Acts 24:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul had been away from Jerusalem for many years, spending much of that time among the Gentiles. Now, he returned to Jerusalem with a specific purpose—to bring alms for the impoverished church there. These collections were made among the Gentile churches, especially in Macedonia, to support the Jewish believers in Jerusalem. While Paul had previously shown a willingness to conform to Jewish customs to reach out to the Jews, his main intention in coming back was to offer help and support to his fellow believers.
