# Acts 24:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
While falsely accusing me of polluting the temple, certain Jews from Asia discovered me engaged in the sacred service of completing the observance of my vow. They found me purified in the temple, contradicting their claim of profanity. In truth, I was not defiling the temple, but rather honoring it by participating in its worship and service alongside others with similar commitments.

3. "Bornemann would supply Œø·Ωêœá Œø·ΩóœÑŒøŒπ ŒºŒ≠ŒΩ before œÑŒπŒΩŒµœÇ Œ¥Œ≠; but the objection to this is, that the negative Œø·Ωê ŒºŒµœÑ·Ω∞ ·ΩÑœá ‚Ä¶ stands already as the proper opponent clause to œÑŒπŒΩŒµœÇ Œ¥Œ≠, and we should thus have two negative clauses together."
