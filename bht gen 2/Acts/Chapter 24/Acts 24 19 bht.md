# Acts 24:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The persecution of the children of God often leads to great errors and blunders, with the world going against its own laws in the process. It is important for those who accuse to have the proper evidence and witnesses present to substantiate their claims. Only then can a fair and just judgment be made.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The sentence is an anacoluthon: δεῖ is absolutely asserted in the present: then ἔχοιεν in the opt. follows, as if the hypothetical ἔδει had been used: and hence the correction to ἔδει."
2. "This also is a skilful argument on the part of the Apostle: it being the custom of the Romans not to judge a prisoner without the accusers face to face, he deposes that his real accusers were the Asiatic Jews who first raised the cry against him in the temple, not the Sanhedrim, who merely received him at the hands of others, and that these were not present."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They were the proper witnesses, and as they had staid away it showed that they were not prepared to undergo a strict examination."
2. "They alone could testify as to anything that occurred in the temple; and as they were not present, that charge ought to be dismissed."

### John Calvin:
1. "Ye which lay so many things to my charge, cannot tell how the matter standeth; but you bring before the judgment-seat of the governor a tale which was rashly believed."
2. "But those who are to be blamed for the matter...appear not. After Paul hath turned back [retorted] the crime upon others, taking to himself a good courage, he doth now appeal unto the adversaries which are present, willing them if they know anything by him freely to utter it."
3. "For his meaning is, in my judgment, that he was ready to give an account of all things in their council...because, if there had been in him any fault, they would not have concealed it then."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This was happily urged by the apostle, as it was the Roman custom not to judge a prisoner on any charge unless the accusers were present."
2. "Paul urges that his accusers really were not the Sanhedrim nor the Jews then in court, but certain foreign pilgrims from Ephesus (Asia)."
3. "These we hear nothing of now; they had doubtless tarried behind in Jerusalem, or had already set out on their return journey."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The passage as it stands is instinct with life, and seems to exhibit the abruptness so characteristic of the Pauline Epistles."
2. "The accusers who were present had not witnessed the alleged offense: those who could have given evidence at first-hand were not present."
3. "A condition of the fourth class or undetermined with less likelihood of being determined... with a conclusion of the second class."

### John Gill:
1. "Who ought to have been here before thee,.... For they were the only persons who saw him in the temple, and what he was doing; and who by an hideous outcry raised a mob upon him, who took things upon hearsay from them."
2. "and object, if they had ought against me; either with respect to sedition, or blasphemy, error or heresy, if they were capable of proving anything."

### John Wesley:
1. "But the world never commit greater blunders, even against its own laws, than when it is persecuting the children of God."
