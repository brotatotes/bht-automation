# Acts 24:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Felix, the judge before whom Paul was brought forth, listened to Tertullus, who indulged in flattery as he accused Paul. Tertullus praised Felix, claiming that peace and prosperity had been achieved under his governance. However, Felix's true character and governance were quite infamous, as he was known for being corrupt and causing trouble throughout the provinces he ruled. This starkly contrasts with Paul's honest, humble, and truthful speech.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Certainly Tertullus fulfils and overacts the precept, for his exordium is full of the basest flattery."
2. "There was just enough foundation for the flattery, to make the falsehood of its general application to Felix more glaring."
3. "It has been remarked that the character of this address is peculiarly Latin."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness." 
2. "Felix acted with a degree of vigor and success." 
3. "by thy providence—a phrase applied to the administration of the emperors."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Though it was said for flattery, and though Felix was in many respects an unprincipled man, yet it was true that his administration had been the means of producing much peace and order in Judea, and that he had done many things that tended to promote the welfare of the nation."
2. "He referred to those [deeds] which have just been mentioned as having been accomplished by Felix, particularly his success in suppressing riots and seditions; and as, in the view of the Jews, the case of Paul was another instance of a similar kind, he appealed to him with the more confidence that he would suppress that also."
3. "By thy providence - By thy foresight, skill, vigilance, prudence."

### John Calvin:
1. "Not that I am of their mind who reprehend Tertullus for speaking the judge fair, and for seeking to win his favor. For it is not always disagreeing with the right and lawful form of pleading to commend the judge..."
2. "For the rhetorician doth insinuate himself under false praises, that he may darken the matter which is called in question."
3. "Therefore Tertullus commendeth the industry of Felix, because he had cleansed Judea from many corruptions, and he restored many things which would otherwise have decayed."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Felix, during his long and burdensome administration, had at least distinguished himself by his strong measures to put down brigandage and deeds of violence in Judæa, and had waged ceaseless warfare against those wandering bands of Sicarii (assassins) which had begun to infest the country."
2. "And that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation. Rather ‘reforms’ or ‘improvements, according to the reading of the more trustworthy MSS. There was absolutely no ground for this statement of Tertullus; within two years of this time, Felix was accused by the Jews of bad government, and the accusation supported by such undeniable proof that he was recalled from his province to Rome."
3. "By thy providence. Tua providentia, Providentia Cæsaris, is a common inscription on the coins of the emperors."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Obtaining much peace by thee." 
2. "Providence is Latin Providentia (foreseeing, provideo)."
3. "Reform continually taking place for this nation."

### John Gill:
1. "And when he was called forth...he was ordered to be brought out of custody into the court, to hear his indictment, and answer for himself." 
2. "Tertullus began to accuse him...which he introduced with a flattering preface to Felix..." 
3. "Saying, seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence...which showed his sagacity, and which Tertullus here calls 'providence'..."

### John Wesley:
1. "A speech how different from St. Paul's; which is true, modest, solid, and without paint."
2. "Felix was a man of the most infamous character."
3. "Felix was a plague to all the provinces over which he presided."
