# Acts 24:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After gaining a more perfect knowledge of the beliefs and teachings followed in that way, the judge decided to put off the case until he had received more accurate information. He wanted to ensure that he had a complete understanding of the matter before making any decisions. Once he had gathered all the necessary details, he promised to bring the case to a conclusion and provide a final resolution. It is likely that he, along with other officials involved, would have shared a comprehensive account of the events with their superiors in Rome.
