# Acts 24:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Felix, perceiving the innocence of Paul and the malicious intent of the priests, showed him favor by allowing him to be visited by his friends. The custody that Paul was under in Caesarea was military arrest, which had relaxed conditions. This allowed him to have more freedom and to receive support from his acquaintances. Despite the efforts of the Jews to impede the spreading of the Gospel, they were unable to hinder it.
