# Acts 24:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Drusilla, the daughter of Herod Agrippa I, had a significant presence during the first century. She was renowned for her beauty and unfortunately was enticed by Felix, who convinced her to leave her husband and marry him, despite being a heathen. Tragically, Drusilla and her son from Felix met their demise in the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius. It is worth noting that the phrase concerning the faith in Christ refers to the entirety of the Christian religion and its teachings.
