# Acts 24:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Preaching the gospel to Felix, an unjust and immoral judge, required more than just words about Christ; it necessitated addressing the specific sins and duties relevant to his life and position. Like many, Felix deferred the consideration of righteousness, self-control, and the coming judgment to a future time that never arrived. So, let us be cautious and not rely on false dependencies that may prevent us from being convicted and transformed by the faithful preaching of God's word.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is remarkable that Tacitus uses of Felix the expression ‚Äòcuncta malefacta sibi impune ratus.‚Äô"
2. "The fear of Felix appears to have operated merely in his sending away Paul."
3. "No impression for good was made on him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He ruled with a mixture of cruelty, lust, and servility, and relying on the influence of his brother Pallas at court, he thought himself at liberty to commit every sort of crime with impunity."
2. "How noble the fidelity and courage which dared to treat of such topics in such a presence, and what withering power must have been in those appeals which made even a Felix tremble!"
3. "Alas for Felix! This was his golden opportunity, but‚Äîlike multitudes still‚Äîhe missed it. Convenient seasons in abundance he found to call for Paul, but never again to 'hear him concerning the faith in Christ,' and writhe under the terrors of the wrath to come."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Paul seized every opportunity of making known the gospel; and whether a prisoner or at liberty; whether before princes, governors, kings, or common people, he was equally prepared to defend the pure and holy doctrines of the cross."
2. "His aim was to defend the truth, and to save, if possible, the souls of Drusilla and of Felix."
3. "He was alarmed and terrified, and looked with deep apprehension to the coming judgment. This was a remarkable instance of the effect of truth on the mind of a man unaccustomed to such alarms, and unused to hear such truth."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He supposed he might perpetrate with impunity every kind of villainy."
2. "Temperance [ŒµŒ≥Œ∫œÅŒ±œÑŒµŒπŒ±] is, properly, self-control; holding the passions in hand."
3. "Trembled [ŒµŒºœÜŒøŒ≤ŒøœÇ Œ≥ŒµŒΩŒøŒºŒµŒΩŒøœÇ] Lit., having become in fear. Rev., better, was terrified."

### John Calvin:
1. "Let us first learn by this, what great force of the Spirit of God there was both in the heart and also in the tongue of Paul."
2. "And now seeing Felix‚Äô heart is so pricked with the voice of a prisoner, the majesty of the Spirit doth show itself in that also."
3. "Furthermore, this place doth teach that men are then examined and tried to the quick, when their vices, wherewith they are infected, are brought to light, and their consciences are called back unto the judgment to come."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Christian teacher apparently never touched on the ‚Äòevidences of his faith,‚Äô said nothing of his own life nothing in connection with his own experience of shame at the hands of men, or of surpassing glory at the hands of God."
2. "The three famous words rendered ‚Äòrighteousness,‚Äô ‚Äòtemperance,‚Äô and ‚Äòjudgment to come,‚Äô were without doubt Paul‚Äôs own expressions. Luke took them down from his master‚Äôs lips."
3. "The characters of Caiaphas and Annas, and of the sisters Drusilla and Bernice, were the natural outcome of the teaching of the Rabbinic schools so sternly condemned by the Lord Jesus."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul turned the tables completely around and expounded 'the faith in Christ Jesus' as it applied to Felix and Drusilla and discoursed concerning 'righteousness' which they did not possess, 'self-control' or temperance which they did not exhibit, and 'the judgment to come' which was certain to overtake them." 
2. "Felix was brought under conviction, but apparently not Drusilla. Like another Herodias her resentment was to be feared."
3. "It was his 'excuse' for dodging the personal turn that Paul had given."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle not only discoursed concerning the doctrine of faith in Christ, but insisted upon the duties of religion."
2. "He might show, that it was the loss of righteousness which was the reason of the first man being removed from his place and state of happiness."
3. "The universality of it, that it would reach to all men and things, and would proceed according to the strict rules of justice, and in the most awful manner; and that a true and just sentence would be pronounced and strictly executed."

### John Wesley:
1. "This was the only effectual way of preaching Christ to an unjust, lewd judge."
2. "Like thousands, he deferred the consideration of these things to a more convenient season. A season which, alas! never came."
3. "Let this teach us to guard against all such false dependencies as tend to elude those convictions that might otherwise be produced in us by the faithful preaching of the word of God."
