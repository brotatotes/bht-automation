# Acts 24:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Unjust and greedy, Felix hoped to receive a bribe from Paul, yet the apostle knew the value of justice and did not give in to corruption. The Roman governors, like Felix, often sought personal gain and disregarded justice. Though Felix hoped for some reward, Paul's poverty and integrity prevented him from satisfying the governor's desires. Ultimately, Felix's hope for money cost him the spiritual treasures that Paul had to offer.
