# Acts 24:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Felix, the governor of Judea, sought to please the Jews at the expense of justice. Despite Paul's knowledge of Felix's inclination for bribery, he refused to offer him money. In an attempt to gain the favor of the Jews, Felix left Paul bound. However, this plan to suppress their enmity proved unsuccessful. Felix's corrupt practices and unjust governance led to numerous complaints against him. These accusations continued to haunt him even in Rome, but he was spared from complete ruin thanks to the intervention of his brother Pallas with Emperor Nero.

### John Calvin:
1. "Seeing Paul knew that the judge who did gape for gain would be favorable to him so soon as he should offer him money, and seeing he had sufficient time to gather the same; it is likely that he did not only bear with the brethren, but also detest such bribery, wherewith the holiness of civil order is shamefully polluted."
