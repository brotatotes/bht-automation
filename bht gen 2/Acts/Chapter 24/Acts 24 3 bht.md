## BHT:
The people, in all ways and in all places, expressed their gratitude and commendation for the provident care and blessings they received under the governor's leadership. They acknowledged his right actions and were thankful for the favors extended to them. However, it is important to recognize that this display of gratitude was nothing more than a refinement of flattery, a pretense and insincere artifice.
