# Acts 24:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The speech by Tertullus, with its flawed structure and unconvincing arguments, failed to make a compelling case before Felix. Seeking to preserve Felix's patience and avoid any impropriety, Tertullus urged a swift hearing of his words. It is interesting to consider that God may have intervened in the orator's abilities, thwarting his attempts to deceive Felix through eloquence.
