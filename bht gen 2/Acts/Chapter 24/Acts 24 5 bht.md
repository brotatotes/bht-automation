# Acts 24:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Tertullus, the advocate who accuses Paul, labels him as a pestilent fellow, likening him to a plague or pest. He further claims that Paul is a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the Roman Empire. Not only is he accused of inciting disturbances, but he is also portrayed as a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes, a term used to refer to Christians in a derogatory manner. These false accusations aim to brand Paul as a troublemaker and a threat to both the Jewish and Roman authorities.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Jews could not call them by any name answering to Christians, as the hope of a Messiah was professed by themselves."
2. "The phænomena are common enough in the Acts, of unaccountable insertions, and almost always in D (here deficient)."
3. "I still retain the words, in dark brackets, being as much at a loss as ever to decide respecting them, and being moved principally by the aorist ἐκρατήσαμεν, inexplicable without any sequel."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "a pestilent fellow—a plague, or pest."
2. "and a mover of sedition among all the Jews—by exciting disturbances among them."
3. "a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes—the second charge; and true enough."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Tertullus did not say that he was a pestilent fellow, but that he was the very pestilence itself." 
2. "This they pretended he did by preaching doctrines contrary to the laws and customs of Moses, and exciting the Jews to tumult and disorder."
3. "The meaning is, that Paul had been so active, and so prominent in preaching the gospel, that he had been a leader, or the principal person in extending the sect of the Nazarenes."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Pestilent fellow [λοιμον] . Lit., a plague or pest."
2. "Ringleader [πρωτοστατην] . Originally, one who stands first on the right of a line; a file - leader."
3. "Nazarenes. The only passage in scripture where this term is used to denote the Christians."

### John Calvin:
1. "Tertullus doth aim at a double mark. The first is this, that Paul may be delivered to the Jews, because they be very skillful in matters which concern the worship of God and the law of Moses."
2. "They knew that the Romans did hate nothing more, therefore they urge that the sorest against Paul."
3. "These good men, who are so zealous over their liberty, do not spare the chiefest maintainers thereof, so they may cause Paul to be hated by means of them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The 'world' here means the Roman orbis terrarum, in other words, 'the Roman Empire,' which, in the days of Paul, embraced so vast an area in the East as well as the West."
2. "The Jews of Thessalonica, when they arrested Jason and other friends of Paul, accused the apostle and his companions of being 'those who had turned the world upside down .... doing things contrary to the decrees of Cæsar, saying that there is another king, Jesus'"
3. "This was really in the eyes of the Jews the offence which Paul had committed. It was here urged by the Sanhedrim advocate Tertullus, before a Roman tribunal, as an offence against the laws of the Empire, inasmuch as the prisoner was an acknowledged chief of a worship not licensed and approved by the state, and an introducer of strange gods."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For we have found a pestilent fellow, a mover of insurrections." 
2. "Throughout the world, a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes."

### John Gill:
1. "For we have found this man a pestilent fellow... as may be observed in several places in Cicero's Orations."
2. "And a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world... the crime charged upon him is greatly aggravated, as that not only he was guilty of sedition, but that he was the mover of it, and that he stirred up all the Jews to it, and that in every part of the world, or empire, than which nothing was more false."
3. "And to this charge he adds, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes; Not Nazarites, as Calvin seems to understand the passage; but Nazarenes, that is, Christians, so called by way of contempt and reproach."
