# Acts 24:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The false accusation of attempting to profane the temple was a flimsy and baseless charge made by the Asian Jews. Instead of following proper legal procedures, they seized Paul without any legal proceedings and did not allow him to present his case. In fact, it was only because of the intervention of the chief captain and his soldiers that Paul was saved from the mob who sought to harm him. This incident clearly highlights the unjust and unlawful actions of those who sought to falsely accuse and harm Paul.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 6. hath gone about—attempted. 
	to profane the temple—the
	third charge; and entirely false. 
	we . . . would have judged
	according to our law.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Who also hath gone about - Who has endeavored."
2. "To profane the temple - This was a serious, but unfounded charge."
3. "And would have judged - That is, would have condemned and punished."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word profane is the Latin pro fanurn, in front of the sanctuary; that which is kept outside the fane because unholy."
2. "The word is akin to bhlov, threshold, and bainw, to step; and its fundamental idea, therefore, is that of overstepping the threshold of sacred places."
3. "We laid hold. The best texts omit all after these words as far as by examining."

### John Calvin:
1. "It was a light and almost frivolous accusation to lay this to his charge before the Roman governor, who could have wished that the temple had been turned topsy-turvy."
2. "But because nothing was more fit for procuring uproars than the polluting of the temple, he doth craftily accuse Paul thereof, as if he should say, that it was no thanks to him that Jerusalem was not on an uproar; and that he carried such a firebrand as might have procured sore hurt if he had not been prevented."
3. "Also he includeth that other thing, that because Paul had offended in matters of religion, it did belong properly to the Jews to give judgment in that matter."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Here the careful lawyer modifies the original accusation, and merely states the prisoner had attempted to profane the Jerusalem temple."
2. "The critical evidence for and against the words is as follows: The passage is omitted in five out of the six of the great Greek (uncial) MSS., upon which we rely here for our text of the Acts."
3. "Perhaps Dean Alford’s compromise, by which he prints the disputed words, but encloses them in a bracket [ ... ] thus, is the fairest and best solution of an acknowledged difficulty."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Assayed to profane (επειρασεν βεβηλωσα). A flat untruth, but the charge of the Asian Jews (Acts 21:28-30). Verbum optum ad calumnian (Bengel)."
2. "We seized (εκρατησαμεν). As if the Sanhedrin had arrested Paul, Tertullus identifying himself with his clients. But it was the mob (Acts 21:28-31) that attacked Paul and Lysias who rescued him (Acts 21:32)."

### John Gill:
1. "By introducing a Greek into it; see Acts 21:28 which was only a supposition and conjecture of the Asiatic Jews, and was a false and groundless one"
2. "they had him not before any court of judicature; they brought no charge in form against him, nor did they examine his case, and inquire into the truth of things, or hear what he had to say"
3. "if it had not been for the chief captain and his soldiers, would have destroyed him, so far were they from proceeding according to their law"
