# Acts 24:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The chief captain Lysias arrived abruptly, catching the conspirators off guard and preventing them from carrying out their murderous intentions swiftly. Their purpose was not to conduct a fair trial but to execute Paul, similar to the actions of the zealots. Lysias, recognizing the danger, forcefully intervened and removed Paul from their grasp, utilizing the might of his soldiers to secure his rescue.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But . . . Lysias came upon us,
	and with great violence took him out of our hands—a wilful
	falsehood and calumnious charge against a public officer." 
2. "He had commanded the Sanhedrim to meet for no other purpose than to 'judge him according to their law'; and only when, instead of doing so, they fell to disputing among themselves, and the prisoner was in danger of being 'pulled in pieces of them' ( :-) —or as his own letter says 'killed of them' (Acts 23:27) —did he rescue him, as was his duty, 'by force' out of their hands."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Tertullus pretends that they would have judged Paul righteously if Lysias had not interposed; but the truth was, that, without regard to law or justice, they would have murdered him on the spot."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "When the Roman soldiers came on the scene, the Jews evidently at once released Paul without further violence: ‘When they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating of Paul’"
2. "The Sanhedrim council were extremely bitter against Claudius Lysias, and the intention evidently of their advocate’s words here (if we admit them as genuine), was to insinuate that all was going on in order and in strict conformity to the law, until the commander in the castle of Antonia violently and oppressively interfered."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This whole verse with some words at the end of verse Acts 24:6 and the beginning of verse Acts 24:8 in the Textus Receptus is absent from Aleph A B H L P 61 (many other cursives) Sahidic Bohairic."
2. "It is beyond doubt a later addition to the incomplete report of the speech of Tertullus."
3. "The motive of the added words is clearly to prejudice Felix against Lysias and they contradict the record in Acts 24:21."

### John Gill:
1. "But the chief captain Lysias came upon us,.... Suddenly, and at unawares, immediately, and with great haste, before they could execute their designs;" (Acts 23:27)
