# Acts 24:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Tertullus tries to shift the blame onto the captain, insinuating that the legal process against Paul was hindered by him. He suggests that it is because of the captain that the governor, high priest, and elders are troubled. But by examining Paul himself, the governor can gain knowledge of the accusations and see for himself the truth of the matter. Tertullus' impudence is evident as he boldly claims that the governor will easily find Paul guilty if he conducts the examination.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Certainly it might, on the other hand, be said that Tertullus would hardly refer the governor to Lysias, whose interference he had just characterized in such terms of blame."
2. "The judge should be referred to the prisoner (for examination by torture on one who had already claimed his rights as a Roman citizen can hardly be intended) for the particulars laid to his charge."
3. "Remarkably enough, we find Felix, Acts 24:22, putting off the trial till the arrival of Lysias."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Commanding his accusers to come unto thee—Here they insinuate that, instead of troubling Felix with the case, he ought to have left it to be dealt with by the Jewish tribunal; in which case his life would soon have been taken."
2. "by examining whom—Lysias, as would seem (Acts 24:22)."
3. "thyself mayest, &c.—referring all, as if with confidence, to Felix."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Commanding his accusers ... - Acts 23:30.By examining of whom - That is, the Jews who were then present."
2. "Tertullus offered them as his witnesses of the truth of what he had said."
3. "It is customary for the sacred writers, as for other writers, to give only the outline of discourses and arguments."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. From whom. Paul. It would refer to Lysias if the omitted passage above were retained.

### John Calvin:
1. "A good request, that the governor do not give sentence before he thoroughly examine and know the matter; and that he do not condemn Paul before he be lawfully convict."
2. "They had witnesses in readiness; and that they do not offer themselves to prove the matter until they do call them; though there were another end."
3. "Thus do false accusers boldly boast that their matter is plain, that they may blind the eyes of the judges."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "By examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him."
2. "If the disputed words are left in the text as in our English Version, then ‘of whom’ refers of course to Claudius Lysias."
3. "If, however, we omit the words in accordance with the ordinary rules of criticism, then ‘of whom’ must refer to St. Paul."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "By examining him thyself (αυτος ανακρινας). Not by torture, since Paul was a Roman citizen, but by hearing what Paul has to say in defense of himself."
2. "Ανακρινω is to examine thoroughly up and down as in Luke 23:14."

### John Gill:
1. "Tertullus would insinuate that the captain was blameworthy, that he hindered a legal process against Paul; and that it was owing to him, that this trouble was given the governor, as well as the high priest and elders."
2. "By examining of whom; not the accusers, but either the chief captain, as some think, or rather Paul: thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things whereof we accuse him."
3. "So impudent was Tertullus, and of such effrontery and assurance, that he feared not to say, that the governor, by examining Paul himself, would easily come to the knowledge of the things he was accused of, and plainly see that he was guilty of them."
