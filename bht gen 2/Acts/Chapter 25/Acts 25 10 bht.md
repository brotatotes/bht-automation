# Acts 25:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul confidently states that no one has the authority to give him up to the Jews for judgment. In making this claim, he emphasizes that Festus cannot hand him over for he knows that Paul has done no wrong to the Jews. Instead, Paul appeals to Caesar, exercising his right as a Roman citizen to be judged before the Roman emperor and not before the Jewish authorities.
