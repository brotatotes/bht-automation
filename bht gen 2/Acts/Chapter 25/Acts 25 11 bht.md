# Acts 25:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul, aware of his rights as a Roman citizen, did not fear to face the accusations against him. He was willing to accept any verdict, even death, if he were proven guilty. With confidence in the justice of a Roman tribunal, he made it clear that no one had the authority to hand him over to the Jews; he declared his appeal to Caesar. This decision was not a way to evade or postpone justice but a bold assertion of his innocence and a desire to carry out God's plan for him to bear witness to Christ in Rome.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "If I am guilty, it is not by them, but by Cœsar, that I must be (and am willing to be) tried, sentenced, and punished. If I am innocent, and Cœsar acquits me, then clearly none will be empowered to give me up to them: therefore, at all events, guilty or innocent, I am not to be made their victim."
2. "I call upon, i.e. appeal to Cæsar."
3. "This power (of 'provocatio ad populum') having existed in very early times, was ensured to Roman citizens by the Lex Valeria, when it was decreed that it should be unlawful to make any magistrate from whom there did not lie an appeal."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The right of appeal to the supreme power, in case of life and death, was secured by an ancient law to every Roman citizen, and continued under the empire."
2. "Paul, strong in the consciousness of his innocence and the justice of a Roman tribunal, would not have made this appeal."
3. "When the only other alternative offered him was to give his own consent to be transferred to the great hotbed of plots against his life, and to a tribunal of unscrupulous and bloodthirsty ecclesiastics whose vociferous cries for his death had scarcely subsided, no other course was open to him."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "No true Christian wishes to escape from the laws. He will honor them, and not seek to evade them."
2. "Boldness is not incompatible with Christianity; and innocence, when its rights are invaded, is always bold."
3. "God answers prayer, but it is often in a way which we little anticipate. He so orders the train of events; he so places us amidst a pressure of circumstances, that the desire is granted in a way which we could never have anticipated, but which shows in the best manner that he is a hearer of prayer."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Deliver [χαρισασθαι] . With an underlying sense of giving him up as a favor to the Jews."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This power of appealing to Rome was a valuable privilege of all Roman citizens, and a great safeguard against tyranny and oppression on the part of provincial magistrates."
2. "We may well suppose, too, that Paul's determination to appeal to Caesar was strengthened, if not suggested, by this special promise he had received...that he should bear witness to the Lord Jesus in Rome before he died."
3. "He would carry out, he thought, his Master's will, and at all risks, even though in chains, would bear his witness to the Crucified in the imperial city; so he cried, 'I appeal unto Caesar.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Assuming it to be true for the sake of argument."

### John Gill:
1. "I refuse not to die... for if anything could be proved against him, that was of a capital nature, he did not desire to escape death; he was ready to die for it; this was no subterfuge, or shift, to evade or defer justice."
2. "no man may deliver me unto them; not justly, or according to the Roman laws; I appeal unto Caesar."
3. "to this the apostle was induced, partly by the conduct of the governor, who seemed inclined to favour the Jews; and partly by the knowledge he might have of their intention to lie in wait for him, should he go up to Jerusalem; and chiefly by the vision he had had, which assured him that he must bear witness of Christ at Rome."
