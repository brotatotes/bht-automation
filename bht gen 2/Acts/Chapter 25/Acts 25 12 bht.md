# Acts 25:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Festus, though possibly resentful, acknowledged Paul's appeal to Caesar, aware that he was obligated to honor it. This exchange shed light on the limited authority of the governor and the power of a Roman citizen's right to appeal. The council present during this discussion consisted of officials who provided counsel to the governors. This decision ultimately allowed the fulfillment of Paul's desire to go to Rome, aligning with the divine promise given to him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Thus were the two the design of Paul (ch. Act 19:21 ), and the promise of our Lord to him (ch. Act 23:11 ) brought to their fulfillment, by a combination of providential circumstances."
2. "We can hardly say, with De W. and Meyer, that these must have influenced Paul in making his appeal; that step is naturally accounted for, and was rendered necessary by the difficulties which now beset him."
3. "But we may be sure that the prospect at length, after his long and tedious imprisonment, of seeing Rome, must at this time have cheered him, and caused him to hear the ·ºêœÄ·Ω∂ ŒöŒ±ŒØœÉŒ±œÅŒ± œÄŒøœÅŒµœçœÉ·øÉ of Festus with no small emotion."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "He did not dare to deliver him to the Jews in violation of the Roman laws, and he was not willing to do justice to Paul, and thus make himself unpopular with the Jews."
3. "He was, therefore, probably rejoiced at the opportunity of thus freeing himself from all the trouble in the case in a manner against which none could object."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "In doubtful cases the governor was bound to consult with his council, and his failure to do so exposed him to censure."
3. "That Festus exercised this discretion in Paul's case is shown by his conferring with the council."

### John Calvin:
1. "The governors did use to have certain of the chief citizens which did attend upon them, and sat with them in judgment."
2. "Furthermore, it doth seem that Festus pronounced this with indignation, when he said interrogatively, 'Hast thou appealed to Caesar?'"
3. "To wit, because it grieved him that he could not do the Jews such a pleasure as he desired; though I leave that indifferent because it is neither of any great importance, and it leaneth only to a conjecture."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The council here referred to was not the members of the Sanhedrim then present at C√¶sarea, but certain officials whom Suetonius calls consiliarii."
2. "If the accusation against the citizen appealing were perfectly clear, as in the case of a notorious malefactor or rebel, the request to be allowed to appeal might be refused by the Roman official presiding over the court."
3. "Without, perhaps, quite conceding this, we cannot help suspecting that over the procurator‚Äôs face something like a smile of derision passed when he delivered his sentence: ‚ÄòWell, you have appealed to C√¶sar‚Äôs court; to C√¶sar‚Äôs court you shall go,‚Äô Festus knowing well the reception, the weary delays and harsh treatment, such a prisoner would probably meet with at Rome."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "If the prisoner were a well-known robber or pirate, it could be refused."
3. "But embarrassment will come to Festus. He has refused to acquit this prisoner. Hence he must formulate charges against him to go before Caesar."

### John Gill:
1. "He answered, hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go." 
2. "The question is put, partly for the more certain knowledge of the thing, that there might be no mistake in it; and partly on account of the Jews, that they might see that though he was disposed to do them a favour, it was not in his power, because of this appeal."
3. "It may be with some resentment in himself, since it carried in it a sort of reflection upon him, as if he was incapable of issuing this affair, or would not be just and faithful in it."
