Agrippa, the son of Herod Agrippa, was a king and the brother of Bernice. He played a challenging role during tumultuous times, being indebted to the Roman Empire and its ruling family.

The baroque nature of their lives and the intense love they had for each other can be seen in the events that unfolded.
