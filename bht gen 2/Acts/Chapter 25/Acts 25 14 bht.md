# Acts 25:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Many days were spent idly by Festus and King Agrippa, indulging in pleasure and engaging in various conversations. To pass the time, Festus took the opportunity to discuss Paul's case with the king. He explained that Paul was a prisoner, left behind by the previous governor Felix in Caesarea. Festus likely wanted to gain further insight into the reasons behind the intense hatred and accusations made against Paul by the Jewish leaders.
