# Acts 25:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is important to remember that the Romans had a practice of not condemning someone without giving them the opportunity to defend themselves. This was seen as a fair and just way to handle accusations. It was not their custom to simply hand someone over to be destroyed without allowing them to face their accusers and present their own defense. This rule, which is common among many nations, should guide our own actions and decisions, whether they be in public or private life. It is a rule that promotes justice and upholds the rights of the accused.
