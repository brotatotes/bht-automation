# Acts 25:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Festus admits that the accusations against Paul were not in line with what he had initially assumed. It appears that the accusations stemmed from a place of passion, rather than being based on concrete evidence. This revelation suggests that the hostility towards Paul was driven more by personal feelings than legitimate concerns.
