# Acts 25:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Festus, in his mention of Jesus, shows a lack of understanding and appreciation for the magnitude of the truth Paul was proclaiming. Yet this truth is of the utmost importance, for it declares Jesus as the one to whom every knee shall bow. Festus's doubt regarding Jesus being alive is founded on ignorance rather than lack of evidence. If only he had earnestly sought the truth, he could have been led to the glorious liberty of the children of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1.  19. ]  δεισιδαιμ  . is used by Festus in a  middle sense, certainly not as = ‘  superstition ,’ E. V., speaking as he was to Agrippa, a Jew.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Thus speaks this miserable Festus of Him to whom every knee shall bow" - Bengel.
2. "The resurrection of the Crucified One had been the burden, as usual, of Paul's pleading."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Festus would not probably speak of the religion of his royal guest as superstition, but would speak of it with respect."
2. "He meant, therefore, to say simply that they had certain inquiries about their own religion, but accused him of no crime against the Roman laws."
3. "In this manner a Roman magistrate could speak of this glorious truth of the Christian religion, and this shows the spirit with which the great mass of philosophers and statesmen regarded its doctrines."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Better, religion, as Rev. As Agrippa was a Jew by religion, Festus would not have insulted him by applying the word superstition to his faith."
2. "He left Agrippa 'to take the word in a good sense, but reserved his own view, which was certainly the Roman one' (Meyer)."
3. "There is, indeed, a similar tact in Paul's use of the word to the Athenians. He selected 'a word which almost imperceptibly shaded off from praise to blame' (Trench)."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The English word ‘superstition,’ like the adjective used in chap. Acts 17:22, utterly fails to represent the Greek δεισιδαιμονι ́ ας   here."
2. "This word is one which may be understood in a bad sense, viz. a ‘superstition;’ but it also signifies ‘religion,’ without a shade of disrespect or slight being intended to be conveyed."
3. "The ‘Acts’ report is of the briefest, and fails to touch upon the inner line of thought of these ‘apologies’ of the great Gentile apostle. He evidently, on those occasions, by no means confined himself to the general doctrine of the resurrection taught in all the Pharisee schools in Jerusalem and elsewhere, but dwelt earnestly on the special connection of these doctrines with the resurrection of their loved Master, the Lord Jesus."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "But had (δε ειχον). Descriptive imperfect active of εχω and δε of contrast (but)." 
2. "This is the climax of supercilious scorn toward both Paul and 'one Jesus.'" 
3. "With all his top-loftical airs Festus has here correctly stated the central point of Paul's preaching about Jesus as no longer dead, but living."

### John Gill:
1. "The Jews objected to him among other things, his belief in Jesus of Nazareth, whom they traduced as an impostor and deceiver; Paul on the other hand argued, that he was the true Messiah."
2. "Paul affirmed that though they had put him to death, he was risen from the dead, and so was declared to be the Son of God with power."
3. "Festus, it is very likely, had never heard of Jesus before, and therefore speaks of him in this manner; or if he had, he had entertained a contemptible opinion of him, as well as of the Jewish religion."

### John Wesley:
1. "How coldly does he mention the things of the last importance!"
2. "And about one Jesus - Thus does Festus speak of Him, to whom every knee shall bow!"
3. "Whom Paul affirmed to be alive - And was this a doubtful question? But why, O Festus, didst thou doubt concerning it? Only because thou didst not search into the evidence of it. Otherwise that evidence might have opened to thee, till it had grown up into full conviction; and thy illustrious prisoner have led thee into the glorious liberty of the children of God."
