# Acts 25:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The leading men of the city, along with the chief priests, took the chance to approach the new Procurator when he arrived in Jerusalem. They hoped that this early encounter might work in their favor, as he was just beginning his governorship and might be inclined to please the influential members of society and gain their favor. They made strong accusations against Paul and sought to sway the governor's opinion against him. Their persistent pleas were an attempt to obtain a specific favor from him.
