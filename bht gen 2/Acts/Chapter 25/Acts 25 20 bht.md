# Acts 25:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is evident that Festus, as a Roman judge, was perplexed and unsure about how to handle the questions surrounding Paul's case. He considered going to Jerusalem to have the matter more thoroughly investigated and judged by the Jewish authorities, as they were better equipped to understand the nature of the accusations. It is possible that Festus also had political motives for wanting to gain a deeper understanding of Christianity, which was highly controversial and despised by the Jewish ruling elites.
