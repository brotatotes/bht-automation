# Acts 25:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Paul appealed to be reserved for the hearing of Augustus, he was asserting his right as a Roman citizen to have his case heard by the highest authority. This title of Augustus, which was not a proper name but a title of honor and reverence for the Roman emperors, was considered prestigious and carried great weight. It is interesting to note that while the title of Augustus belongs to the past, the lower and less distinguished title of Caesar has been adopted by other cultures, showing the influence and significance it held in the Roman Empire.
