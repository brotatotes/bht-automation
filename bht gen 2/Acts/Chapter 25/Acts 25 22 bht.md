# Acts 25:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Agrippa's desire to hear Paul speak was not simply out of curiosity or past wishful thinking. Being a Jew by profession, he knew more about Jesus Christ and the Christian sect than Festus did, and he must have heard much concerning these matters. Agrippa's curiosity was driven by a genuine interest in obtaining further information and knowledge about the controversial issues between the Jews and the Christians. The stage was set for this grand meeting, and Agrippa's presence allowed for a unique opportunity to witness a powerful defense that would unfold before them all.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "[ἐβουλόμην does not imply any former wish of Agrippa to hear Paul. It is a modest way of expressing a wish, formed in this case while the procurator was speaking, but spoken of by Agrippa as if now past by, and therefore not pressed.]"
2. "Agrippa, as a Jew, is anxious to hear Paul’s defence, as a matter of national interest."
3. "The procurator’s ready consent is explained, Acts 25:26."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I would also hear— 'should like to hear.'"
2. "Paul was right when he said, 'The king knoweth of these things... for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner'"
3. "Hence his curiosity to see and hear the man who had raised such commotion and was remodeling to such an extent the whole Jewish life."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Agrippa doubtless had heard much of the fame of Jesus, and of the new sect of Christians." 
2. "This wish of Agrippa gave occasion to the noblest defense which was ever made before any tribunal."
3. "Spendid eloquence as can be found in any language."

### John Calvin:
1. "And it may be that not only curiosity did move him to be desirous to hear Paul, but because he did hope to profit by hearing him."
2. "So that the holy minister of Christ is brought forth as on a stage, that a profane man may cheer up his guest, save only that Festus will be holpen with the advice of Agrippa and his company, that he may let Caesar understand how diligent he is."
3. "But admit none of them did embrace Christ sincerely and from his heart, this was no small profit, that the unskillful were appeased after that the malice of the enemies was discovered, that they might not be inflamed with such hatred against the gospel."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I was wishing... Agrippa must have heard often of Paul. Many and contradictory reports must oftentimes have been brought to this royal guardian of the temple the last guardian!"


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The imperfect for courtesy, rather than the blunt βουλομα, I wish, I want."
2. "Literally, 'I myself also was wishing' (while you were talking), a compliment to the interesting story told by Festus."
3. "The use of αν with the imperfect would really mean that he does not wish (a conclusion of the second class condition, determined as unfulfilled)."

### John Gill:
1. "I would also hear the man myself; Agrippa being a Jew by profession, and knowing more of these things than Festus did, and very likely had heard much concerning Jesus Christ."
2. "He was very desirous, not only out of curiosity to see the man, but to hear him; and get some further information and knowledge about the things in dispute, between the Jews and Christians."
3. "Sooner things could not well be prepared for an affair of this kind, and for so grand a meeting."
