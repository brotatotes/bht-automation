# Acts 25:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When examining the case of the accused, it becomes clear that he had not done anything to warrant a sentence of death. This conclusion is based on the fact that he had committed nothing deserving of such a severe punishment. It is worth noting that both Paul's own declaration of innocence and the testimony of others supported this. Additionally, since the apostle had appealed to Caesar, it was decided to send him to Augustus. This decision was reached after seeking the counsel of the authorities present, as their input was important in this matter.
