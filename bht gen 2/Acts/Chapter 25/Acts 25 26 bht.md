# Acts 25:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the case of Paul, the accusations brought against him were vague and lacking substance. Festus, conflicted by his own belief in Paul's innocence, sought the assistance of King Agrippa, who had a deeper understanding of Jewish customs. This encounter marked a significant moment in the growth of the early Christian Church, as testimonies from different regions converged. Amidst the false accusations, Paul's defense became an opportunity to proclaim and uphold the lordship of Jesus Christ, as believers steadfastly refused to compromise their faith in the face of persecution.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The whole matter had been hitherto obscured by the exaggerations and fictions of the Jews."
2. "Augustus and Tiberius refused this title; Caligula and (apparently) all following bore it."
3. "Now first was our Lord‚Äôs prophecy Matthew 10:18, Mar 13:9 fulfilled."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The writer's accuracy should be remarked here. It would have been . . . a mistake to apply this term ("lord") to the emperor a few years earlier."
2. "Neither Augustus nor Tiberius would let himself be so called, as implying the relation of master and slave."
3. "But it had now come (rather, "was coming") into use as one of the imperial titles" [HACKET].

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They had not accused Paul of any crime against the Roman laws; and Festus professes himself too ignorant of the customs of the Jews to inform the emperor distinctly of the nature of the charges and the subject of trial."
2. "The emperors that succeeded them, however, admitted the title, and suffered themselves to be called by this name. Nothing would be more satisfactory to Nero, the reigning emperor, than this title."
3. "As Agrippa was a Jew, and was acquainted with the customs and doctrine of the Jews, Festus supposed that, after hearing Paul, he would be able to inform him of the exact nature of these charges, so that he could present the case intelligibly to the emperor."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "An instance of Luke's accuracy."
2. "The title 'Lord' was refused by the first two emperors, Augustus and Tiberius."
3. "In the time of Domitian it was a recognized title."

### John Calvin:
1. "For it was a thing credible that he might easily be persuaded to lay away fear, and to submit himself to the judgment and discretion of a just judge."
2. "To what end soever he did it, he condemneth himself of iniquity by his own mouth, in that he did not let a guiltless man go free whom he is now ashamed to send unto Caesar, having nothing to lay against him."
3. "But the Lord (to whom it belongeth to govern events contrary to man‚Äôs expectation) had respect unto another thing, to wit, that when the clouds of false accusations were driven away, Paul might more freely avouch sound doctrine."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Festus was thoroughly perplexed in the case of Paul. It is quite clear his own feelings led him to look on his prisoner as innocent, but the reiterated and urgent pressure for his condemnation on the part of the supreme council led him to suspect that there was more in the accusation than met the eye." 
2. "Before writing his official report, Festus welcomes the assistance of one so well versed in Jewish religious and political matter as King Agrippa." 
3. "In Antioch, the new mother Church of Jewish and Gentile Christians was flourishing; here in C√¶sarea, the testimony which had begun in the house of Cornelius the centurion had now risen upward, till it comes before the brilliant assembly of all the local authorities, in the presence of the last king of the Jews."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "No certain thing. Nothing definite or reliable. All the charges of the Sanhedrin slipped away or were tripped up by Paul."
2. "Festus confesses that he had nothing left and thereby convicts himself of gross insincerity in his proposal to Paul in verse Acts 25:9 about going up to Jerusalem."
3. "Paul has all this fully in mind when he says in 1 Corinthians 12:3 that 'no one is able to say ŒöœÖœÅŒπŒøœÇ ŒôŒ∑œÉŒøœÖœÇ except in the Holy Spirit' (cf. also Philippians 2:11). The Christians claimed this word for Christ and it became the test in the Roman persecutions as when Polycarp steadily refused to say 'Lord Caesar' and insisted on saying 'Lord Jesus' when it meant his certain death."

### John Gill:
1. "No certain crime, charge, or accusation; nothing of any moment or consequence, no particular thing, nothing but a heap of confused notions." 
2. "A man of eminence, dignity, and authority, but of knowledge in such matters."
3. "Concerning him, and the charges exhibited against him to the emperor."
