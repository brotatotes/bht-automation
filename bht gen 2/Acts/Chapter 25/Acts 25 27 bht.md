# Acts 25:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Festus found it unreasonable to send a prisoner without specifying the charges against him, considering it to be an absurd and foolish act. He felt the need to elicit fresh facts and gain a better understanding of the secret history behind the whole affair. Festus was aware that a confused and contradictory statement could potentially harm his reputation in Rome. Thus, his interest in hearing the man who had caused such commotion and was reshaping Jewish life stemmed from curiosity and a desire to uncover the truth.

2. "In the case of Agrippa, we have an instance of the reasons which induce many people to hear the gospel. He had no belief in it; he had no concern for its truth or its promises; but he was led by curiosity to desire to hear a minister of the gospel of Christ."
3. "In Paul we have the example of a man unlike both Festus and Agrippa. He felt a deep interest in the subject a subject which pertained as much to them as to him. He was willing not only to look at it, but to stake his life, his reputation, his all, on its truth."
