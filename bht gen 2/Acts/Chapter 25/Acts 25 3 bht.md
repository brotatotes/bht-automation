# Acts 25:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The hostility of those against him remained deep, as they persistently sought his condemnation. Their request to have Paul sent to Jerusalem under the pretense of a trial was a part of their plot to ambush and assassinate him. The Sicarii, a group of assassins, were likely hired for this purpose. However, God's providence was evident in using Festus to prevent the fulfillment of their malicious plan, ensuring that Paul would bear witness to the truth in Rome instead.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "χάριν = καταδίκην, Acts 25:15."
2. "ποιοῦντες, not for ποιήσοντες: they were making, contriving, the ambush already."
3. "The country was at this time, as may be seen abundantly in Jos. Antt. xx., full of sicarii; who were hired by the various parties to take off their adversaries."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "How deep must have been their hostility, when two years after the defeat of their former attempt, they thirst as keenly as ever for his blood!"
2. "Their plea for having the case tried at Jerusalem, where the alleged offense took place, was plausible enough."
3. "Festus had been made acquainted with their causeless malice, and that in some way which Paul was privy to."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Would send for him to Jerusalem - Probably under a pretence that he might be tried by the Sanhedrin; or perhaps they wished Festus to hear the cause there, and to decide it while he was at Jerusalem."
2. "Their real motive is immediately stated."
3. "But God had promised him that he should bear witness to the truth at Rome Acts 23:11, and his providence was remarkable in thus influencing the mind of the Roman governor, and defeating the plans of the Jewish council."

### Marvin Vincent:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "From the detailed account, it seems that two formal requests were made to him by the priests and influential men at Jerusalem - the first was that he should pronounce a condemnatory judgment against the prisoner Paul." 
2. "This was the real point of their request. Failing to persuade the Roman governor to condemn Paul, they determined, if they could induce him to send the prisoner up from Cæsarea to Jerusalem, to lay an ambuscade and to assassinate the hated Nazarene teacher."
3. "No doubt, when the request was urged, the band of Sicarii (assassins) was already hired, and the very place where the murder was to be carried out fixed upon."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Asking favour against him (αιτουμενο χαριν κατ' αυτου). A favour to themselves, not to Paul, but 'against' him."
2. "Laying wait (ενεδραν ποιουντες). Old idiom for laying a plot or ambush as here."
3. "On the way (κατα την οδον). Down along, up and down along the way. Plenty of opportunity would occur between Caesarea and Jerusalem for ambush and surprise attacks."

### John Gill:
1. "They asked a favour of him, and desired it as such, as what would be gratefully accepted and acknowledged by them."
2. "Their scheme was, that if they could have prevailed upon Festus to have sent for Paul to Jerusalem, from Caesarea, they would have provided men... to have laid in wait for him in the way as he came, and to have killed him."
3. "The whole of this shows the malice of these men, the badness of their cause, the indefatigableness and diligence to attain their end, the danger the apostle was in, and the care of Providence over him."
