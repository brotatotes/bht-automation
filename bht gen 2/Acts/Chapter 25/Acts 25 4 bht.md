# Acts 25:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The governor decided that Paul should stay in custody in Caesarea, for it was there that his case should be heard. His response was wise and prudent, showing care for both Paul's safety and the preservation of the imperial privileges. In this decision, we see God's invisible hand at work, guiding the events of the world. The governor's actions, though silent, were filled with wisdom and energy. It was indeed improper to send Paul to Jerusalem at this time, and the governor's decision kept him safe.
