# Acts 25:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let those among you who have the ability and authority, particularly the leading individuals, come forward and bring their accusations against this man in a just and proper manner, presenting any evidence of wrongdoing that can be proved. If there are any criminal or unjust actions committed by him that are clearly unreasonable, against moral and legal standards, and even if they involve blasphemy or sedition, let them be brought forth in the proper context so that a fair trial can be conducted.
