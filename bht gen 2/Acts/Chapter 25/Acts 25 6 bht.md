# Acts 25:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Festus lost no time and sat on the judgment seat to try the apostle's case. He commanded Paul to be brought from his place of custody to the judgment hall. The historian may not have known the exact number of days, as the different translations mention eight or ten days. The timeframe was short for a new governor to stay in Jerusalem before departing.
