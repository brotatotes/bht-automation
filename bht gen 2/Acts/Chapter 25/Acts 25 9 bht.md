# Acts 25:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Festus, driven by a desire for popularity, sought to please the Jews by giving them the opportunity to try Paul before the Sanhedrin. However, Paul, being a Roman citizen, questioned the proposal, knowing that it was in his best interest to be tried under Roman law. It is clear that Festus was aware of the jurisdictional complexity of the case and tried to appease both sides, while also ensuring that he would not be accused of delivering a Roman citizen into the hands of the Jews. Ultimately, God providentially orchestrated these events, allowing Paul to appeal to Rome.
