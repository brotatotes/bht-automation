# Acts 26:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Paul was given the opportunity to speak for himself, he stretched forth his hand, an action that was customary for orators in those times. As he spoke, Paul was not pleading before his judges, but rather presenting an account of the Christian faith and addressing the point at issue between him and the Sanhedrim. Paul's defense was not only impressive because his hand was chained, but also because he held himself up as an apostle and messenger of God, demonstrating remarkable dignity and grace in his words.

"The prisoner Paul, it must not be forgotten, on this occasion was not pleading before his judges: the appeal to Cæsar, which had been allowed, had removed him from all provincial jurisdiction; he was simply here asked to give an account of the Nazarene or Christian faith, and to state what was the point at issue between him and the supreme council of the Sanhedrim, by whom he was considered unworthy to live."
