# Acts 26:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul, before his conversion, was actively involved in persecuting the early Christians. He went to great lengths to apprehend both men and women, imprisoning them and causing chaos within the Church. He not only approved of the persecution, but he actively participated in the condemnation of these innocent and righteous individuals. It is even speculated that Paul may have had the authority to cast votes and carry out the sentences against these believers, as he was closely associated with the chief priests and the Jewish Sanhedrin.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "Many Christians were put to death, but there is no improbability in supposing that the same thing which had happened to Stephen had occurred in other cases." 
2. "Stephen was the first martyr, and as he was a prominent man his case is particularly recorded."
3. "Paul instigated them in this persecution, and urged them on to deeds of blood and cruelty."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "On this word agiov, holy, which occurs over two hundred times in the New Testament, it is to be noted how the writers of the Greek scriptures, both in the New Testament and, what is more remarkable, in the Septuagint, bring it out from the background in which it was left by classical writers, and give preference to it over words which, in pagan usage, represented conceptions of mere externality in religion."
2. "Even in the Old Testament, where externality is emphasized, agiov is the standard word for holy."
3. "The phrase may be taken as expressing merely moral assent and approval."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul was not ashamed to confess how sore he had offended against God, so that that might turn to the glory of Christ."
2. "He doth not spare his own estimation, but doth willingly utter his own shame, that the mercy of God may the more plainly appear thereby."
3. "Though Paul might have retained the fame of a courageous man, yet he confesseth he was a madman."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "When Saul was consenting unto his death...committed them to prison...all these things took place in the Holy City." 
2. "Before the Jews he shrank from using any expression of reverential admiration...but now...he gives these noble martyrs, long since in Paradise, a title of honour which aggravated his own guilt as their persecutor."
3. "This assertion by Paul of his having voted for the death of certain of the 'saints' in the early Church, has been taken as a proof of his having been, in his Pharisee days, a member of the supreme council of the Sanhedrim."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Effective aorist active of κατακλειω, old word to shut down like a trap door."
2. "Paul was the official persecutor of the saints under the direction of the Sanhedrin."
3. "Paul's phrase (not found elsewhere) is more vivid than the usual καταψηφιζω for voting."

### John Gill:
1. "He haled men and women out of their houses, and committed them to prison, and made havoc of the church of Christ, and destroyed the faith." 
2. "I gave my voice against them; not that he sat in council, or was a member of the Jewish sanhedrim, and voted for the execution of the Christians, but he was pleased with the sentence they passed, and approved of it."
3. "Some render the words, 'I carried the sentence'; as the Vulgate Latin version; that is, the sentence of condemnation, which the Jewish sanhedrim passed upon the disciples and followers of Christ: this Saul took, and carried, it may be, both to the Roman governor, to be signed by him, and to the officers to put it in execution; so industrious and forward was he in persecuting the saints."

### John Wesley:
1. "Men not only innocent, but good, just, holy."
2. "I joined with those who condemned them."
3. "Perhaps the chief priests did also give him power to vote on these occasions."
