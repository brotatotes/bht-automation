## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "τιμωρῶν...by scourging; compare Matthew 10:17."
2. "ἠνάγκαζον does not imply that any did blaspheme...the imperf. only relates the attempt."
3. "The persecuting the Christians even to foreign cities, forms the transition to the narrative following."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is not necessarily implied in the expression, 'and compelled them to blaspheme,' that he succeeded in doing it, but that he endeavored to make them apostatize from the Christian religion and deny the Lord Jesus."
2. "Nothing could more forcibly express his violence against the Christians. He raged like a madman; he was so ignorant that he laid aside all appearance of reason; with the fury and violence of a maniac, he endeavored to exterminate them from the earth."
3. "None but a madman will persecute people on account of their religious opinions; and all persecutions have been conducted like this, with the violence, the fury, and the ungovernable temper of maniacs."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Persons were always scourged in the presence of the judges. For, punishment being designed in terrorem, what more likely to strike the mind with awe, and deter men from falling into like errors, than to have it executed in their religious assemblies and in the face of the congregation?"
2. "There were some weaker brothers, some timid sisters; these his harsh words and cruel deeds had compelled to blaspheme that glorious name by which they were called."

2. "I strove to make them blaspheme (ηναγκαζον βλασφημειν). Conative imperfect active of αναγκαζω, old verb from αναγκη (necessity, compulsion)."

### John Gill:
1. "And I punished them oft in every synagogue... by beating and scourging them there..."
2. "Compelled them to blaspheme; the Lord Jesus Christ, both to deny Him to be the Messiah, and to call Him accursed..."
3. "Persecuted them even to strange cities; particularly Damascus... or through the violence of his persecution he obliged them to fly to strange cities..."

### John Wesley:
1. "I compelled them — That is, some of them; to blaspheme - This is the most dreadful of all!"
