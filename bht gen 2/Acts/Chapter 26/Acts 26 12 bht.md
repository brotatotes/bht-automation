# Acts 26:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Saul was on his way to Damascus, he was engaged in affairs of persecution, intent on punishing the saints, compelling them to blaspheme, imprisoning them, and even putting them to death. He had the authority and commission from the chief priests to bring those who believed in Christ in Damascus bound to Jerusalem in order to be punished. Damascus was known as the chief city of Syria, where many believers had settled to escape the persecution in Jerusalem. Little did Saul know that his encounter on the road to Damascus would forever change his life.
