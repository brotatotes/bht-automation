The heavenly light that appeared was far more radiant than the sun, overwhelming Saul and his companions. This level of brightness serves to emphasize the greatness and divine nature of the encounter, as it is not mentioned in the other versions of this event. The brilliance of this created sun pales in comparison to the glory of the true Sun of righteousness, representing the Father's splendor.
