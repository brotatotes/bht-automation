# Acts 26:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As St. Paul spoke, the men with him were struck with fear, falling in awe of the divine presence manifested in the extraordinary light. While the other accounts only mention Paul falling to the ground, there is no contradiction in this detail. St. Paul clarifies that he heard a voice speaking to him, not only confirming the reality of the encounter, but also emphasizing the divine nature of the communication. It is worth noting that St. Paul's use of the Hebrew tongue distinguished his interaction with Christ, who both spoke in Hebrew during His earthly ministry and from heaven.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The metaphor is derived from oxen at plough or drawing a burden, who, on being pricked with the goad, kick against it, and so cause it to pierce deeper."
2. "It is a Greek, and not (apparently) a Hebrew proverb; but this is no reason why it should not be used in Hebrew, just as it is in Latin."
3. "Instances of its use are Pind. Pyth. ii. 173: χρὴ δὲ πρὸς θεὸν οὐκ ἐρίζειν … φέρειν δ ʼ ἐλαφρῶς ἐπαυχένιον λαβόντα ζυγὸν ἀρήγει . ποτὶ κέντρον δέ τοι λακτιζέμεν τελέθει ὀλισθηρὸς οἶμος."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks." 
2. "The metaphor, though not found in Jewish writings, was common in Greek and Roman writings."
3. "Who knows whether at that moment the operation of ploughing might not be going on within sight of the road along which the persecutor was traveling?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks." This proverb, well known in classical writers, is discussed at length in an Excursus which follows chapter 9.
2. "Although these words are omitted in the account of the appearance on the Damascus road by the writer of the ‘Acts’ in chap. Acts 9:5, and must therefore in that place be expunged from the text, here there is no shadow of doubt that the words formed part of Paul’s own account of the ‘appearance.’"
3. "Later scribes, as they copied MSS. of the ‘Acts,’ finding them here, no doubt inserted them in the passage of the ninth chapter, which relates the Lord’s words to Saul."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "When we were all fallen (παντων καταπεσοντων ημων)."
2. "It is hard for thee to kick against the goad (σκληρον σο προς κεντρα λακτιζειν)."
3. "A common proverb as Aeschylus Ag. 1624: Προς κεντρα μη λακτιζε."

### John Gill:
1. "Saul, and the men that were with him, [fell] for fear of the divine Majesty, who by this extraordinary light was thought to be present."
2. "The other narratives only relate Saul's falling to the earth; how this is to be reconciled to their standing speechless."
3. "I heard a voice speaking unto me."

### John Wesley:
1. In the Hebrew tongue — St. Paul was not now speaking in Hebrew: when he was, Acts 23:7, he did not add, In the Hebrew tongue. Christ used this tongue both on earth and from heaven.
