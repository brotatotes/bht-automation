# Acts 26:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul, who experienced both the sufferings and the glory of Christ, recounts how the Lord appeared to him for a purpose. This appearance was not for his destruction, but rather for his honor, comfort, and usefulness in the ministry. By affirming his authority as an apostle, Paul emphasizes that his commissioning was not of human origin, but rather a divine calling from Christ Himself. As a witness of the sufferings and the resurrection, Paul's encounters with the risen Lord solidify his position as a chosen instrument in proclaiming the Gospel message to all nations.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Paul was the witness of the glory of Christ: whereas Peter, the first of the former twelve, describes himself as 'a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed.'" 
2. "The expression 'ὑπηρέτην ὧν εἶδες' may be compared with 'ὑπηρέται τοῦ λόγου,' which Luke calls the αὐτόπται."
3. "ὧν τε ὀφθήσομαί σοι: (1) ὀφθ. must be passive, not causative (‘videre faciam’), but as E. V., I will appear unto thee. (2) The gen. is exactly paralleled by Soph. Œd. Tyr. 788, ὧν μὲν ἱκόμην = τούτων (rather ἐκείνων) διʼ ἃ ἱκόμην. So here ὧν = τούτων (ἐκείνων) διʼ ἃ ὀφθ., the things in (or on account of) which I will appear to thee."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Here the apostle appears to condense into one statement various sayings of his Lord to him in visions at different times, in order to present at one view the grandeur of the commission with which his Master had clothed him." 
2. "A minister...of those in which I will appear to thee—referring to visions he was thereafter to be favored with such as Acts 18:9; Acts 18:10; Acts 22:17-21; Acts 23:11; 2 Corinthians 12:1-10, &c."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Paul dwells on them here at length in order particularly to show his authority for doing what he had done in preaching to the Gentiles."
2. "No man is qualified to enter the ministry who has not a personal saving view of the glory and perfections of the Lord Jesus, and who does not go to his work as a witness of those things which he has felt."
3. "The highest personal consolation in this work is the promise of being admitted to ever-growing and expanding views of the glory of the Lord Jesus, and of experiencing his presence, guidance, and protection."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ did throw down Paul that he might humble him; now he lifteth him up, and biddeth him be of good courage."
2. "And this is no small consolation, when Christ saith that he appeared to him not as a revenger to plague him − for his madness, for those stripes which he had unjustly and cruelly given − but as a merciful Lord, intending to use his industry, and to call him to an honorable ministry."
3. "This vision was worthy to be recorded, by which he learned that Christ reigneth in heaven, that he might no longer proudly contemn him, but acknowledge that he is the Son of God, and the promised Redeemer."
