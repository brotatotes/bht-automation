### Henry Alford:
1. "The general reference of οὕς becomes tacitly modified [...] by the expression σκότος and ἐξουσία τοῦ σατανᾶ, both, in the common language of the Jews, applicable only to the Gentiles."
2. "This last reference determines πίστει τῇ εἰς ἐμέ to belong not to ἡγιασμένοις but to λαβεῖν."
3. "Thus the great object of Paul’s preaching was to awaken and shew the necessity and efficacy of πίστις ἡ εἰς ἐμέ. And fully, long ere this, had he recognized and acted on this his great mission. The epistles to the Galatians and Romans are two noble monuments of the APOSTLE OF FAITH."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The whole passage leans upon Isaiah 61:1...The connection here between being 'turned from darkness' and 'from the power of Satan,' whose whole power over men lies in keeping them in the dark."
2. "Faith is here made the instrument of salvation at once in its first stage, forgiveness, and its last, admission to the home of the sanctified."
3. "The faith which introduces the soul to all this is emphatically declared by the glorified Redeemer to rest upon Himself."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To open their eyes - To enlighten or instruct them. Ignorance is represented by the eyes being closed, and the instruction of the gospel by the opening of the eyes." 
2. "From the power of Satan - From the dominion of Satan. The pagan world, lying in sin and superstition, is represented as under his control; and this passage teaches, doubtless, that the great mass of the people of this world are the subjects of the kingdom of Satan, and are led captive by him at his will."
3. "That they may receive forgiveness of sins - Through the merits of that Savior who died - that thus the partition wall between the Jews and the Gentiles might be broken down, and all might be admitted to the same precious privileges of the favor and mercy of God."

### John Calvin:
1. "For it teacheth in other places how little man’s industry can do of itself. For they must plant and water, but it is God alone which giveth the increase."
2. "Therefore, this is the drift of the gospel, that being delivered from blindness of mind, we may be made partakers of the heavenly light; that being delivered from the thraldom of Satan, we may be turned to God; that having free forgiveness of sins, we may be made partakers of the inheritance among the saints."
3. "Therefore, in my judgment, this member, and that which followeth, express both one thing, to be turned from the power of Satan unto God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The two great features in Jesus Christ’s life and work which shocked His own people were (1) In His life, He presented the true image of a suffering Messiah. (2) In His work, He showed that the kingdom of the future was not intended to be confined to the old chosen race or the old Holy Land, but to be made up of all mankind and all countries of the world."
2. "The purpose and end of Saul’s life-work is to guide people into a knowledge of their state, their slavery to sin, and their utter hopelessness."
3. "The result of opening their blind eyes and turning to God is forgiveness of sins and a place among the sanctified, a home in the redeemed and restored."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "To open...that they may turn...that they may receive." 
2. "Sanctified by faith in me."
 


### John Gill:
1. "To open their eyes,.... The eyes of their understanding, which were shut, and darkened, and blind... to see their lost state and condition by nature, the exceeding sinfulness of sin..."
2. "And to turn them from darkness to light... in the effectual calling this darkness is in a great measure removed... they see light, and behold the above things, and of the light of glory hereafter."
3. "And from the power of Satan unto God... he has power over the minds of them that believe not, to blind them... they are... at his beck and command, and do his lusts, and obey his will."

### John Wesley:
1. "To open — He opens them, who sends Paul; and he does it by Paul who is sent."
2. "Their eyes - Both of the Jews and Gentiles: that they may turn - Through the power of the Almighty, from the spiritual darkness wherein they were involved, to the light of Divine knowledge and holiness."
3. "That they may receive through faith - pardon, holiness, and glory."
