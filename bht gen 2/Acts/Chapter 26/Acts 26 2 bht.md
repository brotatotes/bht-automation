# Acts 26:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul, in addressing King Agrippa by name, recognizes the peculiar force and significance it holds. By doing so, he establishes a connection and acknowledges Agrippa's understanding of Jewish customs and beliefs. This personal approach allows Paul to make his defense, affirming that it is an advantage for him to plead his own cause before someone who is familiar with the hopes and onlooks of the Jews. It is through this engagement and recognition of Agrippa's knowledge that Paul strengthens his defense and seeks to vindicate himself from the charges brought against him.
