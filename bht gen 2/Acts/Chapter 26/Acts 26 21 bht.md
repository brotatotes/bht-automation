# Acts 26:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle takes the opportunity to apply all that he had said, addressing the specific circumstances in which he was caught in the temple and faced the threat of being killed. These actions serve as a testimony to the truth of his preaching, for he was targeted for sharing his message indiscriminately, both to the Jews and the Gentiles, emphasizing the impartiality of the message of the Gospel.
