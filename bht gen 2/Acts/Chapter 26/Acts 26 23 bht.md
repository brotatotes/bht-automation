# Acts 26:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ, the Messiah, suffered in his human nature, not his divine nature, and he did so for the sake of sinners, to make peace and bring them closer to God. He was the first to rise from the dead, in his own power, to an immortal life, setting an example and leading the way for others who would follow.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Paul does not refer to the prophetic announcement, or the historical reality, of the fact of Christ’s suffering, but to the idea of the Messiah as passible and suffering being in accordance with the testimony of the prophets."
2. "That the fact of His having suffered on the cross was in the Apostle’s mind, can hardly be doubted: but that the words do not assert it, is evident from the change of construction in the next clause."
3. "this light, to be preached to the Jews (ὁ λαός) and Gentiles, must arise from the resurrection of the dead, and that Christ, the first ἐξ ἀναστάσεως, was to announce it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The construction of this sentence implies that in regard to the question 'whether the Messiah is a suffering one, and whether, rising first from the dead, he should show light to the (Jewish) people and to the Gentiles,' he had only said what the prophets and Moses said should come."


### Albert Barnes:
1. "That the Messiah expected by the Jews should be a suffering Messiah."
2. "That he would be the first that should rise...first in eminence; the most distinguished, the chief, the head of those who should rise from the dead."
3. "Would be their instructor and prophet...And to the Gentiles."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He expresses himself in a problematic form, because it was the point of debate among the Jews whether a suffering Messiah was to be believed in."
2. "They believed in a triumphant Messiah, and the doctrine of his sufferings was an obstacle to their receiving him as Messiah."
3. "Note the article, 'the Christ,' and see on Matthew 1:1."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Protected by a Divine and invisible Guardian, I have gone about, bearing my message to the powerful and humble alike, using as my storehouse of argument only the books of Moses and the prophets..."
2. "This expected One of Moses and the Prophets was not only triumphant as the Jews loved to dwell on, but a suffering Messiah."
3. "The Messiah, when He came, should be the Herald of life and light not only to the Jew, but to the despised Gentile."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Cross of Christ was a stumbling-block to the rabbis."
2. "Christ is the first who arose from the dead and no longer dies."
3. "It was at the word Gentiles that the mob lost control of themselves in the speech from the stairs."

### John Gill:
1. "The sufferer is Christ, or the Messiah, not the Father, nor the Spirit, but the Word, or Son of God, and not in his divine nature, which was incapable of suffering, but in his human nature."
2. "He endured, not for himself, nor for angels, but for chosen men, sinners, and ungodly persons; in order to make peace and reconciliation for them, procure the pardon of their sins, obtain eternal redemption for them, deliver them from all evil, and from all enemies, and bring them nigh to God."
3. "And that he should be the first that should rise from the dead: by his own power, and to an immortal life, as Jesus did; and so is the firstborn from the dead, and the first fruits of them that slept."
