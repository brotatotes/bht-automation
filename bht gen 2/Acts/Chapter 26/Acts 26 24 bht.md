# Acts 26:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Festus's accusation that Paul is mad is actually a misunderstanding on his part. Festus fails to comprehend the earnestness and importance of Paul's message, which is in stark contrast to the indifference of the Roman elite towards religious and moral matters. Festus, being unfamiliar with the Jewish faith, cannot grasp the significance of Paul's teachings and dismisses them as madness. He fails to see that the wisdom and knowledge Paul possesses is actually leading him to speak truth, despite the world's perception that it is madness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Festus was probably not so well acquainted as his predecessor with the character of the nation...Hence he is unable to comprehend the earnestness of St. Paul, so unlike the indifference with which religious and moral subjects were regarded by the upper classes at Rome."
2. "Thou art mad, not merely, 'thou ravest,' nor 'thou art an enthusiast:' nor are the words spoken in jest, but in earnest...Festus finds himself by this speech of Paul yet more bewildered than before."
3. "Thy much learning...seems more natural."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Paul, thou art beside thyself, much learning doth make thee mad—"is turning thy head."
2. "The union of flowing Greek, deep acquaintance with the sacred writings of his nation, reference to a resurrection and other doctrines to a Roman utterly unintelligible, and, above all, lofty religious earnestness, so strange to the cultivated, cold-hearted skeptics of that day—may account for this sudden exclamation."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The reasons why Festus thought Paul mad were, probably:(1) His great earnestness and excitement on the subject.(2) His laying such stress on the gospel of the despised Jesus of Nazareth, as if it were a matter of infinite moment."
2. "The really sober and rational part of the world they who fear God and keep his commandments; they who believe that eternity is before them, and who strive to live for it - are thus charged with insanity by those who are really deluded, and who are thus living lives of madness and folly."
3. "The tendency of long-continued and intense application to produce mental derangement is everywhere known."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "The much knowledge with which thou art busied."
3. "Is turning thee to madness."

### John Calvin:
1. "This outcry which Festus doth make doth show how much the truth of God prevaileth with the reprobate; to wit, though it be never so plain and evident, yet is it trodden under foot by their pride."
2. "Nothing was more foolish or more unsavory than the superstitions of the Gentiles, so that their high priests were for good causes ashamed to utter their mysteries, whose folly was more than ridiculous."
3. "And this is the cause that he cannot away to mark what he saith, lest he make him mad also; as many at this day fly from the word of God, lest they drown themselves in a labyrinth."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Paul apparently had, at this point of his address, completed the main argument, which he wished to put before Agrippa, on the real identity of his belief with that held by all orthodox Jews..."
2. "The Jews would find foretold in their Holy Scriptures every detail in the articles of the Christian faith which Paul taught."

2. "Thy much learning doth turn thee to madness (τα πολλα σε γραμματα εις μανιαν περιτρεπε). 'Is turning thee round.' Festus thought that Paul's 'much learning' ... was turning his head to madness and he was going mad right before them all."
