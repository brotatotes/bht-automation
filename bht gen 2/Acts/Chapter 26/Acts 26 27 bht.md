# Acts 26:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do you believe what the prophets have said about the person, office, sufferings, death, and resurrection of Christ? I know that you believe, not only in the truth of the prophets' words, but also that they have come to pass. If you believe in the prophets, then you believe in me and in Christ. With this question, Paul has captivated the attention of King Agrippa, leaving little room for him to escape his grasp.
