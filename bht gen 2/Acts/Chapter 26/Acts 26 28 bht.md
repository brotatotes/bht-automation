## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Lightly (with small trouble) art thou persuading thyself that thou canst make me a Christian: and understand them, in connexion with Paulâ€™s having attempted to make Agrippa a witness on his side, â€˜l am not so easily to be made a Christian of, as thou supposest.'"
2. "To my mind, the first of these considerations decides that Agrippa is characterizing no effect on himself, but what Paul was fancying in his mind, reckoning the Ï€ÎµÎ¯Î¸Î¿Î¼Î±Î¹ which he had expressed above: the second, that he speaks of something not that he is likely to become, but that contrasts strangely with his present worldly position and intentions."
3. "Most of the ancient Commentators (especially as reading Ï€ÎµÎ¯Î¸ÎµÎ¹Ï‚) take the words as implying some effect on Agrippaâ€™s mind, and as spoken in earnest: but this I think is hardly possible, philologically or exegetically."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Almostâ€”or, 'in a little time.' thou persuadest me to be a Christianâ€”Most modern interpreters think the ordinary translation inadmissible, and take the meaning to be, 'Thou thinkest to make me with little persuasion (or small trouble) a Christian'â€”but I am not to be so easily turned."
2. "But the apostle's reply can scarcely suit any but the sense given in our authorized version, which is that adopted by CHRYSOSTOM and some of the best scholars since."
3. "The objection on which so much stress is laid, that the word 'Christian' was at that time only a term of contempt, has no force except on the other side; for taking it in that view, the sense is, 'Thou wilt soon have me one of that despised sect.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He could not deny that he believed the prophecies in the Old Testament. He could not deny that the argument was a strong one that they had been fulfilled in Jesus of Nazareth."
2. "The arguments of Paul had been so rational; the appeal which he had made to his belief of the prophets had been so irresistible, that he had been nearly convinced of the truth of Christianity."
3. "This state of mind is one of special interest and special danger. It is not one of safety, and it is not one that implies any certainty that the 'almost Christian' will ever be saved. To be almost persuaded to do a thing which we ought to do, and yet not to do it, is the very position of guilt and danger."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Almost thou persuadest [ÎµÎ½ Î¿Î»Î¹Î³Ï‰ Î¼Îµ Ï€ÎµÎ¹Î¸ÎµÎ¹Ï‚]... The rendering almost must be rejected, being without sufficient authority."
2. "The phrase, in a little, is adverbial, and means in brief; summarily. We may supply pains or talk. 'With little pains, or with a few words.'"
3. "The words are ironical, and the sense is, 'You are trying to persuade me offhand to be a Christian.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "Agrippaâ€™s meaning is, that he will not willingly become a Christian; yea, that he will not be one at all; and yet that he is not able to gainsay, but that he is drawn after a sort against his will." 
2. "Whereby it appeareth how great the pride of manâ€™s nature is until it be brought under to obey by the Spirit of God."
3. "We must note that he doth not wish it simply, but from God, as it is he which draweth us unto his Son; because, unless he teach us inwardly by his Spirit, the outward doctrine shall always wax cold."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If thou goest on speaking as thou art doing, thou wilt soon persuade me to become a Christian."
2. "To him the Jewish sovereign was a soul just grasping with feeble uncertain hand the rope of safety which would save it from eternal death, but letting it slip through his weak nerveless fingers."
3. "Among the distinguished scholars and expositors who thus (in the sense of 'almost') understand the exclamation of Agrippa, must be reckoned the famous Greek commentator and writer Chrysostom."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "ÎµÎ½ Î¿Î»Î¹Î³Ï‰ does not mean 'almost.' It may refer to time (in little time) or a short cut, but that does not suit well ÎµÎ½ Î¼ÎµÎ³Î±Î»Ï‰ in verse Acts 26:29."
2. "Most likely the idea is 'in (or with) small effort you are trying to persuade me in order to make me a Christian.'"
3. "The tone of Agrippa is ironical, but not unpleasant. He pushes it aside with a shrug of the shoulders."

### John Gill:
1. "An almost Christian is one that has much light and knowledge, but no grace."
2. "He may know something of himself and of sin, of its being a violation of the law of God, and of the bad consequences of it, but has not true repentance for it."
3. "He may have a large notional knowledge of the doctrines of the Gospel, but has no experience of the power, sweetness, and comfort of them in his own soul."

### John Wesley:
1. "Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian!"
2. "Poor Agrippa! But almost persuaded!"
3. "Another step, and thou art within the vail. Reader, stop not with Agrippa; but go on with Paul."
