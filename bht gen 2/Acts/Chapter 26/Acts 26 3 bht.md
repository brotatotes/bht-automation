# Acts 26:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul acknowledges the expertise of Agrippa in the customs and questions of the Jews. Agrippa, being well-acquainted with these matters, had built a reputation for his exact knowledge and observance of Jewish customs. Hence, Paul earnestly appeals to Agrippa to listen patiently as he addresses the charges against him, considering Agrippa's familiarity with the laws and customs that form the basis of his defense. The discourse that follows exemplifies the harmonious blend of the Christian's sincerity, the apostle's boldness, and the gentleman and scholar that Agrippa represents.
