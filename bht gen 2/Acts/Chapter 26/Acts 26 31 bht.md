# Acts 26:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verdict is clear - this man is innocent and does not deserve death or imprisonment. Even his adversaries acknowledge that he has done nothing to merit such punishment. We must remember that their assessment is not based on one particular action, but on a careful consideration of his entire life. However, let us not forget that a favorable judgment from man is not all that God demands. We must respond to the message and purpose that this preacher brings, for he has been called by God and entrusted with a special mission.

2. "No definite act was alleged against him: and his apologetic speech was in fact a  sample of the acts of which he was accused."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This man doeth nothing worthy of death - This was the conclusion to which they had come after hearing all that the Jews had to allege against him."
2. "It was a full acquittal from all the charges against him; and though he was to be sent to Rome, yet he went there with every favorable prospect of being acquitted there also."

### Marvin Vincent:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It tells us how groundless were the accusations made against him...how blameless, how perfectly unselfish, was the whole tenor of that generous brave life."
2. "As Festus had arranged this hearing before Agrippa...he no doubt wrote such a favourable view of the prisoner’s case as eventually brought about his acquittal and freedom from his first Roman imprisonment."

1. "They spake one to another (ελαλουν προς αλληλους). Imperfect active, describing the eager conversation of the dignitaries about Paul's wonderful speech."
