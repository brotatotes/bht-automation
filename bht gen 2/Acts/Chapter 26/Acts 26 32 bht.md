# Acts 26:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is believed that this man could have been set free, but he chose to appeal to Caesar instead. The reasons for this decision are not entirely clear, but it seems that he wanted to ensure fairness and justice in his case. It is possible that he felt he would have a better chance of being heard and receiving a fair judgment before Caesar. This shows his determination to pursue his rights and seek justice, even if it meant facing a higher authority.
