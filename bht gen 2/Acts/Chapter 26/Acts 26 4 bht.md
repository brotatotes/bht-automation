# Acts 26:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
My conduct and behavior, starting from my early years until now, have been a part of my identity and known to those who have observed me. From the time when I was able to engage in religious practices and discern the different sects, my manner of life has been observed and recognized by others. Particularly, during my early days in Jerusalem, I was among the Jews, including the more learned and wise individuals. Therefore, my course of life should be familiar to them, as they have witnessed my actions and character since my youth.
