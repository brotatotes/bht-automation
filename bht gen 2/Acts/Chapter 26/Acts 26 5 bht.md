# Acts 26:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul, in his defense, refers to his previous life as a Pharisee, a member of the strictest sect of the Jewish religion. He lived his life in accordance with their strict rules and regulations, striving to be blameless both within the community and to outsiders. This knowledge about Paul's background added credibility to his current testimony, as those who knew him were well aware of the high standards he upheld. However, despite this knowledge, they chose not to testify on his behalf.
