# Acts 26:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The accusation against him encompassed not only the belief in the resurrection, but also the hope of a promised Messiah and His kingdom, which included the resurrection. In his defense, he emphasized the connection between his former Pharisaic life and his present proclamation of the hope of Israel. This hope involved righteousness, life, and salvation through the Messiah, along with the belief in the resurrection of the dead and the promise of eternal life. Paul's message was rooted in the understanding that without Christ's resurrection, the hope of resurrection for all would be impossible to attain.
