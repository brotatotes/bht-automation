# Acts 26:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The hope of the twelve tribes is firmly rooted in the promise made to their fathers, as they earnestly anticipate its fulfillment. It is clear that their hope is centered on the future, while some, like Paul, have come to find rest in the One who has already come. Though accused by the Jews, Paul's defense rests on the common belief and expectation of his countrymen, highlighting the innocence of his conviction. This collective hope of the twelve tribes is a powerful force that sustains and unites them, as they eagerly anticipate their inheritance of eternal life.
