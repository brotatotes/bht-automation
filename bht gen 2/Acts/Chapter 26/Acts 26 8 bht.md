# Acts 26:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Why should it be considered unbelievable by you? The notion of the resurrection of the dead was deemed implausible by many, even Festus himself, as mentioned in Acts 25:19. However, Paul responds as if he had heard Festus's doubts, emphasizing the importance of considering the incredible power of God and not confining the understanding of the resurrection to human comprehension. The resurrection is not only within the realm of possibility but also a manifestation of God's infinite power and the fulfillment of divine justice.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

3. "We have many instances of this use of εἰ: Xen. Mem. i. 1. 13, ἐθαύμαζε δὲ εἰ μὴ φανερὸν αὐτοῖς ἐστίν: ib. 18, ὅσα δὲ πάντες ᾔδεσαν, θαυμαστὸν εἰ μὴ τούτων ἐνεθυμήθησαν: ib. i. 2. 13, ἐγὼ δ' εἰ μέν τι κακὸν ἐκείνῳ τὴν πόλιν ἐποιησάτην οὐκ ἀπολογήσομαι: on which examples Hermann remarks, ad Viger. p. 504, 'in his locis omnibus rem non dubiam et incertam indicat εἰ, sed plane certam et perspicuam.'"

"As the perfections of God will be illustrated by his raising up the dead; as the future state is necessary to the purposes of justice in vindicating the just and punishing the unjust, and as God is a righteous moral governor, it should not be regarded as an absurdity that he will raise up those who have died, and bring them to judgment."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "If God raises the dead." (Rev.)
