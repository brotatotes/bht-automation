# Acts 26:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Before his conversion, Paul passionately believed that he should actively oppose Jesus of Nazareth and His followers. He thought it was not only his duty but also his conscience-driven conviction to persecute the early Christians and reject the teachings of Jesus. However, his encounter with Christ completely transformed his perspective and redirected his zeal towards spreading the Gospel instead. This radical change highlights the profound impact of Paul's conversion and serves as a reminder of the transformative power of encountering Jesus.
