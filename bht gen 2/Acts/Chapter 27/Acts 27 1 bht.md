# Acts 27:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Luke narrates the voyage and shipwreck with great detail, shedding light on ancient seafaring practices. Although he uses accurate sea terms, Luke's writing style reflects that of a landsman rather than a sailor. Through this account, we not only learn about the journey itself but also gain insight into the remarkable character of Paul. It is clear that Paul's voyage to Rome was part of God's plan, as he was entrusted to the care of Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band, who commanded respect like other centurions mentioned in the New Testament.
