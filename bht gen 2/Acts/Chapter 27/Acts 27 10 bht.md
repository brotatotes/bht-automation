## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "From the use of θεωρῶ here, and from the saying itself, it seems clear to me that Paul was not uttering at present any prophetic intimation, but simply his own sound judgment on the difficult question at issue."
2. "μετὰ ὕβρεως is interpreted by Meyer as subjective ‘accompanied with presumption on our part:' but not to mention that this would be a very unusual sense, Acts 27:21, κερδῆσαι τὴν ὕβριν ταύτ. κ. τ. ζημίαν, is decisive against it."
3. "ὅτι … μέλλειν] A mixing of two constructions, see Winer, edn. 6, § 44. 8, remark 2. This is most flagrant in later writers, as Pausanias and Arrian, but is also found earlier, e.g. Plato, Charm., p. 165: οὐκ ἂν αἰσχυνθείην ὅτι μὴ οὐχὶ ὀρθῶς φάναι εἰρηκέναι."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Sirs, I perceive, that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, &c.—not by any divine communication, but simply in the exercise of a good judgment aided by some experience."
2. "The event justified his decision."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I perceive - It is not certain that Paul understood this by direct inspiration. He might have perceived it from his own knowledge of the danger of navigation at the autumnal equinox, and from what he saw of the ship as unsuited to a dangerous navigation."
2. "It is not meant that their lives would be lost, but that they would be jeoparded."
3. "Paul evidently, by this, intended to suggest the propriety of remaining where they were until the time of dangerous navigation was past."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "I perceive [θεωρω] . As the result of careful observation."
2. "Hurt [υβρεως] . The word literally means insolence, injury, and is used here metaphorically: insolence of the winds and waves, 'like our 'sport' or 'riot' of the elements' (Hackett)."
3. "Damage [ζημιας] . Better, as Rev., loss. Hurt and damage (A. V.) is tautological."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Hurt and much damage, i.e. risk of injury and great loss."
2. "St. Paul, with his customary good sense, uses an argument which would appeal forcibly to every one who heard him."

### John Gill:
1. "Not only by the tempestuous weather...but by a spirit of prophecy, which he was endued with..."
2. "For certain it is that it was revealed to the apostle, that not one life should be lost; but yet through the shipwreck, what with the fright of it, and being in the water, much damage must accrue to their persons, as well as the ship and all its freight be lost."

### John Wesley:
1. Saying to them — To the centurion and other officers.
