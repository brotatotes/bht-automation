# Acts 27:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
With his expertise and experience, the centurion trusted the master of the ship to guide them safely. After all, the master held a position of authority and knowledge, understanding the intricacies of navigation and steering the vessel. However, it is worth noting that in times of great need, a person driven by their faith may offer advice even wiser than that of the expert, as they are guided by a higher wisdom and understanding.
