# Acts 27:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The recommended harbor, known as Phoenix, is described as not well situated, with an entrance that faces southwest and northwest. Though it may have appeared reasonable to both Paul and the ship's majority to remain in this harbor through the stormy weather, it was ultimately deemed unfit for wintering due to its exposed position in an open bay. This place, identified as Lutro, is mentioned both in the Syriac version and in ancient geographical references. It seems that the double opening of the harbor offered shelter from the boisterous waves, making it a safer anchorage in times of storms.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For this purpose the anchorage was εὔθετος, and in it they had (see next verse) actually ridden out the storm, before they left it."
2. "The direction then is towards the spot indicated, just as in the present case it is in that of the motion indicated."
3. "But I cannot believe, till experience can be shown to confirm the idea, that even sailors could speak of a harbour as ‘looking’ in the direction in which they would look when entering it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Phenice, now called Lutro."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The fair havens...furnished rather a safe anchorage ground in time of a storm than a convenient place for a permanent harbor." 
2. "The majority of persons on board concurred with Paul in the belief that it was not advisable to attempt the navigation of the sea until the dangers of the winter had passed by." 
3. "Its entrance was in a southwest direction. It then turned so as to lie in a direction toward the northwest. It was thus rendered perfectly safe from the winds and heavy seas; and in that harbor they might pass the winter in security."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Not commodious [ανευθετου] . Lit., not well situated."
2. "The difference between the Rev. and A. V., as to the points of the compass, turns on the rendering of the preposition kata."
3. "According to the Rev., kata means down : 'looking down the southwest and northwest winds,' i.e., in the direction toward which they blow."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The exact knowledge of this roadstead which we now have through the surveys of British officers, shows that the case might have been reasonably argued on both sides."
2. "The recommendation of Phoenix, as a good harbour for wintering, is precisely this, that it was sheltered from the two above-mentioned winds."
3. "There is no difficulty now in identifying Phoenix with Lutro, in the narrowest part of the island of Crete. It is a place of admirable shelter, with deep water close under the rocks, and precisely protected from south-west and north-west winds, as was said in the discussion at Fair Havens."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The harbour being unfit (ανευθετου) for wintering" 
2. "We vote for going on the chance that we may be able" 
3. "There are two ways of interpreting this language. Λιπς means the southwest wind and χωρος the northwest wind. But what is the effect of κατα with these words? Does it mean 'facing' the wind? If so, we must read 'looking southwest and northwest.' But κατα can mean down the line of the wind (the way the wind is blowing). If so, then it is proper to translate 'looking northeast and southeast.'"

### John Gill:
1. "Perhaps it might be an open road or bay, and having nothing to shelter from the boisterous waves, was a place very improper for a ship to be in, in stormy weather."
2. "The majority in the ship were for sailing."
3. "This place is called in the Syriac version Phoenix; and Ptolomy makes mention both of the city and haven of Phoenix, as on the south side of the island of Crete."

### John Wesley:
1. Which is a haven — Having a double opening, one to the southwest, the other to the northwest.
