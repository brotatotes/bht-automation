# Acts 27:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage describes a sudden and violent storm that arose against the ship, bringing forth a tempestuous wind called Euroclydon. This Euroclydon is identified as a typhon-like wind, known for its whirlwind or hurricane-like characteristics. It is considered a dangerous wind for sailors, capable of breaking ships and sails. The wind is also associated with the northeast direction and is described as a kind of hurricane that tosses the ship back and forth. This particular wind is not commonly found elsewhere and is likened to the levanters, which blow in various directions from the northeast to the southeast.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "What then is ἔβαλεν κατ  ʼ   αὐτῆς? ἔβαλεν applied to wind may be understood as above, neuter, or reflective, ‘blew,' ‘rushed.'"
2. "Assuming this, and that there is no object to be supplied between ἔβαλεν and the preposition, κατ ʼ αὐτῆς may surely be rendered, as in βῆ δὲ κατ ʼ Οὐλύμποιο καρήνων, κατ ʼ Ἰδαίων ὀρέων, κατὰ πέτρης, &c., viz. down (from) Crete, ‘down the high lands forming the coast.'"
3. "The term ‘typhonic’ indicates that it was accompanied by some of the phænomena which might be expected in such a case, viz. the agitation and whirling motion of the clouds caused by the meeting of the opposite currents of air when the change took place, and probably also of the sea, raising it in columns of spray."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "A tempestuous wind—that is, like a typhon or tornado, causing a whirling of the clouds, owing to the meeting of opposite currents of air."
2. "Called Euroclydon—The true reading appears to be Euro-aquilo, or east-northeast, which answers all the effects here ascribed to it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Arose - Beat violently...Against it - Against the vessel...A tempestuous wind - Turbulent - violent - strong." 
2. "Called Euroclydon - Εὐροκλύδων Eurokludōn...a hurricane, or wind veering about to different quarters."
3. "The name euroclydon is derived probably from two Greek words, εῦρος euros, 'wind,' and κλύδων kludōn, 'a wave'; so called from its agitating and exciting the waves."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Luke is the only New Testament writer who uses nauv (see verse 41), though he uses it but once."
2. "The rendering of the Rev. is, therefore, well supported, and, on the whole, preferable: there beat down from it."
3. "The word tufwn means a typhoon, and the adjective formed from it means of the character of a typhoon."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "How suddenly violent changes may take place when we least expect them, and when we have thought that already we have ‘gained our purpose’!"
2. "The storm came 'down from the island.' The land here is very high, and the gale suddenly swept down one of the gullies among the mountains, in a south-westerly direction."
3. "Whatever may be our conclusion in this matter, two things are clear, first, either word shows that the gale blew more or less from the east; while, secondly, the fact that it came ‘down from’ the island, and drove the ship to the southward (see below), shows that it blew more or less from the north."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Αυτης cannot refer to πλοιον (boat) which is neuter. So the ablative case with κατα as in Mark 5:13, Homer also."
2. "The Cretan mountains are over 7,000 feet high."
3. "The Ευρακυλων (reading of Aleph A B against the Textus Receptus Ευροκλυδων) has not been found elsewhere."

### John Gill:
1. "This wind may very well be thought to be the same which is called Typhon, and is by writers represented as a very tempestuous one, as a sort of whirlwind or hurricane, a violent storm, though without thunder and lightning; and Pliny calls it the chief plague of sailors, it breaking their sails, and even their vessels to pieces."
2. "Moreover, this wind is also called 'Euroclydon'. The Alexandrian copy reads, 'Euracylon', and so the Vulgate Latin version seems to have read, rendering it 'Euro-aquilo, the northeast wind'. The Ethiopic version renders it, the 'north wind'."
3. "It seems by its name to be an easterly wind, which blew very violently, ploughed the sea, and lifted up its waves; hence the Arabic version renders it, 'a mover' or 'stirrer up of the waves'; which beat against the ship in a violent manner, and exposed it to great danger."

### John Wesley:
1. "There arose against it — The south wind; a tempestuous wind, called in those parts Euroclydon." 
2. "This was a kind of hurricane, not carrying them any one way, but tossing them backward and forward." 
3. "These furious winds are now called levanters, and blow in all directions from the northeast to the southeast."
