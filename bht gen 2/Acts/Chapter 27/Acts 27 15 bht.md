# Acts 27:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The ship was caught, snatched up by the wind and forcibly carried away. They could not resist the wind, unable to face it directly. So they let the ship be driven, realizing it was useless to go against the wind or try to control its course.

2. "The ancient ships often had an eye painted on each side of the bow."

### John Calvin:
1. "Seeing they were first gone some space, and the mariners thought that all things fell out as they would have it, undoubtedly they did deride Paul’s admonition; as rash men use commonly to wax proud if fortune favor them."
2. "Being now caught, they are grievously punished for their boldness; yea, when they drew near to an haven, − they were no less afraid lest they should break the ship, than they were before of overturning the same."
3. "Nevertheless, [God] suffered his servant to labor with the rest, until he thought he should die. For he did not appear unto him by his angel, before it might seem that he was past hope of recovery."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Here, again, a very strong expression is used in the original, implying that the wind seized hold of the ship, as it were, and whirled her out of her course." 
2. "The literal meaning is, 'could not look at, or against, the wind;' and the phrase is made all the more expressive by the fact that in ancient ships, eyes were painted on each side of the prow."
