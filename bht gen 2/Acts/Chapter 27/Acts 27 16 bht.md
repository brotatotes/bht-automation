We were faced with the challenge to secure the boat, which was in danger of being destroyed in the storm. It was a difficult task, but we managed to take it up into the ship.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "St. Luke exhibits here as on every other occasion, the most perfect command of nautical terms, and gives the utmost precision to his language by selecting the most appropriate: they ran before the wind to leeward of Clauda, hence it is ὑποδραμόντες: they sailed with a side wind to leeward of Cyprus and Crete: hence it is ὑπεπλεύσαμεν." 
2. "Upon reaching Clauda, they availed themselves of the smooth water under its lee, to prepare the ship to resist the fury of the storm. Their first care was to secure the boat by hoisting it on board."
3. "St. Luke tells us they had much difficulty in securing the boat. He does not say why: but independently of the gale which was raging at the time, the boat had been towed between twenty and thirty miles after the gale had sprung up, and could scarcely fail to be filled with water."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "under—the lee of. a certain—"small" island . . . Clauda—southwest of Crete, now called Gonzo; about twenty-three miles to leeward."
2. "we had much work to come by—that is, to hoist up and secure. the boat—now become necessary."
3. "Independently of the gale, raging at the time, the boat had been towed between twenty and thirty miles after the gale sprang up, and could scarcely fail to be filled with water."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They ran near to it, where the violence of the wind was probably broken by the island..." 
2. "Much difficulty; we were scarcely able to do it."
3. "The importance of securing the small boat is known by all seamen."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "We were able with difficulty to secure the boat." 
3. "On with difficulty, see note on scarce, ver. 7."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Under the shelter of this island, they would have, for a short time, comparatively smooth water, which was a matter of the utmost importance to them in their preparations for riding out the storm."
2. "The first instinct of the sailors, at so dangerous a moment, would be to make sure of the boat. But to get it up on deck with so furious a wind blowing and in so heavy a sea, was not easy, which accounts for the strong language employed here."
3. "There is no chance of attaining a correct idea of the details of this voyage except from the point of view of practical seamanship. But, when examined from this point of view, the whole becomes perfectly clear."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The smooth water behind the little island enabled them to do this." 
2. "Probably cables or ropes were used under the hull of the ship laterally or even longitudinally, tightly secured on deck." 
3. "The ship was now fixed as near to the wind as possible...That would enable the ship to go actually W by N and so avoid the quicksands."

### John Gill:
1. "And running under a certain island....which is called Clauda: by Ptolomy x it is called Claudus, and was near the island of Crete, and now called Gozo."
2. "we had much work to come by the boat; which they had with them to go ashore in, or to betake themselves to in case of shipwreck; and which in this storm was in danger of being dashed to pieces against the ship, or lost."
3. "and it was with some difficulty that they came at it, and took it up into the ship."

### John Wesley:
1. We were hardly able to get masters of the boat — To prevent its being staved.
