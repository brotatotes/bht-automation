# Acts 27:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To protect the ship from the violent storm, the sailors took measures to strengthen it by undergirding, a practice of passing ropes under the keel and binding both sides of the ship. This was done to prevent the ship from splitting apart under the pressure of the rough seas. Additionally, they let down the vessel by straking sail, which involved lowering the sail yard and contracting the sails. By doing so, they aimed to reduce the vulnerability of the ship to the raging winds and waves, allowing it to have some control and stability in the midst of the storm.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "measures to strengthen the ship, strained and weakened by labouring in the gale."
2. "To frap a ship is to pass four or five turns of a large cable-laid rope round the hull or frame of a ship, to support her in a great storm."
3. "Fearing a certain danger, they deprived themselves of the only possible means of avoiding it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "undergirding the shipâ€”that is, passing four or five turns of a cable-laid rope round the hull or frame of the ship, to enable her to resist the violence of the seas, an operation rarely resorted to in modern seamanship."
2. "fearing lest they should fall into the quicksandsâ€”'be cast ashore' or 'stranded upon the Syrtis,' the Syrtis Major, a gulf on the African coast, southwest of Crete, the dread of mariners, owing to its dangerous shoals."
3. "they strakeâ€”'struck' sailâ€”This cannot be the meaning, for to strike sail would have driven them directly towards the Syrtis. The meaning must be, 'lowered the gear' (appurtenances of every kind); here, perhaps, referring to the lowering of the heavy mainyard with the sail attached to it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They used ropes, cables, stays, or chains, for the purpose of securing the ship."
2. "The ancients were accustomed to pass cables or strong ropes around a vessel to keep the planks from springing or starting by the action of the sea."
3. "They were at the mercy of the wind and waves, and their only hope was by taking away their sails."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Undergirding [Ï…Ï€Î¿Î¶Ï‰Î½Î½Ï…Î½Ï„ÎµÏ‚] . In modern nautical language, frapping : passing cables or chains round the ship 's hull in order to support her in a storm."
2. "The effect was at once manifest by a great diminution in the working of the parts already mentioned; and, in a less agreeable way, by impeding her rate of sailing."
3. "Every ship situated as this one was, when preparing for a storm, sends down upon deck the 'top - hamper, ' or gear connected with the fair - weather sails, such as the topsails."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They used helps, undergirding the ship. It is evident that the timbers were in danger of parting. Hence they artificially strengthened the vessel by passing ropes round it over the gunwale and under the keel, and tightening them on deck by levers."
2. "Fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands. This means a certain very definite part of the sea called the Greater Syrtis, full of shoals, on the north coast of Africa. The ancient navigators dreaded this place very much."
3. "They laid the ship to; and, her head being already to the north, they laid her to on the starboard tack, or with her right side to the wind. This is done by setting a small amount of sail, and with the united action of the wind on this sail, and of the rudder on the water, keeping the shipâ€™s head as near the wind as possible."

### John Gill:
1. "Undergirding the ship: with cords and ropes, which they drew under the keel of the ship, and so bound both sides of the ship, that it might not split and fall to pieces."
2. "Horace refers to this use of ropes in tempests, when he says, 'do not you see that without ropes the keels can scarcely endure the more imperious sea?'"
3. "They strake sail; let down their sails; so read some manuscripts in New College, Oxford; in the Greek text it is, 'they let down the vessel'; not the boat they had taken in, of which we read after; nor an anchor, or anchors, which would have been improper in a storm; nor the mast... wherefore this is to be understood of letting down the sail yard, and contracting the sails."
