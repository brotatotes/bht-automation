# Acts 27:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They lightened the ship by casting the heavy goods into the sea, as described in Psalms 107:25. This action was done to alleviate the condition of their exceedingly tossing with a tempest, similar to what the mariners did in the ship in which Jonah was (Jonah 1:5). The specific goods that were thrown overboard on this day are unknown, but it is believed that they would have been the heavy things that could be most easily spared. The Ethiopian version refers to them as goods and the Arabic version as merchandise.
