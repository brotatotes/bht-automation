# Acts 27:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the face of imminent danger, we had to take drastic measures to save the ship. We cast out the furniture, the equipment, and even the tackling of the ship - the anchors, sails, cables, and baggage. It was a desperate action, but necessary for our survival. The urgency of the situation drove us to cast away everything that was not indispensable, even if it meant fatigue and exhaustion among the crew. We did not take this decision lightly, but we knew that it was essential for our deliverance.
