# Acts 27:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The absence of the sun and stars for an extended period presented a grave challenge to the sailors, as these celestial bodies served as their primary navigation aids. In those times, when the compass had not yet been invented, the sun, moon, and stars were relied upon to steer their course and determine their location at sea. This prolonged absence of any celestial guidance only compounded the crew's difficulties and made their predicament even more perilous.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The sun and stars were the only guides of the ancients when out of sight of land."
2. "All hope was taken away, seems... to betoken that a greater evil than the mere force of the storm... was afflicting them, viz., the leaky state of the ship."
3. "Their successive lightenings of her... shewn by their successive lightenings of her."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This continued thickness of the atmosphere prevented their making the necessary observations of the heavenly bodies by day or by night; so that they could not tell where they were."
2. "Their exertions to subdue the leak had been unavailing; they could not tell which way to make for the nearest land, in order to run their ship ashore, the only resource for a sinking ship."
3. "Their apprehensions, therefore, were not so much caused by the fury of the tempest, as by the state of the ship."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "As they could see neither sun nor stars, they could make no observations..."
2. "They had no compass, they would be totally ignorant of their situation..."
3. "They gave up all as lost."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "When neither sun nor stars in many days appeared. This was a most serious aggravation of the danger."
2. "All hope was now taken away. Two stages in the progress of growing fear have been mentioned in the two preceding verses. Now we come to the third stage, which is absolute despair."
3. "We should note that it was precisely at this time, when no escape through human means seemed possible, that St. Paul interposed with Divine encouragement."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "When neither sun nor stars shone upon us."
2. "For many days... no small tempest."
3. "All hope that we should be saved was now taken away."

### John Gill:
1. "The sun, moon, and stars, are useful to sailors, to steer their course by; especially they were to the ancients, before the invention and use of the loadstone."
2. "The constellations and stars were of singular use unto them; and above all, the two Bears, the greater and the lesser; the Greeks observed the former, and the Phoenicians the latter; and who are said by Pliny to have first found out the use of the constellations in navigation."
3. "The apostle himself knew indeed, that though the ship would be lost, every man's life would be saved; and yet he could have no hope of this, as to the outward appearance of things, but on account of the revelation which the Lord had made to him, and he believed."

### John Wesley:
1. Neither sun nor stars appeared for many days — Which they could the less spare, before the compass was found out.
