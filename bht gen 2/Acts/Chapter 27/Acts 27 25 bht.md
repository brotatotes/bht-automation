# Acts 27:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
True faith is a firm and unwavering trust in the word and promises of God. It confidently lays hold of what God has spoken, regardless of the circumstances. In the case of Paul, his faith in God's promise that he would bear witness in Rome gave him reason to exhort others to have confidence. This type of faith is not based on human reasoning or circumstances, but on the veracity, faithfulness, and power of God. The promises of God are sure and unchanging, and anyone who possesses true faith can hold onto them without a doubt.
