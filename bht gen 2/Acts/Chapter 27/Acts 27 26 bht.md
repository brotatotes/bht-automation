# Acts 27:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
At this moment, Paul reveals that they will indeed be cast upon a specific island, and this revelation is important to show that their landing there was not a coincidence but a divine plan. Even though the exact island is not mentioned here, it is later revealed to be Melita, which fulfills this part of the prophecy.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Spoken prophetically, as also Acts 27:31; not perhaps from actual revelation imparted in the vision, but by a power imparted to Paul himself of penetrating the future at this crisis, and announcing the Divine counsel."
2. "Mr. Humphry compares and contrasts the speech of Cæsar to the pilot under similar circumstances: τόλμα κ. δέδιθι μηθέν, ἀλλὰ ἐπιδίδου τῇ τύχῃ τὰ ἱστία καὶ δέχου τὸ πνεῦμα, τῷ πνέοντι πιστεύων, ὅτι Καίσαρα φέρεις καὶ τὴν Καίσαρος τύχην, Plut. de Fortun. Rom. p. 518."

### Albert Barnes:
1. Howbeit - Nevertheless.Upon a certain island - Malta. See Acts 28:1.

### Philip Schaff:

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "We must be cast." - It is necessary for us to fall out.

### John Gill:
