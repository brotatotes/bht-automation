# Acts 27:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They were driven to and fro in the rough seas, tossed by the waves of the Adriatic Sea. The word Adria referred to the central basin of the Mediterranean, extending from Sicily in the west to Greece in the east. It is in this same sea that famous historical figures like Josephus found themselves shipwrecked. In the middle of the night, the mariners believed they were nearing land, as they observed its proximity or distance.
