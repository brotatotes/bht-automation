# Acts 27:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The ancient mariners would use a sounding line, also known as bolis, to determine the depth of the water. This line would be cast into the sea to take soundings. For deep water, a deep sea line with a larger lead and line would be used. By using this deep sea line, mariners could accurately measure the distance from the shore in certain areas, such as the coasts of Virginia. With this knowledge, they could navigate safely and avoid any dangers that might be lurking beneath the surface.
