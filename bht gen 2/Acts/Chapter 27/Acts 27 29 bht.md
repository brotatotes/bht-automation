# Acts 27:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of the storm, the sailors cast four anchors from the stern of the ship to secure its position. These anchors, equipped with heavy weights of lead or baskets filled with stones, aimed to bring the ship to a halt and prevent it from being carried away by the raging waves. This strategic move helped maintain stability and ensured that they would not drift any farther until they could determine their location and find safety. The anchors served as a vital means to bring stability and keep them grounded amidst the stormy sea.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "That a vessel can anchor by the stern is sufficiently proved (if proof were needed) by the history of some of our own naval engagements."
2. "The passage from CÃ¦sar, Bell. Civ. i. 25, 'has quaternis ancoris ex quatuor angulis distinebat, ne fluctibus moverentur,' is not to the purpose, for it was in that case a platform composed of two vessels, and anchored by the four corners."
3. "Their ship might not go down at her anchors: and, even supposing her to ride out the night safely, uncertain whether the coast to leeward might not be iron-bound, affording no beach where they might land in safety."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The very best thing they could do was to anchor by the stern."
2. "Anxiously or devoutly wished for day."
3. "The ungenerous but natural attempt, not peculiar to ancient times, of the seamen to save their own lives by taking to the boat."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They cast four anchors - On account of the violence of the storm and waves, to make, if possible, the ship secure."
2. "And wished for the day - To discern more accurately their situation and danger."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks. It might seem now that they not only heard breakers at a distance, but now heard them directly ahead."
2. "The fact that there were four anchors seems to show that they were well provided with ground tackle. Moreover, ancient ships were so built that they frequently anchored at the stern."
3. "The coincidence is so remarkable as to be startling; and yet there is nothing forced in this way of viewing the matter."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Lest somewhere we should fall out down against rocky places."
2. "With a view to running the ship ashore anchoring from the stern would, it is said, be best."
3. "Imperfect middle, kept on praying for 'day to come' before the anchors broke under the strain of the storm or began to drag."

### John Gill:
1. "They cast four anchors out of the stern; or hinder part of the ship; the Ethiopic version calls it, 'the head of the ship'... and these were not pointed, but had great weights of lead, or baskets filled with stones at the head of them, to stop the ship with..."
2. "The modern anchor is a large strong piece of iron, crooked at one end, and formed into two barbs, resembling a hook, fastened at the other end by a cable."
3. "These they cast out to stop the ship, and keep it steady, and that it might proceed no further, till they could learn whereabout they were."
