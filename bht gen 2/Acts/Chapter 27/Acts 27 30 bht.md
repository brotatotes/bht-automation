# Acts 27:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The sailors, under the pretense of securing the ship, planned to flee out of it and into the boat, fearing that the boat would be safer over the shallow waters. This deceitful attempt to escape the impending danger of the ship splitting apart was perceived by St. Paul, who wisely admonished that the sailors should not be allowed to flee. God's power is not an excuse for laziness or recklessness, but rather when He appoints means to accomplish something, He expects that we do not exceed the boundaries He has set.

### John Calvin:
1. "The grace of the Holy Spirit appeareth in Paul, even in this point also, in that he did wisely admonish that the mariners should not be suffered to fly."
2. "Paul doth not dispute, in this place, precisely of the power of God, that he may separate the same from his will and from means; and surely God doth not, therefore, commend his power to the faithful, that they may give themselves to sluggishness and carelessness, contemning means, or rashly cast away themselves when there is some certain way to escape."
