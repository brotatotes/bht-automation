# Acts 27:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To ensure survival, it was essential for the sailors to remain on the ship, as their expertise in seamanship was indispensable. St. Paul's appeal to the soldiers and the centurion rested on the principle of self-preservation, recognizing that they lacked the necessary skills to manage the vessel. This highlights the partnership of divine agency and human instrumentality, emphasizing the importance of utilizing all available means to secure salvation. God's promise of deliverance does not negate the need for active participation and the use of practical wisdom.

2. "Thus spiritual and eternal salvation is a certain thing; it is the appointment of God, which is absolute and unconditional, immutable and unfrustrable; there is a sure connection between the decree of God and salvation."
3. "None can be saved without regeneration; without this there is no meetness for heaven; nor does it appear without it that any have a right unto it; nor can an unregenerate man have any true hope of it; wherefore such as are chosen and redeemed, are regenerated by the Spirit of God."
