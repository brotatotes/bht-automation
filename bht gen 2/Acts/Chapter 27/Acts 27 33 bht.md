# Acts 27:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For two weeks, these individuals had not eaten a proper meal due to their deep awareness of the imminent danger they faced. The urgency of the situation overshadowed their basic physical needs. This extreme level of concern and focus on their safety mirrored the intense awareness some may have of the overwhelming danger of eternal death. In such moments, individuals may even forget to eat, as their priority becomes ensuring their spiritual well-being. Rather than dismissing this mindset as foolishness, we should recognize that it could mark the initial stages of true wisdom.
