# Acts 27:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul held a piece of bread, not the Eucharist, and set an example by giving thanks to God before eating. This act of saying grace, in the manner of a Hebrew family, would have encouraged the others in his presence to also partake of the meal. Paul's actions mirrored the custom and manner of the Jews who would first give thanks and then say 'Amen,' exemplifying gratitude and acknowledging their dependence on God.
