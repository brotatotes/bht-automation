1. "This wheat was either the remainder of the cargo, part of which had been disposed of in Acts 27:18 or was the store for their sustenance, the cargo having consisted of some other merchandise."
2. "And this latter is much the more likely, for two reasons: (1) that σῖτος is mentioned here and not in Acts 27:18, which it would have been in all probability, had the material cast out there been the same as here; and (2) that the fact is related immediately after we are assured that they were satisfied with food: from whence we may infer almost with certainty that ὁ σῖτος is the ship’s provision, of part of which they had been partaking."
