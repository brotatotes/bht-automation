# Acts 27:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We sailed under Cyprus, finding refuge and shelter from the contrary winds. Rather than facing the opposing winds, we chose to navigate along the coast of Cyprus, seeking protection and safety in its lee. This decision allowed us to lessen the force of the winds and make our voyage less difficult and dangerous. By sailing under Cyprus, we were able to find respite and continue our journey.
