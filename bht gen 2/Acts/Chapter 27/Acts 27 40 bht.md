# Acts 27:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They loosened the rudder bands, which held the two rudders on each side of the ship. The rudders were essential for steering the ship precisely into the creek. By hoisting up the foresail to the blowing breeze, the ship could make its way toward the shore and find safety in the haven.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "They cut away all four anchors...to save time, and not to encumber the waterlogged ship with their additional weight."
2. "They let loose the ropes which tied up the rudders...when the ship was again got under way."
3. "They raised their ἀρτέμων to the wind...the ‘artemon’ was the foresail of the ancient ships."


### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "cut the anchors (away), they left them in the sea."
2. "When anchored by the stern in a gale, it would be necessary to lift them out of the water and secure them by lashings or rudder bands, and to loose these when the ship was again got under way."
3. "How necessary must the crew have been to execute all these movements, and how obvious the foresight which made their stay indispensable to the safety of all on board."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The expression may mean that they slipped or cut their cables, and that thus they left the anchors in the sea. This is the most probable interpretation." 
2. "The rudder, in navigation, is that by which a ship is steered." 
3. "The mainsail (foresail) being hoisted showed good judgment, though the distance was so small, as it would not only enable them to steer more correctly than without it, but would press the ship farther on upon the land, and thus enable them the more easily to get to the shore."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Taken up [περιελοντες] . Wrong. The word means to remove, and refers here to cutting the anchor - cables, or casting off, as Rev."
2. "Committed themselves [ειων] . Wrong. The reference is to the anchors. Rev., correctly, left them in the sea."
3. "Rudder bands [ζευκτηριας των πηδαλιων] . Lit., the bands of the rudders. The larger ships had two rudders, like broad oars or paddles, joined together by a pole, and managed by one steersman."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "These anchors were, as we have seen (Acts 27:29), ‘cast out of the stern.’ When this was done, the ship was free for the full action of the wind."
2. "They did not ‘take up’ the anchors, but cut the ropes which connected the ship with them. They committed them (i.e. the anchors) to the sea."
3. "The rudders were now absolutely necessary in order to steer the ship precisely, so that she might take the ground at the right point."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Having taken away all four anchors from around the stern." 
2. "They let the anchors go and the ropes fell down into the sea." 
3. "Hoisting up the foresail to the blowing breeze."

### John Gill:
1. "The rudder, in navigation, is a piece of timber turning on hinges in the stern of a ship, and which opposing sometimes one side to the water, and sometimes another, turns or directs the vessel this way or that."
2. "A narrow rudder is best for a ship's sailing, provided she can feel it; that is, be guided and turned by it, for a broad rudder will hold much water when the helm is put over to any side."
3. "And made toward the shore; which was in the creek, or to the haven in it."

### John Wesley:
1. "Loosing the rudder bands - Their ships had frequently two rudders, one on each side." 
2. "Loosened, when they had need of them to steer her into the creek."
