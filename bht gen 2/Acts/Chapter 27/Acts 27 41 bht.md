# Acts 27:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The ship unexpectedly got stuck in a sandbar, possibly due to the meeting of two seas which caused rippling in the water. This meeting point could have been a sand shelf near the entrance to the bay, leading to their shipwreck. The stern of the ship broke under the force of the waves, providing boards and broken pieces for the company to reach the shore.
