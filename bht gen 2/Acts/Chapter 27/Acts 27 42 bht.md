# Acts 27:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This passage reveals the cruel and ungrateful nature of those who proposed to take the lives of others, even as they themselves were in danger. Such wickedness is truly monstrous, especially considering that Paul had been instrumental in saving their lives. It is evident that the influence of the devil was at work in this situation.
