# Acts 27:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul was well acquainted with the coastlines of Cilicia and Pamphylia, having grown up in the region. The city of Myra, located in Lycia, was a significant port east of Patara and held significance as the metropolis of Lycia. Myra was a hub for trade, particularly in grain, and it was here that the precious ointment of the Gospel was shared during Paul's stay. The absence of disciples mentioned in certain places along Paul's journey, such as Lasea, Melita, Syracuse, and Rhegium, suggests the diverse and individual nature of his encounters.
