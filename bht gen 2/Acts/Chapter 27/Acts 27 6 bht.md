# Acts 27:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This ship, hailing from the renowned city of Alexandria, was no ordinary vessel. It was a ship of great importance, part of the extensive trading network between Egypt and other lands. Proudly displaying its top sail, a distinct mark of an Alexandria ship, it sailed with prisoners and soldiers on board. Such voyages were not uncommon for this type of ship, which was known for transporting goods and passengers between different regions.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Ships, particularly those of the ancients, unprovided with a compass, and ill calculated to work to windward, would naturally stand to the N. till they made the land of Asia Minor, which is peculiarly favourable for such a mode of navigation."
2. "Myra lies due N. from Alexandria, and its bay is well calculated to shelter a wind-bound ship."
3. "The Alexandrian ship was not, therefore, out of her course at Myra, even if she had no call to touch there for the purposes of commerce."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "As Egypt was the granary of Italy, and this vessel was laden with wheat, we need not wonder it was large enough to carry two hundred seventy-six souls."
2. "Besides, the Egyptian merchantmen, among the largest in the Mediterranean, were equal to the largest merchantmen in our day."
3. "It may seem strange that on their passage from Alexandria to Italy they should be found at a Lycian port. But even still it is not unusual to stand to the north towards Asia Minor, for the sake of the current."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A ship of Alexandria - A ship belonging to Alexandria."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is a popular fallacy to suppose that the trading ships of the Mediterranean, under the Roman Empire, were necessarily small craft."
2. "We have abundant proof that they were often of 500 or 1000 tons."
3. "Thus it was extremely natural that a vessel bound from Egypt to Italy should stand to the north, where the Asiatic coast is high and easily seen, where good harbours are abundant, and where the above described advantages as to wind and water would be found."

3. "A ship of Alexandria with them was a ship that went from the land of Israel to Alexandria; whereas here it seems to design one that belonged to Alexandria, and went from thence to other parts."
