# Acts 27:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Because of strong winds pushing against the ship, they were forced to change course and sail slowly, with difficulty. They sailed under the protection of Crete, going southwest with the island to their right, in order to seek shelter from the contrary winds. This journey involved tacking and struggling against the wind, with Cnidus being a city and promontory in the peninsula of Caria.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We learn from the sailing directions for the Mediterranean, that, throughout the whole of that sea, but mostly in the eastern half, including the Adriatic and Archipelago, N.W. winds prevail in the summer months."
2. "With N.W. winds the ship could work up from Myra to Cnidus; because, until she reached that point, she had the advantage of a weather shore, under the lee of which she would have smooth water, and, as formerly mentioned, a westerly current; but it would be slowly and with difficulty."
3. "Unless she had put into that harbour (Cnidus), and waited for a fair wind, her only course was to run under the lee of Crete, in the direction of Salmone, which is the eastern extremity of that island."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "sailed slowly many days—owing to contrary winds."
2. "But for the contrary wind they might have made the distance from Myra in one day."
3. "the strong westerly current induced them to run south."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The wind not suffering us - The wind repelling us in that direction; not permitting us to hold on a direct course, we were driven off near to Crete."
2. "We sailed under Crete - See Acts 27:4. We lay along near to Crete, so as to break the violence of the wind."
3. "Over against Salmone - Near to Salmone. This was the name of the promontory which formed the eastern extremity of the island of Crete."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Many [ικαναις]. See on Luke 7:6. Scarce [μολις]. Incorrect. Render, as Rev., with difficulty." 
2. "The meaning is not that they had scarcely reached Cnidus when the wind became contrary, nor that they had come only as far as Cnidus in many days; but that they were retarded by contrary winds between Myra and Cnidus, a distance of about one hundred and thirty miles, which, with a favorable wind, they might have accomplished in a day." 
3. "Such a contrary wind would have been the northwesterly, which prevails during the summer months in that part of the Archipelago."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If, as is said in what immediately follows, ‘many days’ had passed after leaving Myra, while yet they ‘scarce were come over against Cnidus,’ they must have sailed ‘slowly.’"
2. "Moreover, the Greek word μόλις, translated ‘scarce,’ really expresses difficulty and struggle. It would be necessary, along the Lycian coast, as previously along the Cilician and Pamphylian, for the ship to beat up against the wind, with tacks."
3. "Sailed under Crete, i.e. under its lee. Here they would obtain the same advantages as before, under the shore of Asia Minor, as to comparative shelter and a favourable current."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Only here and in Artemidorus (sec. cent. A.D.). It may mean 'tacking' before the wind." 
2. "Here the protection of the land from the northwest wind ceased."
3. "Instead of going to the right of Crete as the straight course would have been they sailed southwest with Crete to their right and got some protection against the wind there."

### John Gill:
1. "Because of contrary winds...the ship being laden with goods." 
2. "Cnidus, a city and promontory in Doris, in the Chersonese or peninsula of Caria."
3. "We sailed under Crete, or below it...over against Salmone, now called Capo Salamone."

### John Wesley:
1. Cnidus — was a cape and city of Caria.
