# Acts 27:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The ship, facing strong headwinds, could hardly pass Cape Matala and the Fair Havens, a small bay that was not suitable for wintering. The nearby city of Lasea, though now lost, was known in ancient times. In spite of the difficulties faced, the ship managed to reach the Fair Havens, which still bears the same name today, serving as evidence that this was indeed the harbor mentioned in scripture. It is remarkable to see these geographical details reaffirm the truth of the Bible.
