# Acts 27:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Sailing was considered dangerous at that time due to both the approaching winter and the frequent storms in the Mediterranean. Paul specifically urged them to stay in Crete, recognizing the potential risks and advising against taking unnecessary chances. The day of atonement, known as the fast, fell on September 25th and was an additional factor contributing to the unfavorable conditions for sailing. This shows that Paul, even in practical matters, demonstrated wisdom and faith by offering guidance and counsel.

1. "Sailing was now dangerous... The further prosecution of the voyage being now dangerous... The sky might be expected to be overcast."
2. "Moreover, it is highly probable from what immediately follows that the ship had received great damage, and was already in an unseaworthy condition. There was good reason for remaining in harbour if possible."

1. "Because the Fast was now already gone by (δια το κα την νηστειαν ηδη παρεληλυθενα). Accusative (after δια) of the articular infinitive perfect active of παρερχομα, to pass by, with the accusative of general reference (νηστειαν, the great day of atonement of the Jews, Leviticus 16:29) occurring about the end of September. The ancients considered navigation on the Mediterranean unsafe from early October till the middle of March." 
2. "Paul admonished them (παρηινη ο Παυλος). Imperfect active of παραινεω, old word to exhort from παρα and αινεω, to praise (Acts 3:8)... Paul had clearly won the respect of the centurion and officers and also felt it to be his duty to give this unasked for warning."
