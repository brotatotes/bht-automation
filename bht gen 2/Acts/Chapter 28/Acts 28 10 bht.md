# Acts 28:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people honored the apostle, not as divine beings, but with expressions of respect and gratitude. They gave them necessary provisions and showed gratitude for the favors received. It's possible that many on the ship were converted through the apostle's ministry, and their acts of kindness were for his sake.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In all the passages quoted to support it, ref. Sir., Cicero, ad Diversos, xvi. 9 (‘Curio misi ut medico honos haberetur’), the expression τιμή is general, and the context renders an inference probable as to what sort of τιμή is meant."
2. "Here there is no such unavoidable indication, whereas the other meaning is rendered probable by the form of the sentence, which opposes to these τιμαί, bestowed on them during their whole stay, τὰ πρὸς τ . χρείας, with which they were loaded at their departure."
3. "Render it therefore honoured us with many honours (or ‘distinctions,’ or ‘attentions’)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Such grateful expressions of feeling, particularly in providing what would minister to their comfort during the voyage, as showed the value they set upon the presence and labors of the apostle among them."
2. "Whether any permanent effects of this three months' stay of the greatest of the apostles were left at Malta, we cannot certainly say."
3. "But though little dependence is to be placed upon the tradition that Publius became bishop of Malta and afterwards of Athens, we may well believe the accredited tradition that the beginnings of the Christian Church at Malta sprang out of this memorable visit."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Who also honored us - As people who were favored by heaven, and who had been the means of conferring important benefits on them in healing the sick, etc."
2. "Probably the word 'honors' here means 'gifts, or marks of favor.'"
3. "They laded us - They gave us, or conferred on us. They furnished us with such things as were necessary for us on our journey."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Honors [τιμαις]. The word was applied to payments for professional services."
2. "That fact may have influenced Luke in selecting it."
3. "But it is evidently not used in that sense here."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "St. Paul did not refuse elsewhere to accept the gifts which were freely offered to him."
2. "There was a fulfilment of that which is written, The labourer is worthy of his support."
3. "When they were preparing to set sail, gifts for the wants of the voyage were lavishly pressed upon them."

### John Gill:
1. "Not with divine honours, with religious adorations, as if they had been so many deities; but civil honours, expressions of respect and gratitude." (24 words)
2. "They laded us with such things as were necessary; they expressed their gratitude for the favours they received from Paul." (22 words)
3. "For whose sake not only his company, but the whole ship's company fared the better; very likely many of them were converted under the apostle's ministry." (25 words)
