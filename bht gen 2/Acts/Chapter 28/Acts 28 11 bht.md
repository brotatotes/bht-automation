# Acts 28:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After three months, they set sail, most likely in March. The ship they boarded had a sign or figurehead carved or painted on the bow that gave it its name. In this case, it depicted the twin gods Castor and Pollux, who were considered the protectors of sailors. The presence of these deities on the ship was a common practice in ancient times. Their belief in the power of these gods to bring good fortune during a voyage likely influenced the decision to include them on the ship's figurehead.
