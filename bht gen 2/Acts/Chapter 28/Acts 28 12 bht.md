And as they landed at Syracuse, a city rich in history and known for its four large parts, it stood as a significant destination for Paul and his companions. This place, situated about eighty miles from Malta, had a remarkable reputation, having once been defended by the ingenious mathematician Archimedes against the Romans. It is a city with deep historical and theological significance, as it was even mentioned in the fifth century when Hilarius, a teacher from Syracuse, corresponded with Augustine regarding the Pelagian heresy.
