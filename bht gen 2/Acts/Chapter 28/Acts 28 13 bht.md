# Acts 28:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The journey continued from there, but it was not a straightforward path due to the rough sea. They had to navigate around it, like a ship tacking in adverse winds. They arrived in Rhegium, a city in Italy, along the southwest coast. Puteoli, another coastal city in Italy, was their next destination. It was a significant port and served as a major hub for maritime trade, particularly for the Alexandrian wheat ships. The sea was even named after the city of Puteoli, indicating its importance as a coastal location.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "περιελθόντες apparently denotes the roundabout course of a vessel tacking with an adverse wind." 
2. "The day at Rhegium, as perhaps the three at Syracuse before, was spent probably in waiting for the wind." 
3. "Puteoli (anciently Dicæarchia, Strab. Acts 28:4 , now Puzzuoli) was the most sheltered part of the bay of Naples. It was the principal port of Southern Italy, and, in particular, formed the great emporium for the Alexandrian wheat ships."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "from thence we fetched a compass—that is, proceeded circuitously, or tacked, working to windward probably, and availing themselves of the sinuosities of the coast" [SMITH].
2. "after one day the south wind blew—a south wind having sprung up; being now favored with a fair wind, for want of which they had been obliged...to tack and put in for a day at Rhegium" [SMITH].
3. "The Alexandrian corn ships enjoyed a privilege peculiar to themselves, of not being obliged to strike their topsail on landing. By this they were easily recognized as they hove in sight by the crowds that we find gathered on the shore on such occasions" [HOWSON].

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We fetched a compass - We coasted about; or we sailed along the eastern side of Sicily."
2. "And came to Rhegium - This was a city of Italy, in the kingdom of Naples, on the coast near the southwest extremity of Italy."
3. "The south wind - A wind favorable for their voyage."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "From thence we fetched a compass. The meaning of this English phrase is (as in 2 Kings 3:9), that they did not sail in a straight course..."
2. "After one day the south wind blew. This was the most favourable wind for carrying the vessel through the Faro; and if she was rigged with a great square sail, she would go very rapidly before it."
3. "But a further help is supplied to us by visible and tangible remains. Seventeen piers still survive of the mole upon which his foot was set. In fact, the most perfect ruin existing of any ancient Roman harbour is that which is for ever connected with the memory of St. Paul’s arrival in Italy."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The ship had to tack to reach Rhegium and was not able to make a straight course."
2. "A south wind sprang up, but with no bad results this time, though the weather was plainly treacherous at this early season."
3. "It was eight miles northwest from Neapolis (Naples) and the chief port of Rome, the regular harbour for the Alexandrian ships from Rome."

### John Gill:
1. "And from thence we fetched a compass....it was separated from it by the violence of the sea at this place." 
2. "The Syriac version adds, 'a city of Italy'....and so Jerom says, Puteoli a city, a colony of Campania."
3. "That it was a place by the sea side, may be learned from the sea being called after its name, 'mare Puteolanum', the sea of Puteoli."
