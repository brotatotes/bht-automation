The brethren's arrival to meet Paul and his companions revealed their zealous care and demonstrated the strong interest and affection the Roman Christians held for Paul. This act of love displayed the support and encouragement that fellow believers can provide in the midst of life's trials. As Paul thanked God and took courage upon seeing the brethren, we see his reliance on the presence of friends and the gratitude that their service inspired. Their dutifulness testified to their godliness toward Christ and fueled Paul's desire to fulfill the work that awaited him in Rome.
