# Acts 28:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul was allowed to live alone while being guarded by a soldier to whom he was constantly chained. This arrangement was not only a reflection of Roman custom but also allowed Paul to have a degree of freedom despite being in custody. His good conduct and the favorable impression he had made on the centurion likely played a role in him being afforded this relatively more comfortable arrangement.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It does not follow, from the singular being used, that there was but one præfectus prætorio at this time..." 
2. "Luke is not so precise in Roman civil and military matters, as that he necessarily should in this case have written ἑνὶ τῶν στρατοπεδάρχων."
3. "The ‘præfectus prætorio’ was the person officially put in charge with the prisoners sent from the provinces."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard—the Prætorian Prefect, to whose custody, as commander of the Prætorian guard, the highest military authority in the city, were committed all who were to come before the emperor for trial."
2. "This privilege was allowed in the case of the better class of prisoners, not accused of any flagrant offense, on finding security—which in Paul's case would not be difficult among the Christians."
3. "As the soldiers who kept him were relieved periodically, he would thus make the personal acquaintance of a great number of the Prætorian guard; and if he had to appear before the Prefect from time to time, the truth might thus penetrate to those who surrounded the emperor."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The captain of the guard - The commander of the Praetorian cohort, or guard."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "God did govern from heaven the bonds of his servant; not only that he might ease him of his trouble, but that the faithful might have freer access unto him."

2. "Already we have read of the centurion Julius, who brought Paul from the East to Rome, courteously entreating his prisoner. It seems as though the Roman officials pitied the brave missionary apostle."
3. "The soldier thus chained to him was relieved at stated intervals, and so by means of these stern military guardians each of whom doubtless in turn was won by the sweet patience and glowing earnestness of the captive Paul’s bonds in Christ were manifested in the Praetorian Camp, and in all other places."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
