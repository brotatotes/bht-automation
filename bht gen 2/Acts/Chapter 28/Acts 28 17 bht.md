# Acts 28:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul, being bound, called together the Jewish leaders to explain himself, as he always sought to engage with his fellow Jews. He assured them that he hadn't done anything against their beliefs or customs and that he had been delivered as a prisoner into the hands of the Romans. His aim was to dispel any suspicion they may have had, as seeing him chained might lead them to believe that he had committed some wrongdoing.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Paul was naturally anxious to set himself right with the Jews at Rome to explain the cause of his being sent there, in case no message had been received by them concerning him from Judæa, and to do away if possible with the unfavourable prejudice which such letters, if received, would have created respecting his character."
2. "The banishment of Jews from Rome (ch. Act 18:2) had either tacitly or openly been abrogated some time before this."
3. "The fact of his sending for them, and their coming to him, seems to shew (as in the gloss on Acts 28:16; see digest) that he was not imprisoned in the Prætorian camp, but was already in a private lodging."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Though banished from the capital by Claudius, the Jews enjoyed the full benefit of the toleration which distinguished the first period of Nero's reign, and were at this time in considerable numbers, wealth, and influence settled at Rome."
2. "We have seen that long before this a flourishing Christian Church existed at Rome, to which Paul wrote his Epistle, and the first members of which were probably Jewish converts and proselytes."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Paul called the chief of the Jews - He probably had two objects in this: one was to vindicate himself from the suspicion of crime, or to convince them that the charges alleged against him were false; and the other, to explain to them the gospel of Christ."
2. "In accordance with his custom everywhere, he seized the earliest opportunity of making the gospel known to his own countrymen."
3. "He naturally supposed that charges highly unfavorable to his character had been sent forward against him to the Jews at Rome by those in Judea."

### John Calvin:
1. "He might well have excused himself before men, if he passed over these Jews and turned himself to the Gentiles."
2. "He saw that he must remain at Rome... he would not that they should be deprived of the fruit of his labor."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul invited the Jewish leaders to come to his lodging and hear his explanation of his presence in Rome as a prisoner with an appeal to Caesar." 
2. "He is anxious that they may understand that this appeal was forced upon him by Festus following Felix and not because he has come to make an attack on the Jewish people."
