# Acts 28:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the authorities thoroughly examined my case, they reached the conclusion that I should be set free. They released me from my chains and granted me the freedom to move about as I pleased. It is worth noting that throughout my trials, various Roman officials consistently recognized my innocence and found no basis for the charges brought against me. There was no justifiable cause to sentence me to death, as no crime that warranted such a severe punishment had been proven. This highlights the integrity and righteousness of my actions, providing a clear justification for my freedom.
