# Acts 28:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people on the island were called barbarians simply because they did not speak Greek or Latin, but that did not mean they were uncivilized. In fact, their kindness and hospitality to the shipwrecked was impressive, showing more compassion than even educated individuals. The fire they kindled was no ordinary fire, but a large one that provided much-needed warmth to those who were wet and shivering. The generosity of these seemingly uncultivated islanders was more valuable than any polished education that lacked compassion.
