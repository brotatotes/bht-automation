# Acts 28:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul, in his imprisonment, proclaims that the hope of Israel lies in the Messiah. Being a prisoner for the sake of this hope, Paul shows his deep love for his own people and desires to set things right with them. Though restrained by chains, Paul does not let his circumstances define him; instead, the chain becomes a symbol of his commitment and dedication to his mission. He proudly proclaims that the Messiah, whom Israel has been waiting for, has already come, and it is in Him that the hope of eternal life and salvation is found.
