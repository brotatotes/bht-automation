# Acts 28:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The lack of communication between the Jews in Rome and JudÃ¦a regarding Paul's case is quite peculiar. Before his appeal, there was no reason for them to discuss it, and even after his appeal, no one came forward with any information. This suggests that the Jews in JudÃ¦a had not sought to prejudice the Jews in Rome against Paul. However, the denial of having heard of Paul by the Roman Jews is disingenuous, given the constant contact between Judea and Rome. It is clear that they were being dishonest in order to avoid bias against Paul.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It may seem strange that they had received no tidings concerning him... before his appeal, the Jews in JudÃ¦a had no definite reason to communicate with the Jews in Rome respecting him." 
2. "Since his appeal, it would have been hardly possible for them to have sent messengers who should have arrived before him."
3. "It appears, however, that none had come."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The distinction made between himself, against whom they heard nothing, and his 'sect,' as 'everywhere spoken against,' is a presumption in favor of their sincerity."
2. "There is ground to think that as the case took an unexpected turn by Paul's appealing to CÃ¦sar, so no information on the subject would travel from Jerusalem to Rome in advance of the apostle himself."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Paul had been acquitted successively by Lysias, Felix, Festus, and Agrippa; and as they had not succeeded in procuring his condemnation before them, they saw no prospect of doing it at Rome, and resolved, therefore, not to press the prosecution any further."
2. "There was a very constant contact between Judea and Rome, but it seems that the Jews who had come before Paul had arrived had not mentioned his case, so as to prejudice them against him."

### John Calvin:
1. "For many do stop the way before themselves with this prejudice, because they cannot abide to hear that which is refused by common judgment, but subscribe to the opinion of other men to the condemning of doctrine which they know not." 
2. "But we must note the state of the disputation, which Luke saith is double...where it was necessary that it should be rightly defined, that they might know that the kingdom of God is spiritual, whose beginning is newness of life, and the end thereof blessed immortality and the heavenly glory."
3. "He could not intreat of those things; but he must needs call back the Jews from gross and earthly inventions into heaven, and also take away the stumbling-block of the cross, seeing he taught that there was no other way or means whereby we are reconciled with God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This reply of the Roman Jews was more courteous than honest."
2. "It was clearly disingenuous for them on their part to deny any knowledge of his evil fame among the rulers of the people."
3. "The result of the earnest and impassioned pleading of the Christian apostle, told so shortly, but so sorrowfully, in the words of Acts 28:24, â€˜and some believed notâ€™ coupled with the evident mournful disappointment manifested by Paul at his complete failure to convince â€˜someâ€™ evidently a large number of his Jewish audience, points to the conclusion we have arrived at, that the courteous reply of the Roman Jews to Paul (Acts 28:21) was hollow and false."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Official documents from the Sanhedrin about the charges against Paul." 
2. "The three aorists (ÎµÎ´ÎµÎ¾Î±Î¼ÎµÎ¸Î±, Î±Ï€Î·Î³Î³ÎµÎ¹Î»ÎµÎ½, ÎµÎ»Î±Î»Î·ÏƒÎµÎ½) cover the past." 
3. "These Jews do not mean to say that they had never heard of Paul."

### John Gill:
1. "We neither received letters out of Judea concerning thee...neither any of the brethren that came [from] Jerusalem...shewed or spake any harm of thee..." 
2. "This they said, to show that they were not prejudiced against him by any person or means; and which carried in it a very considerable testimony of the apostle's innocence."

### John Wesley:
