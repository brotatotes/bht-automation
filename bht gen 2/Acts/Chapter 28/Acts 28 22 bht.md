# Acts 28:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Christian religion is often spoken against and criticized, which may actually be a sign that it is a good and true faith. It is not a matter of human opinion or invention, but a divine revelation from God. Jesus Christ, who is the essence of Christianity, was also spoken against and his words, actions, and even his miracles were blasphemed and criticized. However, these attacks do not invalidate the truth and wisdom that the Christian religion holds.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Their short notice of Christianity is perhaps the result of caution, seeing as they did the favour shewn by the authorities towards Paul: or perhaps of dissimulation."
2. "Many Commentators have noticed the omission of all mention of the Christian Church at Rome, and of Paul’s connexion with or work among them. But without any reason: for the work of the Apostle among churches already founded is not the subject of our history, and is seldom related by Luke, without a special reason."
3. "Besides, one great object of this history is to shew forth Paul as working out the Lord’s implied command, to preach the Gospel ‘to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile,’ and, having every where done this, it is but natural that he should open his commission in Rome by assembling and speaking to the Jews."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "What are thy sentiments, views, &c. The apparent freedom from prejudice here expressed may have arisen from a prudent desire to avoid endangering a repetition of those dissensions about Christianity." 
2. "We desire - 'deem it proper' - to hear of thee what thou thinkest." 
3. "The expulsion of the Jews under Claudius."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "What thou thinkest - What your belief is; or what are the doctrines of Christians respecting the Messiah."
2. "This sect - The sect of Christians."
3. "Spoken against - Particularly by Jews. This was the case then, and, to a great extent, is the case still. It has been the common lot of the followers of Christ to be spoken “against.” Compare Acts 24:5."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. We desire [αξιουμεν] . Rather, we think it fitting. Compare ch. 14 38. Sect. See on heresies, 2 Peter 2:1.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The leading Jews of Rome...were naturally anxious to hear what such an one...would have to say on behalf of the faith for which he had endured and suffered so much."
2. "Already men had begun to whisper abroad the dark calumnies which we know were universally circulated through the Roman world concerning the innocent Christians."
3. "The jealous and angry Jew joined hands here with the Pagan in fostering untrue and utterly baseless rumours respecting the worship and practice of men whose doctrines were gradually penetrating into all classes and orders of the Empire."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They think it only fair to hear Paul's side of his case." 
2. "Paul had identified Christianity with Judaism in its Messianic hope." 
3. "The line of cleavage between Jew and Christian was now sharply drawn everywhere."

### John Gill:
1. "The Gospel, or Christian religion, is not an human device, the choice and option of man's free will, and what he pleases himself with, as an opinion and invention of his own."
2. "The Christian religion... is of God, and by revelation of Jesus Christ, and is a doctrine of the highest wisdom."
3. "Christ, the author, sum, and subject of the Christian religion, was spoken against in his person; his deity and divine sonship were denied, as they still are; and his offices, as prophet, priest, and King; yea, his actions, even his works of mercy to the bodies of men... were blasphemed and evil spoken of."

### John Wesley:
1. This sect we know is every where spoken against — This is no proof at all of a bad cause, but a very probable mark of a good one.
