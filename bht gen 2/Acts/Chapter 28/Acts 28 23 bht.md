# Acts 28:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul, with great determination, tirelessly presented evidence and reasoning to persuade his countrymen about the spiritual nature of the Messiah's kingdom. Through detailed explanations and the testimony of prophecies and miracles, he sought to convince them that Jesus of Nazareth was the long-awaited Lord of this kingdom. Although his efforts did not bring about the desired effect in all of his listeners, Paul knew that their resistance was both intellectual and willful, and he steadfastly continued to make use of persuasive arguments to urge them towards embracing Jesus as the Messiah.
