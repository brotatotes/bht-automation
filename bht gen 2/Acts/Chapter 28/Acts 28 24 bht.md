# Acts 28:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Faith is a gift from God, bestowed upon those who hear the word and embrace it with divine power. However, there were those who stubbornly held on to their disbelief, influenced by their preconceived notions of a worldly kingdom, their inability to comprehend the spiritual truths presented to them, and their hardened hearts. The difference between those who believed and those who did not was not a result of human willpower, but a demonstration of God's sovereign grace.
