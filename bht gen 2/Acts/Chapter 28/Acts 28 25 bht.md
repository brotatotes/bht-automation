### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "The malice and frowardness of the unfaithful is the cause of this, that Christ, who is our peace, and the only bond of holy unity, is an occasion of dissension."
2. "And yet for all this we must not think that the preaching of the gospel is the cause of discord; but that privy displeasure, which lurked before in their malicious minds, doth then break out."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "When they agreed not (ασυμφωνο οντες). Old adjective, only here in N.T., double compound (α privative, συμ, φωνη), without symphony, out of harmony, dissonant, discordant." 
2. "It was a triumph to gain adherents at all in such an audience."
