# Acts 28:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is a special mercy when people not only hear the word, but also understand and embrace it. However, it is a solemn dispensation when they only hear without comprehension, which can lead to condemnation. It is clear that the preaching of the Gospel and even miracles alone are insufficient for conversion; only efficacious grace can truly transform hearts. This judicial blindness, foretold by Isaiah and referred to by Jesus, shows the devastating consequences of a willful and stubborn resistance to the truth.
