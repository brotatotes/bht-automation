# Acts 28:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people's hearts have become dulled and hardened, fixated on earthly matters rather than spiritual truths. They have closed their ears to the message of the Gospel, preventing them from seeing, hearing, and understanding with their hearts. Nevertheless, it is through hearing the Gospel that conversion and true spiritual healing can take place, as it has the power to turn people away from their sinful ways and restore the health of their souls.
