# Acts 28:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The salvation of God is sent to the Gentiles, proclaiming a full and eternal salvation. This divine message, which the prophets often attested, now extends to strangers. The Gospel, illuminating the Gentile world, will be heard, understood, and embraced by those who were once ignorant of God. As the Gentiles receive the Gospel and are saved, may their response mirror the unwavering faith and zeal of the apostle Paul.
