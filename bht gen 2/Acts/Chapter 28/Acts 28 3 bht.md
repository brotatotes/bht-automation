# Acts 28:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
While gathering sticks for the fire, Paul displayed his humility and willingness to help even in the most trivial tasks. The viper, concealed in the bundle of sticks, awoke from its torpor upon feeling the heat. It was a venomous viper, which gives weight to the seriousness of the situation. The viper's emergence from the heat signifies that it was forced out by the growing intensity of the fire.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The difficulty here is, that there are now no venomous serpents in Malta. But as Mr. Smith observes, 'no person who has studied the changes which the operations of man have produced on the animals of any country, will be surprised that a particular species of reptiles should have disappeared from Malta.'"
2. "To suppose the converse ('the ἀπό was adopted by those who thought the sense was ‘on account of the fire,’ ' Dr. Bloomf.), is simply absurd; for 1) no man ever could suppose the sense of ἐκ in such a connexion to be this: and 2) even if any one did, he would not have substituted another ambiguous preposition, ἀπό."
3. "The narrative leaves no doubt that the bite did veritably take place."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The vigorous activity of Paul's character is observable in this comparatively trifling action."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The viper was doubtless in the bundle of sticks or limbs of trees which Paul had gathered, but was concealed, and was torpid."
2. "But when the bundle was laid on the fire, the viper became warmed by the heat, and came out and fastened on the hand of Paul."
3. "It is not expressly affirmed that Paul was bitten by the viper, yet it is evidently implied; and it is wholly incredible that a viper, unless miraculously prevented, should fasten himself to the hand without biting."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Of sticks [φρυγανων] . Only here in New Testament. From ajpo to roast or parch. Hences dry sticks. Out of [εκ] . The best texts read ajpo, by reason of.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We see the apostle here helping with his own hands to improve the fire, as we saw him before in the storm helping with his own hands to lighten the ship."
2. "Such incidents are part of that natural framework which gives life and reality to the biographies of the New Testament."
3. "The impression given by these words is that St. Paul was bitten by the viper; and this, no doubt, is the true impression. We gain nothing in such a case by attenuating a miracle."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Few things show Paul to better advantage than this incident." 
2. "The viper was in a state of torpor in the bundle of sticks. The heat wakened him."
3. "The natives thought that it was a poisonous viper."

### John Gill:
1. "And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks,.... Had picked up some sticks, and put them in a bundle fit for the fire, as everyone was busy to assist in this extremity; nor did the apostle think such an action below him, who in all things was a man of great humility and condescension."
2. "there came a viper out of the heat: a viper is a kind of serpent, which brings forth its young living, to the number of twenty, only one in a day, which come forth wrapped up in thin skins, which break on the third day, and set them at liberty; and so is reckoned among viviparous animals."
3. "Now when this viper here is said to come out of the heat, the meaning is, that it came out from the sticks, which were laid upon the fire, being forced from thence by the heat of it."
