# Acts 28:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During the two years that Paul spent in his own hired house, he received all who came to him, freely preaching the Gospel to them. Scholars believe that during this time, he wrote epistles such as Philippians, Philemon, Colossians, and Ephesians, which have since become immortalized. It is uncertain whether Paul was set at liberty after these two years and continued his missionary journeys or whether he suffered martyrdom. Nevertheless, during this period, Paul made a significant impact on the kingdom of God, continuing to fulfill his calling and share the message of salvation.
