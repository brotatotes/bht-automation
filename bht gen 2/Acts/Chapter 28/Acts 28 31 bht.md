## BHT:
The Acts of the Apostles come to a close with the triumphant progress of the early Christian Church, which began in Jerusalem, moved to Antioch, and finally reached imperial Rome. The final chapters focus on the apostle Paul, his conversion, labors, and sufferings for the faith. Despite being imprisoned in Rome, Paul receives support from the church in Philippi. His time in captivity allows him to continue preaching the gospel and writing important epistles. The conclusion of Acts highlights the power of God's Word and the exponential growth of the Christian faith, leaving a profound impact on the world.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Thus closes this most precious monument of the beginnings of the Christian Church in its march from east to west, among the Jews first, whose center was Jerusalem; next among the Gentiles, with Antioch for its headquarters; finally, its banner is seen waving over imperial Rome, foretokening its universal triumphs."
2. "That distinguished apostle whose conversion, labors, and sufferings for 'the faith which once he destroyed' occupy more than half of this History, it leaves a prisoner, unheard, so far as appears, for two years."
3. "All that we know of the apostle's proceedings and history beyond this must be gathered from the Epistles of the Imprisonmentâ€”Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Philemonâ€”written during this period, and the Pastoral Epistlesâ€”to Timothy and Titus, which, in our judgment, are of subsequent date."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In this situation he was remembered with deep interest by the church at Philippi, who sent Epaphroditus to him with a contribution to supply his needs."
2. "Perhaps there could be no more appropriate close to the book of the inspired history than thus to have conducted the apostle of the Gentiles to the capital of the Roman world, and to leave the principal agent in the establishment of the Christian religion in that seat of intelligence, influence, and power."
3. "To Paul now, what are all his sorrows, and persecutions, and toils in the cause of his Master? What but a source of thanksgiving that he was permitted thus to labor to spread the gospel through the world?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There is something musical in the cadence of this word reserved for the end of the Book."
2. "The Roman authorities no doubt at this time viewed the intense hatred which existed between the more rigid Jews and the rapidly-increasing Christians, with considerable favour."
3. "Its peculiar worship, its especial hopes and fears, were matters with which these philosophic Pagan statesmen declined to interfere."

### John Gill:
1. "he preached up Jesus as the King Messiah, and declared that his kingdom was come, and opened the nature of it; that it consisted not in meats and drinks, but in righteousness and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost"
2. "he gave them same account of the kingdom of glory, and the way unto it; and showed, that without regeneration and sanctification, no one could be meet for it; and without the justifying righteousness of Christ, no man could have a right unto it, or be possessed of it"
3. "with all confidence; with all freedom and liberty in his soul, though he was bound in his body with a chain; with all plainness, openness, and faithfulness; and with all courage and boldness, though in the midst of adversaries"

### John Wesley:
1. "Such was the victory of the word of God."
