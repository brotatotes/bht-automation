# Acts 28:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The natives, convinced of the man's guilt, concluded that he must be a murderer based on the serpent's attack and his chains. They believed that calamity and adversity were signs of divine punishment, a belief rooted in the human conscience and belief in a particular providence. However, they erred in assuming that all misfortunes are judgments for sin. It is important for us to be cautious and not hastily condemn the innocent or even the virtuous when interpreting hardships and trials in life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The natives, who were sure to know, here positively declared it to have been a venomous serpent."
2. "'The idea of his being a murderer is not to be accounted for...by the bite of a serpent...it is accounted for by the obviousness of the crime as belonging to the most notorious delinquents, and the aptness of the assumed punishment, death for death."
3. "Justice, or Nemesis. What the Phœnician islanders called her, does not appear; but the idea is common to all religions."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "No doubt this man is a murderer—His chains, which they would see, might strengthen the impression."
2. "whom . . . vengeance suffereth not to live—They believed in a Supreme, Resistless, Avenging Eye and Hand, however vague their notions of where it resided."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The fact that the viper had fastened on him; and that, as they supposed, he must now certainly die, was the proof from which they inferred his guilt."
2. "They reasoned incorrectly, as many do, only because that they supposed that every calamity is a judgment for some particular sin."
3. "The general proposition that all sin will be punished at some time is true, but we are not qualified to affirm of particular calamities always that they are direct judgments for sin."

### John Calvin:
1. "God, to the end he might make the world without excuse, would have this deeply rooted in the minds of all men, that calamity and adversity, and chiefly notable destruction, were testimonies and signs of his wrath and just vengeance against sins."
2. "Though God doth always punish men’s sins with adversity, yet doth he not punish every man according to his deserts in this life; and sometimes the punishments of the godly are not so much punishments as trials of their faith and exercises of godliness."

### John Gill:

2. "When the execution of capital punishments was taken away from them, yet such who deserved them were punished by God in a way equivalent to them."
