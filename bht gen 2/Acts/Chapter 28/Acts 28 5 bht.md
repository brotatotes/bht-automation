# Acts 28:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, the Apostle Paul shakes off the venomous serpent that had latched onto his hand and feels no harm. The shaking off of the serpent is seen as a token of a quiet mind and a fulfillment of Jesus' promise in Mark 16:18. The fact that the snakes in Malta do not harm the inhabitants further emphasizes God's protection and power, making this incident an eternal memorial of what God once wrought there.
