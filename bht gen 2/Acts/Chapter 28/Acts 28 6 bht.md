# Acts 28:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The symptoms following a viper's bite are acute pain, swelling, faintness, rapid pulse, nausea, convulsions, vomiting, cold sweats, and potential death. The people of Melita initially believed Paul to be a murderer, but quickly changed their opinion to regarding him as a deity. This hasty shift highlights the inconstancy of human reasoning. In truth, Paul was simply a man of God, neither a murderer nor a god. This serves as a cautionary reminder to avoid making snap judgments about others, particularly those who are followers of Christ.
