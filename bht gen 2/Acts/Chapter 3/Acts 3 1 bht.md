# Acts 3:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter and John, who were often seen together in their journeys, now went up to the temple, not for the daily sacrifice, but for the purpose of prayer. It was their custom to pray three times a day - in the evening, morning, and at noon - and they made it a priority to seize every opportunity for spreading the gospel. They ascended the terraces to the temple courts, eager to preach and share the good news with the people gathered there.
