# Acts 3:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The God of our fathers, whom ye delivered up, hath glorified his Son Jesus - This declaration by Peter, in the beginning of his discourse, serves to connect his argument with their own acknowledged principles, and shows that their rejection of Jesus was a direct contradiction to the testimony of their own Scriptures.
