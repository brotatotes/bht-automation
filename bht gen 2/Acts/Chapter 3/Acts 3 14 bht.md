# Acts 3:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In their rejection of Christ, they denied the One who is holy in his divine and human nature and the source of holiness for his people. They also rejected the One who is just and righteous, both in his person and in his role as Savior. Despite the verdict of Pilate, who recognized Christ as the Just One, they demanded his crucifixion, opting for a sentence of condemnation rather than an act of grace.
