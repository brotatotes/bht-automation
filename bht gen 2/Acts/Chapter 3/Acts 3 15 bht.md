# Acts 3:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The auditors were confronted with a piercing paradox as they realized that while they demanded a murderer, they killed the Prince of life.

This designation aligns with the portrayal of Jesus as the source of life in other parts of the Bible. The apostles, as witnesses, proclaim the connection between Jesus' life and passion and the fulfillment of prophecies, highlighting His resurrection as evidence of God's power surpassing human malice.
