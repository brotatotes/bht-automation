# Acts 3:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God, being fully aware of what would transpire, allowed the betrayal, sufferings, and death of the Messiah, as foretold in the Old Testament Scriptures, to serve a greater purpose. This divine plan of redemption, although baffling and paradoxical to many, was a means by which God brought about a remarkable outcome. It is a testament to the wisdom and sovereignty of God that he can turn even the darkest moments of human history into something ultimately good.
