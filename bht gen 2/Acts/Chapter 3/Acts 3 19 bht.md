# Acts 3:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Repentance is the call for all to turn away from sin and Satan and be converted to God. It is through this act of turning that one can receive the forgiveness of sins and experience the times of refreshing from the Lord. These times of refreshing, filled with God's grace and presence, bring about spiritual renewal, joy, and peace. The invitation to repentance is a time of mercy, offering deliverance from the consequences of sin and the restoration of one's relationship with God.
