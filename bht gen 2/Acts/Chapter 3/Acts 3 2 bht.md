# Acts 3:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
At the gate of the temple, called Beautiful, stood a man who had been lame from birth, relying on the kindness of passersby for survival. This gate, added by Herod the Great, was a magnificent structure made of Corinthian brass, towering thirty cubits high and fifteen cubits wide. Its intricate design and lavish material made it even more impressive than the gates adorned with silver and gold. It was at this gate, where a large number of people entered the temple, that the beggar laid, hoping for alms.

"The outward face of the Temple, looking at it from the Mount of Olives, as our Lord did that last week of His earthly life, wanted nothing that was likely to surprise men’s minds or their eyes; for it was covered over with plates of gold, which, at the first rising of the sun, reflected back such a splendour as compelled those who forced themselves to look upon it to turn away their eyes."
