# Acts 3:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He shall send Jesus Christ, the Messiah, to teach, redeem, save, judge, gather, and condemn. This period of refreshing is the time when the Messiah is proclaimed to come. The promise of rest brings comfort to believers in the midst of troubles. Embracing Jesus as Savior now through the gospel ensures that his second coming will not be in vain, but as a Judge to render justice. Remembering the day of rest that quenches all trouble sustains the faith of believers, as they eagerly anticipate the coming of the Lord, who was appointed before the foundation of the world.
