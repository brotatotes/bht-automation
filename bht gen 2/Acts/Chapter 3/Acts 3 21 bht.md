# Acts 3:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Until the appointed times of the complete restoration of all things, Christ is to be received and retained in heaven, exercising His role as Priest and interceding for His people. The prophetically foretold fulfillment of God's word extends throughout history, with its final culmination in the complete restoration of all things that Christ will bring about. This restoration is not merely about the salvation of all people or the undoing of all the consequences of sin but rather the fulfillment of what the prophets have spoken, which will be confirmed by the continued course of time.

### Henry Alford:
1. "It behoves the heaven (which is his, obeying his will) to receive Him till the time appointed." 
2. "I understand it then of the glorious restoration of all things, the παλιγγενεσία [Mat 19:28], which as Peter here says, is the theme of all the prophets from the beginning."
3. "The key both to the construction and meaning here, is our Lord’s saying, Matthew 17:11, Ἡλίας μὲν ἔρχεται καὶ ἀποκαταστήσει πάντα. From this we see that ἀποκατ . πάντων stands alone, as the ἀποκατ. of all things: and that ὧν does not belong to πάντων."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The meaning of the expression 'whom the heavens must receive,' is that it was 'fit' or 'proper' that he should ascend."
2. "It was also fit or expedient that he should do it, to direct the affairs of the universe for the welfare of the church and that he should exercise there his office as a priest in interceding for his people."
3. "The expression ['which God hath spoken'] is limited by the connection to this; and of course, it does not mean that all people will be saved, or that all the evils of sin can be repaired or remedied. This can never be, for the mischief is done and cannot be undone; but everything which the prophets have foretold shall receive their completion and fulfillment."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The statement that heaven must receive Christ until the period of His Second Advent is anything but derogatory to the majesty of the Redeemer who will reign from heaven; it is only inconsistent with the doctrine of the ubiquity of Christ’s body which Lutheran divines invented to strengthen their view of the corporeal presence in the Eucharist."
2. "The 'times of restitution' signify the same epoch as the 'times of refreshing'; and the 'restoration of all things' will either immediately precede or coincide with the Second Advent."
3. "This 'restitution,' so deeply rooted in the hearts of all Jews, was the principal cause of their summary rejection of a suffering Messiah."
