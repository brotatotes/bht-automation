# Acts 3:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The prophecy speaks of a prophet raised by the Lord, similar to Moses, who brings revelation, teaches God's will, and foretells the future. This prophet is not just one among a succession, but has a distinct role. He establishes the Christian Church, much like Moses established the Jewish Church. Although there are some similarities between Moses and this prophet, this prophet surpasses Moses in person and office. Jesus Christ fulfills this prophecy and brings ultimate deliverance from sin and death. His arrival marks a significant fulfillment of these prophetic words and establishes a new era for God's people.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This citation is a free but faithful paraphrase of the text in Deut."
2. "That the words, as spoken by Moses, seem to point to the whole line of prophets sent by God, is not any objection to their being applied to Christ, but rather necessitates, and entirely harmonizes with, that application."
3. "And none of the whole prophetic body entirely answered to the '·Ω°œÇ ·ºêŒºŒ≠,' but Christ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "a prophet . . . like unto me‚Äîparticularly in intimacy of communication with God."
2. "Peter takes it for granted that, in the light of all he had just said, it would be seen at once that One only had any claim to be that Prophet."
3. "him shall ye hear in all things, &c.‚ÄîThis part of the prediction is emphatically added, in order to shut up the audience to the obedience of faith, on pain of being finally 'cut off' from the congregation of the righteous."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The authority of Moses among the Jews was absolute and final. It was of great importance, therefore, to show not only that they were not departing from his Law, but that he had actually foretold these very things."
2. "The object of the passage is not to prove that the heavens must receive him, but that he was truly the Messiah."
3. "The meaning of this passage in Deuteronomy is apparent from the connection. Moses is stating to the Hebrews the duty and office of the priests and Levites. He then cautions them against conforming to the surrounding nations, particularly on the subject of religious instruction and guidance."

### John Calvin:
1. "He did this for this cause, because he intreateth in this place of the authority of doctrine."
2. "He aimeth at, to bring them to hear Christ willingly, as the master whom God hath appointed to teach them."
3. "Peter saw that this testimony doth so appertain unto the other prophets, that yet notwithstanding it doth chiefly commend Christ, not only because that he is the prince and chief of all the prophets, but because all other former prophecies were directed toward him, and because God did at length speak absolutely by his mouth."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Like unto me (œâœÇ ŒµŒºŒµ). As me, literally; Moses (Deuteronomy 18:14-18) claims that God raised him up as a prophet and that another and greater one will come, the Messiah."
2. "The Jews understood Moses to be a type of Christ (John 1:21)."
3. "God spoke to Moses face to face (Exodus 33:11) and he was the greatest of the prophets (Deuteronomy 34:10)."

### John Gill:
1. "The passages referred to are in Deuteronomy 18:15, a prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you: which is not to be understood of a succession of prophets, as some of the Jewish writers think, but of a single prophet." 
2. "He was a prophet in every sense, who brought a revelation of the divine will, taught the way, and explained the Scriptures of truth perfectly, and foretold things to come; he was raised up by the Lord God of Israel, and was anointed by his Spirit, and sent by him." 
3. "There was likewise between Moses and Christ, an agreement in the miracles they wrought, and in other things."

### John Wesley:
1. "The Lord shall raise you up a prophet like unto me ‚Äî And that in many particulars. Moses instituted the Jewish Church: Christ instituted the Christian."
2. "With the prophesying of Moses was soon joined the effect, the deliverance of Israel from Egypt: with the prophesying of Christ that grand effect, the deliverance of his people from sin and death."
3. "But though he was like Moses, yet he was infinitely superior to him, in person, as well as in office."
