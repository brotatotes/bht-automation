# Acts 3:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The prophets unanimously spoke of these days, referring to the times of the Messiah. Their prophecies pointed to the coming of Jesus Christ and the future restoration and refreshing that would take place. By listening to the voice of their own prophets, the Jews would find the fulfillment of these prophecies in Jesus and understand the true message of the gospel. The grand theme of the Old Testament writings is the coming of Messiah and the sure hope of a joyful season of restoration and refreshing. These days, spoken of by the prophets, signify the days of the Messiah.

1. "It is, however, an undisputed fact, that in all the prophetic writings preserved by the providence of God in the Old Testament, which are guarded now by the Jews with a jealous and devoted reverence, the grand theme is the coming of Messiah, and the sure hope of a joyful season of restoration and refreshing."
2. "â€˜These daysâ€™ may, as Alford and others maintain, refer to the days â€˜now present,â€™ the Gospel times of restoration, as taking in the whole of the period known as â€˜the last days;â€™ but the reference more clearly points to â€˜the  days â€™   immediately in the speakerâ€™s mind, to which he had been directing his hearers attention, the Second Advent and the times of restitution of all things (with this view Meyer and De Wette agree)."
