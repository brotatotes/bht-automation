# Acts 3:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The great Gospel blessing is to be turned from our iniquities, a blessing brought about through the incarnation and ministry of Jesus Christ. He was sent to the Jews first, and through the power of His grace in the proclamation of the Gospel, many were converted. This blessing does not come from our own efforts, but from Christ Himself, and it is through Him alone that we can be delivered from the curse of sin and find forgiveness and mercy.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is strange how Olshausen can suppose that the Spirit in Peter overleapt the bounds of his subsequent prejudice with regard to the admission of the Gentiles: he never had any such prejudice, but only against their admission uncircumcised, and as Gentiles."
2. "It is still stranger how a scholar like Dr. Burton can propose the ungrammatical and unmeaning rendering, 'πρῶτον is perhaps used with reference to Christ’s first coming, as opposed to his second.' This would require τὸ πρῶτον, and would certainly imply in the mind of the speaker an absolute exclusion of all but Jews till the second coming."
3. "This discourse does not come to a final conclusion as in ch. Acts 2:36, because it was interrupted by the apprehension of the Apostles."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "His Servant Jesus" (see on :-). 
2. "The great blessing with which Messiah has come laden is the turning away of every one of you from his iniquities."
3. "With what divine skill does the apostle, founding on resistless facts, here drive home to the conscience of his auditors their guilt in crucifying the Lord of Glory; then soothe their awakened minds by assurances of forgiveness on turning to the Lord, and a glorious future as soon as this shall come to pass, to terminate with the Personal Return of Christ from the heavens."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jesus himself also confined his ministry entirely to the Jews."
2. "The highest blessing that can be conferred upon people is to be turned from sin."
3. "The design of Peter in these remarks was to show them that the Messiah had come, and that now they might look for happiness, pardon, and mercy through him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. His Son Jesus. The best texts omit Jesus. Render servant for son, and see on ver. 13. 

### John Calvin:
1. "For we must always remember this, that all mankind is accursed, and, therefore, there is a singular remedy promised us, which is performed by Christ alone."
2. "And if so be that Christ came to this end, that he may bless the Jews first, and, secondly, us, he hath undoubtedly done that which was his duty to do; and we shall feel the force and effect of this duty in ourselves, unless our unbelief do hinder us."
3. "For Christ doth not do away the sins of the faithful, to the end they may grant liberty to themselves to sin under this color; but he maketh them therewith all new men."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Perhaps at this moment, full of the Holy Spirit, the fact of the glorious breadth of redemption flashed on the speaker’s mind with startling clearness..."

### John Gill:
1. "Which may be understood, either of the incarnation of Christ, and his exhibition in the flesh; which is sometimes expressed by raising him up, and is no other than the mission, or manifestation of him in human nature."
2. "He was sent in the ministry of the word, and came by his Spirit, first to the Jews, among whom the Gospel was first preached for a while, and was blessed to the conversion of many thousands among them, both in Judea, and in the nations of the world, where they were dispersed."
