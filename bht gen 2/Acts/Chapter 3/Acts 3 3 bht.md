# Acts 3:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Peter and John were going up to the temple, they encountered a man who asked them for alms. It is interesting to note that this man, despite not knowing Peter and John personally, had the courage to approach them and request assistance. This incident serves as a reminder that sometimes, the help we need comes from unexpected sources. Additionally, it is worth considering that the man's request for alms was not simply a plea for material support, but also a prayer for relief and sustenance in his time of need.
