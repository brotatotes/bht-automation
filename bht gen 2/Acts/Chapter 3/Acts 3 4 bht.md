# Acts 3:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter, moved by the Holy Spirit, fixed his gaze on the beggar and invited him to look at them. This was not a casual glance, but a deliberate act to capture the man's attention and showcase their authority in performing the forthcoming miracle. The intention was not only to heal the beggar physically, but also to demonstrate the power of God in a way that challenged the common Jewish notion of supernatural healing.
