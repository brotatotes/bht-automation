# Acts 3:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter, unlike the bishop of Rome, humbly admits to lacking silver and gold, demonstrating his commitment to relying on the power of the Lord rather than material wealth. He understands that the power to heal and perform miracles is not derived from himself, but entrusted to him by the Lord Jesus Christ. By emphasizing the authority of Jesus' name, Peter ensures that the man understands that the healing came from the one who was crucified, countering any notion that it was his own doing.
