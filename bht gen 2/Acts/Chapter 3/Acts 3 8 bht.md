# Acts 3:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The man, filled with joy, leaped up and stood and walked. His cure was immediate and perfect. He leaped for joy and to show others that he was truly healed. This fulfilled the prophecy in Isaiah 35:6. He praised God, not the apostles, recognizing that it was God's power that had brought about this miracle.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "describes his first joyous liberation from his weakness: as soon as he felt himself strengthened, he leapt up, for joy."
2. "His joy is quite sufficient to explain the gesture, and it is better to leave the narrative in its simplicity."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The man would be filled with joy, and would express it in this manner. He had been lame from a child; he had never walked; and there was more in the miracle than merely giving strength."
2. "His heart would be full; and he could have no doubt that this blessing had come from God alone. It is remarkable that he did not even express his gratitude to Peter and John. They had not pretended to restore him in their own name, and he would feel that man could not do it."
3. "It is remarkable that he praised God without being taught or entreated to do it. It was instinctive - the natural feeling of the heart. So a sinner. His first feelings, when he is converted, will be to ascribe the praise to God."
