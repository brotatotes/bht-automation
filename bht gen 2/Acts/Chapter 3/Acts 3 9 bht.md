# Acts 3:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the people gathered at the temple for prayer, they witnessed a remarkable sight - a man who was once paralyzed and bedridden was now walking. This miracle was widely witnessed, as the people saw him being carried in and now walking on his own. The people were filled with awe and praised God for this marvelous healing. The man's transformation from helplessness to wholeness was a cause for great rejoicing, and it inspired the people to offer praise and thanksgiving to God in the temple.
