# Acts 4:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The priests, diligent and faithful in their duty, claimed authority to prevent the preaching of the apostles. The captain of the temple police, a person of importance, came to suppress disturbances. The Sadducees, who denied the resurrection, opposed the apostles for proclaiming it through Jesus. Their preaching was a challenge to their beliefs. The wicked were always ready to silence the servants of Christ, even within the temple guard.
