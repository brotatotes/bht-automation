# Acts 4:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the name of Jesus is invoked, it carries such power and authority that even the Sanhedrin, who hold responsibility for the crucifixion, cannot ignore it. It is through the living name of Jesus that this miraculous healing has taken place, serving as evidence of the truth of his resurrection. The presence of the healed man before them further confirms the reality of this miracle, leaving the Sanhedrin without a valid defense to counter the undeniable power and authority of Jesus.
