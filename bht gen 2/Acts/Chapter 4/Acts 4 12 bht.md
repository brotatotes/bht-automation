# Acts 4:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
There is no other name whereby we must be saved, declares the apostle. He emphasizes the uniqueness of Christ as the only Savior and Redeemer, offering deliverance not only from temporal afflictions like the healing of the lame man, but also from the greater significance of sin and spiritual impotence. Following the example set by Jesus himself, the apostle employs this earthly example to convey a profound spiritual truth, inviting us to recognize the incomparable salvation found in Christ alone.
