# Acts 4:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These men, unlearned and ignorant in the eyes of the world, spoke with boldness, avowing their doctrines without hesitation or disguise. Their success in ministry was not dependent on their talent or eloquence, but on their genuine conviction of the truth they proclaimed. Their words revealed that they had been with Jesus, and their astonishment caused the ruling authorities to recognize them. The rulers marveled at the fluency and pertinence of their speech, though they were illiterate and uneducated according to worldly standards. God has always used such men, even the most seemingly unqualified, to proclaim His word throughout history.
