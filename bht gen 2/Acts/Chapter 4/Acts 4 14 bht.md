# Acts 4:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Beholding the man who was healed, the Sanhedrin could not refute the undeniable evidence of his transformation. The healed man, whether brought before the council or willingly appearing as a witness, stood as a living testament to the power and truth of the apostles' words. Staring at the undeniable proof of the miraculous healing and lacking any valid objections, the Sanhedrin was left with no choice but to acknowledge the authenticity of the apostles' actions and the impact of their encounter with Jesus.
