# Acts 4:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The fear and opposition faced by the apostles did not deter them from spreading the message of the Gospel. The authorities sought to contain and silence them, but the power of true Christianity cannot be confined or silenced. The threats and attempts to intimidate were futile, for the apostles had a higher authority to turn to and their faith empowered them to continue boldly proclaiming the truth. The world may oppose genuine Christianity, but it cannot stop its spread.
