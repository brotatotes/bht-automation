# Acts 4:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The individuals in question were given strict orders not to speak about the name of Jesus. This included both private conversations and public teachings. The prohibition extended not only to speaking about Jesus, but also to spreading his doctrine, which encompasses all aspects of his identity, from his incarnation to his resurrection from the dead. The intention was to completely silence their voices, preventing them from sharing the transformative power of Jesus with others.
