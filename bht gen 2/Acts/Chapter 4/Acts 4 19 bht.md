# Acts 4:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostles fearlessly proclaimed the truth of God, without regard for their own safety or reputation. They understood that their obedience to God's commandments was far more important than any human authority or opinions. Their unwavering commitment to God's will meant they were willing to sacrifice everything, even their own lives, rather than compromise their faith. Their boldness served as a reminder to all believers that we must prioritize obedience to God above all else, trusting in His authority and standing firm in our convictions.

### John Calvin:
1. "And lest, according to their wonted pride, they think that their authority is abated, when God is extolled above them, Peter draweth them away from such pleasant flattering of themselves, telling them that this matter must be determined before the judgment-seat of God; for he saith plainly before [in the sight of] God; because, howsoever men be blinded, yet will God never suffer any man to be preferred before him."
2. "Therefore, let us then remember this holy authority of God, which is able to drive away the vain smoke of all man’s excellency."
