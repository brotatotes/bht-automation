# Acts 4:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The priests and Sadducees were deeply troubled and filled with wrath and indignation at the teachings of Jesus and the apostles. Their anger arose from the fact that the resurrection of Jesus undermined their authority and doctrines, particularly their denial of the resurrection and future state. The Sadducees sought to discredit the apostles and their belief in the resurrection, while the priests were concerned about the decline of their office and temple services. However, the resurrection of Jesus also served as a powerful testimony to his righteousness and implicates them in his crucifixion.
