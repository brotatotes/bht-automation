# Acts 4:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For the disciples, sharing the message of the gospel was not a choice but a compulsion. They had witnessed firsthand the power and truth of Christ, and they were under a divine command to spread this message. The authorities sought to suppress the gospel, but Peter and John, in a respectful yet defiant appeal, refused to be silenced. They were willing to face the consequences for boldly testifying to what they had seen and heard. This demonstrated their unwavering loyalty to Christ and their fearlessness in the face of opposition.
