# Acts 4:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When faced with the task of finding a way to punish them, the authorities were at a loss. They feared the people's reaction, recognizing that any attempt to harm Peter and John would only incite a public uproar. Thus, they were forced to let them go, not because they deemed them innocent, but because they could find no means to punish them without provoking the people's anger. In the end, the people themselves, who were wiser than their rulers, glorified God for the powerful works that had been done.
