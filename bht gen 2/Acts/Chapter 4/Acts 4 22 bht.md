# Acts 4:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus healed a man who had been lame from birth, a miraculous event that was made even more remarkable by the fact that the man had been disabled for over forty years. The age of the man highlighted the certainty and greatness of the miracle, and his long-standing condition rendered any doubts of deception or trickery absurd. This healing served multiple purposes, benefiting both the man who was healed and serving as a testimony to the power and glory of God and the truth of the Gospel.
