# Acts 4:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The believers gathered together with their fellow saints, finding solace and joy in one another's presence, as seen in other passages of Scripture. They came together not only to share in each other's company, but also to exchange valuable information that could benefit the entire community and bring glory to God. They openly discussed the commands, instructions, and threats they had received from the chief priests and elders, ensuring that all were aware of the challenges they faced. Such unity and transparency were crucial in these tumultuous times.
