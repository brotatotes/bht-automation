# Acts 4:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
With one accord, the believers lifted up their voices in prayer, their emotions evident in the loud and fervent manner in which they expressed their petitions. As they faced the imminent storm of danger and persecution, they sought the help of God, recognizing that He alone is the Creator of heaven and earth and that His power surpasses that of their adversaries. Their prayer was a confident and hopeful expression, trusting in God's promises and unfailing power.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "With one accordâ€”the breasts of all present echoing every word of this sublime prayer."
2. "Lordâ€”(See on :-). Applied to God, the term expresses absolute authority."
3. "God which hast made heaven and earthâ€”against whom, therefore, all creatures are powerless."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To lift up the voice, among the Hebrews, was a phrase denoting either an 'address' to the people, or a phrase expressive of 'weeping' or of 'prayer'."
2. "The union of the early Christians is often noticed in the Acts of the Apostles. Thus far, there was no jar or dissension in their society, and everything has the appearance of the most entire affection and confidence."
3. "In times of danger and perplexity we should remember that God has a right to do with us as he pleases; and we should go cheerfully, and commit ourselves into his hands."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Lord [Î´ÎµÏƒÏ€Î¿Ï„Î±] . See on 2 Peter 2:1.

### John Calvin:
1. "We are taught by this example what is our duty to do when our adversaries do imperiously threaten us...the fear of danger ought to drive us to crave help at the hands of God." 
2. "The disciples of Christ do not jest when they hear that their enemies do threaten them so sore and press so sore upon them...but being touched with fear, they fly to seek help at the hands of God."
3. "Our prayers are such as they ought to be, and acceptable to God only then, when as staying ourselves upon his promises and power, we pray with certain hope to obtain that for which we pray."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Surely the storm of danger and persecution which then was threatening shortly to break over the little church must have seemed ever imminent to a company of men whose life-work it was to preach the religion of a crucified malefactor."
2. "It is a beautiful thought which sees in these solemn words, where an unshaken, a deathless faith shines through the gloom of present and coming sorrow, a fragment of the oldest Christian liturgy."
3. "Lord, thou art the God which hast made heaven and earth. How feeble, after all, was the power of high priest and Sanhedrim compared with that of their Master, the Creator of all!"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "With one accord" (Î¿Î¼Î¿Î¸Ï…Î¼Î±Î´Î¿Î½). A concert of voices as already seen by the word in Acts 1:14; Acts 2:46 and later in Acts 5:12; Acts 7:57; Acts 15:25.
2. "O Lord" (Î”ÎµÏƒÏ€Î¿Ï„Î±). Our word despot. Old word for relation of master to slaves or household servants (1 Timothy 6:1; 2 Timothy 2:21; Titus 2:9; 1 Peter 2:18). Simeon thus addressed God (Luke 2:29). So in 2 Peter 2:1; Judges 1:4; Revelation 6:10. See "slaves" in verse Acts 4:29.

### John Gill:
1. "being inspired by the Holy Ghost, they not only agreed in the matter of their petitions, which agreement is of great avail with God; for whatever two or more agree in to ask of God, shall be given to them"
2. "in the very words which were vocally expressed by them, and that in a very loud and sonorous way, to signify the vehemency and ardour of their minds and affections"
3. "which is a full proof of the omnipotence of God; an attribute of singular use to the saints in distressed circumstances; for what is it he cannot do, who made all things that are?"

### John Wesley:
1. The sense is, Lord, thou hast all power. And thy word is fulfilled. Men do rage against thee: but it is in vain.
