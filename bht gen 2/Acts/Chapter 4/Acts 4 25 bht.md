# Acts 4:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The psalmist laments the rage of the nations and the futile plotting of the people against the Messiah. The ancient Jewish scholars affirmed that this psalm is indeed about the promised Messiah. It is evident throughout the psalm that the focus is on the Messiah, with mentions of the opposition He faces and the attempts of earthly powers to thwart Him. The heathens and people's raging and vain imaginations culminated in the crucifixion of the Messiah, but their attempts were ultimately in vain, for death could not hold Him.
