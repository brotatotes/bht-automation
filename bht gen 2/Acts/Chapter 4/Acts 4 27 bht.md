# Acts 4:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The anointing of Jesus as the king of Israel is referenced here. He was set apart for this role from eternity, being called to be the prophet, priest, and king. This anointing took place both at his incarnation and baptism when he received the Spirit without measure. It is significant to note that the fulfillment of this prophecy involved Herod, Pontius Pilate, and others coming together to mock, scourge, and crucify Jesus, demonstrating the truth of God's plan. The anointing of Jesus as the holy child and King Messiah aligns perfectly with the events that have unfolded.
