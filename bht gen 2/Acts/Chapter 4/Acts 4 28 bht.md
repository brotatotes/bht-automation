# Acts 4:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The gathering, consultations, and conspiracies of those who opposed the gospel were all within the realm of God's sovereign control. They could only do what God allowed them to do. In His eternal plan, God had decreed that Christ would be subjected to the actions of both Jews and Gentiles, in accordance with His will and the covenant made with Christ. All that took place was part of God's determined purpose to save mankind through the suffering of His Son.
