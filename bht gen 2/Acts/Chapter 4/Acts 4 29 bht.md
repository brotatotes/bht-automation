# Acts 4:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the face of threats, the early believers did not shy away from their critical position but instead asked God to take notice of the opposition. Their prayer was not for personal safety, but for the courage and boldness to continue proclaiming the gospel without fear. They desired to speak God's word with freedom, openness, and faithfulness. This petition reveals their understanding that the ability to boldly speak the word of God is a gift from Him, and they sought to exercise it faithfully and fearlessly, regardless of the challenges they faced.
