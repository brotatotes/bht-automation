# Acts 4:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
There was a remarkable unity and agreement among the believers, as if their hearts and souls were intertwined. This deep level of connection in their thoughts, emotions, and desires was a result of their shared love and devotion. The multitude of believers were bound together by this unity, and it naturally led to a sense of commonality in their possessions and resources. As long as their love and oneness persisted, it was only natural for them to have all things in common.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "On the community of goods, see note at ch. Acts 2:45. We have the view there taken strikingly confirmed here by the expressions used."
2. "No one called (reckoned) any thing of his goods (which were still τὰ ὑπάρχοντα αὐτῷ, not alienated) (to be) his own."
3. "ἔλεγεν, dicebat: hoc ipso præsupponitur proprietatem possessionis non plane fuisse deletam."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They felt alike, or were attached to the same things, and this preserved them from jars and dissensions."
2. "No expression could denote it more strikingly than to say of friends they have one soul."
3. "There can be no more striking demonstration of union and love than to say of more than five thousand suddenly drawn together that they had one soul!"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Heart and soul. See on Mark 12:30.

### John Calvin:
1. "And surely where faith beareth the chief sway, it doth so knit the hearts of men together, that all of them do both will and nill one thing."
2. "But we shall see anon, after what sort they had their goods common. This is now worth the noting in the text of Luke that the inward unity of minds goeth before as the root, and then the fruit followeth after."
3. "And in vain do we boast of a right affection, unless there appear some testimony thereof in external offices."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A harmony complete and unbroken reigned at first in the Church of Jesus: greed, jealousy, and selfish ambition were unknown as yet in the community."
2. "This enthusiasm of love found its first expression in a voluntary cession of all possessions on the part of each individual believer in favor of the common funds of the society."
3. "It is clear, then, that this was an attempt to graft the principle of a community of goods on the Church of Christ - an attempt which utterly failed in practice, and which was given up altogether after a very short experience."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "There was one heart and soul (nominative case, not genitive as the English has it) in the multitude (του πληθους, subjective genitive) of those who believed."
2. "Not one of them (ουδε εις). More emphatic than ουδεις, 'not even one.'"
3. "The word κοινα is kin to συν (together with)=ξυν (Epic) and so ξυνοσ=κοινος. See this word already in Acts 2:44. The idea of unclean (Acts 10:15) is a later development from the original notion of common to all."

### John Gill:
1. "There was an entire consent and agreement in doctrine, in matters of faith they were all of one mind and judgment, and there was a perfect harmony in their practice."
2. "Their souls were knit to one another; so that there was, but as it were, one soul in this large body of Christians."
3. "They were not only every day liable to persecutions and to have their possessions seized, and their goods confiscated; but they also knew, that in process of time, Jerusalem would be destroyed, and they could not tell how soon; and therefore judged it right to sell off their possessions, and throw the money into one common stock, for their mutual support, and for the carrying on the common cause of Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "Every individual person were of one heart and one soul - Their love, their hopes, their passions joined."
2. "In so great a multitude: this was a necessary consequence of that union of heart."
3. "So long as that truly Christian love continued, they could not but have all things common."
