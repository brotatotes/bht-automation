# Acts 4:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The early Christians exemplified their faith through their generous acts of sharing their possessions with those in need. They went beyond mere charity, as they willingly sold their lands and houses to ensure that no one among them lacked the necessities of life. This selfless act of communal living served as a tangible expression of the abundant grace bestowed upon them by God. It is a timeless testament to the transformative power of the Gospel, revealing that when grace and love abound, it naturally produces a generous outpouring of care for one another.

3. "In the places cited by Wetst. from Demosth. and Appian the pres. retains its proper force, as here. In Appian, B. Civ. v. p. 1088, the expression is, τιμὰς τῶν ἔτι πιπρασκομένων."

### John Calvin:
1. "For this is spoken for amplification’s sake, that the rich men did not only relieve the poverty of their brethren of the yearly revenue of their lands, but they were so liberal, that they spared not their lands."
2. "And this might be, though they did not rob themselves of all, but only a little diminish their revenues; which we may gather again out of the words of Luke, for he saith that this was the end, that no man might lack."
3. "Hereby it appeareth what that meaneth, that no man counted anything his own, but they had all things common. For no man had his own privately to himself, that he alone might enjoy the same, neglecting others; but as need required, they were ready to bestow upon all men."

Bread to eat, or clothes to wear, or any of the necessaries of life; which shows their great charity, and gives a reason why they were in so much favour with the people, because they took so much care of their poor; and this flowed from the grace of God bestowed upon them."
