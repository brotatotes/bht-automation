## BHT:
Joseph, or Joses, was a companion of the apostle Paul and known for his generosity and sacrificial spirit. He was called Barnabas, meaning son of consolation, because of his ability to provide encouragement and comfort to others. As a Levite, he possessed land within the Levitical cities. Barnabas was renowned for his gifts as a preacher, particularly in the areas of comforting and exhorting. His wealth and talents made him an esteemed figure in the New Testament, and he exemplified the spirit of giving and ministering to others.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Barnabas, בַּר נְבוּאָה, is υἱὸς προφητείας and the interpretation has been generally made good by taking παράκλησις as included in προφητεία, and as in the sense of exhortation."
2. "The Levites might possess land at all times within the precincts of the Levitical cities: such was the case, e.g., in Jeremiah 32:7."
3. "For the state of Cyprus at this time, see notes on ch. Acts 11:19; Acts 13:4-7."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Joses, &c.—This is specified merely as an eminent example of that spirit of generous sacrifice which pervaded all."
2. "Son of consolation—no doubt so surnamed from the character of his ministry."
3. "A Levite—who, though as a tribe having no inheritance, might and did acquire property as individuals (Deuteronomy 18:8)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He is mentioned elsewhere with honor in the New Testament...and usually as the companion of the apostle Paul." 
2. "The practice of giving surnames, as expressive of character, was not uncommon."
3. "The great mass of ministers, like very many who have been distinguished in other professions, have been taken from among the poor, and from humble ranks in life."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Possibly Joseph had a larger estate than some others also."
2. "Doubtless his gifts as a preacher lay along this same line."
3. "Encouragement is the chief idea in παρακλησις though exhortation, comfort, consolation are used to render it."

### John Gill:
1. "And Joses,.... The Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Ethiopic versions, read 'Joseph', and so do Beza's most ancient copy, and two of his manuscripts, and the Alexandrian copy, and others; for 'Jose', or 'Joses', is only an abbreviation or contraction of 'Joseph'." 
2. "...afterwards, or at least after he came to be acquainted with the apostles, and to be in their company, they called him 'Barnabas', The Arabic and Ethiopic versions read, 'who was of the apostles'; and so Barnabas is spoken of as if he was an apostle."
3. "....from the excellent gift and talent he had at exhorting; see Acts 11:23 and from the use he was of for the comforting of distressed minds; for נבא, 'Naba, to prophesy', includes both exhortation and comfort; and he having the gift of prophecy or preaching the Gospel, was called ברנבא, 'Barnabas', a son of comfort, or a comforter, or an exhorter."

### John Wesley:
1. "A son of consolation — Not only on account of his so largely assisting the poor with his fortune..."
2. "...but also of those peculiar gifts of the Spirit, whereby he was so well qualified both to comfort and to exhort."
