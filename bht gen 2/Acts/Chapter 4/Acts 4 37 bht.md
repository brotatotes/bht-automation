# Acts 4:37 Commentary Help Text

When the disciples sold their land, it was likely a valuable estate and may have been located in Cyprus. As a Levite, the individual who sold the land did not have a distinct inheritance in Israel. This act of selling their possessions reflected the abolition of the ceremonial law and the unity and selflessness of the early Christian community.
