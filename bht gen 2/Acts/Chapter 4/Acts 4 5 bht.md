# Acts 4:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The gathering mentioned consisted of the Sanhedrim, comprising rulers, elders, and scribes who were known for their power, wisdom, and learning. Within this council, the chief priests held a prominent position. The Sanhedrim sought to undermine the gospel and the name of Christ, but their plans were thwarted by God. Despite their wicked subtlety, their counsels were made futile through the fear of the people, as they restrained their fury to avoid envy. God brings a sudden fear upon them, preventing them from carrying out their desires and preserving the truth in the process.
