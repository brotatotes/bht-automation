# Acts 4:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage includes references to Annas and Caiaphas, both called high priests. Annas, the father-in-law of Caiaphas, held the position of high priest before Caiaphas took over. Annas continued to exercise significant power even during the priesthood of Caiaphas. Additionally, it mentions John and Alexander, leaders among the Sadducees, who played a role in pressing charges against Peter and John. These individuals were prominent figures in the Jewish nation, with Annas still holding influence beyond his time as high priest.

Its powers embraced all matters, civil as well as religious."

"...he lived also at Jerusalem; for it is said of him that he sat in the shadow of the temple, and expounded all the whole day; and a very remarkable story is told of him, which happened just about this time, which is, that 'forty years before the destruction of the temple--the doors of the temple opened of themselves, when Rabban Jochanan ben Zaccai reproved them.'"
3. "Alexander; whose surname was Lysimachus, and had the title of 'Alabarcha'; he was a very rich man: after Alexander the great had been at Jerusalem, this name became frequent among the Jews."
