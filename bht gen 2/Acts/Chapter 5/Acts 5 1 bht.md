# Acts 5:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Ananias and his wife sought to deceive the early Christian community by presenting only a portion of the money gained from the sale of their field as a generous offering, while keeping the rest for themselves. This act of hypocrisy was a display of Satan's cunning, infiltrating the seemingly pure and virtuous actions of believers. It underscores the significance of genuine devotion and exposes the abomination of insincerity in the sight of God. This cautionary tale reminds us to wholeheartedly commit ourselves to God, forsaking any selfish motives, and to shun deceit and hypocrisy within the Christian community.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The crime of these two is well described by Meyer: 'By the sale of their field, and the bringing in of the money they in fact professed to give the whole price as a gift of brotherly love to the common stock: but their aim was to get for themselves the credit of holy love and zeal by one portion of the price, whereas they had selfishly kept back the other portion for themselves.'"


### Albert Barnes:
1. "Hypocrisy consists in an attempt to 'imitate' the people of God, or to assume the 'appearance' of religion, in whatever form it may be manifested."
2. "The hypocrisy of Ananias consisted in 'attempting' to imitate this in appearance, and to impose in this way on the early Christians and on God."
