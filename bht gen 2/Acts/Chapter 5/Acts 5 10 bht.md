# Acts 5:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The death of Sapphira, which occurred immediately after she fell down at her husband's feet, was regarded as supernatural. The Church, being mentioned for the first time in this context, becomes an example of a New Testament Church. Within this community, a group of men, united by fellowship and the Gospel, takes on the responsibility of burying Sapphira. This act serves as a sobering reminder of the discipline enacted by the deaths of Ananias and Sapphira. The burial itself aligns with the Jewish custom, where burial was typically done before sunset on the day of death.
