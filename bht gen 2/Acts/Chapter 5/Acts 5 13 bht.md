# Acts 5:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
None of the rest, whether they were the outsiders or those who were in the church but not truly committed, dared to attach themselves to the apostles. The fear of facing the same tragic fate as Ananias and Sapphira kept them from superficially associating with the believers. Only those who were genuinely devoted to following Jesus were willing to join themselves to the apostles and experience the life-changing power of the gospel.
