# Acts 5:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The fear and reverence that resulted from Ananias and Sapphira's punishment didn't hinder people from joining the church; in fact, it led to even greater additions of true believers. This remarkable growth was evident in both men and women, with the Gospel spreading despite opposition. Unbelievers were kept at a distance, while genuine followers of Christ were drawn in.
