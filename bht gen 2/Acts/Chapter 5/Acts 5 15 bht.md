# Acts 5:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people, hearing about the miraculous cures performed by the apostles, brought out their sick loved ones into the streets. They laid them on beds and couches, hoping that at the very least, the shadow of Peter passing by would overshadow some of them. It is important to note, however, that there was no inherent power in Peter's shadow itself. The Papists' claims of the primacy of Peter, the worship of images, and the Pope having the same power as Peter's shadow are all vain and unfounded.
