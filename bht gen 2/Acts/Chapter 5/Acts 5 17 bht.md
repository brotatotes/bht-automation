# Acts 5:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The high priest, along with the sect of the Sadducees, reacted with great fury and zeal upon hearing about the miracles and growth of the apostles. They were filled with blind and bitter anger, driven by their denial of angels and the resurrection. This hostile opposition, motivated by misguided zeal, served as a formidable challenge for the followers of Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "To suppose that the H. P. 'rose up' after a council held (Meyer) is far-fetched, and against the ἐπλήσθησαν ζήλου, which points to the kindling zeal of men first stirred up to action."

3. "The movement extended through the whole sect."

### John Calvin:
1. "Whence we may gather with what blind fury and rage Satan driveth them forward, when as they are so little terrified with such evident power of God, that they run headlong more boldly, and with greater force, and bend all their force, as it were, to overthrow the very heaven."
2. "Especially the knowledge of the gifts of God, whereby he testifieth that he is present with us, ought to encourage us, lest the fury and boldness of the wicked do terrify and dismay us. For this is no small comfort, when we know that God is present with us."
3. "We see at this day those men moved and stirred with devilish fury, who will be counted the most devout of all men, who rage horribly to shed innocent blood."
