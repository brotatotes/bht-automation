# Acts 5:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the apostles were seized and taken away, they were placed in the public prison. This prison was not just any prison, but a place of confinement for notorious offenders. The motive behind their arrest was rooted in jealousy and rivalry, which led to their unjust imprisonment. The apostles were held in custody, as if they were criminals, highlighting the gravity of their situation. The incident was not a temporary confinement, but rather a serious and intentional act to keep them detained.
