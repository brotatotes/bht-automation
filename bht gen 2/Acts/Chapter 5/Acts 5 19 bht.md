# Acts 5:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By night, the angel of the Lord, one of those ministering spirits sent by God, opened the prison doors, leading them forth. This angel, one that excel in strength, easily opened the doors that imprisoned them. The angel's actions were immediately felt by the apostles, as their faith was strengthened by this visible manifestation and they fearlessly continued to proclaim the holy name of the Master. The Sadducee chiefs, on the other hand, were left perplexed and anxious, as this event provided a new proof of a strange and awe-inspiring power associated with these bold men.
