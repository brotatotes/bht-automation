# Acts 5:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Upon their deliverance from prison, the apostles were not merely rescued to protect themselves from danger, but rather to continue their God-given mission of preaching the Gospel in the temple. They were commanded to proclaim without hesitation all the words of this life, referring to the teachings and doctrines that reveal the way to eternal life. These life-giving words are not to be hidden or watered down, but boldly and faithfully shared with conviction and constancy. By embracing and proclaiming these words, sinners are awakened, believers are revived, and souls are nourished towards the path of everlasting life.
