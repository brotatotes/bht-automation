# Acts 5:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
At daybreak, the apostles entered the temple, faithfully following the angel's command to proclaim God's message. They wasted no time, arriving in the morning when the temple doors were opened and people began to gather. Meanwhile, the high priest and his associates, convening the various courts of Jerusalem, sent officers to the prison to bring the apostles before them. The apostles' obedience and the high priest's swift action reveal the contrasting motivations of the faithful and the religious leaders in this pivotal moment.

3. "He brought them without violence, that is, that they were not drawn violently, lest any tumult should arise, so that, whereas they neither fear nor reverence God, they are afraid of men."
