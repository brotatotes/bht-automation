# Acts 5:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The prison was found shut, indicating that it had not been broken into. This was evidence that their deliverance was a result of God's intervention. Furthermore, the guards were keeping watch, not aware that anything had happened. Upon entering the prison, they discovered the prisoners were gone. The angel likely closed the doors again after their escape.
