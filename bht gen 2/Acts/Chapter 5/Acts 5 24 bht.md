# Acts 5:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They found themselves in a perplexing situation, unsure of what to make of the reported events. Their doubt stemmed from their inability to comprehend the magnitude of what had occurred. This uncertainty left them anxious and unsure of how to explain or respond to such a supernatural occurrence. The unexpected and miraculous nature of the apostles' escape left them with no logical explanation, causing them to question the source of power behind these events. This uncertainty reinforces the notion that worldly powers are often confounded when faced with the unexplainable workings of God.
