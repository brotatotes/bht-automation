# Acts 5:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostles' success in filling Jerusalem with their doctrine is a powerful testimony to the truth of their message, even coming from reluctant lips. They boldly placed themselves in the midst of the whole sanhedrim, with the high priest taking charge of their questioning, despite not being the council president. This highlights the significance of their testimony and the attention it garnered, giving weight to the validity of their preaching.
