# Acts 5:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The opponents of the Gospel act cunningly by making laws that go against God's commands, causing those who are devoted to following God to inevitably disobey. Thus, these enemies of the Gospel seize the opportunity to condemn and punish the innocent, treating them as guilty. In contrast, the apostles did not harbor any desire to accuse others; they earnestly proclaimed the unadorned truth.
