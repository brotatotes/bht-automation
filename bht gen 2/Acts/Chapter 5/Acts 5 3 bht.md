# Acts 5:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Why hath Satan filled thine heart? Peter, guided by divine revelation, calls out Ananias for allowing Satan to influence him into committing such a deceitful act. Not only did Ananias lie to the Holy Ghost, but he also attempted to deceive God by keeping back part of the price of the land he sold. This was a significant moment as it revealed Satan's power over Ananias and marked the first attempt to introduce the concept of owning private property within the early Christian Church.
