# Acts 5:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people in the story were deeply affected, as if their hearts were being cut apart. The intense rage and indignation they experienced was so strong that it tore at their minds and emotions. They were filled with a desire to harm and destroy, driven by their fury and madness. This wasn't a reasoned or judicial decision, but a reckless and violent intention to commit murder without proper legal authority. Their anger blinded them to the truth and led them astray from righteousness.

3. The words used in the two places are strikingly different."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word used here properly denotes 'to cut with a saw'; and as applied to the 'mind,' it means to be agitated with 'rage' and 'indignation,' as if wrath should seize upon the mind as a saw does upon wood, and tear it violently, or agitate it severely." 
2. "When used in connection with 'the heart,' it means that the heart is violently agitated and rent with rage."
3. "The word rendered 'took counsel' denotes commonly 'to will'; then, 'to deliberate'; and sometimes 'to decree' or 'to determine.'"

### John Calvin:

2. "Yet we must therewithal note the force of the word, because although the reprobate are not thereby changed, that they may become better, yet it pierceth into their hearts, so that it urgeth their consciences..."
3. "And chiefly when they are cited by the sound of the trumpet to appear before the judgment-seat of God, then appeareth their madness and fury."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Were cut to the heart (διεπριοντο). Imperfect passive of διαπριω old verb (δια, πριω), to saw in two (δια), to cut in two (to the heart). Here it is rage that cuts into their hearts, not conviction of sin as in Acts 2:37."
