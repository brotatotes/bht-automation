"Considering that he was a Pharisee, opposing the prevalent faction of Sadducæism in a matter where the Resurrection was called in question, and a wise and enlightened man opposing furious and unreasoning zealots, considering also, that when the anti-pharisaical element of Christianity was brought out in the acts and sayings of Stephen, his pupil Saul was found the foremost persecutor, we should, I think, be slow to suspect him of any favouring of the Apostles as followers of Jesus."
3. "He does not here appear as the president of the Sanhedrim, but only as a member."
