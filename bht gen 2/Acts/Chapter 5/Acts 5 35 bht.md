# Acts 5:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Take heed to yourselves and hold your minds on yourselves, considering well before acting rashly and precipitantly. Do not give in to passion and wrath, hastily laying hands on these men and destroying them. Otherwise, you may bring upon yourselves disgrace, danger, ill-will, and the wrath of God. Take the time to deliberate and consult on what punishment to inflict, whether it be imprisonment, scourging, or death, but do not act rashly in this matter.
