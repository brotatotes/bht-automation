## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We are plainly in no position (setting all other considerations aside) to charge St. Luke with having put into the mouth of Gamaliel words which he could not have uttered."
2. "All we can say is, that such impostors were too frequent, for any one to be able to say that there was not one of this name at the time specified."
3. "It is exceedingly improbable, considering the time and circumstances of the writing of the Acts, and the evident supervision of them by St. Paul, the pupil of Gamaliel, that a gross historical mistake should have been here put into his mouth."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Gamaliel's advice was to permit these men to go on."
2. "The fact that Josephus has not recorded the insurrection referred to by Gamaliel does not militate at all against the account in the Acts."
3. "It is altogether improbable that 'Gamaliel' should refer to a case which was not well authenticated, and that Luke should record a speech of this kind unless it was delivered."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Joined themselves [προσεκολληθη] . The best texts read prosekliqh, were inclined; i e., leaned to, or took sides with.

### John Calvin:
1. "But I think that when Luke saith, After him was there one Judas, he meant not to note the course of time, as if he were the latter; but forasmuch as Gamaliel brought in two like examples, he might put the one in place of the other, without having respect of time." 
2. "Gamaliel hath respect unto this alone, that men have unlucky success when as they advance themselves un-advisedly; and that cometh to pass by the just judgment of God." 
3. "Therefore the constancy of the apostles was the more excellent, who, though they be so evil rewarded for those long pains which they had endured, yet are they not discouraged, neither do they cease to hold on as they had begun."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He does not speak of ancient records, though he might have done so, but of more recent histories, which are most powerful to induce belief."
2. "This is one of the so-called historical inaccuracies of the ‘Acts.’"
3. "The mistake of identifying the Theudas of Josephus with the Theudas instanced by the writer of the ‘Acts,’ is probably in great measure owing to the mistake of Eusebius."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Josephus gives an account of four men named Simon who followed each other within forty years, and of three named Judas within ten years, who were all instigators of rebellion" (Hackett).
2. "If the same Theudas is meant, then either Josephus or Luke (Gamaliel) has the wrong historical order. In that case one will credit Luke or Josephus according to his estimate of the two as reliable historians."
3. "'Somebody' of importance here."

### John Gill:
1. "This instance Gamaliel produces, to show that impostors and seditious persons, such as the apostles were thought to be, seldom succeeded, but generally failed in their attempts, and were blasted."
2. "He rose up and made an insurrection, boasting himself to be some body, or 'some great one.' Just as Simon Magus did afterward."
3. "This account agrees with this instance of Gamaliel, only differs in chronology; since, according to Gamaliel's account, this case of Theudas was some time ago, and must have been before now, or he could not have mentioned it."

### John Wesley:
1. Before these days — He prudently mentions the facts first, and then makes the inference.
