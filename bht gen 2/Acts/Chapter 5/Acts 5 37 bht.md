# Acts 5:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
There was a man named Judas from Galilee who led a rebellion against the Romans. He believed it was wrong to pay tribute to the Romans and have mortal rulers instead of God. This rebellion was the result of the Jews' belief that only God should rule over them and be called Lord. When Cyrenius came to Syria as a judge and appraiser of their estates, Judas of Galilee, also known as Judas the Gaulonite, and Saddochus rebelled, urging the nation to fight for their liberty against the servitude brought about by the appraisement.
