# Acts 5:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a situation where the cause is clearly just, it is wise to immediately support it. Conversely, if the cause is clearly evil, it should be opposed without delay. However, when faced with a sudden and uncertain situation, this advice becomes even more valuable, as it helps guide our actions in a new and uncertain circumstance.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "implying by the first, perhaps, the manifold devices of human imposture and wickedness"
2. "the solemnity and fixedness of the divine purpose, by the indicative"
3. "The whole plan, the scheme, of which this ἔργον, the fact under your present cognizance, forms a part."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The very way to exalt error into notice, and to confirm people in it, is to oppose it in a harsh, authoritative, and unkind manner."
2. "Error, if left alone, will often die away itself. The interest of people in it will often cease as soon as it ceases to be opposed; and, having nothing to fan the flame, it will expire. It is not so with truth."
3. "The preservation of the Christian religion, unchanged through so many revolutions, and in so many fiery trials, shows that it is not of men, but of God. The argument for the divine origin of the Christian religion from its perpetuity is one that can be applied to no other system that has been, or that now exists."

2. "nor go about to hinder them, in what they are concerned"
