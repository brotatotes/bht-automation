# Acts 5:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If it is a work of God, undertaken by these men in accordance with His will, with the purpose of bringing honor and glory to Him, then your attempts to overthrow it will be in vain. This work will continue to flourish and remain steadfast, despite any opposition it may face from both earthly and spiritual forces. It would be sheer folly to engage in a futile fight against God Himself, and no rational person can expect to prevail in such an endeavor.
