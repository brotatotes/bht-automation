# Acts 5:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the possession of the property was still his, it was entirely his to do with as he pleased. Ananias had the choice to sell it or keep it. But instead of being honest, he held deceit in his heart, leading him to commit this grave offense. His lie was not just to the men in the room, but to God Himself, as the Holy Ghost is indeed God. This passage serves as a reminder that our actions and honesty should always be in reverence to God's authority and guidance.
