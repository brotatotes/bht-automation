# Acts 5:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Gamaliel's wise counsel resonated with the members of the Sanhedrin, who were convinced and persuaded by his persuasive arguments and approved of his advice. They agreed to follow his counsel, which included beating or scourging the apostles with forty stripes save one, fulfilling the prophecy of Christ. By releasing them and setting them at liberty, the Sanhedrin demonstrated that they had heeded Gamaliel's advice and decided not to take more extreme measures against the disciples.
