Every day, the apostles were undeterred by any punishment or fear, faithfully carrying out their Master's command to teach and preach Jesus Christ. They proclaimed this truth not only in the temple but also in every house, showing great constancy and zeal. Their unwavering commitment to declaring Jesus as the Son of God, the true and only Savior of sinners, was not hindered by their persecutions but rather fueled by them.
