# Acts 5:5 Commentary Help Text

Ananias fell down and expired, and this severity was just considering the combination of vain glory, covetousness, fraud, and impiety in his action.

It struck great fear in those who heard, leading them to be cautious in their words and actions, further upholding the reverence and authenticity of the early Church.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The deaths of Ananias and Sapphira were beyond question supernaturally inflicted by Peter, speaking in the power of the Holy Spirit. This is the only honest interpretation of the incident."
2. "We surely need not require any justification for this judicial sentence of the Apostle, filling as he did at this time the highest place in the church, and acting under the immediate prompting of the Holy Spirit."
3. "If such, however, be sought, we may remember that this was the first attempt made by Satan to obtain, by hypocrisy, a footing among Christ's flock: and that however, for wise reasons, this may since then have been permitted, it was absolutely necessary in the infancy of the church, that such attempt should be at once, and with severity, defeated."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Ananias . . . gave up the ghost . . . great fear came on all that heard these things—on those without the Christian circle; who, instead of disparaging the followers of the Lord Jesus, as they might otherwise have done on the discovery of such hypocrisy, were awed at the manifest presence of Divinity among them."
2. "The mysterious power of throwing off such corrupt matter which rested upon the young Church."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Seeing that his guilt was known, and being charged with the enormous crime of attempting to deceive God."
2. "The sin was one of great aggravation. It was suddenly and unexpectedly detected. The fact that it was known, and the solemn charge that he had 'lied unto God,' struck him with horror."
3. "Sudden death always does it; but sudden death in immediate connection with crime is suited much more deeply to affect the mind."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Gave up the ghost [εξεψυξε] . Used by Luke only. A rare word, occurring in the Septuagint, and in medical writers."
2. "See Ezekiel 21:7, 'Every spirit shall faint.'"
3. "See, also, on failing, Luke 21:26."

### John Calvin:
1. "The death of Ananias doth, indeed, declare and prove the force of the word, which Paul cloth highly extol; to wit, that it is the savor of death unto death to those which perish."
2. "When we hear this, let the threatenings of the gospel terrify us, and humble us in time, lest we also feel the like effect."
3. "And there came great fear This was the Lord’s purpose, by punishing one to make the rest afraid, that they might reverently beware of all hypocrisy."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In both instances [the death of Ananias and Sapphira], the end must be regarded as a direct Divine interposition, by which a speedy and terrible punishment was inflicted."
2. "The judgment pronounced and executed upon the unhappy pair has been condemned, now as a needless cruelty on the part of Peter, now as an inexplicable act of Divine revenge."
3. "Had not Ananias and Sapphira 'been cut off from the congregation,' had their gifts been accepted, and they as saints been admitted with respect and admiration into the congregation, a new spirit would have crept into the little Church."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Fell down (πεσων). Second aorist active participle of πιπτω, fell all of a sudden while listening."
2. "Gave up the ghost (εξεψυξεν). First aorist active indicative of εκψυχω, late verb in LXX and Hippocrates, to breathe out, to expire."
3. "It is needless to blame Peter for the death of Ananias. He had brought the end upon himself. It was the judgment of God. Physically the nervous shock could have caused the collapse."

### John Gill:
1. "And Ananias hearing these words... immediately he fell down and gave up the ghost." 
2. "And this was done either by an angel; or rather by an extraordinary gift bestowed on Peter..." 
3. "And great fear came upon all them that heard these things; both upon the members of the church, and so was of service to make them careful of their words and actions..."

### John Wesley:
1. "And Ananias fell down and expired... this severity was not only just, considering that complication of vain glory, covetousness, fraud, and impiety, which this action contained."
2. "It was likewise a convincing proof of the upright conduct of the apostles, in managing the sums with which they were intrusted; and in general of their Divine mission."
3. "For none can imagine that Peter would have had the assurance to pronounce, and much less the power to execute such a sentence, if he had been guilty himself of a fraud of the same kind; or had been belying the Holy Ghost in the whole of his pretensions to be under his immediate direction."
