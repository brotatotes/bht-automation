# Acts 5:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The young men of the church, who were active and willing to serve, quickly responded to the need to take care of the situation at hand. They wrapped Ananias in linen cloths, following the Jewish custom for burial. Since the Jewish practice was to bury before sunset on the same day, there was a sense of urgency to complete the burial promptly. This efficient and respectful handling of the situation shows the order and reverence that characterized the early Christian community.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We can hardly assume, as yet, any such official distinctions in the congregation as would mark off οἱ νεώτεροι from οἱ πρεσβύτεροι, which latter are first officially mentioned ch. Acts 11:30."
2. "And the use of οἱ νεανίσκοι in Acts 5:10, as applying to these same persons, seems to decide that they were merely the younger members of the church, acting perhaps in accordance with Jewish custom, perhaps also on some hint given by Peter."
3. "The speedy burial of the dead, practised among the later Jews, was unknown in earlier times, see Genesis 23:0. It was grounded on Numbers 19:11 ff. The practice was to bury before sunset of the same day. The immediate burial in this case adds to the probability that the young men obeyed an intimation from the Apostle."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The young men - some of the younger and more active members of the church, not as office-bearers, nor coming forward now for the first time, but who probably had already volunteered their services in making subordinate arrangements."
2. "In every thriving Christian community such volunteers may be expected, and will be found eminently useful."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The fact that they took up Ananias voluntarily implies that they were accustomed to perform offices of servitude to the congregation."
2. "It was the usual custom with the Jews to wind the body in many folds of linen before it was buried; commonly also with spices, to preserve it from putrefaction."
3. "There might have been some danger of an excitement and tumult in regard to this scene if the corpse had not soon been removed; and as no valuable purpose could be answered by delaying the burial, the body was decently committed to the dust."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The verb means to draw together, or draw in; hence used for shortening sail, reducing expenses, lowering or humbling a person."
2. "In the sense of wrapping up it is found in Aristophanes, of wrapping cloaks or garments about one; also of tucking up the garments about the loins, as a preparation for service."
3. "In medical language, of bandaging a limb; of the contraction of tumors, and of organs of the body, etc."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The earliest Christian worship was modelled upon the synagogue, with such modifications as the position held by the apostles and perhaps the ‘seventy’ would require."
2. "The prompt and orderly acts which followed immediately upon the terrible event just discussed all point to a simple order and discipline reigning from the first among the new congregations."
3. "In the East the usual custom is only to allow a few hours’ interval between death and burial."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The young men...same as νεανισκο in verse Acts 5:10 and so no order in the young church." 
2. "Perhaps these young men were acting as ushers or actual pallbearers...to wrap with bandages, to enshroud as here."
3. "The time for burial was short in Jerusalem for sanitary reasons and to avoid ceremonial defilement."

### John Gill:
1. "The younger brethren of the church, who were robust, and strong, and fit for the following service: these rose up from their seats at once, not willing that such an awful spectacle should lie long before them."
2. "They wound him up in linen clothes, as was the manner of the Jews."
3. "The burying places of the Jews were without the city: and buried him; which was all done in a very short time, as appears by what follows."
