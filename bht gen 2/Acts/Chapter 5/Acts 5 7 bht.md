# Acts 5:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During the course of three hours, a significant amount of time had passed. The delay in burying Ananias gave Sapphira additional time to reflect on her actions and potentially rethink her involvement in her husband's deceit. This interval provided an opportunity for her to reconsider her decision and possibly seek forgiveness.
