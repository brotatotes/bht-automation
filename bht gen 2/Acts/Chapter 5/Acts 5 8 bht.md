# Acts 5:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The woman's entrance into the assembly of the saints was like a speech, conveying a falsehood. She may have been inquiring about her husband, using a common way of speaking among the Jews. The amount of money she claimed to have sold the land for was the exact sum that Ananias had brought, which the historian did not explicitly mention. Her steadfast commitment to this deceitful act exposed her lack of repentance and fear of God. Her story serves as a reminder that God thoroughly tests matters before sending judgment upon the obstinate and unrepentant.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
