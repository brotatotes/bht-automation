# Acts 6:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The early church faced divisions and tensions that disrupted the unity and care within the community. The Grecians, Greek-speaking Jews from various backgrounds, clashed with the Hebrews, native Jews who viewed themselves as superior. The distribution of aid to widows became a source of contention, revealing a need for a fair and organized system. The apostles, desiring to maintain their focus on ministry, delegated this responsibility to laymen to ensure transparency and prevent any suspicion of dishonesty. Despite the challenges, the increase in disciples demonstrated that God's work was flourishing amidst these difficulties.

2. "The Hebrews were the pure Jews, not necessarily resident in Palestine, nor necessarily of unmixed Jewish descent, else the ἐξ Ἑβρ. would hardly have been an additional distinction, but rather distinguished by language, as speaking the Syro-Chaldaic and using the Hebrew Scriptures."
3. "Those poor who could attend for themselves and represent their case were served: but the widows, who required more searching out at their own houses, were overlooked."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was better to defer the appointment until an occasion should occur when it would appear to be manifestly necessary and proper."
2. "When the church was small, its alms could be distributed by the apostles themselves without difficulty."
3. "The distribution might give rise to contentions, it was necessary that this matter should be entrusted to the hands of 'laymen,' and that the 'ministry' should be freed from all embarrassment, and all suspicions of dishonesty and unfairness in regard to pecuniary matters."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The present participle indicating something in progress."

2. "The distinction between the Grecians and the Hebrews was not one of nationality, but of language."
3. "There is no doubt that the real cause of these ‘murmurings’ which disturbed the peace of the early Church, must be sought for in the jealousy which always existed between the Jews who, with the ancient language, had preserved more rigidly the old customs and tone of Hebrew thought, and the Grecian or foreign Jews who, with the Greek language, had adopted broader and less rigid views generally."
