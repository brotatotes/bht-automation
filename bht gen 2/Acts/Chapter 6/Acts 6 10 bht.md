# Acts 6:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Stephen's wisdom and the spirit by which he spoke were both irresistible. His arguments were unanswerable and his sincerity and zeal were evident to all. Even though his opponents tried to stand against him, they were no match for his deep knowledge of divine things and the powerful words he spoke with the guidance of the Holy Spirit. The Jewish leaders tried to incite the people against him, but Stephen fearlessly continued to proclaim the truths of Scripture, leaving them in a desperate situation.
