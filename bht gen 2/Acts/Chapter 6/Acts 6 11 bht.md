# Acts 6:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Stephen's opponents resorted to false accusations, subtly manipulating others to bring forth misleading testimonies against him. These accusations centered around Stephen's proclamation of the imminent end of the Mosaic system and the transitory nature of the law and the temple. By claiming that Stephen's teachings were blasphemous, the accusers sought to incense the Jewish people and enhance their own standing in defending Jewish rights and privileges. However, in truth, Stephen was merely expressing the changing nature of God's plan and the fulfillment of the old covenant through the new covenant in Christ.
