# Acts 6:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Stephen was falsely accused of blasphemous words against Moses and God. The witnesses took his words out of context and misrepresented his arguments. Although Stephen may have used words similar to those he was charged with uttering, there is no evidence that he intended to blaspheme Moses or speak reproachfully. These false accusations were likely artfully invented to incite anger among the people. The Jews were particularly sensitive about any perceived criticism of the temple and the law, so any mention of their destruction or cessation could be twisted into blasphemy.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The falsehood of their witness consisted, as in the similar case of our Lord, in taking Stephen’s words out of their context, and misrepresenting what perhaps, totidem verbis, he had actually said."
2. "The temple, see reff."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They accused him of 'blasphemy'; that is, of calumnious and reproachful words against Moses and against God. That Stephen had spoken in such a manner, or had designed to 'reproach' Moses, there is no evidence. What was said in the mildest manner, and in the way of cool argument, might easily be perverted so as in 'their view' to amount to blasphemy."
2. "The probability therefore is, that the whole testimony was 'false,' and was artfully invented to produce the utmost exasperation among the people, and yet was at the same time so plausible as to be easily believed."
3. "For on this point the Jews were particularly sensitive; and it is clear that they had some expectations that the Messiah would produce some such changes."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Stephen seems to have used in his arguments words not very dissimilar from those which he was charged with uttering."
2. "These witnesses, even perhaps quoting before the Sanhedrim the very words used by the eloquent Nazarene teacher, took them out of their original context, distorted them, and evidently represented him as unceasingly assailing the Temple and the holy Jewish rites."
3. "The procedure of these jealous and angry Jews who suborned the false witnesses is curious, and deserves special notice."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "False witnesses (μαρτυρας ψευδεις). Just as Caiaphas did with Jesus."
2. "Ceaseth not (ου παυετα). Wild charge just like a false witness that Stephen talks in the synagogues against the law and the holy temple."

### John Gill:
1. "Stephen was continually telling the people, that in a little time their temple would be destroyed, and an end be put to temple worship, and to all the rituals and ceremonies of the law of Moses."
2. "Speaking against the temple and the law was sufficient to make good a charge of blasphemy."
