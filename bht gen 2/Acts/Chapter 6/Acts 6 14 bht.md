# Acts 6:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy, meaning the temple, as the Ethiopic version renders it, and change the customs which Moses delivered. This claim by the people against Jesus is not unfounded, as the Jews themselves acknowledge that in the days of the Messiah, all sacrifices shall cease. However, it is important to note that false accusations and misconceptions often surround the teachings of the gospel. It is easy for the doctrine to be subject to misinterpretation and for it to be handled warily and moderately. Nonetheless, we should not be surprised, for it has always been the case.
