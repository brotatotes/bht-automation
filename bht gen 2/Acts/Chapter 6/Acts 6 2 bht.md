# Acts 6:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the early Church, the main focus of apostles, evangelists, and bishops was to preach the word of God. However, they also had the responsibility to care for the physical needs of the community, particularly the poor, strangers, and widows. While preaching was their primary duty, they recognized the importance of providing food for those in need. It is worth noting that when they later preached the Gospel, it was not as deacons, but through a separate commission as evangelists.

### Henry Alford:
1. "It is not our pleasure... defending this rendering by ἀρεστόν being used in the LXX for the Heb. טוֹב: but even there it never signifies good or right absolutely, but is used subjectively, with בְּעֵינָיִךְ, 'in thine eyes.'" 
2. "For to this it would come, if the Apostles were to inquire into, and do justice in, every case of asserted neglect."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is a point of prudence and godly carefulness, in that they prevent the evil which began to arise, without deferring the remedy."
2. "For it is as if they should say, If thou wilt enjoy our ministry in the preaching of the gospel, deliver us from the charge of the poor, because we are not able to do both."
3. "Therefore, forasmuch as the apostles prefer the preaching of the gospel, we gather thereby that no obedience is more acceptable to God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This business of feeding the poor was probably delegated to others in an informal manner, and the feelings set out at some length above, seem to have had their influence in the division of alms and food among the widows and helpless poor of the more despised class; hence the murmuring." 
2. "The apostles seem at once to have acknowledged the justice of the remonstrance; they agree amongst themselves that an immediate change in their way of administration is necessary, and determine at once upon a formal division of labour."
3. "Without making any pretensions to authority, or suggesting the names of men to be chosen as their assistant ministers, they summon a meeting of the whole Church, and after explaining the case leave the decision with the assembled brethren."

3. "Present active infinitive of διακονεω from διακονος (δια and κονις, dust), to raise a dust in a hurry, to serve, to minister either at table (John 12:20), or other service (John 12:25), to serve as deacon (1 Timothy 3:10; 1 Timothy 3:13)."

### John Gill:
1. "it is not pleasing, neither to God, nor to us; nor could it be pleasing to the church itself: that we should leave the word of God..."
2. "the care of the poor taking up more of their time, than the work of the ministry, or preaching of the Gospel would admit of; and therefore thought it not so right and proper, or so acceptable a thing to God and man..."
3. "From hence we learn what is the business of deacons, who were afterwards appointed to take this part of the apostles' work off of their hands, and attend to it; which is to serve tables..."

### John Wesley:
1. "In the first Church, the primary business of apostles, evangelists, and bishops, was to preach the word of God; the secondary, to take a kind of paternal care for the food, especially of the poor, the strangers, and the widows."
2. "But their proper office was, to take care of the poor."
3. "And when some of them afterward preached the Gospel, they did this not by virtue of their deaconship, but of another commission, that of evangelists."
