# Acts 6:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The selection of deacons is an important task entrusted to the church. They are to be individuals of good reputation, recognized for their integrity. They must also be filled with the Holy Spirit and wisdom, as they will be responsible for the proper management of the Church's resources. The apostles themselves sought the input of the congregation in choosing these officers, demonstrating the importance of working in unity with the church. This selection process ensures that those appointed to this role can serve with impartiality and effectiveness in carrying out their responsibilities.
