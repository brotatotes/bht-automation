# Acts 6:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostles were determined to make prayer and preaching the central focus of their ministry. They recognized that prayer was essential in seeking God's blessings and guidance for their work, both privately and in public settings. The ministry of the word, specifically the preaching of the Gospel, was inextricably linked to prayer and held utmost importance in their calling. These two aspects, prayer and preaching, were not occasional duties, but rather continuous and wholehearted commitments that characterized the apostles' ministry.
