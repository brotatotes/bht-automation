# Acts 6:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The early church had the wisdom to appoint seven Hellenists to the important task of caring for the widows, which was well-received by the entire congregation. Among these chosen individuals was Stephen, a man of strong faith, boldness, and loyalty to Christ. Another selected deacon, Nicolas, was a proselyte who had converted to Judaism and later embraced Christianity. This diverse group of deacons, including both Greek and Gentile backgrounds, was chosen with great intentionality and wisdom to serve the needs of the growing church community.
