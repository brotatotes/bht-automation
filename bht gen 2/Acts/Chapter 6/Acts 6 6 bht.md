# Acts 6:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The act of laying on of hands during ordination is a significant symbol of consecration and a prayer for God's blessing. It was a solemn way for the apostles to ordain and install the candidates, signifying the authority received from God. This practice, borrowed from Jewish tradition, was used to confer gifts and blessings. However, it is important to understand that the laying on of hands itself did not grant power or ability; rather, it served as a sign of the authority and commission received through prayer and the work of the Holy Spirit.
