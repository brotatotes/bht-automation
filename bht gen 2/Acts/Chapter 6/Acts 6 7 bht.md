# Acts 6:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As the church faced conflicts and opposition, it remained united and continued to flourish. The Word of God not only thrived but spread further, despite attempts to divide and destroy it. The growing number of converts, including priests themselves, is a testament to the power of God's grace. The faith, or belief in the gospel, played a significant role in the church's growth. Through it all, God orchestrated these events to work together for the good of the church and the advancement of His kingdom.

3. "This arrays against it that powerful and zealous sect, and henceforward it finds neither favour nor tolerance with either of the parties among the Jews, but increasing and bitter enmity from them both."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Note (1) how easily misunderstandings may arise among the most loving and devoted followers of the Lord Jesus: but (2) How quickly and effectually such misunderstandings may be healed, where honest intentions, love, and wisdom reign:"
2. "What a beautiful model for imitation is furnished by the class here complained of, who, though themselves the majority, chose the new office-bearers from amongst the complaining minority!"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In the great majority of New Testament passages faith is clearly used in the sense of faith in Jesus Christ: 'the conviction and confidence regarding Jesus Christ as the only and perfect mediator of the divine grace and of eternal life, through his work of atonement' (Meyer)."
2. "Accordingly, faith, though it becomes in man the subjective moral power of the new life, regenerated through the power of the Spirit, is regarded objectively as a power - the authority which commands submission."
3. "This interpretation is according to the analogy of the expression hearing of faith (Galatians 3:2), which is to be rendered, not as equivalent to the reception of the Gospel, but as the report or message of faith; i.e., which treats of faith."

### John Calvin:
1. "Luke setteth forth again the increasing of the Church, to the end he may the better declare the power of God and his grace in the continual going forward thereof."
2. "This was an excellent work of God that the Church should suddenly, and, as it were, in a moment, be raised up; but this is worthy no less admiration, in that he furthereth that work which he had begun amidst so many lets, in that the number of these is increased, whom to diminish, and so, consequently, to destroy the whole stock, the world doth so greatly labor."
3. "In that he saith that the Word of God did grow, his meaning is, that it was spread further abroad."

2. "The instances of conversion were very numerous; how large must this church now be!"
