### Henry Alford:
1. "The power was perhaps conferred by the laying on of the Apostles’ hands; though, that having been for a special purpose merely, and the working miracles being a fulfilment of the promise, Mark 16:17-18, to all believers, I should rather refer the power to the eminence of Stephen’s faith."
2. "χάριτος, divine grace (not ‘favour with the people’): the effects of which, the miracles, were called χαρίσματα."
