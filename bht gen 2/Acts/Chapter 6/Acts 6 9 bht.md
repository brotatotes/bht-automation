# Acts 6:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Stephen started preaching Jesus as the Messiah to the Hellenists, he faced opposition from a synagogue that consisted of various nationalities, including those whose ancestors had been slaves but were later freed. Some members of this synagogue, including Saul from Cilicia and possibly under Gamaliel's leadership, disputed with Stephen about his teachings and the authority behind his miracles. They were filled with indignation and envy towards Stephen, leading them to fiercely oppose him.
