# Acts 7:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God graciously rescued Joseph from all the trials and hardships he faced and caused him to find favor and wisdom in the eyes of Pharaoh, the ruler of Egypt. Joseph's wisdom and God's favor led the king to hold him in high regard. Joseph attributes his wisdom not to his own abilities, but acknowledges that it is a gift from the Lord. Such humility is admirable, especially considering the great position of authority and influence that Joseph held in the kingdom of Egypt.
