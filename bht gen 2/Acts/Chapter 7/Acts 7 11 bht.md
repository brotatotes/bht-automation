# Acts 7:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During the time of the dearth or famine mentioned in Genesis 41:54, there was a scarcity of food not only in Egypt and Canaan, but also in other lands. Jacob and his family, who were living in Canaan, were unable to find sufficient sustenance and had to travel to Egypt for provision. This episode highlights the free goodness of God, as it is through Joseph, who was sold by his own brothers, that their nourishment is ultimately provided. The term sustenance refers to the essential fodder needed for their livestock, emphasizing the dire need for resources during that time.
