# Acts 7:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Seventy-five souls were counted, including the descendants of Joseph and Jacob, according to the Septuagint version followed by Stephen. Although there seems to be a discrepancy with Moses, it is important to focus on the miracle that the Spirit is showing us here, rather than getting caught up in the exact number. This account of Divine favor serves as a powerful reminder of how God blessed and multiplied the people.
