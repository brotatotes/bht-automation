# Acts 7:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our fathers, including Jacob, went to Egypt and died there, and their bones were brought over to Shechem and buried in the sepulcher that Abraham had bought. This was a common Hebrew way of speaking, where the speaker would mention only part of the story and leave the rest to be understood by the hearer. The land that was bought by these strangers was not for residence but for a burial place, emphasizing their longing for a heavenly country.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The facts, as related in the O. T., were these: Jacob, dying in Egypt, was (Gen 50:13) taken into the land of Canaan, and buried in the cave of Machpelah, before Mamre...Joseph, dying also in Egypt, was taken in a coffin (Gen 50:26) at the Exodus (Exo 13:19), and finally buried (Jos 24:32) at Shechem." 
2. "The burying-place which Abraham bought was not at Sychem, but (Gen 23:3-20) at Hebron, and was bought of Ephron the Hittite...The two incidents are certainly here confused."
3. "The fact of the mistake occurring where it does, will be far more instructive to the Christian student than the most ingenious solution of the difficulty could be, if it teaches him fearlessly and honestly to recognize the phænomena presented by the text of Scripture, instead of wresting them to suit a preconceived theory."

### John Calvin:
1. "Stephen saith, that the patriarchs were carried into the land of Canaan after they were dead."
2. "Moses speaketh of Joseph for honor’s sake, because he had given express commandment concerning his bones, which we cannot read to have been done of the rest."
3. "I can affirm nothing concerning this matter for a certainty, save only that this is either a speech wherein is synecdoche, or else that Luke rehearseth this not so much out of Moses, as according to the old fame."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The O.T. does not say where the sons of Jacob were buried save that Joseph was buried in Shechem."
2. "If 'Jacob' is substituted for 'Abraham,' the matter is cleared up."
3. "Abraham had built an altar at Shechem when he entered Canaan."

### John Gill:
1. "Joseph and the rest of the patriarchs, who died in Egypt, when the children of Israel came out from thence, they brought their bones along with them, and buried them in Sichem."
2. "The words refer to both places and purchases; to the field of Machpelah bought by Abraham, and to the parcel of field in Sichem bought by Jacob."
3. "This agrees with Stephen's account and design, in the preceding verse; he observes, that Jacob died in Egypt, and all the twelve patriarchs; and here he tells us how they were disposed of, and where they were buried, both Jacob and his sons."

### John Wesley:
1. "This concise manner of speaking, strange as it seems to us, was common among the Hebrews; particularly, when in a case notoriously known, the speaker mentioned but part of the story, and left the rest, which would have interrupted the current of his discourse, to be supplied in the mind of the hearer."
2. "The first land which these strangers bought was for a sepulchre. They sought for a country in heaven."
3. "So Jacob went down into Egypt and died, he and our fathers, and were carried over to Shechem, and laid by the sons (that is, descendants) of Hamor, the father of Shechem, in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money."
