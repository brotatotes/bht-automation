# Acts 7:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The arrival of a new king marked a shift in power, with a different dynasty taking control. This king, unfamiliar with Joseph and his significant deeds, showed no appreciation for his contributions to Egypt. In fact, he seemed to purposefully ignore Joseph's accomplishments, potentially as a way of disrespecting the Hebrew people.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "The 'common' name of all the kings of Egypt was 'Pharaoh,' as 'Caesar' became the common name of the emperors of Rome after the time of Julius Caesar."
2. "It can hardly be supposed that he would be ignorant of the name and deeds of Joseph; and this expression, therefore, probably means that he did not favor the designs of Joseph."
3. "National ingratitude has not been uncommon in the world, and a change of dynasty has often obliterated all memory of former obligations and compacts."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Another [ŒµœÑŒµœÅŒøœÇ]. Not merely a successor, but a monarch of a different character."
2. "Knew not. As sixty years had elapsed since Joseph's death, and a new dynasty was coming to the throne, this may be taken literally: did not know his history and services."
3. "Some explain, did not recognize his merits."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This new king was Amasis or Ahmes, the first of the eighteenth dynasty, or that of the Diospolitans from Thebes."
2. "It is probable that this oppressor of the Hebrews was the first native prince who reigned after the expulsion of the Hyksos or shepherd kings."
3. "The expulsion of these Hyksos seems connected in some way with the bitter hatred with which the Hebrews were now regarded in the land."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A different kind of king also, probably a king of the new dynasty after the shepherd kings had been expelled from Egypt." 
2. "Joseph's history and services meant nothing to the new king." 
3. "The previous dynasty had been that of the Hyksos: the new king was Ahmes who drove out the Hyksos."

### John Gill:
1. "The Jews call him Talma e and by Theophilus of Antioch f he is called Tethmosis; and by Artapanus g, Palmanotha: 'which knew not Joseph'; nor what great things he had done, to the advantage of the Egyptian nation."
2. "Aben Ezra says, he was not of the seed royal; wherefore it is written, 'and there arose'; he the kingdom, and had not a just right and title so that being a stranger, it is no wonder that he should not know Joseph."
3. "Jarchi's note is,'he made himself as if he did not know him'he dissembled, he pretended ignorance of him, because he would show no respect unto his people."

### John Wesley:
