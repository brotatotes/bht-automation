# Acts 7:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The king of Egypt used deceitful and cruel tactics to subdue the Hebrews and oppress them. He devised wicked schemes to continuously burden them and turn them into slaves. In his cunning, he even commanded that the newborn sons of the Israelites be cast out to perish. His intention was to diminish and eliminate the children of Israel, so they would never grow up to challenge his oppressive rule. However, the Israelites fought against this injustice, resisting the evil commands and preserving the lives of their children.
