## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The words τῷ πατρὶ ἡμῶν decide nothing as to Stephen’s genuine Hebrew extraction." 
2. "This was the Jewish tradition, though not asserted in Genesis."
3. "But we can hardly suppose that Stephen adopted the pluperfect rendering of וַיֹּאמֶר in Genesis 12:1."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The God of glory—A magnificent appellation, fitted at the very outset to rivet the devout attention of his audience; denoting not that visible glory which attended many of the divine manifestations, but the glory of those manifestations themselves..." 
2. "It is the glory of absolutely free grace."
3. "Though this first call is not expressly recorded in Genesis, it is clearly implied in Genesis 15:7 Nehemiah 9:7; and the Jewish writers speak the same language."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Men, brethren, and fathers - These were the usual titles by which the Sanhedrin was addressed. In all this Stephen was perfectly respectful, and showed that he was disposed to render due honor to the institutions of the nation."
2. "The God of glory - This is a Hebrew form of expression denoting 'the glorious God.' It properly denotes His 'majesty, or splendor, or magnificence'; and the word 'glory' is often applied to the splendid appearances in which God has manifested Himself to people."
3. "The expression was therefore well calculated to conciliate their minds.When he was in Mesopotamia - In Genesis 11:31, it is said that Abraham dwelt 'in Ur of the Chaldees.' The word 'Mesopotamia' properly denotes the region between the two rivers, the Euphrates and the Tigris."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Brethren. Addressing the audience generally. Fathers. Addressing the members of the Sanhedrim. Of glory. Outward, visible glory, as in the shekinah and the pillar of fire. Appeared [ωφθη] . See on Luke 22:43.

3. "It is well known that that is called by this name which lieth between the river Tigris and Euphrates; and he saith before, he dwelt in Charran, because Abraham, being warned by an oracle, fled from Chaldea to Charran."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham."
2. "It was the God whose visible symbol was that glory so well known by every child of Israel, who appeared to Abraham, the father of the race."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

### John Gill:
1. "He calls them men, brethren, by an usual Hebraism, that is, 'brethren'; and that, because they were of the same nation."
