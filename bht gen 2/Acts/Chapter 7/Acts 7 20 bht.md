# Acts 7:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Moses was born during a period of great hardship and suffering. It was a time when the Israelites were deeply oppressed. Despite the challenging circumstances, Moses was born as a beacon of hope, a destined deliverer. He was not just an ordinary child, but one who was deemed exceeding fair or divinely beautiful. His birth was not only significant for his people but also held special meaning for God.
