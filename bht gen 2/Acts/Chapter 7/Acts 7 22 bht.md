## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "That Moses was instructed in the wisdom of the Egyptians, is not found in the O. T., but derived from tradition, and following as a matter of course from his adopted station as the son of Pharaoh’s daughter." 
2. "This wisdom of the Egyptians, celebrated by so many ancient writers, consisted mainly in natural philosophy, medicine, and mathematics, and its teachers were the priests."
3. "So Josephus calls Moses πλήθεσιν ὁμιλεῖν πιθανώτατος, but late in his course, during the journey through the wilderness; when the divine Spirit, as the book of Deuteronomy abundantly testifies, had turned his ‘slowness of speech’ into the most fervid eloquence."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Though defective in utterance, his recorded speeches fully bear out what is here said."
2. "Referring probably to unrecorded circumstances in his early life."
3. "If we are to believe JOSEPHUS, his ability was acknowledged ere he left Egypt."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Moses was learned - Or, was 'instructed.' It does not mean that he had that learning, but that he was carefully 'trained' or educated in that wisdom."
2. "Their learning is not infrequently spoken of in the Scriptures... Their knowledge is equally celebrated in the pagan world."
3. "When it is said that he was mighty in words, it means that he was mighty in his communications to Pharaoh, though they were spoken by his brother Aaron."

### John Calvin:
1. "Because God had determined to redeem his people, he doth, in the mean season, frame both the mind of Moses and all other things to finish his work."
2. "The end itself is so wonderful, that we are enforced to confess that all these things were governed by singular counsel and order to set forth the glory of God."
3. "Surely this was excellent modesty, in that he which could reason with learned and witty men of the secrets of nature, doth not only omit higher subtleties, but doth also descend unto the common capacity of every most simple man."


### Philip Schaff:
1. "The statement of Stephen respecting the learning of Moses is not derived from any Old Testament source, but solely from those Jewish traditions we have so often alluded to as used in this speech, and which were evidently authoritative in their time."
