# Acts 7:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Moses, according to tradition, was forty years old when he decided to deliver his people from bondage. During the earlier years of his life, he had lived in the palace of Pharaoh, seemingly detached from the suffering of the Israelites. However, at this moment, God stirred his heart to visit his brethren and witness their plight. This internal prompting was a result of a new and unexpected movement of the Spirit. It seems that Moses, previously ignorant or unmindful of his true heritage, now felt a deep connection to his people and a divine calling to set them free.
