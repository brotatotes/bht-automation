# Acts 7:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Moses, upon witnessing an act of oppression, took it upon himself to defend the oppressed Hebrew from the blows of the Egyptian.

This daring act of protecting and avenging the oppressed was fueled by the empowerment of God's Spirit, as He equips individuals for the fulfillment of their significant roles. Word of this incident quickly spread among the Hebrews, even though Moses attempted to conceal the evidence of his actions in the camp.
