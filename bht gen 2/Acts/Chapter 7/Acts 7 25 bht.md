# Acts 7:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Moses took action against the Egyptian oppressor, he hoped that his own people would understand his intentions. He believed they would recognize him as a chosen leader and deliverer. However, his brethren misunderstood him and failed to grasp the significance of his actions. This recurring pattern of misunderstanding God's purposes and plans is evident throughout the history of the chosen people. Stephen's words convey a sense of disappointment and reproach as he highlights their consistent failure to comprehend the ways of their God.
