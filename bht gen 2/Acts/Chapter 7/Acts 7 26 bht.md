### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Appeared [ωφθη] . With the suggestion of a sudden appearance as in a vision; possibly with the underlying notion of a messenger of God."

### John Calvin:
1. "So the wickedness of men doth oftentimes hinder God from doing that [which] he would do."
2. "Men ye are brethren. There is, indeed, amongst men a general conjunction, so that they ought to use great courtesy one toward another, and to abstain from all injuries; but this is more unmeet and intolerable, when those hurt one another who are nearer linked together."
3. "Furthermore, we are taught by this example, that the servants of God cannot so do their duty in reproving such vices of men, but they shall suffer many injuries, offend many, and incur dangers; and chiefly when they do well, they shall surely hear evil."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The day following (τη επιουση ημερα). Locative case, 'on the following day.'"

### John Gill:
1. "The Hebrew man (that had been abused) went to his house to divorce his wife, who was defiled, but she fled and told the affair to Abiram her brother: and on the morrow, Moses returned a second time to the Hebrew camp, and found Dathan and Abiram contending about the divorce."
2. "Saying, sirs, ye are brethren; as Abraham said to Lot, when there was a strife between their herdsmen, Genesis 13:8 and if these two were Dathan and Abiram, they were brethren in the strictest sense, Numbers 16:1"
3. "Why do ye wrong one to another? by abusing each other, calling ill names, or striking one another; or by lifting up the hand to strike, as Jonathan the Targumist says Dathan did against Abiram."
