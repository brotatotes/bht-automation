# Acts 7:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The rejection Moses faced from his fellow Israelites mirrors the resistance shown by their ancestors towards the promptings of the Spirit. Despite his divine calling and deep love for his people, Moses's attempts to reconcile with them and bring about liberation were met with rejection and hostility. This pattern of resistance can be seen throughout Israel's history. The rejection of Moses was fueled by the memory of his past actions and doubts about his suitability as a leader. This highlights the challenge of reconciliation when it is the wrongdoer who struggles to find acceptance.
