# Acts 7:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Moses, questioning the intentions of the one who confronted him about his killing of the Egyptian the day prior, asks, Wilt thou kill me, as thou didst the Egyptian yesterday? This inquiry suggests Moses' uncertainty about whether this person's purpose is to harm him, reflecting on the fact that he had thought his actions went unnoticed. The remark Is it thy will? dost thou design to kill me? further expresses his unease. Interestingly, the mention of yesterday in relation to the incident is notably accurate, as Stephen later quotes Exodus 2:14.
