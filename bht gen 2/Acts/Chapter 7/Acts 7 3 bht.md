# Acts 7:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Abraham's journey serves as a symbol of the saints' calling to leave behind their old lives and follow Christ wherever He leads them. In this journey, Abraham did not know where he was going, demonstrating his faith and trust in God's guidance. This parallels our own journey as believers, where we may not know the exact destination, but we trust that God will safely bring us to the heavenly country He has prepared for us.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was an act of 'simple confidence' in God."
2. "He went, therefore, trusting simply to the promise of God. Thus, his conduct illustrated precisely what we are to do in reference to all our coming life, and to the eternity before us: We are to trust simply to the promise of God, and do what he requires. This is faith."
3. "To act under the proper impression of that truth which God presents is faith; as simple and intelligible as any other act or operation of the mind."
