# Acts 7:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Moses led his flock to the Sinaean mountain, which was known for its abundance of good pasture and considered a dwelling place of the Divine Being. It was unused by the shepherds before, out of fear and reverence. There, an angel of the Lord appeared to Moses, who was none other than the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This angel, who referred to himself as Jehovah, manifested in a flame of fire, symbolizing the majestic presence of God.
