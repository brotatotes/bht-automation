# Acts 7:31 Commentary Help Text

The sight of a bush on fire, yet not consumed, was extraordinary and a clear sign of God's presence. The appearance of an angel or even the Lord Himself in this burning bush added to the wonder and amazement of the moment. Moses, struck with admiration and curiosity, drew nearer but was also filled with a sense of fear and trembling. This incredible phenomenon not only revealed God's majesty, but also imparted a deeper understanding of His power and presence. It is a powerful reminder of God's ability to reveal Himself in unexpected and awe-inspiring ways.
