# Acts 7:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The declaration, Saying, I am the God of thy fathers...the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob... is not merely a historical reference, but a significant affirmation that supports the doctrine of resurrection. By stating that He is the God of the living, not the dead, God establishes the basis for believing in life after death. It is worth noting that Moses trembled at this revelation, as attested to by both tradition and the book of Hebrews, illustrating the profound awe and reverence that should accompany the reception of God's commandments.
