# Acts 7:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Loose thy shoes was a sign of reverence in ancient times, a way of showing humility and respect. The holiness of certain places, like the ground near the burning bush, was not inherent but derived from the presence of God. Therefore, it was essential to comply with such customs and acknowledge the sacredness of the space out of reverence for the divine presence.
