# Acts 7:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The rejected Moses, whom they refused, was sent by God as a ruler and a deliverer. Though the Israelites scorned him, God exalted him to be their leader. Moses foreshadowed the Messiah, Jesus Christ, who would deliver people from the bondage of sin. Like Moses, Jesus was despised but was made Lord and Christ, exalted as a Prince and Saviour. It is noteworthy that Moses was sent by the angel, who was none other than the Son of God, fulfilling his role as the mediator between God and man.

### Marvin Vincent:
