# Acts 7:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God delivered the Israelites from Egypt and displayed His power through wonders and signs. The ten plagues and the parting of the Red Sea are notable examples of His miraculous intervention. The Red Sea is named after Erythrus (Esau), its previous owner. Through these extraordinary events, God demonstrated His faithfulness and love for His chosen people. Despite the Israelites' initial resistance to Joseph and Moses, God used them as instruments of deliverance. These acts of deliverance affirm the absurdity of any accusation of blasphemy against the God whom Stephen greatly admired and loved.

2. "Thus, each of the first two epochs into which Stephen had divided Israelâ€™s eventful story, in spite of the stubborn hard heart of their forefathers in rejecting (a) Joseph, (b) Moses, had ended in their being delivered by their Divine Protector (a) By the hand of Joseph, (b) By the hand of Moses, out of all the troubles and afflictions which surrounded them."

2. "and in the Red sea; by dividing the waters of it, so that the people of Israel went through it as on dry ground, which Pharaoh and his army attempting to do, were drowned."
3. "This sea is called the Red sea, not from the natural colour of the water, which is the same with that of other seas; nor from the appearance of it through the rays of the sun upon it, or the shade of the red mountains near it; but from Erythrus, to whom it formerly belonged, and whose name signifies red; and is no other than Esau, whose name was Edom, which signifies the same."
