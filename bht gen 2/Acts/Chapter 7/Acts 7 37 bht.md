# Acts 7:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Stephen's reference to Moses in Deuteronomy 18:15 serves to emphasize that there is no conflict between Moses and Christ. Moses himself prophesied the coming of a prophet like him, and Stephen points out that Jesus is the fulfillment of this prophecy. By highlighting this, Stephen is not setting up a opposition between Moses and Christ, but rather demonstrating that Moses anticipated the ultimate prophet, who is Jesus.
