# Acts 7:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Moses, the mediator between the Angel of the covenant and our ancestors, was part of the assembly in the wilderness. He faithfully reported the divine commands, also known as the living oracles, to the people. These oracles, specifically the ten commandments, are referred to as living because they have power and bring life to those who receive and apply them. Every word spoken by God to Moses was an oracle, and it is through these words that Moses served as a conduit for God's instruction and will.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "That Moses conversed with both the Angel of the covenant and our fathers, implies that he was the mediator between them." 
2. "ἐκκλησίᾳ probably, the assembly held for the promulgation of the law at Mt. Sinai, not ‘the Church’ generally: but the article does not determine this: it would be expressed, whichever meaning we take."
3. "λόγια ζῶντα living, see reff., not = ζωοποιοῦντα (Grot., Kuin.), 'life-giving:' still less to be understood 'given vivá voce' (Pisc. Alberti)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This is he that was in the church in the wilderness, with the angel . . . and with our fathers—alike near to the Angel of the Covenant, from whom he received all the institutions of the ancient economy, and to the people, to whom he faithfully reported the living oracles and among whom he set up the prescribed institutions."
2. "By this high testimony to Moses, Stephen rebuts the main charge for which he was on trial."


### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word “church” means literally 'the people called out,' and is applied with great propriety to the assembly or multitude called out of Egypt, and separated from the world."
2. "It is clear, therefore, that by 'the angel' here, Stephen intends to designate him who was God."
3. "The word 'lively,' or 'living' ζῶντα zōnta, stands in opposition to what is dead, or useless, and means what is vigorous, efficacious; and in this place it means that the commands were of such a nature, and given in such circumstances, as to secure attention; to produce obedience; to excite them to act for God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Lively. Better, living, as Rev. Compare 1 Peter 2:4, 1 Peter 2:5.

### John Calvin:
1. "It was meet that so many miracles should not only have stuck fast in their minds, but also have continued still before their eyes. But having forgotten all, they fly back suddenly unto the superstitions of Egypt." 
2. "This is a general way to establish doctrine, when men teach nothing but that which is commanded them by God. For what man dare make Moses inferior to him, who (as the Spirit affirmeth) ought only to be believed for this cause, because he faithfully unfolded and delivered the doctrine which he had received of God?" 
3. "Therefore the law hath life in itself. Yet if any man had liefer take living for that which is full of efficacy and strength, I will not greatly stand in contention."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "God's church is not limited to Judæ. It was in the wilderness; and there Moses, your great lawgiver, was with it; and remember he died there in the wilderness, and was never permitted to enter the Promised Land, to which you would restrain the favours of God."
2. "The second special instance of Divine favour was his solitary communing with the great covenant Angel, the Almighty Being who, under the name Jehovah (the Eternal One), chose Israel as His peculiar people."
3. "He it was who, from the Eternal of hosts on Sinai, received that sacred law, those living words, the deathless charge which should endure as long as the world endures."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Moses is here represented as receiving the law from an angel as in Hebrews 2:2; Galatians 3:19 and so was a mediator or middle man between the angel and the people." 
2. "The words from God to Moses are still 'living' today." 
3. "In Romans 3:2 Paul refers to the substance of the law and of prophecy. In Hebrews 5:12 the writer means the substance of the Christian religious teaching."

### John Gill:
1. "God always had, and will have a church, though that is sometimes in the wilderness."
2. "It was a peculiar honor to Moses, that he was in this church, though it was in the wilderness; even a greater honor than to be in Pharaoh's court."
3. "He received from the angel which spake to him the law, to deliver to the children of Israel; which is called 'the oracles', because it came from God, and contained his mind and will, and was a sure and infallible declaration of it."

### John Wesley:
1. "This is he — Moses.With the angel, and with our fathers — As a mediator between them." 
2. "Who received the living oracles — Every period beginning with, And the Lord said unto Moses, is properly an oracle."
3. "But the oracles here intended are chiefly the ten commandments. These are termed living, because all the word of God, applied by his Spirit, is living and powerful, Hebrews 4:12, enlightening the eyes, rejoicing the heart, converting the soul, raising the dead."
