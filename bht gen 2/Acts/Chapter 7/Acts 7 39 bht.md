# Acts 7:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people rejected God's appointed messenger, Moses, and turned back in their hearts to the idolatries of Egypt. They longed for the fleshpots and licentiousness of Egypt, weary of the strict worship of Jehovah. Their disobedience and murmuring against Moses was ultimately against God Himself, rejecting His oracles and guidance. This turning away from God and desire for Egypt foreshadowed their future rebellion and rejection of God's chosen leaders.
