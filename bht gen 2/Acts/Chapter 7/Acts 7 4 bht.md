# Acts 7:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Abraham's complete transition to Canaan followed the death of his father, Terah. There may be discrepancies regarding the timing mentioned in Genesis 11:32, but the focus remains on Abraham's commitment to God's call. Some suggest that Terah's death was mentioned prematurely, while others state that Terah's relapse into idolatry in Haran prompted Abraham's departure. Nevertheless, Abraham's faith is commendable, as he swiftly obeyed God's command and relinquished all ties to his past. His actions exemplify unwavering trust in God's guidance and protection throughout his transformative journey into the land of promise.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It seems evident, that the Jewish chronology, which Stephen follows, was at fault here, owing to the circumstance of Terah‚Äôs death  being mentioned Genesis 11:32 ,  before the command of Abram to leave Haran; it not having been observed that the mention is  anticipatory."
2. "The subterfuge of understanding the  spiritual death of Terah, who is, as a further hypothesis, supposed to have relapsed into idolatry at Haran, appears to have originated with the Rabbis."
3. "It is truly lamentable to see the great Bengel, warped by the unworthy effort of squaring at all hazards, the letter of God‚Äôs word in such matters, write thus: 'Abram, dum Thara vixit in Haran, domum quodammodo paternam habuit in Haran, in terra Canaan duntaxat peregrinum agens; mortuo autem patre, plane in terra Canaan domum unice habere c≈ìpit.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "His settlement in it as the land of promise is here said to be after [his father's death], as being in no way dependent on the family movement, but a transaction purely between Jehovah and Abraham himself."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Errors in ‚Äúnumbers‚Äù are more likely to occur than any other."
2. "It is not affirmed that Abraham was born just at the time when Terah was 70 years of age."
3. "The Jews unanimously affirm that Terah relapsed into idolatry before Abraham left Haran; and this they denominate 'death,' or a moral death (Kuinoel)."

### John Calvin:
1. "The readiness and willingness of faith is commended in these words."
2. "He maketh no delay, but maketh haste and subdueth all his affections."
3. "He does not procrastinate, but breaks off all delay."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A strange interpretation of the expression ‚Äòwas dead,‚Äô has been accepted by some commentators of high reputation."
2. "There is a tradition among the Jews that Terah, the father of Abraham, relapsed into idolatry during the abode at Haran, and that Abraham departed from him on account of this apostasy."
3. "But that the words possess such a mystic sense is most improbable; the plain obvious meaning, in spite of the chronological difficulty which it involves, must be maintained that is, after his father‚Äôs death, Abraham removed into Canaan."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In Genesis 11:32 it is stated that Terah died at Haran at the age of 205. There are various explanations of the discrepancy, but no one that seems certain."
2. "According to this view Terah was 130 years old at the birth of Abraham, leaving Abraham 75 at the death of Terah (205)."
3. "Note also emphatic use of œÖŒºŒµŒπœÇ (ye) and now (ŒΩœÖŒΩ)."

### John Gill:
1. "It was out of Ur, in the land of the Chaldeans particularly, that Abraham came, upon his first call." 
2. "But Philo the Jew is expressly with Stephen in this circumstance; he says 'I think no man versed in the laws can be ignorant, that Abraham, when he first went out of the land of Chaldea, dwelt in Charan; but his father dying there, he removed from thence.'" 
3. "For it was by the order and assistance, and under the direction and protection of God, that he came into that land."

### John Wesley:
1. After his father was dead ‚Äî While Terah lived, Abraham lived partly with him, partly in Canaan: but after he died, altogether in Canaan.
