# Acts 7:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people made a calf, indulging in the sinful practice of idol worship and rejoicing in their own handiwork. This displeased God, causing him to turn away in anger and give them over to idolatry. Despite their many sacrifices, they were not acceptable to God because they did not offer them with a sincere and upright heart, instead sacrificing to idols alongside him.
