# Acts 7:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God, provoked by their rebellion, turned away from them, abandoning them to their own desires. He judicially gave them up to their idolatry as a punishment for their previous sin. Although the Israelites claimed to have made sacrifices to God, they were not genuine or wholehearted in their worship. Instead, they offered sacrifices to devils. These insincere and hypocritical acts went unnoticed by God and were disregarded as if they had never happened.
