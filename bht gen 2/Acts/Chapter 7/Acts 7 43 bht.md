# Acts 7:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Israelites, as a form of idolatry, carried around the tabernacle of the image of Molech, an Ammonite idol to whom children were sacrificed. The idol was likely a hollow image with an ox-head and outstretched arms, in which children were placed and heated from below. Remphan, another idol worshipped by the Israelites, was believed to be the planet Saturn. This idolatry and corruption of worship had been ongoing since the time of their ancestors, and the prophet condemns these figures and external forms of worship, emphasizing that God desires to be worshipped spiritually rather than through visible forms.

### John Calvin:
1. "If I shall rip up from the beginning, (O house of Jacob,) how your kindred hath behaved itself toward me; your fathers began to overthrow and corrupt, even in the wilderness, that worship which I had commanded; but you have far passed their ungodliness, for you have brought in an infinite company of gods."
