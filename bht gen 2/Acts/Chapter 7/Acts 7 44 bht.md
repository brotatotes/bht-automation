# Acts 7:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The tabernacle of witness in the wilderness served as a visible testimony of God's presence and a reminder of His commandments. Its mention emphasizes the severity of the Israelites' sin of idolatry. It warns against deviating from God's prescribed form of worship. The tabernacle, based on a model seen by Moses, underscores the importance of adhering to God's instructions in matters of worship. This serves as a valuable lesson, showing that holiness is not confined to a specific location, but rather, it is through obedience to God's design that worship is truly meaningful.
