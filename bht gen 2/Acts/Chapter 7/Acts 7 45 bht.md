# Acts 7:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The tabernacle, which the Israelites received from their ancestors and brought into the possession of the Gentiles, played a crucial role in their history. It served as a symbol of their covenant with God, guiding them through the wilderness and into the land of Canaan. However, Stephen highlights that God's favor is not limited to the land, as he has always loved righteous individuals in every nation. Conversely, God has never loved the wicked, even within the Promised Land. This emphasizes the importance of righteousness and faithfulness to God, regardless of geographical boundaries.
