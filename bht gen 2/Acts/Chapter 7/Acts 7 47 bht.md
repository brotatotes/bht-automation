# Acts 7:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Solomon, the son of David, was chosen by God to be the builder of the temple despite David's desire and preparations for it. The temple symbolized God's presence amongst His people and served as a reminder that He cannot be confined to man-made structures. It was important to counter the false belief that God was bound solely to the temple and that true worship was limited to physical rituals. Solomon's construction of the temple fulfilled God's promise and demonstrated His ongoing faithfulness. For more detailed information about the temple, refer to 1 Kings 6:1.
