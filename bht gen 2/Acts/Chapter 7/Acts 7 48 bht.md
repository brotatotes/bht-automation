# Acts 7:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The presence of the Most High is not confined in any building, even one as magnificent as Solomon's Temple. Though God did dwell in the temple, He was not limited or restricted by it. The Most High does not reside in temples made by human hands, as Solomon himself acknowledged during the dedication of the temple. In fact, the name the most High is one of the titles used to refer to God. The Apostle Paul also echoes these sentiments, emphasizing that no building can contain the Most High, who is infinite and omnipresent.
