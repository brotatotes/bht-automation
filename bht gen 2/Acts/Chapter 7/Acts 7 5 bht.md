# Acts 7:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Abraham, the father of many nations, was promised a great inheritance by God. However, the land which he bought for the burial of his dead did not come under the description of a divine gift or possession. Instead, Abraham had to purchase it himself, emphasizing his status as a stranger in the land. Although the promised inheritance was not fully realized during Abraham's lifetime, it remained a testament to his faith in God's promises and the future fulfillment of those promises in his descendants.
