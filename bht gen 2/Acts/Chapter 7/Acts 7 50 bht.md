# Acts 7:50 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's true worship is not confined to ceremonies or material offerings because He has no need for them. Instead, He desires that we cultivate godliness and seek Him wholeheartedly. The difference between true religion and humanly devised rituals is evident in the fact that God seeks us, not our possessions. As the creator of all things, His hand has made everything, making it impossible for any material object or structure to adequately reflect His glory. Therefore, our focus should be on developing a deep relationship with God rather than relying on external acts of worship.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "God hath no need either of gold, either of precious furniture of the temple, either of the sacrifices; whereupon it followeth that his true worship is not contained in ceremonies."
2. "For he desireth none of all these things which we offer unto him, for his own sake, but only that he may exercise us in the study of godliness."
3. "Let us know that God seeketh us and not ours, which we have only at pleasure; and hereby it appeareth also what great difference there is between true religion and the carnal inventions of men."

### John Gill:
1. "Hath not my hand made all these things?" - The heaven, and the earth, and all that is in them.
2. "The Arabic version renders it, 'all these creatures'".
3. "What can be made for God?" or "what house built for him?" in Isaiah the words are read without an interrogation, and affirm that his hand had made all these things, and therefore nothing could be made for him suitable to him, by the hands of men.
