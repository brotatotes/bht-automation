# Acts 7:51 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
You, who are stubborn and resistant like a stubborn ox that refuses to be yoked, are also uncircumcised in heart, lacking the fear and love of the Lord. Your resistance goes beyond the physical realm to opposing the very work of the Holy Spirit. You have a long history of rejecting the message of God, both from the time of your forefathers and up until now. This resistance and opposition has been seen throughout the generations of Israel, as witnessed by the prophets and ultimately culminating in the betrayal and crucifixion of the Just One Himself, Jesus Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He has now brought down the history to the establishment of the temple worship. From Solomon’s time to his own, he saw but a succession of apostasies, idolatries, rejection of God’s prophets: a dark and loathsome catalogue, terminated by the betrayal and murder of the Just One Himself."
2. "Words and figures familiar to the prophets in speaking of the rebellious Israel."
3. "Apparently a reference to Isaiah 63:10. The instances as yet had been confined to οἱ πατ. ὑμ.: now he has arrived at their own times."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Ye stiffnecked . . . ye do always resist the Holy Ghost, &c."
2. "But as little farther light could have been thrown upon Israel's obstinacy from subsequent periods of the national history on the testimony of their own Scriptures, we should view this as the summing up, the brief import of the whole Israelitish history—grossness of heart, spiritual deafness, continuous resistance of the Holy Ghost, down to the very council before whom Stephen was pleading."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'stiff-necked' is often used in the Old Testament... It is a figurative expression taken from oxen that are refractory, and that will not submit to be yoked. Applied to people, it means that they are stubborn, contumacious, and unwilling to submit to the restraints of Law." 
2. "The expression 'uncircumcised in heart' denotes those who were not willing to acknowledge [the Law], and submit to it. They had hearts filled with vicious and unsubdued affections and desires." 
3. "You oppose the message which is brought to you by the authority of God and the inspiration of his Spirit. The message brought by Moses; by the prophets; by the Saviour; and by the apostles - all by the infallible direction of the Holy Spirit - they and their fathers opposed."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Stiff-necked and uncircumcised” - Both only here in the New Testament.
2. "Resist" - It is a very strong expression, implying active resistance.
3. "Ye have been" - More correctly, as Rev., ye have become.

### John Calvin:
1. "These two things, as we have said, were the principal points of the question, that Stephen had blasphemed God and his temple; that he went about to disannul the law."
2. "Their lofty and proud spirits might by this means have been subdued, tamed, and humbled, that being emptied of that wind of foolish glory they might come unto the Mediator."
3. "But because, when he was come to the pith of the matter, they cannot abide to hear any more, (they were so incensed with fury,) the application of those things which he had said, unto this cause which he had in hand, is wanting."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He had brought down the story of the people to the period of the establishment of the Temple worship and the reign of Solomon, and his view now ranged over a long and gloomy time... this long dark avenue of sin and ingratitude was closed by the cross on Mount Calvary, with the figure of the Just One nailed upon it."
2. "It was this terrible memory of the last long chapters of the story he was telling, it was the thought above all of the crucifixion of the Just, which filled the soul of Stephen with holy indignation, which found vent in this torrent of rebuke and anger against his guilty judges."
3. "The bitter words of reproach which he used were well-known ones, and the imagery was familiar to every Jew."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "No epithet could have been more galling to these Pharisees than to be turned 'uncircumcised in heart'." 
2. "Stephen has shown how God had revealed himself gradually, the revelation sloping upward to Christ Jesus."
3. "The pity of it overwhelmed him, and his mingled grief and indignation broke out in words of fire, such as burned of old on the lips of the prophets."

### John Gill:
1. "Ye stiffnecked....expressive of their obstinacy, stubbornness and refractoriness."
2. "and uncircumcised in heart and ears...their hearts were not circumcised to fear and love the Lord."
3. "ye do always resist the Holy Ghost...their ill treatment of Christ and his ministers, by falling upon them and putting them to death."
