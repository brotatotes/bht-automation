# Acts 7:52 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Throughout history, the nation displayed a consistent disposition of disobedience and hostility towards God's messengers. Their refusal to heed the words of the prophets and their participation in the murder of these messengers only emphasized their deep-rooted animosity. This dark pattern of rejection ultimately culminated in the betrayal and killing of the Messiah himself. The Scriptures often link the guilt of the fathers and the children, underscoring the ongoing cycle of transgression. Hence, the depth of their sin lies in their rejection of the Righteous One, the servant who brings salvation.
