# Acts 7:53 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The recipients of the law are those who received it through the ministry of angels. When God gave the law on Mount Sinai, He was accompanied by a multitude of His angels. This divine presence of angels emphasized the importance and significance of the law. The Jews, therefore, cannot claim ignorance or innocence in their failure to keep it. They were not only entrusted with the law, but it was given to them in a grand and imposing manner, making their transgression even more grievous.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The use of οἵτινες, instead of οἱ, so very frequent in the Acts and Epistles, occurs when the clause introduced by it contains a further explanation of the position or classification of the person or persons alluded to."

2. "The reference is most probably to the Jewish tradition that the law was given through the agency of angels."
3. "Paul expressly says that the law was administered by the medium of angels (Galatians 3:19)."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is evident, saith he, that you lie, when you pretend the zeal of the law, which you transgress and break without ceasing... he upbraideth unto them their revolting from the law."
2. "And here is also a fit antistrophe, because they made semblance that they received the law which was committed to them, which was, notwithstanding, reproachfully despised by them."

2. "As it was ordained by angels (εις διαταγας αγγελων). About angels see on Acts 7:38. Διαταγη (from διατασσω, to arrange, appoint) occurs in late Greek, LXX, inscriptions, papyri, Deissmann, Light from the Ancient East, pp. 89ff., and in N.T. only here and Romans 13:2."
