# Acts 7:55 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Steadfastly fixing his gaze on heaven, Stephen, filled with the Holy Spirit, beheld the glorious manifestation of God's presence and the radiant glory that surrounded Him. Miraculously aided by divine intervention, Stephen's imagination was stirred as he caught a glimpse of heaven's splendor. In a manner similar to Ezekiel's visionary experience, where he saw Jerusalem while in Babylon, Stephen may have felt transported to the heavenly realm. It's likely that other martyrs, facing imminent death, received similar extraordinary assistance to strengthen them during their final moments.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Certainly, in so far as the vision of Stephen was supernatural, it was not necessary that the material heavens should have been visible to him; but from the words ἀτενίσας εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν it would seem that they were."
2. "A reason why the glorified Saviour was seen standing, and not sitting, has been pleasingly given by Chrysostom (in Cramer’s Catena): τί οὖν ἑστῶτα καὶ οὐχὶ καθήμενον? ἵνα δείξῃ τὴν ἀντίληψιν τὴν εἰς τὸν μάρτυρα · καὶ γὰρ περὶ τοῦ πατρὸς λέγεται “ἀνάστα ὁ θεός.”"
3. "Stephen, under accusation of blaspheming the earthly temple, is granted a sight of the heavenly temple; being cited before the Sadducee High Priest who believed neither angel nor spirit, he is vouchsafed a vision of the heavenly HIGH PRIEST, standing and ministering at the throne amidst the angels and just men made perfect."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "You who can transfer to canvas such scenes as these, in which the rage of hell grins horribly from men, as they sit condemned by a frail prisoner of their own, and see heaven beaming from his countenance and opening full upon his view—I envy you, for I find no words to paint what, in the majesty of the divine text, is here so simply told."
2. "Clearly, to express the eager interest with which He watched from the skies the scene in that council chamber, and the full tide of His Spirit which He was at that moment engaged in pouring into the heart of His heroical witness, till it beamed in radiance from his very countenance."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Foreseeing his danger, and the effect his speech had produced; seeing that there was no safety in the Great Council of the nation, and no prospect of justice at their hands, he cast his eyes to heaven and sought protection there."
2. "When dangers threaten us, our hope of safety lies in heaven. When people threaten our persons, reputation, or lives, it becomes us to fix our eyes on the heavenly world; and we shall not look in vain."
3. "In the case of Stephen there is every indication of a vision or supernatural representation of the heavenly objects; something in advance of mere 'faith' such as dying Christians now have."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Being [υπαρχων] . See on James 2:15."
2. "Looked up steadfastly. Compare ch. 1 10; Acts 3:4, Acts 3:12; Acts 6:15; and see on Luke 4:20."
3. "Standing. Rising from the throne to protect and receive his servant."

### John Calvin:
1. "Stephen did look unto God, who is the judge of life and death, when he was brought into extreme despair of all things, whilst that there is nothing but death before his eyes."
2. "Therefore, Luke assigneth this cause, why Stephen looked up steadfastly toward heaven, because he was full of the Spirit. We must also ascend into heaven, having this Spirit to be our director and guide, so often as we are oppressed with troubles."
3. "God will be no less present with us, if, forsaking the world, all our senses strive to come to him; not that he appeareth unto us by any external vision, as he did to Stephen, but he will so reveal himself unto us within, that we may indeed feel his presence."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The scene before his eyes was no longer the council hall at Jerusalem, and the circle of his infuriated judges; but he gazed up into the endless courts of the celestial Jerusalem, with its innumerable company of angels, and saw Jesus, in whose righteous cause he was about to die." 
2. "Stephen might have beheld [the glory of God] as he gazed through the window of the judgment hall, shining through the deep blue arch of sky which overhung Jerusalem."
3. "Though it is possible the material heavens may be referred to here...it is by no means necessary to assume that he was gazing into the open sky at all."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Full of the Holy Spirit, gazing steadfastly into heaven, he saw God's glory and Jesus 'standing' as if he had risen to cheer the brave Stephen."
2. "Elsewhere (save verse Acts 7:56 also) he is pictured as sitting at the right hand of God (the Session of Christ) as in Matthew 26:64; Mark 16:19; Acts 2:34; Ephesians 1:20; Colossians 3:1; Hebrews 1:3."

### John Gill:
1. "being under the influences of the Spirit of God, and filled with his divine comforts, and strong in the faith of Jesus Christ, and having a holy boldness, courage, and intrepidity of mind"
2. "looked up steadfastly to heaven; where he desired to be, and hoped and believed he should be; and from whence he knew his help came, and which he might now implore, as well as forgiveness for his enemies"
3. "Jesus being risen from the dead, and ascended on high, was set at the right hand of God, in human nature, and so was visible to the corporeal eye of Stephen; whose visual faculty was so extraordinarily enlarged and assisted, as to reach the body of Christ in the third heavens; where he was seen by him standing, to denote his readiness to assist him, and his indignation at his enemies"

### John Wesley:
1. "But he looking steadfastly up to heaven, saw the glory of God...doubtless he saw such a glorious representation, God miraculously operating on his imagination."
2. "...as on Ezekiel's, when he sat in his house at Babylon, and saw Jerusalem, and seemed to himself transported thither."
3. "And probably other martyrs, when called to suffer the last extremity, have had extraordinary assistance of some similar kind."
