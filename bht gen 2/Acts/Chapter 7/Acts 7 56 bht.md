# Acts 7:56 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Stephen, full of the Holy Ghost, declares that he sees the heavens opened and behold, the Son of Man standing. It is noteworthy that this is the only time after His ascension that our Lord is referred to as the Son of Man by human lips. Stephen, guided by the Spirit, repeats the very words Jesus Himself spoke before this council. By declaring that he sees the Son of Man standing, Stephen reveals that Jesus is ready to receive him, in contrast to the common understanding that Jesus sits at the right hand of God.
