# Acts 7:58 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The stoning of Stephen was not a legal proceeding, but rather a tumultuary one. Nevertheless, some forms of law were observed, such as stoning him in the manner prescribed for blasphemers. The witnesses, whose hands were first to be upon the criminal, also took part in his execution. A young man named Saul, who would later become a notable figure in Christianity, was entrusted with the task of guarding their garments. This introduction to Saul serves as a reminder of how much Christianity owes to him and the transformative journey he would embark on.
