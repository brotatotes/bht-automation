# Acts 7:59 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Stephen, in his final moments, was seen stoning while calling upon and making direct prayer to the Lord Jesus. This act of invoking Jesus shows the legitimacy of worshiping and praying to Him. It is worth noting that Stephen's prayer to Jesus mirrors Christ's own prayer to the Father on the cross. These instances provide strong evidence for the acceptability of addressing Christ and committing our spirits to Him, as both Stephen and others, even facing death, have done the same.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The attempt to escape from this direct prayer to the Saviour by making Ἰησοῦ the genitive, and supposing it addressed to the Father, in the face of the ever-recurring words κύριος Ἰησοῦς (see Rev 22:20 especially), and the utter absence of any instance or analogy to justify it, is only characteristic of the school to which it belongs." 
2. "The same prayer in substance had been made by our Lord on the cross (ref. Luke) to His Father. To Him was now committed the key of David."
3. "Similarly, the young man Saul, in after years: πέπεισμαι ὅτι δυνατός ἐστιν τὴν παραθήκην μου φυλάξαι εἰς ἐκείνην τὴν ἡμέραν , 2 Timothy 1:12."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The sense is perfectly clear without any supplement at all—'calling upon [invoking] and saying, Lord Jesus'; Christ being the Person directly invoked and addressed by name."
2. "In presenting to Jesus the identical prayer which He Himself had on the cross offered to His Father, Stephen renders to his glorified Lord absolute divine worship, in the most sublime form, and at the most solemn moment of his life."
3. "In this commitment of his spirit to Jesus, Paul afterwards followed his footsteps with a calm, exultant confidence that with Him it was safe for eternity."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That is, he was engaged 'in prayer' to the Lord Jesus...And this shows that it is right to worship the Lord Jesus, and to pray to him. For if Stephen was inspired, it settles the question." 
2. "Then the following circumstances show that he, an inspired man, regarded it as right, and as a proper example to be followed." 
3. "If Thomas did it [offered worship to the Lord Jesus] in the presence of the Saviour without reproof, it was right. If Stephen did it without any expression of disapprobation from the inspired historian, it was right."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Calling upon God. God is not in the Greek."
2. "From the vision just described, and from the prayer which follows, it is evident that Jesus is meant."
3. "An unquestionable prayer to Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "Seeing they must commit the murder with their own hands, many are holden with a certain dread, who otherwise are less afraid to cut the throats of the innocent with perjury of the tongue."
2. "That every man may consider with himself what great hurt he might have done in God’s Church, unless Christ had bridled him betimes."
3. "In like sort, the Lord will have his servants to be brought to nought as it were sometimes, to the end their salvation may be the more wonderful."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Stephen here prays with his latest breath to Jesus, and all attempts to explain this momentous fact away are utterly useless."
2. "The martyr’s last cry was a prayer to our Lord, moulded upon two of the seven sayings of the Redeemer on the cross."
3. "'Dying men do not cling to devotional fancies or to precarious opinions: the soul in its last agony instinctively falls back upon its deepest certainties.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They stoned (ελιθοβολουν)... as he was calling upon the Lord Jesus and making direct prayer to him as 'Lord Jesus' (Κυριε Ιησου)." 
2. "Receive my spirit (δεξα το πνευμα μου). Aorist middle imperative, urgency, receive it now." 
3. "Many have followed Stephen into death with these words upon their dying lips."

### John Gill:
1. "From whence we learn, that the spirit or soul of man sleeps not, nor dies with the body, but remains after death."
2. "Jesus Christ is a fit person to commit and commend the care of the soul unto immediately upon its separation."
3. "This is so glaring a proof of prayer being made unto him, that some Socinians, perceiving the force of it, would read the word Jesus in the genitive case, thus; 'Lord of Jesus receive my Spirit'."

### John Wesley:
1. "This is the literal translation of the words, the name of God not being in the original."
2. "Stephen here worshipping Christ in the very same manner in which Christ worshipped the Father on the cross."
