# Acts 7:60 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Stephen, as he faced his persecutors and impending death, followed in the footsteps of Jesus by kneeling before Him in prayer, asking that their sin not be counted against them. Just like Jesus, Stephen desired forgiveness for his enemies and proclaimed his faith in a loud voice before his martyrdom. The use of sleep as a metaphor for death, which is seen in Stephen's final moments, is a common expression among the Jews, signifying a pure and honorable way to speak of the death of a righteous person.

### Henry Alford:
1. "Fix not this sin upon them" 
2. "Reckon not this sin to them" 
3. "Its use here, when the circumstances, and the actors in them, are remembered, is singularly touching, from the contrast."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Cried with a loud voice—with something of the gathered energy of his dying Lord."
2. "Comparing this with nearly the same prayer of his dying Lord, it will be seen how very richly this martyr of Jesus had drunk into his Master's spirit, in its divinest form."
3. "How bright the record of this first martyrdom for Christ, amidst all the darkness of its perpetrators; and how many have been cheered by it to like faithfulness even unto death!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Nothing but the Christian religion will enable a man to utter such sentiments in his dying moments."
2. "Sustaining grace will be derived in trials chiefly from a view of the Lord Jesus."
3. "To do this, we should live a life of faith. In health, and youth, and strength, we should seek him as our first and best friend."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Lay not this sin to their charge... fix not this sin upon them."
2. "He fell asleep... marking his calm and peaceful death."
3. "The pagan burying place carried in its name no suggestion of hope or comfort. It was a burying - place, a hiding - place, a monumentum, a mere memorial of something gone; but the Christian thought of death as sleep, brought with it into Christian speech the kindred thought of a chamber of rest, and embodied it in the word cemetery - the place to lie down to sleep."

### John Calvin:
1. "And we know that we are all commanded to do the same which Stephen did, but because there is nothing more hard than so to forgive injuries, that we will wish well to those who would have us undone, therefore we must always set Stephen before our eyes for an example."
2. "Stephen's prayer was not in vain. Here ariseth a question, how Stephen prayeth for those which he said of late did resist the Holy Ghost; but this seemeth to be the sin against the Spirit which shall never be forgiven? We may easily answer, that that is pronounced generally of all which belongeth to many everywhere; therefore, he called not the body of the people rebellious in such sort that he exempted none."
3. "When he prayeth that God will not lay the sin to their charge, his meaning is, that the guiltiness may not remain in them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "After Stephen was thrown down from the scaffold, still living and conscious, he raised himself to his knees, that his last act might be a protest alike for his adoration of his Master and his forgiveness of his enemies."
2. "The word κοιμητήριον, cemetery, that is, a sleeping-place where the bodies were laid only to sleep till the resurrection should awaken them, is peculiarly a Christian term, and its introduction and general use is owing to the new ideas which the teaching of Jesus has persuaded men to associate with the grave."
3. "There is something musical in the cadence of this word, and also of the word which closes the Acts, ακωλύτως, unhindered, rendered in the English, 'no man forbidding him.' The word commences with a short syllable followed by three long ones, happily adapted to express rest after labour."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus was standing at the right hand of God and Stephen knelt before him in worship and called on him in prayer." 
2. "The very spirit of Jesus towards his enemies as he died upon the Cross." 
3. "The metaphor of sleep for death is common in all languages, but it is peculiarly appropriate here as Jesus used it of Lazarus."

### John Gill:
1. "Lord, lay not this sin to their charge: do not impute it to them, or place it to their account; let it not rise and stand in judgment against them, or they be condemned for it; grant them forgiveness for it, and for every other sin."
2. "There is a great deal of likeness between Christ and this first martyr of his at their deaths; Christ committed his Spirit into the hands of his Father, and Stephen commits his into the hands of Christ; both prayed for forgiveness for their enemies; and both cried with a loud voice before they expired."
3. "This way of speaking is common with the Jews, who say that Rabbi such an one 'slept'; i.e. 'died'; and this they say is a pure and honourable way of speaking with respect to an holy body, whose death is no other than as it were a sleep."
