# Acts 7:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
And through this covenant of circumcision, God brought forth Isaac as the fulfillment of His promise. As the seal of this covenant, circumcision became a tangible sign of God's faithfulness and his special relationship with Abraham. This act of circumcision marked the beginning of a lineage that would eventually lead to the birth of the twelve patriarchs, who would become the heads of the twelve tribes of Israel. In this way, the covenant of circumcision served as a foundational moment in the history of God's chosen people.
