# Acts 7:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The sons of Jacob were filled with envy and rage towards Joseph because of their father's greater love for him and the evil report he brought to their father. There is a similarity between Joseph's treatment and that of Jesus Christ, as Joseph was sold by his brethren and Christ was sold by one of his disciples for silver. However, God was with Joseph throughout his trials, prospering him, protecting him, and ultimately delivering him from his troubles. Though he was not in the land, God's presence was with him.
