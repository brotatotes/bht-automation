# Acts 8:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The persecution against the early Christians began with the stoning of Stephen, at which Saul fully approved. The Church of Jerusalem was scattered as a result. The apostles, however, remained in the city, steadfast in their duty despite the danger. The dispersion of the believers advanced the Gospel, allowing for the further dissemination of the message. The persecution was met with courage by the Christians, while their adversaries may have been timid due to witnessing the believers' miraculous works. The grace of God was abundantly evident in these circumstances.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "From this time, the narrative takes up Saul, and, at first with considerable interruptions, but after entirely follows his history."
2. "Connected with Acts 8:4; this word is not without importance, as introducing the next step in the dissemination of the Gospel, according to our Lord‚Äôs command in ch. Acts 1:8."
3. "Perhaps, from their exalted position of veneration by the people, the persecution did not extend to them: perhaps they remained, as possessed of superior firmness and devotion."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Saul was consenting unto his death‚ÄîThe word expresses hearty approval."
2. "They were all scattered abroad‚Äîall the leading Christians, particularly the preachers, agreeably to their Lord's injunctions, though many doubtless remained."
3. "Except the apostles‚Äîwho remained, not certainly as being less exposed to danger, but, at whatever risk, to watch over the infant cause where it was most needful to cherish it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They had become so embittered by the zeal and success of the apostles, and by their frequent charges of murder in putting the Son of God to death, that they resolved at once to put a period to their progress and success."
2. "Why the apostles, who were particularly in danger, did not flee also, is not stated by the historian. Having been, however, more fully instructed than the others, and having been taught their duty by the example and teaching of the Saviour, they resolved, it seems, to remain and brave the fury of the persecutors."
3. "Good thus came out of evil; and the first persecution resulted, as all others have done, in advancing the cause which was intended to be destroyed."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Death [Œ±ŒΩŒ±ŒπœÅŒµœÉŒµŒπ] . Lit., taking off. See on Luke 23:32.

### John Calvin:
1. "The persecution began at Stephen, after that, when their madness was thereby set on fire, it waxed hot against all, both one and other."
2. "For they fled not unadvisedly, being discouraged, but because they saw no other means to pacify the fury of the adversaries."
3. "If any man object that they might have divided the provinces amongst them, that they might not all have been occupied in one place, I answer, that Jerusalem alone had business enough for them all."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Returning from the scene of blood, Saul, armed with the authority of the jealous Sanhedrim, at once commenced his savage work, and in a very short time the little flourishing Church of Jerusalem was dispersed."
2. "This partial dispersion of the new sect, this breaking up of their organization, is roughly designated by the words, ‚Äòthey were all scattered abroad.‚Äô"
3. "But whether or no they were exposed to danger, they felt they had no right to quit the holy city, which they regarded as their post of duty."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul himself will later confess that he felt so (Acts 22:20), coolly applauding the murder of Stephen, a heinous sin (Romans 1:32). It is a gruesome picture." 
2. "A great persecution (Œ¥ŒπœâŒ≥ŒºŒøœÇ ŒºŒµŒ≥Œ±œÇ). It was at first persecution from the Sadducees, but this attack on Stephen was from the Pharisees so that both parties are now united in a general persecution that deserves the adjective 'great.'"
3. "It remains a bit of a puzzle why the Pharisees spared the apostles. Was it due to the advice of Gamaliel in Acts 5:34-40? Or was it the courage of the apostles? Or was it a combination of both with the popularity of the apostles in addition?"

### John Gill:
1. "That Saul consented to the death of Stephen, and approved of that barbarous action, is evident from his taking care of the clothes of the witnesses that stoned him." 
2. "These accounts serve to set off and illustrate the grace of God, which was abundant towards him."
3. "This scattering by reason of the persecution was not only an instance of courage and constancy in them, but also of the timidity of their adversaries, who might be afraid to meddle with them; remembering what miraculous works were performed by them."
