# Acts 8:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Simon, known as the Great Power of God, captivated the people with his deceptive charm and held their attention through his words and actions. His influence stretched across all levels of society, gaining the obedience and regard of both the elite and ordinary individuals. They mistakenly believed that he was the Messiah, considering him to be a true representation of God's power. However, this misplaced faith in Simon's divine pretensions highlights the vulnerability of people to be deceived by false prophets during that era.
