# Acts 8:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The news that the Samaritans had received the word of God was heard by the apostles, who recognized the significance of this conversion. In response, they sent Peter and John, both equal and intimately acquainted with one another, to confirm the teachings of Philip and establish the new converts in the Gospel. This act demonstrated the equality, if not the superiority, of the apostles to Peter, emphasizing the importance of their collective authority in the early church.

### Henry Alford:
1. "PETER, because to him belonged, in this early part of the Gospel, in a remarkable manner, the first establishing of the church; it was the fulfilment of the promise ἐπὶ ταύτῃ τῇ πέτρᾳ οἰκοδομήσω μου τὴν ἐκκλησίαν."
2. "It was he who had (in common with all the Apostles, it is true, but in this early period more especially committed to him) τὰς κλεῖδας τῆς βασιλείας τῶν οὐρανῶν, who opened the door to the 3000 on the day of Pentecost, now (as a formal and ratifying act) to the Samaritans, and in ch. 10 to the Gentiles."
3. "The monstrous fiction begins, when to Peter is attributed a fixed diocese and successors, and to those successors a delegated power more like that ascribed to Simon Magus than that promised to Peter."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

	own equal.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They sent - That is, the apostles 'deputed' two of their number. This shows conclusively that there was no 'chief' or ruler among them."
2. "In times of revival there is often more to be done than can be done by the regular servant of a people, and it is proper that he should be aided from abroad."
3. "Peter was ardent, bold, zealous, rash; John was mild, gentle, tender, persuasive. There was wisdom in uniting them in this work, as the talents of both were needed; and the excellencies in the character of the one would compensate for the defects of the other."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Samaria. The country, not the city. See vv. 5, 9.

2. "We can hardly understand now what a painful struggle it must have been for pious Jews like James, the Lord’s brother, and John to concede that even the hated Samaritan had a right to the kingdom of heaven..."
