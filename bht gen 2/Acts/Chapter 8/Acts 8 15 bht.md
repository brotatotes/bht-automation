# Acts 8:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostles prayed for the Samaritans, seeking an increase in both the miraculous gifts and sanctifying graces of the Holy Spirit. While they may not have needed the extraordinary gifts that were not necessary for all, they desired an augmentation of spiritual light and knowledge for everyone. This prayer was founded on the fact that the Holy Spirit had not yet visibly manifested Himself among the Samaritans, indicating the need for this outward sign of His presence to be seen.
