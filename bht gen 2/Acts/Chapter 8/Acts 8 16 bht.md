# Acts 8:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The believers had fallen, meaning that the Holy Spirit had swiftly and suddenly come upon them. They had received the Spirit as a source of illumination, sanctification, conversion, and faith. They were regenerated, enlightened, and sanctified through Him. By being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus, they had shown themselves to be believers in Christ. This baptism was the only ordinance they had taken part in at that point, and it signified their acceptance of Christ and the grace that comes through Him.

3.
