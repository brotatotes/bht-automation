# Acts 8:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostles recognized the importance of establishing strong leadership within the church, so they selected and equipped individuals for ministry. In order to provide the new church with capable leaders, both Peter and John laid their hands on these individuals. Through this act, the apostles sought the blessing of the Holy Spirit upon these individuals, enabling them to effectively carry out their roles as pastors and teachers. As a result, the newly appointed leaders received spiritual gifts, enabling them to prophesy, speak in tongues, perform miracles, and perform other extraordinary acts.
