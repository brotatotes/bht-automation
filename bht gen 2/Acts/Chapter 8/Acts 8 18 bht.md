# Acts 8:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Simon, who witnessed the powerful effects of the apostles' hands, thought that if he could purchase this ability to confer the Holy Spirit onto others, he could use it for profit. His sinful motives were exposed when he tried to buy this power from the apostles before he himself had received the Spirit. This act of Simon reveals that he was driven by improper motives and materialism, leading to the term simony being coined to describe the sin of trafficking in sacred things for personal gain.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Its effects were therefore visible...the effect of the laying on of the Apostles’ hands was not the inward but the outward miraculous gifts of the Spirit." 
2. "He regarded the capability of imparting the Holy Spirit, rightly, as something conferred, as a derived power...and wrongly, as one to be obtained by an external method, without an inward disposition...he wanted to buy it. This is the essence of the sin of Simony, which is intimately connected with unbelief in the power and signification of the Spirit, and with materialism." 
3. "Clearly, from the narrative, Simon himself did not receive the Spirit by the laying on of hands. His nefarious attempt to treat with the Apostles was before he himself had been presented to them for this purpose."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 18-24. offered them money—Hence
	the term simony, to denote trafficking in sacred things, but
	chiefly the purchase of ecclesiastical offices.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Simon saw ... he witnessed the extraordinary effects, the power of speaking in a miraculous manner, etc."
2. "He saw that if he could communicate to 'others' this power; if he could confer on 'them' the talent of speaking other languages, it might be turned to vast account, and he sought, therefore, to purchase it of the apostles."
3. "This act of Simon shows conclusively that he was influenced by improper motives in becoming connected with the church."

### John Calvin:
1. "The denial of ourselves ought to follow true faith."
2. "God wipeth away that false color now in Simon, lest by professing the name of Christ he deceive both himself and others."
3. "He thought that it would be gainsome if he might give the graces of the Spirit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The gifts of the Holy Ghost were in this case plainly visible. The laying on of the apostles’ hands conferred something more than the inward spiritual grace; outward miraculous gifts of some kind or other were plainly bestowed."
2. "His sordid, grasping nature remained unchanged, though he had heard the burning words of the missionaries of Jesus."
3. "He supposed the secret of these men, like everything else Simon knew of in this world, was to be purchased with gold and silver."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This participle (second aorist active of οραω) shows plainly that those who received the gift of the Holy Spirit spoke with tongues."
2. "Simon now saw power transferred to others."
3. "He took Peter to be like himself, a mountebank performer who would sell his tricks for enough money."

### John Gill:
1. "Whence it appears, that the Holy Ghost, or his gifts, which were received by imposition of hands, were something visible and discernible; and so something external, and not internal..."
2. "...he saw, that through laying on of the apostles' hands, the Holy Ghost was given: he saw, that upon this men began to prophesy, and to speak with divers tongues they had never learned, and to work miracles, cure men of their diseases, and the like..."
3. "...hence buying and selling spiritual things, or what relate thereunto, are commonly called 'simony': a vice which has greatly prevailed in the church of Rome, and among its popes; and who therefore may be more properly called the successors of Simon Magus, than of Simon Peter."

### John Wesley:
1. Simon offered them money — And hence the procuring any ministerial function, or ecclesiastical benefice by money, is termed Simony.
