# Acts 8:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The individual highlighted in this passage is driven by a strong desire for power and control. Instead of seeking to personally receive the Holy Spirit, his focus is on obtaining the ability to confer these spiritual gifts onto others. This reveals a distorted understanding of the Holy Spirit, reducing it to a tradeable commodity. However, it is vital to recognize that true spiritual gifts cannot be acquired through material means. Rather, they are bestowed upon individuals as divine gifts from God himself, reflecting qualities such as wisdom, faith, and holiness.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 19. that on whomsoever I lay hands,

	shows itself the key to this wretched man's character.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He wants the power to pass on 'this power.' His notion of 'The Holy Spirit' was on this low level."
2. "He regarded spiritual functions as a marketable commodity."
3. "Money 'can buy diamonds, but not wisdom, or sympathy, or faith, or holiness'."

### John Gill:
1. "He does not ask them to lay their hands on him, that he might receive the Holy Ghost, and have these gifts to exercise himself, but that he might have the power of conferring them on others..."
2. "...he perceived that this was purely apostolical; and indeed, what he requested was more than what the apostles could do; for though upon their prayers, and through the imposition of their hands, the gifts of the Spirit were bestowed upon men; yet they never could, nor did give a power to others, to do as they did..."
3. "...his avarice prompted him to this, that he might make gain of it; not by doing miracles himself, but by conveying a power to others to do them."
