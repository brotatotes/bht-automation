# Acts 8:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter's strong words convey not a curse upon Simon's person, but rather a deep abhorrence of his sin. Peter does not simply wish damnation upon him, for he later urges Simon to repent and seek forgiveness. It is clear that Simon has a misguided understanding of the Spirit of God, His gifts, and the gracious manner in which they are given - he wrongly believes they can be purchased with money.
