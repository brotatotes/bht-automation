# Acts 8:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
You have no portion or share, freely given by God, in this matter - the precious gift of the Spirit. For your heart is not sincere and upright in the sight of God. Unlike Simon, who sought his own personal gain and glory, the apostle Paul, who was not inferior to the other apostles, did not have such impure motives.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The matter now spoken of, 'to which I now allude.'" 
2. "Thy heart is not right, sincere, single-meaning, in God’s presence, 'as God sees it:’ i.e., 'seen as it really is, by God, is not in earnest in its seeking after the gospel, but seeks it with unworthy ends in view.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Thou hast neither part nor lot."
2. "Thy heart is not right, &c."
3. "This is the fidelity of a minister of Christ."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "You have no 'portion' of the grace of God; that is, you are destitute of it altogether."
2. "One act may sometimes bring out the 'whole character'; it may evince the 'governing' motives; it may show traits of character utterly 'inconsistent' with true religion."
3. "No external profession is acceptable without the heart. Reader, is your heart right with God? Are your motives pure; and does 'God' see there the exercise of holy, sincere, and benevolent affections toward him?"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Lot expresses the same idea as part, but figuratively."
2. "Matter [λογω] . The matter of which we are talking."
3. "Right [ευθεια] . Lit., straight."

### John Calvin:
1. "Thy money perish with thee, because thou thinkest that the inestimable gift of the Spirit can be bought with money."
2. "We must note the true definition of simony, to wit, that it is a wicked buying and selling of the gifts of the Spirit, or some other such like thing, whilst that a man abuseth them unto ambition or other corruptions."
3. "Peter prescribeth no general rule in this place, but because the Church alone is for the most part made partaker of the gifts of the Spirit, he pronounceth that Simon, who is a stranger to Christ, is unworthy to have the same graces given him, (which are bestowed upon the faithful,) as if he were one of God’s household."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter." More accurately rendered 'in this word' that is to say, one whose heart is given up, as is yours, to covetousness and greed of gain, has no share in the word or doctrine which we teach.
2. "Thy heart is not right." Is not sincere, as God sees it.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Lot (κληρος). Same idea as 'part' (μερις), only as a figure." 
2. "Matter (λογο). Literally, word or subject, the power of communicating the Holy Spirit."
3. "Straight (ευθεια). Quotation from Psalms 78:37. Originally a mathematically straight line as in Acts 9:11, then moral rectitude as here."

### John Gill:
1. "Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter...as he had not the grace of the Spirit of God implanted in him, so he should not have any of the gifts of the Spirit bestowed on him; and much less a power of communicating them to others" 
2. "he had not a clean heart, nor a right spirit created in him; he had not true principles of grace wrought in him; his heart was full of covetousness, ambition, and hypocrisy" 
3. "his view was not the spread and confirmation of the Gospel, or the enlargement of the kingdom and interest of Christ, and the glory of God, but his own applause and worldly interest."

### John Wesley:
1. "Thou hast neither part, nor lot - Given gratis, in this matter - This gift of God."
2. "For thy heart is not right before God."
3. "This we are sure St. Paul had not; though he was not inferior to the chief of the apostles."
