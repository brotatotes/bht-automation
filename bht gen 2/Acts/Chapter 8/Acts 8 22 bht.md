# Acts 8:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Simon's wickedness in attempting to purchase the gift of the Holy Spirit with money was a great offense. However, there is hope for forgiveness if he truly repents. Prayer is a duty that applies to all, regardless of their spiritual state, although true spiritual prayer can only come from a spiritual person. While Simon's sin is grave, it is not unpardonable, yet he is warned that he is still bound by the bitterness and bondage of his iniquity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This verse is important, taken in connexion with John 20:23, as shewing how completely the Apostles themselves referred the forgiveness of sins to, and left it in, the sovereign power of God, and not to their own delegated power of absolution."
2. "Peter does not pronounce his sin to have been such, but throws in this doubt, to increase the motive to repent, and the earnestness of his repentance."
3. "The uncertainty refers, not to the doubt whether Simon would repent or not, but as to whether or not his sin may not have come under the awful category of those unpardonable ones specified by our Lord."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Repent...pray...if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven—this expression of doubt being designed to impress upon him the greatness of his sin, and the need of alarm on his part."
2. "the greatness of his sin, and the need of alarm on his part."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That all sinners are to be exhorted to 'repent,' as their first work. They are not to be told to 'wait,' and 'read,' and 'pray,' in the expectation that repentance will be 'given' them. With such helps as they can obtain, they are to 'do the thing.'"
2. "Prayer will not be acceptable or heard unless the sinner comes 'repenting'; that is, unless he regrets his sin, and 'desires' to forsake it. Then, and then only, will he be heard."
3. "This shows that a sinner 'ought' to pray, and 'how' he ought to do it. It should be with a desire and purpose to forsake sin, and in that state of mind God will hear the prayer."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "If perhaps. The doubt suggested by the heinousness of the offense."
2. "Thought [επινοια] . Only here in New Testament. Lit., a thinking on or contriving; and hence implying a plan or design."

### John Calvin:
1. "We must so deal with those for whom sharp chiding is profitable, by reason of their hardness and stubbornness, that we throw them down with one hand, and set them on foot with the other; for the Spirit of God doth not suffer us to accurse them." 
2. "But the word ει αρα signifieth as much as if a man should say, If by any means thou must obtain pardon of God...Peter useth this word, not that he may leave Simon’s mind in a perplexity, but that he may the more prick him forward to be earnest in prayer."
3. "Pardon is hard to be gotten, by reason of the greatness of his offense, to the end he may provoke him unto ferventness; for it is requisite that we may be lightened by faith when we go unto God, yea, that she be the mother of prayer."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee." The words 'if perhaps' were uttered owing to the very grave character of the sin which St. Peter believed the impostor magician to have been guilty of.
2. "The apostle was ignorant whether the state of heart which prompted such a request as Simon's was capable of true repentance, but he doubtless spoke these grave, solemn words to stir up any feelings of remorse which might still be lingering in that hard, covetous heart."
3. "This verse is important taken in connection with John 20:23, 'Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them,' etc., as showing how completely the apostles themselves referred the forgiveness of sins to, and left it in the sovereign power of God, and not to their own delegated power of absolution."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Wickedness. Only here in Luke's writings, though old word and in LXX."
2. "If perhaps. This idiom, though with the future indicative and so a condition of the first class (determined as fulfilled), yet minimizes the chance of forgiveness as in Mark 11:13."
3. "The thought. Old Greek word from επινοεω, to think upon, and so purpose. Only here in the N.T."

### John Gill:
1. "For a great piece of wickedness it was, to offer money for the gift of the Holy Ghost, and to imagine, that could be purchased with money..."
2. "Though he was in a state of nature, the apostle exhorts him to the duty of prayer; for prayer is a natural duty, and binding upon all men, though none but a spiritual man can perform it in a spiritual way."
3. "Though this sin of Simon's was a very heinous one, and came very near unto, and looked very much like the sin against the Holy Ghost, yet it was not the unpardonable one; it might be pardoned by the grace of God, and through the blood of Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "Without all doubt if he had repented, he would have been forgiven."
2. "Thou art in the gall of bitterness [...] in the bond of iniquity - fast bound therewith."
