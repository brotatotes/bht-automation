# Acts 8:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Simon was in a desperate condition, bound by the chains of sin and dominated by his sinful nature. Instead of having true repentance and a heart turned towards God, he was consumed by covetousness, ambition, and hypocrisy. This bitterness and state of unregeneracy revealed that he lacked the genuine root of grace within him. Like being held fast in bonds, he was entirely under the control of his sinful desires.
