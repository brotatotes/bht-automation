# Acts 8:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Simon is deeply impacted by Peter's words, his conscience pricked and filled with fear of God's judgment for his wickedness. He pleads with both Peter and John to pray for him, but it is uncertain whether his plea is genuine. If it is, Simon does not follow Peter's advice to pray for himself nor does he show any signs of repentance, suggesting that his desire for the apostles to pray for him may stem from a slavish fear of the impending consequences rather than a true recognition of his sin.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Simon speaks here much as Pharaoh, who yet hardened his heart afterwards." (Acts 8:28 ; Acts 9:28 ; Acts 10:17) 
2. "It is observable also that he wishes merely for the averting of the punishment." 
3. "The words ὅπως μηδὲν ἐπέλθῃ ἐπ ʼ ἐμὲ ὧν εἰρήκατε seem remarkably to set forth the mere terror of the carnal man, without any idea of the ἐμέ becoming another man in thoughts and aims."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Pray ye to the Lord for me—Peter had urged him to pray for himself: he asks those wonder-working men to do it for him; having no confidence in the prayer of faith, but thinking that those men possessed some peculiar interest with heaven."
2. "that none of these things dome upon me—not that the thought of his wicked heart might be forgiven him, but only that the evils threatened might be averted from him."
3. "While this throws great light on Peter's view of his melancholy case, it shows that Christianity, as something divine, still retained its hold of him."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Sinners will often ask others to pray for them, when they are too proud, or too much in love with sin, to pray for themselves."
2. "If people expect to be saved, they must pray 'for themselves'; and pray not chiefly to be freed from 'punishment,' but from the 'sin which deserves hell.'"
3. "The probability is, that, like many other sinners, he did not pray for himself, but continued to live in the gall of bitterness, and died in the bond of iniquity."

### John Calvin:
1. "And though Peter alone spake, yet he attributeth the speech unto all by reason of the consent."
2. "Whereas he yieldeth when he is reproved, and being touched with the feeling of his sin, feareth the judgment of God; and that done, flieth unto the mercy of God, and commendeth himself to the prayers of the Church; these are assuredly no small signs of repentance; therefore we may conjecture that he repented."
3. "That which we read elsewhere of Simon may justly be suspected for many causes."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He confesses his fear of punishment, not horror of guilt."
2. "The history of the Acts never refers again to this episode; so, as far as the New Testament records are concerned, we are left in doubt whether or no St. Peter’s solemn words had any effect on the subsequent life and conduct of Simon."
3. "This gifted but deeply erring man seems, after his meeting with the apostles, to have gone on from bad to worse. He persevered in his dark pursuits, and soon became notorious as one of the most bitter of the opponents of Christianity."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Simon is thoroughly frightened by Peter's words, but shows no sign of personal repentance or change of heart."
2. "He wants to escape the penalty for his sin and hopes that Peter can avert it."
3. "Peter had clearly diagnosed his case. He was an unconverted man in spite of his profession of faith and baptism."

### John Gill:
1. "Whose conscience might be touched, and smote with what Peter had said; and he might be terrified with the wrath of God, and filled with fear of his judgment coming upon him for his wickedness."
2. "Simon desires both of them, that they would pray to the Lord for him; but whether he was serious, and in good earnest in this, is a question."
3. "And if he was in earnest, he did not take Peter's advice to pray for himself; nor did he declare any repentance for his sin; and his desire that the apostles would pray for him, might not be from any sense he had of the evil of his sin, but from a slavish fear of the evil, or mischief, that was like to come upon him for his sin."
