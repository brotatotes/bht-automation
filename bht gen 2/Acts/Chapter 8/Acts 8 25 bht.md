The disciples, following the path of Philip, journeyed to the Samaritan villages to confirm and establish the Gospel. Their preaching in the city of Samaria demonstrated the harmony and agreement of their message.

Through their testimony, the Gospel was firmly established, countering the errors of Simon Magus and bringing the message of salvation to every creature.
