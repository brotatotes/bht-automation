# Acts 8:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage reveals a significant message about the spread of the Gospel. By the breaking down of walls that once separated people, it becomes evident that physical limitations and societal norms do not hinder one's access to the grace of God. It is worth noting that the conversion of the Ethiopian eunuch challenges prejudices and demonstrates that baptism and acceptance into the Christian faith are not contingent upon one's background or circumstances. The encounter between Philip and the Ethiopian eunuch highlights God's inclusive love and His desire for all nations and peoples to come to Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The walls of partition were one after another being thrown down: the Samaritans were already in full possession of the Gospel: it was next to be shown that none of those physical incapacities which excluded from the congregation of the Lord under the old covenant, formed any bar to Christian baptism and the inheritance among believers." 
2. "The whole occurrence seems to have had one design, connected with this fact."
3. "We may remark, that if even the plain revelation by which the reception of Cornelius and his company was commanded failed finally to convince Peter, so that long after this he vacillated, it is no argument for the eunuch not being a Gentile, that his conversion and baptism did not remove the prejudices of the Jewish Christians."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Eunuchs were generally employed for confidential offices in the East, and to some extent are still."
2. "Candace—the family name of the queens of Upper Egypt, like Pharaoh, Cæsar, c. (as appears from classic authors)."
3. "had come to Jerusalem to worship—that is, to keep the recent feast of Pentecost, as a Gentile proselyte to the Jewish faith."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Ethiopia proper lay south of Egypt, on the Nile, and was bounded north by Egypt, that is, by the cataracts near Syene; east by the Red Sea, and perhaps part by the Indian Ocean; south by unknown regions in the interior of Africa; and west by Libya and the deserts."
2. "Eunuchs were commonly employed in attendance on the females of the harem; but the word is often used to denote 'any confidential officer, or counselor of state.' It is evidently so used here."
3. "His words are: 'The edifices of the city were few; a woman reigned there of the name of Candace, which name had been transmitted to these queens for many years.' Strabo mentions also a queen of Ethiopia of the name of Candace. Speaking of an insurrection against the Romans, he says, 'Among these were the officers of queen Candace, who in our days reigned over the Ethiopians.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The monuments prove beyond all question that the Ethiopians borrowed from Egypt their religion and their habits of civilization."
2. "It was through Egypt, too, that Christianity passed into Ethiopia, even in the age of the apostles, as is shown by the eunuch of Queen Candace."
3. "Treasure [γαζης] . Only here in New Testament. A Persian word."

### John Calvin:
1. "The name Candace was not the name of one queen only; but as all the emperors of Rome were called Caesars, so the Ethiopians, as Pliny witnesses, called their queens Candaces."
2. "Hereby we gather that the name of the true God was spread far abroad, seeing he had some worshippers in far countries."
3. "And if such a small sparkle of the knowledge of the law did so shine in him, what a shame were it for us to choke the perfect light of the gospel with unfaithful silence?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This man was not, as some have suggested, a Jew who lived in Ethiopia, but most probably was a heathen convert to Judaism."
2. "Candace was the ordinary name of the female rulers of Meroe, the north part of Ethiopia."
3. "The title Candace was the customary title of the sovereign, as Pharaoh had been in Egypt, and Cæsar continued to be in Rome."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Eunuchs were often employed by oriental rulers in high posts." 
2. "But Christianity is spreading to Samaritans and to eunuchs."
3. "This eunuch apparently brought the gospel to Ethiopia."

### John Gill:
1. "He made no dispute about the matter, though he was directed only part of his way, and had no account of what he went about, or was to do."
2. "A note of admiration is prefixed, to observe to us what was remarkable in providence...that such an one should be the object of God's peculiar favour."
3. "This great person...was under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, that is, of those Ethiopians who inhabited the island of Meroe."

### John Wesley:
1. "Chief officers were anciently called eunuchs, though not always literally such; because such used to be chief ministers in the eastern courts."
2. "So all the queens of Ethiopia were called [Candace]."
