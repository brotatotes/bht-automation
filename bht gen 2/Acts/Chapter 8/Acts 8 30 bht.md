# Acts 8:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
And so Philip eagerly obeyed and ran to the eunuch, hoping to be an instrument of God's glory and the welfare of humanity. The eunuch, with a clear and distinct voice, read aloud the words from Isaiah, both out of reverence for the word of God and to understand and remember it better. It was evident to Philip that the eunuch was not merely reading the language but seeking to grasp the deeper sense and future implications of the prophecy. This encounter teaches us the importance of speaking directly and without unnecessary elaboration when conveying God's message.
