# Acts 8:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In his lowly state, Jesus experienced the sorrows and weaknesses of human nature. During this time, he was unjustly treated and deprived of justice. This removal of justice can be understood as a proverbial expression for oppressing someone. Additionally, it is impossible to fully comprehend or count the number of people who would be redeemed through his sacrificial death.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He was taken away by distress and judgment, i.e., by an oppressive judgment." 
2. "The age in which He shall live ‘the wickedness of his contemporaries.'" 
3. "The fathers, and Bede (and so Wordsworth), explain 'His generation' of His eternal Sonship and His miraculous Incarnation. But the Heb. does not seem to bear this out."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word rendered 'prison' denotes any kind of 'detention,' or even 'oppression.' It does not mean, as with us, to be confined 'in' a prison or jail, but may mean 'custody,' and be applied to the detention or custody of the Saviour when his hands were bound, and he was led to be tried."
2. "His deep humiliation and friendless state was 'followed' by an unjust and cruel condemnation, when no one would stand forth to plead his cause. Every circumstance thus goes to deepen the view of his sufferings."
3. "Perhaps, after all that has been written on this passage, the simple idea is, 'Who shall stand up for him, declaring who he is? Who will appear for him? Who will vindicate him?' meaning that all would forsake him, and that there would be none to 'declare really who he was.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Humiliation. See on Matthew 11:29. Generation. His contemporaries. Who shall declare their wickedness ?

### John Calvin:
1. "The prophet saith that Christ was exalted out of sorrow and judgment, by which words he signifieth a wonderful victory, which immediately ensued his casting down."
2. "Therefore the meaning of the words is, that Christ must first have suffered death, before the Father should exalt him unto the glory of his kingdom; which doctrine must be translated unto the whole body of the Church; because all the godly ought wonderfully to be lifted up with the hand of God, that they be not swallowed up of death."
3. "Therefore, undoubtedly this is the prophet’s meaning, that Christ’s life shall endure for ever, when as he shall be once delivered by his Father’s grace from death; although this life, which is without end, appertaineth unto the whole body of the Church; because Christ rose, not that he may live for himself, but for us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Jesus appeared in a form so humble, a man so poor and insignificant, that Pilate, though convinced of His innocence, thought it not worth while to hazard anything to preserve His life."
2. "Though so lowly, so mean, so poor, was His semblance on earth, who shall declare His generation? It is ineffable! for He is the eternal Son of God, begotten from everlasting of the Father."
3. "Not simply taken away, as the life of an ordinary mortal might be, but lifted up from the earth referring to the ascension of Jesus Christ to the right hand of the Father, where He was before."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Justice was withheld, done away with, in his death, as it certainly was in the death of Christ."
2. "It is not clear what the meaning is here either in the Hebrew or the LXX."
3. "The idea is that justice was taken away in his death."

### John Gill:
1. "The humiliation, or low estate of Christ, lay in his assumption of human nature, with the weaknesses and imperfections of it... in the sorrows he endured from his cradle to his cross..." 
2. "now in this his low estate, 'his judgment was taken away'" 
3. "justice was not done him, right did not take place, but was removed from him, and he was treated in a most unjust and unrighteous manner"

### John Wesley:
1. "In his humiliation his judgment was taken away - That is, when he was a man, he had no justice shown him."
2. "To take away a person's judgment, is a proverbial phrase for oppressing him."
3. "And who shall declare, or count his generation - That is, who can number his seed, Isaiah 53:10; which he hath purchased by laying down his life?"
