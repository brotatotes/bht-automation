Philip wasted no time and immediately began to explain the scripture to the Ethiopian treasurer. Opening his mouth, he boldly expounded on the passage, revealing the glorious fulfillment of the prophecy in Jesus. Philip preached about Jesus being born of a virgin, living a life of perfect obedience, and taking upon himself the sins of his people, bringing them eternal redemption. He also proclaimed that Jesus rose from the dead, ascended into heaven, and now intercedes for transgressors at the right hand of God.
