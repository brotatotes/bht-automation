# Acts 8:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The presence of water, as acknowledged by the eunuch, signifies his eagerness to outwardly seal his newfound understanding of the truth and join the visible community of disciples. It is clear that the eunuch had been taught by Philip about the significance of baptism, which is the ordained sign and seal of discipleship. The omission of the phrase in question from the reliable manuscripts raises doubts about its authenticity. Nonetheless, the eunuch's question demonstrates his intention to commit himself to Christ, publicly profess His name, and dedicate himself to His service.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There is no reason for supposing Philip to have preached to him the necessity of baptism."
2. "This was made very early, as Irenaeus has it."
3. "The authorities against this verse are too strong to permit its insertion."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Behold water!" as if already his mind filled with light and his soul set free, he was eagerly looking out for the first water in which he might seal his reception of the truth and be enrolled among the visible disciples of the Lord Jesus.
2. Philip had probably told him that this was the ordained sign and seal of discipleship, but the eunuch's question was likely the first proposal of its application in this case. 
3. [Note: The :- is wanting in the principal manuscripts and most venerable versions of the New Testament. It seems to have been added from the formularies for baptism which came into current use.]

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is well known, however, that there is no large river or very considerable stream in this vicinity."
2. "This shows that he had been instructed by Philip on the nature and design of baptism."
3. "It evinces also a purpose at once to give himself to Christ, to profess his name, and to be dedicated to his service."

### John Calvin:
1. "For it must needs be that faith was after a sort ripe in his heart, seeing that he brake out into external profession with such desire."
2. "Therefore, as he embraced that willingly which he heard concerning Christ, so now he breaketh out with a godly zeal into the external confession of faith; neither doth he think it sufficient for him to believe inwardly before God, unless he testifieth before men that he is a Christian."
3. "Thus must we take that which David saith, That he loveth the Lord with all his heart...The faith of the whole heart is that which, having living roots in the heart, doth yet notwithstanding desire to increase daily."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A proof, says Wordsworth, â€˜that Philip, in preaching Jesus, had preached the necessity of baptismâ€™ (so Aug.)."
2. "By the expression, 'Philip preached to him Jesus,' St. Luke implies that Philip preached not only what is to be believed concerning Christ, but what is to be done by those who are joined to the unity of the body of Christ, and so preached to him the main points of Christian faith and duty."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "What doth hinder me to be baptized?" - Evidently Philip had said something about baptism following faith and conversion.
2. "Verse Acts 8:37 is not a genuine part of Acts, a western addition."

### John Gill:
1. "The question shows that he had some knowledge of the ordinance of baptism, which he had received from the ministry and conversation of Philip."
2. "It also suggests that there are some things which might be a just bar to this ordinance, as want of grace, and a disorderly life and conversation."
3. "Nothing should hinder: not any thing on his side; not a sense of his own unworthiness, which will never be otherwise, but rather increase; nor the corruptions of his heart and nature, which will always remain, as long as he is in the body; nor fears of falling away, since there cannot be more danger after baptism than before."

### John Wesley:
1. "Thus, even the circumstances of the journey were under the direction of God."
2. "The kingdom of God suits itself to external circumstances, without any violence, as air yields to all bodies, and yet pervades all."
3. "Probably he had been circumcised: otherwise Cornelius would not have been the first fruits of the Gentiles."
