# Acts 8:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The importance of faith in Christ and the profession of it as prerequisites to baptism is evident. This underscores the necessity of a heartfelt acceptance of the truth of the Gospel. In doing so, one aligns themselves with the profound beliefs concerning the person, offices, and grace of Christ, which serve as a comprehensive summary of the essential articles of faith. Ultimately, it is not just an intellectual understanding but a wholehearted surrender of one's heart, will, and affections to these truths that constitutes a proper qualification for partaking in the Lord's Supper.
