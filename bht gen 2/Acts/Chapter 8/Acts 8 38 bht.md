# Acts 8:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As the chariot came to a halt, both Philip and the eunuch stepped out, ready for the next step. They went down to the water together, and there, in accordance with the ancient practice, Philip baptized him. While some argue for immersion, it is important to note that the text itself does not explicitly state the mode of baptism.
