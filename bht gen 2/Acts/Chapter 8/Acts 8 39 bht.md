# Acts 8:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:

The Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip with a miraculous swiftness, demonstrating that his disappearance was supernatural. This event serves as a testimony that Philip was not motivated by personal gain in his ministry, but rather was directed by the Spirit. As he went on his way, the Ethiopian eunuch rejoiced, having received the saving knowledge of Christ and being admitted to the holy ordinance of baptism. It is a reminder to all servants of Christ to serve selflessly and to find joy in the treasures of God's mercy and the gift of himself in his Son.
