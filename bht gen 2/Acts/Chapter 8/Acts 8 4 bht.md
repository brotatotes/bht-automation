## BHT:
The scattered believers took the opportunity to spread the message of the Gospel wherever they went, preaching the word of God and sharing the good news of peace, pardon, righteousness, and salvation through Jesus Christ. Thus, the dispersion of these believers served as a catalyst for the rapid spread of the Gospel message, as they communicated the truth and continued the thread of the story of God's redemptive work.
