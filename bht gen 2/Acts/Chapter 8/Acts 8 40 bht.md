## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "AZOTUS or ASHDOD was one of the five principal cities of the Philistines, never, though nominally in Judah, thoroughly subjugated by the Jews."
2. "At present, it is a small village, retaining the name Esdud, but no remains."
3. "τὰς πόλεις πάσας, viz. Ekron, Jamnia, Joppa, Apollonia, on the direct road: or, if he deviated somewhat for the purpose, Lydda also."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Philip was found—that is, 'found himself,' 'made his appearance': an expression confirming the miraculous manner of his transportation."
2. "As the chariot of the Gospel rolls on, other agents are raised up, each suited to his work."
3. "But 'he that soweth and he that reapeth shall rejoice together.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word is often used in this sense. [...] It does not mean here that there was any miracle in the case, but that Philip, after leaving the eunuch, came to or was in Azotus." 
2. "Azotus - This is the Greek name of the city which by the Hebrews was called Ashdod. [...] It was a place of great strength and consequence."
3. "He preached in all the cities - Joppa, Lydda, Askelon, Arimarthea, etc., lying along the coast of the Mediterranean."

### John Calvin:
1. "Thither was Philip carried; there began he to take his journey on foot after the manner of men, sowing the seed of the gospel wheresoever he became, [passed.] This is surely rare and wonderful stoutness, that he spreadeth the name of godliness in his journey."
2. "And whereas Luke saith expressly that he preached in all cities until he came to Cesarea, and doth not declare that he returned to Samaria, we may thereby conjecture that he staid at Cesarea for a time; and yet I leave this indifferent."
3. "Strenuitas, strenuousness, activity."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Cæsarea became Philip’s home. He probably made it for many years the centre of missionary enterprises." 
2. "Cæsarea was distant about seventy miles from Jerusalem, and was situated on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea."
3. "Here the well-known Procurators Pontius Pilate, Felix, and Festus held their 'courts.' Here Paul was subsequently tried before that brilliant assembly, presided over by the Roman governor, and King Agrippa, and the infamous Princess Bernice."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He preached the gospel." 
2. "Imperfect middle describing the evangelistic tour of Philip."


### John Gill:
1. "Philip was found at Azotus,.... The same with the Ashdod of the Philistines, famous for the temple of Dagon."
2. "And passing through; or, as he passed along through that and other places: he preached in all the cities; that lay in his way; which shows his zeal and diligence."
3. "This place was famous for Jewish Rabbins, and their schools of learning; frequent mention is made of רבנין דקיסרין, 'the Rabbins of Caesarea'."

### John Wesley:
1. But Philip was found at Azotus — Probably none saw him, from his leaving the eunuch, till he was there.
