## BHT:
Philip, not to be confused with the apostle, steps in after Stephen is taken away. He travels to Samaria, a significant city that acts as a bridge between Jerusalem and the rest of the world.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The deacon; not, as apparently implied in the citation from Polycrates in Eus H. E. iii. 31, Acts 8:24, one of the twelve: this is precluded by Acts 8:1; Acts 8:14."
2. "As the words stand here (œÄœåŒªŒπŒΩ = œÑ·Ω¥ŒΩ œÄœåŒªŒπŒΩ, after Œµ·º∞œÇ, compare also 2Pe 2:6), seeing that Œ£Œ±ŒºŒ¨œÅŒµŒπŒ± (Acts 8:9; Acts 8:14; ch. Acts 9:31; Act 15:3) signifies the district, I should be inclined to believe that Sychem is here also intended."
3. "The inhabitants, implied in œÄœåŒªŒπœÇ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The persecution may have been directed especially against Stephen's colleagues." 
2. "The city of Samaria... furnished the bridge between Jerusalem and the world."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "His coming was attended with a remarkable 'revival of religion.' The word translated 'preach' here is not what is used in the previous verse. This denotes to 'proclaim as a crier,' and is commonly employed to denote the preaching of the gospel."
2. "It has been argued that because 'Philip' is said thus to have preached to the Samaritans, that 'therefore' all 'deacons' have a right to preach, or that they are, under the New Testament economy, an 'order' of ministers. But this is by no means clear."
3. "From this, it seems that he preached, not 'because' he was a 'deacon,' but because he had received a special 'appointment' to this business as an evangelist."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Philip. The deacon (Acts 6:5). Not the apostle."
2. "Christ [œÑŒøŒΩ œáœÅŒπœÉœÑŒøŒΩ] . Note the article, 'the Christ,' and see on Matthew 1:1."
3. "He did [ŒµœÄŒøŒπŒµŒπ] . Imperfect. Kept doing from time to time, as is described in the next verse."

### John Calvin:
1. "He put the city of Samaria for the city Samaria which was laid waste by Hyrcanus, and built again by Herod, and called Sebaste."
2. "When he saith that Philip preached Christ, he signifieth that the whole sum of the gospel is contained in Christ."
3. "The sum is this, that Christ doth repair with his grace the world, being destroyed; which cometh to pass when he reconcileth us to the Father. Secondly, when he regenerateth us by his Spirit, that the kingdom of God may be erected in us when Satan is put to flight."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Philip is called the evangelist (Acts 21:8), where he is also mentioned as being married, and having four daughters virgins who prophesied."
2. "The title of evangelist, by which he is commonly known in ecclesiastical history, is owing partly to the fact that he was the first who, outside the holy city, proclaimed the Evangel, good news of Christ."
3. "Philip appears at once to have gone down to this old city, once the capital of the kingdom... It never regained anything of its old importance until the days of Herod the Great, who restored it to its ancient splendour."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Samaria is the name of the city here. This is the first instance cited of the expansion noted in verse Acts 8:4."
2. "Jesus had an early and fruitful ministry in Samaria (Acts 8:4), though the twelve were forbidden to go into a Samaritan city during the third tour of Galilee (Matthew 10:5), a temporary prohibition withdrawn before Jesus ascended on high (Acts 1:8)."
3. "Luke probably obtained valuable information from Philip and his daughters about these early days when in his home in Caesarea (Acts 21:8)."

### John Gill:
1. "This place lay lower than Jerusalem, and therefore Philip is said to go down to it."
2. "Philip preached the Gospel, and baptized, and wrought miracles, yet did not lay on hands, in order that persons might receive the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghost; this was peculiar to the apostles."
3. "He preached Christ unto them; that Christ was come in the flesh, that Jesus of Nazareth was the Christ, and that he was the Son of God, and the alone Saviour of men."

### John Wesley:
1. Stephen ‚Äî Being taken away, Philip, his next colleague, (not the apostle,) rises in his place.
