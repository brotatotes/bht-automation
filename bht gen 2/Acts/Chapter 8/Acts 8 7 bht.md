# Acts 8:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The unclean spirits, referred to as devils, were compelled to leave many afflicted individuals, as they cried out with a loud voice. This loud outcry demonstrated their unwillingness to depart and the irresistible power of Jesus that they could not withstand. Additionally, Philip, in the name of Christ, performed remarkable healings by speaking a word or touching those who were affected by palsies or lameness. These miraculous events showcased the authority and potency of Jesus and His chosen messengers in delivering people from the grip of evil and restoring them to wholeness.
