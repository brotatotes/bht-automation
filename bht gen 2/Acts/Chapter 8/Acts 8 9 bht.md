# Acts 8:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This man, Simon, was both wicked and deceitful. He pretended to be a believer and joined the community, but in reality he was a magician who practiced dark arts and used enchantments. He even had the audacity to claim that he was the great one mentioned by Moses, the seed of the woman, and a prophet. It is astounding how gullible people can be in the face of such an obvious impostor.
