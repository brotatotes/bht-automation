# Acts 9:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Saul, in his relentless persecution, displayed an intense and violent rage against the disciples of the Lord. His breathing out of threats and slaughter revealed the depth of his anger and desire to harm them. However, it is astounding to see how God's grace transformed him. The same mouth that once uttered words of destruction and death became the instrument through which the Gospel of the grace of God was proclaimed. Truly, the conversion of Saul serves as a powerful testament to the boundless riches of divine grace.
