# Acts 9:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Ananias, a respected disciple, was chosen to be the one to approach Saul, not only to reconcile the Jews towards him but to teach Saul humility and receptiveness. As the Lord appeared to Ananias in a vision, it was evident that Jesus, who had begun Saul's conversion, was the one at work here. The term vision implies a communication of future events to the mind, similar to looking upon a landscape. This encounter between Ananias and Saul served as an example for us to seek out those who may be lost and be ready to receive messengers with reverence.
