# Acts 9:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Behold, he prayeth was a powerful declaration from the Lord to Ananias about Saul's transformation. This sight of Saul in prayer was not only astonishing to Ananias, who had witnessed his relentless persecution, but also served as a confirmation that Saul had genuinely encountered the Lord. His fervent prayers were a testament to his newfound faith and repentance, reflecting a deep awareness of his own spiritual need. This revelation paved the way for Ananias to embrace Saul as a fellow believer and instrument of God's grace.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We are allowed to bear in mind that the ‚Äòstraight street,‚Äô which still extends through Damascus in long perspective from the eastern gate, is the street where Ananias spoke to Saul." (C. and H., p. 115.)
2. "Doubtless they (or at least the former) would long be remembered and pointed out by Christians; but, in the long degradation of Christianity in the East, most such identities must have been lost; and imposture is so easy, that it is hardly possible to cherish the thought that the spots now pointed out can be the true ones."
3. "TARSUS was the capital of the province of Cilicia, a large and populous city in a fruitful plain on the river Cydnus, which flowed through the midst of it, with a swift stream of remarkably cold water. Strabo speaks most highly of its eminence in schools of philosophy."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "There is something touching in the minuteness of these directions."
2. "Behold, he prayeth‚Äî'breathing out' no longer 'threatenings and slaughter,' but struggling desires after light and life in the Persecuted One."
3. "Beautiful note of encouragement as to the frame in which Ananias would find the persecutor."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This street extends now from the eastern to the western gate, about three miles, crossing the whole city and suburbs in a direct line."
2. "Behold, he prayeth - This gives us a full indication of the manner in which Saul passed the three days mentioned in Acts 9:9."
3. "It is always the attendant of true conviction for sin that we pray. The convicted Sinner feels his danger, and his need of forgiveness."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Street [œÅœÖŒºŒ∑ŒΩ]. See on Luke 14:21. A narrow street or lane."
2. "Straight. So called from its running in a direct line from the eastern to the western gate of the city."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul gave himself to prayer those three days."
2. "He suffered such long hunger, because he was after a sort deprived of sense, as men which are in a trance use to be."
3. "This was the reason why the Lord caused him to wait three days, that he might the more kindle in him an earnest desire to pray."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In the time when the events related in the ‚ÄòActs‚Äô took place, ‚Äòthe main thoroughfare of Damascus was the street called 'Straight,' so called from its running in a direct line from the eastern to the western gate."
2. "Tarsus was originally of great extent, and was built on both sides of the river Cydnus, and from its consisting of two distinct wings, divided by the Cydnus, took the plural name ‚ÄòTarsoi,‚Äô the wings."
3. "This fact of Saul‚Äôs praying seems mentioned by the Lord to reassure Ananias. The ‚Äòpersecutor ‚Äòwas praying to the God of the ‚Äòpersecuted.‚Äô So the Lord‚Äôs servant might surely look for a favourable reception even from the famous inquisitor Saul."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A run way (from œÅŒµœâ, to run) between the houses."
2. "Most of the city lanes were crooked like the streets of Boston (old cow-paths, people say), but this one still runs 'in a direct line from the eastern to the western gate of the city' (Vincent)."
3. "Since the ancients usually rebuilt on the same sites, it is probable that the line of the street of that name today is the same, though the actual level has been much raised."

### John Gill:
1. "And the Lord said unto him, arise.... Quickly, directly, immediately, from off thy bed; the case required haste and dispatch." 
2. "and inquire in the house of Judas; which was in that street: who this Judas was is not certain, that he was a Jew appears by his name, but whether a believing, or an unbelieving Jew, is not known."
3. "for behold he prayeth: so as he had never prayed before; now he prayed with the Spirit, and with the understanding, from a feeling sense of his wants."

### John Wesley:
1. Behold he is praying ‚Äî He was shown thus to Ananias.
