# Acts 9:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a vision, Saul saw Ananias, a man whose name he knew, confirming that Ananias was not an impostor. This mutual preparation between Saul and Ananias, as seen earlier with Cornelius and Peter, highlights the divine orchestration of their encounter. Ananias, aware of Saul's conversion and reputation, was assured by the Lord that Saul knew his appearance and even his name through a separate vision. This knowledge comforted and confirmed Ananias, and he was emboldened to carry out the Lord's instructions to go and lay hands on Saul so that he could regain his sight.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This word would set before Ananias more powerfully than any other, the state of Saul."
2. "A man, whose name in the same vision he knew to be Ananias. The sight of the man and the knowledge of his name were both granted him in his vision."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Thus, as in the case of Cornelius and Peter afterwards, there was a mutual preparation of each for each."
2. "But we have no account of the vision which Saul had of Ananias coming unto him and putting his hands upon him for the restoration of his sight, save this interesting allusion to it in the vision which Ananias himself had."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The vision was shown to Saul to assure him when Ananias came that he was no impostor."

3. "He was even apprised of his name, that he might be the more confirmed."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ confirmeth Ananias after this sort, There is no cause why thou shouldst fear but that he will receive thee willingly, forasmuch as he already knoweth thy shape by a vision."

1. "Coming in and laying" - Second aorist (ingressive) active participles picturing the punctiliar act as a sort of indirect discourse after verbs of sensation (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 1040-2).
