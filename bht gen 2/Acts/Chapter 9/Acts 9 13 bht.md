### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The objections of Ananias, and the removal of them by the Lord, display in a very touching manner the childlike relation of the believing soul to its Redeemer."
2. "The Saviour speaks with Ananias as a man does with his friend."

### John Calvin:
1. "The saints and servants of God are afraid of death, which thing keepeth them back from doing their duty; yea, it causeth them sometimes to stagger." 
2. "This is a sign of rare obedience, that although through fear of death he were somewhat slack at the first, yet having forgotten himself by and by, he maketh great haste to go whither Christ called him." 
3. "Therefore we may see a desire to obey mixed with fear."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Lord, is it possible that I should be sent on a mission of mercy to the chief enemy of Thy people?"
2. "'We have hitherto found them styled 'disciples,' 'believers,' 'brethren.' Christians are called 'saints' in the New Testament in three senses: (a) Generally as members of a visible and local community devoted to God’s service, and as such united in a common outward profession of faith; (b) more specifically as members of a spiritual community; and (c) in many cases as having personal and individual sanctity. The term probably always hints at the idea of a higher moral life imparted by Christ.'"

2. "Ananias had been at Damascus some time, and was not an eyewitness of the havoc Saul made of the church, only had the account of it from others."
3. "Believers in Christ are called his 'saints'... all which is an aggravation of the evil done them, and which will be avenged by Christ in his own time."

### John Wesley:
