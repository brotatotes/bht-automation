# Acts 9:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When news of Saul's intent to persecute reached Damascus, Christians were well aware of the impending danger. They invoked the name of Christ, not only as an expression of their allegiance and joy in Him but also as a means of seeking His protection and comfort. Calling upon Christ reflected their unwavering confidence and belief in His divinity. Ananias, in his hesitation to approach Saul, demonstrated our tendency to resist God's will in our moments of narrow perspective. His protest serves as a reminder of our own limitations and the need to trust in God's ultimate plan.
