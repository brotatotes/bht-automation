# Acts 9:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
And so, obedient to the heavenly vision, Ananias journeys to meet Saul. With love and tenderness, Ananias embraces him as a brother in Christ, recognizing his regeneration and belonging to the family of God. Ananias acknowledges the appearance of the glorified Jesus to Saul, assuring him of his divine mission and the compassionate love that Christ has for him, despite his past persecution. Ananias does not reveal all that Christ had spoken concerning Saul, as there are greater dignities and purposes to be unfolded in due time.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I can hardly think, with De W. and Meyer, that these words imply that the Lord had said to Ananias more than is above related: I would rather view them as a natural inference from what was said in Acts 9:15."
2. "It is remarkable again how Paul, speaking there to an infuriated Jewish mob, gives the words spoken just that form which would best gain him a favourable hearing with them e.g. ὁ θεὸς τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν, ἰδεῖν τὸν δίκαιον, πάντας ἀνθρώπους, avoiding as yet the hateful word ἔθνη."
3. "He there too gives ἀναστὰς βάπτισαι καὶ ἀπόλουσαι τὰς ἁμαρτίας σου, ἐπικαλεσάμενος τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ as part of the exhortation of Ananias."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "How beautifully childlike is the obedience of Ananias to 'the heavenly vision!'"
2. "This clearly shows in what sense the term 'Lord' is used in this book. It is JESUS that is meant."
3. "This knowledge by an inhabitant of Damascus of what had happened to Saul before entering it, would show him at once that this was the man whom Jesus had already prepared him to expect."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Putting his hands on him - This was not 'ordination,' but was the usual mode of imparting or communicating blessings."
2. "Brother Saul - An expression recognizing him as a fellow-Christian."
3. "Be filled with the Holy Ghost - See the notes on Acts 2:4."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Brother. In Christ.

### John Calvin:
1. "The apostles translated that custom taken from sacrifices to their use, either when they gave the visible graces of the Spirit or when they made any man minister of the Church."
2. "To this end doth Ananias lay his hands now upon Paul, partly that he may consecrate him unto God, partly that he may obtain for him the gifts of the Spirit."
3. "Let the readers note out of the chapter next going before how this ceremony is effectual to give the Spirit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The hesitation, the doubts and fears of Ananias, the Jewish Christian, and his subsequent visit and complete acceptance of the persecutor Saul as a brother saint chosen by the Master for a great and mighty work..."
2. "The words of the Master in the vision had done their work with Ananias. He at once proceeded to the house indicated to him in the vision, and going up to the dreaded inquisitor, now blind and humbled, greeted him with love and tenderness as one of the brotherhood of Jesus..."
3. "Here Ananias directly refers to the appearance of the glorified Jesus to Saul 'in the way.' These and similar declarations are important, as in later days Paul, in speaking of the evidences, seems to have attached the deepest importance to the fact that he had seen the Lord."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "All suspicion has vanished and Ananias takes Saul to his heart as a brother in Christ."
2. "Undoubted use of κυριος as Lord and applied to Jesus."
3. "This enduement of special power he will need as an apostle and as promised by Jesus."

### John Gill:
1. "And Ananias went his way... quietly yields, and cheerfully obeys" 
2. "he calls him 'brother', not because he was of the same nation, but because he was now of the same faith; because he was a regenerate person, and belonged to the family of God"
3. "and this appearance of his, partly to assure him of his mission from him; for otherwise he could have known nothing of his appearance to him; and partly to show the love of Christ to him, and though he had persecuted him in so violent a manner, he had a compassionate regard for him; as also to encourage and comfort him, who had been trembling, and astonished at what he had heard from Jesus."

### John Wesley:
1. "The Lord hath sent me — Ananias does not tell Saul all which Christ had said concerning him."
2. "It was not expedient that he should know yet to how great a dignity he was called."
