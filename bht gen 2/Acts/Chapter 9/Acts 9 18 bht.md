# Acts 9:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Ananias laid his hands on Saul, a miraculous recovery of sight took place, symbolized by the dropping off of scales. These scales, representing ignorance, sin, righteousness, the law, the Gospel, and Jesus as the Messiah, were removed in an instant. This instantaneous cure demonstrated that the restoration of Saul's sight was a supernatural act. Furthermore, Saul's immediate obedience to the sacrament of baptism, performed through immersion, highlights the significance of this ordinance for believers who have been enlightened and have gained a spiritual understanding of divine truths.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The recovery of sight is plainly related as miraculous, the consequence of the divinely appointed laying on of the hands of Ananias."
2. "And this scaly substance which fell from his eyes was thrown off in the process of the instantaneous healing."
3. "Great honour was here placed upon the sacrament of baptism, inasmuch as not even Saul, who had seen the Lord in special revelation and was an elect vessel, was permitted to dispense with this, the Lord’s appointed way of admission into His Church."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This shows that the blindness as well as the cure was supernatural. Substances like scales would not form naturally in so short a time."
2. "The medical precision of Luke's language here is to be noted."
3. "He was baptized as directed by Ananias (Acts 22:16)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word ὡσεὶ hōsei, 'as it had been,' is designed to qualify the following word. It is not said that scales literally fell from his eyes, but that an effect followed as if scales had been suddenly taken off."
2. "The effect was such as would take place if some dark, imperious substance had been placed before the eyes, and had been suddenly removed."
3. "The immediate effect shows that this was miraculous. Had it been a slow recovery, it might have been doubtful; but here it was instantaneous, and it was thus put beyond a question that it was a miracle."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The mention of the scales, or incrustations, such as are incidental to ophthalmia, is characteristic of the physician." 
2. "Luke had often heard Paul relate how he felt at that moment."

### John Calvin:
1. "The blindness of Paul, as we have said before did not proceed from fear alone or from amazedness; but by this means was he admonished of his former blindness, that he might quite abandon that boldness and vain confidence wherewith he was puffed up."
2. "For those must become fools, whosoever they be, which seem to themselves wise, that they may attain to true wisdom."
3. "He hath his eyes covered with scales, that, condemning all his knowledge of ignorance, he may learn that he hath need of new light, which he hath hitherto wanted; and he is taught that he must let [seek] the true light from none other save only from Christ, and that it is given by no other means save only through his goodness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The blinding glare of the light from heaven which surrounded the glorified Jesus had destroyed the sight, and now it was miraculously restored."
2. "The motives which led to the conversion of St. Paul have been often inquired into... It is surely impossible to entertain for a moment the idea that he was a fanatic, when we read his letters, and his story in these ‘Acts,’ and consider fairly his calmness, his wisdom, his prudence, his humility."
3. "If, then, the conversion of this man be the act neither of a fanatic nor of an impostor, to what was it due? He himself often answers the question: It arose from a miraculous appearance of Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Luke does not say that actual 'scales' fell from the eyes of Saul, but that it felt that way to him as his sight returned, 'as if' (ως)."
2. "Medical writers use the word λεπις for pieces of the skin that fall off."
3. "Was baptized (εβαπτισθη). First aorist passive indicative. Apparently by Ananias (Acts 22:16) as a symbol of the new life in Christ already begun."

### John Gill:
1. "These, as soon as Ananias put his hands upon him, dropped off; which were an emblem and representation of the scales of ignorance, of himself, of sin, of righteousness, of the law, of the Gospel, and of Jesus as the Messiah..."
2. "And this shows that baptism was performed by immersion; for had it been done in any other way, either by pouring or sprinkling a little water, Saul might have kept his seat, and water might have been brought to him..."
3. "And this also may suggest to us, that only enlightened persons are the proper objects of this ordinance; such as have the scales of darkness, ignorance, and unbelief removed from them, and have a spiritual sight and sense of divine things..."
