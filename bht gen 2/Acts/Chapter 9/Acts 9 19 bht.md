# Acts 9:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Saul had received food, it strengthened his body after his intense experience of encountering Christ and his subsequent fasting and prayer. He stayed with the disciples in Damascus for a period of time, likely forming a community of believers. It is interesting to note that even centuries later, there was still a church in Damascus, though it eventually faced persecution and its temple was taken away and dedicated to another faith.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "A few days; of quiet, and becoming acquainted with those as brethren, whom he came to persecute as infidels: but not to learn from them the gospel"
2. "Pearson places that journey before our ἐγένετο δέ, which however is manifestly against the sense of the text"
3. "Kuinoel and Olsh., after Acts 9:25, which the εὐθέως of Gal 1:16 will not allow"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "When he had received meat, he was strengthened—for the exhaustion occasioned by his three days' fast would not be the less real, though unfelt during his struggles."
2. "Then was Saul certain days with the disciples at Damascus—making their acquaintance, in another way than either he or they had anticipated, and regaining his tone by the fellowship of the saints; but not certainly in order to learn from them what he was to teach, which he expressly disavows."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Had received meat - Food. The word 'meat' has undergone a change since our translation was made. It then meant, as the original does, food of all kinds." 
2. "We have now passed through the account of one of the most remarkable conversions to Christianity that has ever occurred - that of the apostle Paul. His conversion has always been justly considered as a strong proof of the Christian religion." 
3. "If Paul was sincere; if his conversion was genuine, the Christian religion is true. Nothing else but a religion from heaven could produce this change."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Paul, in his Galatian Epistle (Acts 1:16-18), tells how, shortly after his conversion, he went into Arabia, then returned to Damascus, and after a space of three years went up to Jerusalem to see Peter and the older apostles."
2. "On the question of the Arabian journey referred to in Galatians 1:17, considerable doubt exists as to the meaning of the word ‘Arabia.’"
3. "It is, however, possible that Saul, after the first excitement wrought by his conversion had in some measure passed away, longed for solitude, for a time of meditation before setting out on his great life’s work, and in the stillness of the Arabian desert, near the Red Sea, the well-known desert of the wanderings of his fathers, sought and found opportunity for solitary communion with God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Was strengthened (ενισχυθη). First aorist passive indicative of ενισχυω, to receive strength (ισχυς), comparatively late verb and here only in the N.T. save Luke 22:43 where it is doubtful." 
2. "This clause belongs in sense to verse Acts 9:18." 
3. "Some days (ημερας τινας). An indefinite period, probably not long, the early period in Damascus before Saul left for Arabia (Galatians 1:13-24)."

### John Gill:
1. "He was strengthened; in body, being before very weak and feeble; not so much through fatigue of his journey, as through the fear and surprise the appearance of Christ to him, and his words, threw him into; as also through his fasting so long, and his continuance and constancy in prayer all this while, and the attention he gave to the divine instructions which were communicated to him, internally and externally."
2. "These disciples, with the new converts afterwards, it is highly probable, formed a church state in Damascus."
3. "even in the 'eighth' century, though the Arabians ravaged in those parts, yet still a church continued here for some time, till Ulid, the prince of the Saracens, took away the temple from the Christians of this place, and dedicated it to Mahomet."
