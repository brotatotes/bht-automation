# Acts 9:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Damascus, an ancient city in the heart of a rich and plentiful region, was the destination of Saul's journey. The presence of Christians in Damascus suggests that the Gospel had already reached there. Saul, driven by intense zeal and cruelty, sought authorization from the high priest and the Sanhedrin to persecute these followers of the way. The term the way was a distinctive expression used to refer to the Christian religion. Saul's intention was to eradicate the name of Christ by violently suppressing the God-fearing believers, even targeting women as an added display of his cruelty.
