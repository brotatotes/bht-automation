# Acts 9:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Saul, who later became Paul, had a profound conversion experience. After his encounter with Jesus, he immediately embraced his new identity as a follower of Christ and began preaching the gospel. He boldly proclaimed Jesus as the Son of God, emphasizing his divine nature and the fact that he was the long-awaited Messiah. Paul's preaching reflected his personal knowledge of Christ, and he wasted no time in sharing this revelation with others. His transformation was evident as he fearlessly proclaimed the truth of Jesus' identity to all who would listen.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The alteration to χριστόν has probably, as Meyer suggests, been made from doctrinal considerations, to fix on ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ θεοῦ the theological sense, that Christ is the Son of God instead of that which it now bears..."
2. "Be this as it may, the following τὸ ὄνομα τοῦτο ( Act 9:21 ) is decisive for the reading Ἰησοῦν..."
3. "Οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ χριστός Act 9:22 still more so."

2. "preached Christ...that he is the Son of God"
3. "proving that this Jesus is very Christ"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was an evidence of the genuineness of his conversion that he was willing at once to avow himself to be the friend of the Lord Jesus."
2. "The reading accords much better with the subject than the common reading."
3. "Paul continued the practice of attending the synagogues; and in the synagogues anyone had a right to speak who was invited by the officiating minister."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "Christ was not yet current as his personal name."
3. "Paul's object was to establish the identity of Jesus the Nazarene with the Messiah."

### John Calvin:
1. "He who of late ran headlong against Christ with furious force, doth now not only submit himself meekly unto his will and pleasure but like a stout standard-bearer fighteth even unto the utmost danger to maintain his glory."
2. "Certain it is that he was not so quickly framed by Ananias’ industry, but that so soon as he had learned the first principles by man’s mouth, he was extolled by God unto higher things afterward."
3. "Paul teacheth that Jesus of Nazareth is he, which he cannot do, unless he shake off those gross errors which he had conceived of the earthly kingdom of the Messiah."

2. "'He preached Jesus,' etc."
3. "The Son of God. This was one of the Jewish titles of Messiah."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He proclaimed Jesus... Jesus, not Christ, is the correct text here. He did this first preaching in the Jewish synagogues, a habit of his life when possible, and following the example of Jesus."
2. "That he is the Son of God... This is Paul's platform as a Christian preacher, one that he always occupied to the very end... It is the conclusion that Saul now drew from the vision of the Risen Christ and the message through Ananias."
3. "By 'the Son of God' Saul means the Messiah of promise and hope... Peter laid emphasis on the Resurrection of Jesus as a glorious fact and proclaimed Jesus as Lord and Christ. Paul boldly calls Jesus the Son of God with full acknowledgment of his deity from the very start."
