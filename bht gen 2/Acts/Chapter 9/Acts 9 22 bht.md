# Acts 9:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Saul's strength, not physical but mental, increased day by day. His spiritual gifts and knowledge grew, along with his confidence and eloquence in speaking. As he engaged in debates, he not only strengthened his own convictions but also convinced others through his new and powerful arguments. By skillfully connecting and comparing Old Testament passages, he definitively demonstrated that Jesus of Nazareth fulfilled the prophecies and characteristics of the long-awaited Messiah.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I regard the μᾶλλον ἐνεδυναμοῦτο, as the only words beneath which can lie concealed the journey to Arabia." 
2. "Paul mentions this journey (Gal 1:17) with no obscure hint that to it was to be assigned the reception by him, in full measure, of the Gospel which he preached."
3. "And such a reception would certainly give rise to the great accession of power here recorded."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "His conviction of the truth of the Christian religion became stronger every day, and hence his moral strength or boldness increased."
2. "Paul confuted the Jews, and by so doing he was the occasion of their tumultuous proceedings, or he so enraged them as to lead to great agitation and excitement - a very common effect of close and conclusive argumentation."
3. "It means that Paul showed by strong and satisfactory arguments that Jesus of Nazareth was the true Messiah."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Confounded. See on ch. Acts 2:6." 
2. "Proving [συμβιβαζων] . The verb means to bring or put together : hence to compare and examine, as evidence, and so to prove."
3. "The Christ. Note the article. Not a proper name, but an appellative. See on ver. 20."

### John Calvin:
1. "He waxed strong, saith he, that is, he got the victory in disputation; his confession did carry with it great force and efficacy."
2. "For the word confounded, which Luke useth, doth signify, that, forasmuch as Paul did urge them out of measure, they were so stricken that they could not tell where they were."
3. "Therefore, so often as heretics stand up to resist the true faith, so often as wicked men endeavor to overthrow all godliness, so often as the ungodly do obstinately resist, let us remember that we must fet [seek] armor hence."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The omission of any mention of this journey here can only arise from one or two causes: (1) Whether Paul himself were the source of the narration or some other narrator,  the intentional passing over it as belonging more to his personal history than to that of his ministry."
2. "(1) if the omission was intentional, to record a remarkable accession of power to Saul’s ministry without particularising whence or how it came; (2) if it was unintentional, as a simple record of that which was observed in him, but of which the source was to the narrator unknown."
3. "Proving that this is the very Christ  Literally, bringing together, showing the connection between the words of the Old Testament prophets and the life and work of Jesus of Nazareth."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Increased the more (μαλλον ενεδυναμουτο). Imperfect passive indicative of ενδυναμοω, to receive power (late verb), progressive increase in strength as opposition grew."
2. "Confounded (συνεχυννεν). Imperfect active indicative of συνχυννω (late form of συνχεω, to pour together, commingle, make confusion. The more Saul preached, the more the Jews were confused."
3. "Proving (συνβιβαζων). Present active participle of συνβιβαζω, old verb to make go together, to coalesce, to knit together. It is the very word that Luke will use in Acts 16:10 of the conclusion reached at Troas concerning the vision of Paul."

### John Gill:
1. "But Saul increased the more in strength....Not of body, but of mind; his gifts and graces, and spiritual light and knowledge increased; his abilities were greater; his fortitude of mind, boldness, and freedom of speech, every day increased."
2. "He got more, and new, and fresh arguments, by which he himself was confirmed, and he confirmed others in the truths of Christ."
3. "Proving that this is very Christ; by joining and knitting passages of Scripture in the Old Testament together, by producing and citing express testimonies from thence, and by comparing the prophecies and the characters of the Messiah in them, with Jesus of Nazareth, he proved to a demonstration that he must be the Messiah."
