# Acts 9:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Saul spent many days in Damascus, preaching Christ in the synagogues before going into Arabia for about three years. The Jewish community in Damascus was furious with Saul, and their plot to kill him was thankfully revealed. The Lord protected Saul and allowed him to continue his mission. This period of time in Damascus and Arabia was a crucial season in Saul's life, as it allowed him to grow and deepen his understanding of the Gospel. God's providence and protection are evident in Saul's transformation from persecutor to preacher.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We have thus an account of the 'many days' here referred to by Luke. And in this instance we have a striking example of the truth and honesty of the sacred writers."
2. "The two accounts, therefore, are like the two parts of a tally; neither is complete without the other; and yet, being brought together, they so exactly fit as to show that the one is precisely adjusted to the other."
3. "The writers had formed no collusion or agreement to impose on the world; that they are separate and independent witnesses; that they are honest men; that their narratives are true records of what actually occurred."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. To kill. See on Luke 23:32.

### John Calvin:
1. "The Lord did not suffer the course which he had begun well to be broken off so soon, so he doth with his wonderful counsel hinder the purposes of the enemies, stay their endeavors, restrain their malice and madness, whilst that he furthereth the gospel." 
2. "The unadvised and rash heat of zeal will always almost break out into such cruelty, unless men suffer themselves to be ruled by the word of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Saul, as inflexible in the defense of the Gospel as before, through ignorance he had been furious against it, was willing, we cannot doubt, to lay down his life for his creed; but Providence had destined him for many a long year to stand forth as the great champion of the Church, and to carry its standard triumphantly into far remoter regions."
2. "The gates of Damascus were watched by the Jews day and night to prevent his escape."
3. "The plot against his life was divulged, and the disciples took him, and at midnight let him down through the window of one of the houses built upon the wall."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul there states definitely that he went away from Damascus to Arabia and returned there before going back to Jerusalem and that the whole period was about 'three years' which need not mean three full years, but at least portions of three." 
2. "We are at perfect liberty to supplement the narrative in the Acts with items from Paul's Epistles."
3. "Saul now knew what Stephen had suffered at his hands as his own life was in peril in the Jewish quarter of Damascus. It was a picture of his old self. He may even have been scourged here (2 Corinthians 11:24)."

1. "The Jewish writers observe that the phrase, 'many days', signify at least three days; for by 'days', in the plural number, two must be designed, and many signifies a third, or that one at least is added to them."
2. "Such a space of time is designed by the many days here; for when the apostle had stayed a little while at Damascus, and preached Christ in the synagogues, he went into Arabia, where he continued about three years."
3. "The Jews took counsel to kill him; being filled with indignation at him, that he had changed his religion, and from a persecutor became a preacher of the Gospel."
