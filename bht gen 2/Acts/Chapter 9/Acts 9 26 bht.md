# Acts 9:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle Paul's journey to Jerusalem is an important event that he recounts, but interestingly, he omits the three years he spent in Arabia. This omission is curious because it is not mentioned in Acts 9:26-30 or Acts 22:17-21. It raises questions about why Paul chose to skip over this significant period in his life. It may be that he wanted to focus on his arrival in Jerusalem and his subsequent interactions with Peter and the other disciples.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The purpose of this journey was to become acquainted with Peter, a resolution probably taken during the conspiracy of the Jews against him at Damascus, and in furtherance of his announced mission to the Gentiles."
2. "By conference with the Apostles, his sphere of work might be agreed on."
3. "And this purpose his escape enabled him to effect."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And when Saul was come to Jerusalem... to see Peter... he assayed to join himself to the disciples."
2. "They were all afraid of him... knowing him only as a persecutor of the faith."
3. "The rumor of his conversion... passing away during his long absence in Arabia."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They remembered his former violence against Christians. They had an instinctive shrinking from him, and suspicion of the man that had been so violent a persecutor."
2. "It is not unnatural...to have doubts respecting an open and virulent enemy of the gospel who suddenly professes a change in favor of it. The human mind does not easily cast off suspicion of some unworthy motive...Confidence is a plant of slow growth, and starts up, not by a sudden profession, but is the result of a course of life which is worthy of affection and of trust."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Join himself. See on ch. Acts 5:13; Luke 14:15; Luke 10:11.

### John Calvin:
1. "First, what remaineth but that he fall away from the Church, seeing he is not received? But when he remembereth the life which he had led aforetime he marvelleth not that they are afraid of him."
2. "This was true conversion, that whereas he raged horribly before, he doth now valiantly suffer the storms of persecutions; and, in the meantime, when as he cannot be admitted into the company of the godly, he waiteth with a quiet mind until God reconcile them unto him."
3. "And from this submission was he exalted unto the highest degree of honor, that he might be the principal doctor of the Church, even unto the end of the world. But no man is fit to be a teacher in the Church save only he who willingly submitteth himself, that he may be a fellow disciple with other men."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He returned to the capital poor, despised, a proscribed outlaw, his brilliant earthly prospects blasted, only burning to preach the Name of the Crucified, whose devoted followers he had once persecuted with so bitter, so relentless a hostility."
2. "He might have again, as he approached the city gates, trodden the very spot where he had so exultantly assisted in the death of Stephen; and he entered then perfectly willing, were it Godâ€™s will, to be dragged out through them to the same fate."
3. "The sudden appearance of Voltaire in a circle of Christians, claiming to be one of them, would have been something like this return of Saul to Jerusalem as a professed disciple."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He returns distrusted by the disciples and regarded by the Pharisees as a renegade and a turncoat."
2. "They had probably heard of his conversion, but they frankly disbelieved the reports and regarded him as a hypocrite or a spy in a new role to ruin them."
3. "The present tense is here retained in indirect discourse according to the common Greek idiom."

### John Gill:
1. "Grace had made a strange alteration in him; those whom he hated, and was exceeding mad against, he now loves; they are the excellent ones in the earth in whom is all his delight..."
2. "It is the duty and interest of every gracious soul to join himself to a church of Christ, which consists of the disciples of Christ, as the church at Jerusalem did..."
3. "And a great privilege it is to be in such a relation, having the grace of God; for such have the best of company, and the most refreshing ordinances; are in the greatest safety..."


### John Wesley:
1. And coming to Jerusalem â€” Three years after, Galatians 1:18. These three years St. Paul passes over, Acts 22:17, likewise.
