# Acts 9:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Barnabas likely had previous knowledge of Saul's conversion and ministry, as he may have been acquainted with him before. It is significant that Barnabas stood by Saul at a crucial moment, despite the evidence against him, demonstrating his insight and courage. Barnabas played a key role in introducing Saul to Peter and James, vouching for Saul's story and emphasizing his vision of Jesus and bold preaching. This declaration by Barnabas was important for gaining the trust and acceptance of the church. It is essential for those previously opposed to the truth to prove their transformation before being trusted.
