# Acts 9:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A certain man named Æneas is mentioned in the text. It is notable that his Greek name suggests he was a Hellenist. He had been sick of the palsy for eight years and was bedridden. The significance of his name, which means worthy of praise, adds depth to the story. This man's condition, having lasted for many years, seemed incurable, and he and his loved ones had likely given up hope of his restoration.
