# Acts 9:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus Christ makes you completely well. Peter, knowing that Christ would heal this man through him at this moment, does not claim credit for himself but attributes the miraculous healing to Christ, whose name and power the apostles relied on for their miracles. This man, like the one at the Bethesda pool, is likely to have made his bed to show that he was truly healed.
