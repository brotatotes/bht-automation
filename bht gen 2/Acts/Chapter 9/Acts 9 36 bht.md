# Acts 9:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Tabitha, which is by interpretation Dorcas, was a woman who was full of good works and constantly employed in doing good. Her character and actions aligned with the meaning of her name, which signifies a roe or fawn, an animal known for its beauty. Tabitha was likely a Hellenist Jew known among the Hebrews by the Syriac name Tabitha. Her exemplary life of generosity and kindness serves as an inspiration and example for us all.
