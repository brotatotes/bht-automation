# Acts 9:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The resurrection of Dorcas must have been a truly astonishing event, filling both her and her friends with incredulity. It served as a powerful testimony to the confirmation of the Gospel and the faith of the early Christians. While others may have rejoiced at her return to life, Dorcas herself likely viewed it as a matter of resignation, having been called back to the transient world. Nevertheless, she undoubtedly continued to passionately devote herself to the service of her Savior and God in the time she had left.
