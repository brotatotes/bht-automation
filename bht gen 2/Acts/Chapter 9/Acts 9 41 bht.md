# Acts 9:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He gave her his hand and lifted her up, similar to how his Lord had done with his own mother-in-law. The revival of Tabitha, also known as Dorcas, served a greater purpose for the glory of God, even if it meant returning to the challenges of life. It brought joy and astonishment to all the saints, including Peter, the widows she had helped, and the disciples who had gathered together. Her revival was not just for her own sake, but for the benefit of others, demonstrating God's goodness and power through her life.
