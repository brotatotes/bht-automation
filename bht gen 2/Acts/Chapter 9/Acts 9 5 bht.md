# Acts 9:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus spoke to Saul, He identified Himself as the Nazarene, the very person Saul had persecuted. Jesus wanted Saul to understand the significance of his actions and the opportunity for transformation. Resisting the call of Christ would only lead to ruin, as reflected in the metaphor of kicking against the goads. This proverb illustrates the futility and pain of opposing God's will. In this encounter, Saul's heart was softened, and he surrendered his life to the Risen Christ. This surrender represented his conversion, as he recognized the real personhood of Christ and yielded his will to Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Such appearances could hardly form the subject of autoptic testimony which should rank with that of the other apostles: this, on the contrary, was no ·ºîŒ∫œÉœÑŒ±œÉŒπœÇ, but the real bodily appearance of the risen Jesus: so that it might be adduced as the ground of testimony to His Resurrection."
2. "It is natural that the account of the historian should be less precise than that of the person concerned, relating his own history."

1. "In his amazement and confusion, he naturally asked who it was that was thus addressing him." 
2. "There can be no doubt that he had often blasphemed his name, and profanely derided the notion that the Messiah could come out of Nazareth. Jesus here uses, however, that very designation. 'I am Jesus the Nazarene, the object of your contempt and scorn.'"

2. "Whose name thou art doing many things against, and whose people thou art destroying."
