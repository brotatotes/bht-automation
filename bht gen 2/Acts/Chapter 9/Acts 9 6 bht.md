# Acts 9:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Saul, filled with a sense of sin and guilt, trembled at the sight of his wrongdoing. In this state of deep conviction, he eagerly asked, What wilt thou have me to do, Lord? It is striking to see how God, in His wisdom, sends Saul to be taught by a man, just as He did with Cornelius. The Lord's condescension in using human agents to guide and instruct us is truly admirable. Saul's willingness to do whatever he was told shows his earnest desire for both reconciliation and salvation.
