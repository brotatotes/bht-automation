# Acts 9:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Saul encountered a blinding light and fell to the ground, the men journeying with him also experienced a similar astonishment. They were struck with amazement, rooted in their places in awe of what they saw and heard. Though they heard the sound, they were unable to comprehend the words spoken, unable to understand the voice that came from heaven. They stood up before Saul and witnessed the light, but they did not see Jesus himself. This incredible event displayed the power and presence of God, leaving them speechless and in wonder.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Two accounts seemingly (and certainly, in the letter) discrepant; but exceedingly instructive when their spirit is compared."
2. "The devout and intelligent student of Scripture will see in such examples a convincing proof of the simple truth of the narrative, the absence of all endeavour to pare away apparent inconsistencies or revise them into conformity."
3. "This error arises from forgetting the peculiar character of the verb ἵστημι with regard to transitive and intransitive meanings. ἕστηκα is strictly present, εἱστήκειν imperfect: as much so as sto and stabam."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "if the standing posture be intended, we have only to suppose that though at first they 'all fell to the earth,' they arose of their own accord while Saul yet lay prostrate."
2. "Just as 'the people that stood by heard' the voice that saluted our Lord with recorded words of consolation and assurance...so these men heard the voice that spake to Saul, but heard not the articulate words."
3. "Apparent discrepancies like these, in the different narratives of the same scene in one and the same book of Acts, furnish the strongest confirmation both of the facts themselves and of the book which records them."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The narrative in that place refers to the immediate effect of the appearance of the light. They were immediately smitten to the ground together. This was before the voice spake to Saul, Acts 26:14."
2. "There is no improbability that they rose from the ground immediately, and surveyed the scene with silent amazement and alarm."
3. "In this place, the words 'heard not the voice' must be understood in the sense of 'understanding the words,' of hearing the address, the distinct articulation, which Paul heard."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Speechless [ενεοι] . Only here in New Testament.

### John Calvin:
1. "It may be that they heard the sound of the voice, yet did they not discern either who it was that spake, or what was spoken."
2. "His meaning is, that the voice proceeded from no man, but that it was uttered by God."
3. "To the end the miracle may carry the greater credit, Paul's companions see a light like to lightning; they see Paul lie prostrate; a voice they hear (though not distinctly) sounding from heaven; and yet, nevertheless, Paul alone is taught what he must do."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The words ‘stood speechless’ do not signify apparently that they stood erect, in distinction from lying prostrate, but that, overpowered with what they saw and heard, they were fixed, rooted as it were to the spot."
2. "It must also be borne in mind, that the fact, which it was especially desired that the reader or hearer of this narration should be impressed with, was not that the ‘men stood’ or were ‘fallen to the ground,’ this detail is utterly unimportant, but that they were speechless and confounded."
3. "The companions of Saul heard the sound of the words, while in Paul’s account (chap. Acts 22:9) ‘his companions did not understand what was spoken;' or in other words, Saul received a clear impression of what was being spoken, whilst those with him received only an indefinite one."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "That journeyed with him (ο συνοδευοντες αυτω)... with the associative instrumental."
2. "Hearing the voice, but beholding no man (ακουοντες μεν της φωνησ, μηδενα δε θεωρουντες)... a distinction between the 'sound' and the separate words spoken."
3. "They heard the sound (Acts 9:7), but did not understand the words (Acts 22:9)."

### John Gill:
1. "They were as if they were thunderstruck, and fastened to the earth."
2. "They heard the voice of Saul, saying, who art thou? and what wilt thou have me to do? but saw nobody that he spoke to, which surprised them."
3. "It is certain they did not hear the voice of Christ, that spake to him, Acts 22:9 or if they heard the voice of Christ, it was only the sound of his voice, but did not understand what he said."

### John Wesley:
1. "The men... stood - Having risen before Saul; for they also fell to the ground..."
2. "Hearing the noise — But not an articulate voice."
3. "And seeing the light, but not Jesus himself..."
