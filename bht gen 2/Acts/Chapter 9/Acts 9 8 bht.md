# Acts 9:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Saul regained his senses and opened his eyes, he found himself blinded, symbolizing the ignorance and spiritual blindness he had been living in. He was led by the hand into Damascus, a once mighty persecutor now helpless and dependent, fulfilling the prophecy in Zechariah 9:1. This sudden loss of sight served as proof of the reality of his encounter and marked the beginning of his transformation.
