# Acts 9:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The sudden blindness that befell Saul after his encounter with Christ marked a crucial turning point in his life. This physical state of darkness mirrored the spiritual blindness that had previously enveloped him. During these three days, he underwent a profound inner transformation, gaining a clearer insight into himself, his own sinful condition, and the person of Jesus. This period of blindness was not just a physical ailment, but a symbol of his journey towards spiritual enlightenment. It was a time of deep introspection, repentance, prayer, and an opening of his heart to the truths of the Gospel.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Œº·Ω¥ Œ≤ŒªŒ≠œÄœâŒΩ, his personal subjective state: Œø·ΩêŒ∫ ·ºîœÜ., the historical fact."
2. "Œø·ΩêŒ∫ ·ºîœÜ. . Œø·ΩêŒ¥·Ω≤ ·ºîœÄ., The effect produced on him by the Œø·ΩêœÅŒ¨ŒΩŒπŒøœÇ ·ΩÄœÄœÑŒ±œÉŒØŒ± (ch. Act 26:19), aided by his own deeply penitent and remorseful state of mind, rendered him indifferent to all sustenance whatever."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Such a period of entire abstinence from food, in that state of mental absorption and revolution into which he had been so suddenly thrown, is in perfect harmony with known laws and numerous facts."
2. "The double conviction must have immediately flashed upon him, that his whole reading of the Old Testament hitherto had been wrong, and that the system of legal righteousness in which he had, up to that moment, rested and prided himself was false and fatal."
3. "On the one hand, what self-condemnation, what anguish, what death of legal hope, what difficulty in believing that in such a case there could be hope at all; on the other hand, what heartbreaking admiration of the grace that had 'pulled him out of the fire,' what resistless conviction that there must be a purpose of love in it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Great grief always produces this effect. And it is not uncommon now for an awakened and convicted sinner, in view of his past sins and danger, to be so pained as to destroy his inclination for food, and to produce involuntary fasting."
2. "His blindness was literal. This state of darkness was necessary to humble him and fit him for his work. But the moment a sinner will give his heart to Christ, he may find peace."
3. "By the nature of the ease, as well as by the promises of the Bible, if a sinner will yield himself at once to the Lord Jesus, he will obtain peace."

### John Calvin:

2. "Then, when other things were unseen by him, he kept gazing on Jesus; so piercing, so deep was his remorse, that during this time he neither ate nor drank."
3. "He fasted and prayed in silence; the recollections of his early years, the passages of the ancient Scriptures which he had never understood, the thoughts of his own cruelty and violence, the memory of the last looks of Stephen, all these things crowded into his mind during the three days of solitude."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It was a crisis for Saul, this sudden blindness for three days."
2. "His appetite had gone as often happens in a crisis of the soul."
3. "These must have been days of terrible stress and strain."

### John Gill:
1. "Without bodily sight; for otherwise all this while his spiritual sight was increasing, and Christ was giving him by his Spirit a full view of himself, his state and case, and where his salvation was."

3. "This was likewise a manifest token to others, of what had happened to him in his journey, and ought to have humbled and convinced those bigoted Jews, to whom he had been sent from the sanhedrim."
