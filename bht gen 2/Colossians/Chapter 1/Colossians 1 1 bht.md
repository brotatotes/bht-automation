# Colossians 1:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle begins this letter by signing it with his name, as he did in his other letters, verifying his authority as an apostle. He specifies that he is an apostle of Jesus Christ, highlighting the fact that his mission was directly from Christ himself, not from any human authority. Additionally, he mentions Timothy, either to establish familiarity or to emphasize the unity between them in preaching the doctrine of Christ, hoping that their shared teachings would encourage the Colossians to remain steadfast in their faith.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "On his presence with the Apostle at the time of writing this Epistle, see Prolegg. to Past. Epp. § i. 5. Chrys. (and similarly Thl.) says on  ὁ ἀδελφός , οὐκοῦν καὶ αὐτὸς ἀπόστολος : but there seems no reason for this."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Timothy—He was with Paul at the time of writing in Rome."
2. "He had been companion of Paul in his first tour through Phrygia, in which Colosse was."
3. "Neither, probably, had seen the Colossian Church, but had seen, during their tour through Phrygia, individual Colossians."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There was a particular reason why Timothy should be associated with him in writing this Epistle."
2. "It is evident, however, from the manner in which Paul mentions him here, that he did not regard him as 'an apostle,' and did not wish the church at Colosse to consider him as such."
3. "If he had regarded Timothy as an apostle, or as having apostolic authority, it is not easy to conceive why he should not have referred to him as such in these letters to the churches."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul an Apostle. I have already, in repeated instances, explained the design of such inscriptions." 
2. "For he was not bound to one Church merely, but his Apostleship extended to all."
3. "The term saints which he applies to them is more honorable, but in calling them faithful brethren, he allures them more willingly to listen to him."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Χριστου Ιησου. This order in the later epistles shows that Χριστος is now regarded as a proper name and not just a verbal adjective (Anointed One, Messiah)."
2. "Paul describes himself because he is unknown to the Colossians, not because of attack as in Galatians 1:1."
3. "Timothy (Τιμοθεος). Mentioned as in I and II Thess. when in Corinth, II Cor. when in Macedonia, Phil. and Philemon when in Rome as here."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle puts his name to this epistle, by which he was known in the Gentile world, as he usually does in all his epistles; and styles himself 'an apostle,' as he was..."
2. "He calls himself an apostle 'of Jesus Christ'; not of men, he was not sent out by men, but by Christ..."
3. "He mentions him [Timotheus], either because he was known unto them, or that he might be so; and to show the agreement there was between them in the doctrine of Christ, which might have the greater weight with them to abide in it."
