# Colossians 1:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are empowered with all kinds of spiritual might, which is essential for them to face the various trials and temptations they encounter. This strength comes from above, from God's glorious power. It is His power that upholds all things, supports the saints in their trials, and preserves them on their journey of faith. This strength is not only for endurance but also for joyful perseverance, expressing thankfulness to God in the midst of suffering. It is through this strength that believers can fully submit to the will of God and embrace it with patience, longsuffering, and joyful perseverance.

"Power belongs to God, is a perfection of his nature, and has been, and is gloriously displayed in many things; as in the creation of the heavens and the earth; in the upholding of all things in their being; in the redemption and salvation of sinners; in their faith and conversion; in supporting the saints under various trials and exercises; and in the safe keeping them through faith unto salvation."
3. "This requires strength above that of nature, and a renewed supply of that of grace."

### John Wesley:
1. "Strengthened unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness — This is the highest point: not only to know, to do, to suffer, the whole will of God; but to suffer it to the end, not barely with patience..."
