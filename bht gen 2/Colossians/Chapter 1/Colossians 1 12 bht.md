# Colossians 1:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The glory that awaits us is not something we can attain on our own, but it is God who, through the process of justification and sanctification, makes us suitable and prepared for this heavenly glory. Our own efforts and merits are insufficient, and it is only by God's grace and work in us that we are made worthy to partake in the glorious inheritance that awaits the believers. It is humbling to recognize that it is God's doing, and not our own, that makes us fit for such glory.
