# Colossians 1:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's power delivers us from the bondage of darkness, rescuing us like captives taken from their captor's grasp. In this kingdom of darkness, Satan reigns, blinding minds and locking people away from the light. But God, in His great love, transfers us to the kingdom of His beloved Son, Jesus Christ, where we find true freedom and enlightenment. This radical change occurs through the work of regeneration, as we are called out of the darkness and into the marvelous light of Christ. Colossians 1:13.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

2. "The word is strictly local in its meaning, translated into the kingdom of the Son of His Love - the Son upon whom His Love rests: the strongest possible contrast to that darkness, the very opposite of God’s Light and Love, in which we were."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Those thus translated as to state, are also transformed as to character."

3. "This change is made in regeneration, by which we pass from the kingdom of darkness to the kingdom of light; from the empire of sin, ignorance, and misery, to one of holiness, knowledge, and happiness."

### John Calvin:

3. "As, then, our deliverance from the slavery of sin and death is the work of God, so also our passing into the kingdom of Christ. He calls Christ the Son of his love, or the Son that is beloved by God the Father, because it is in him alone that his soul takes pleasure."

"This deliverance is wrought out for them in the effectual calling, when they are internally called, and powerfully brought out of this darkness, by introducing light into them, revealing Christ in them, causing the prince of darkness to flee from them, and the scales of darkness and blindness to fall from their eyes."
