# Colossians 1:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Christ, we have the amazing blessing of redemption, which includes the remission of our sins. This is a deliverance from the captivity of sin and the punishment of death, a freedom from our enemies, and a rescue from all the effects of sin - death, hell, and future wrath. This redemption was brought about through the blood of Christ, which demonstrates the strict justice of God. Our forgiveness and acceptance are the result of Christ's voluntary passion, and it is through this forgiveness that our redemption begins, ultimately completed in the resurrection.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In whom we have Redemption, the remission of our sins."
2. "The more general word, ἁμαρτιῶν, the more special word, παραπτωμάτων: the meaning being the same."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "redemption—rather as Greek, 'our redemption.'"
2. "through his blood—omitted in the oldest manuscripts; probably inserted from 1 Peter 1:19."
3. "sins—Translate as Greek, 'our sins.' The more general term: for which Ephesians 1:7, Greek, has, 'our transgressions,' the more special term."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The passage here proves that we obtain forgiveness of sins through the blood of Christ."
2. "It does not prove that this is all that we obtain through that blood."
3. "See this explained in the notes at Ephesians 1:7."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Redemption [απολυτρωσιν] . See on Romans 3:24. Continuing the image of an enslaved and ransomed people. Omit through His blood."
2. "Forgiveness [αφεσιν] . See on remission, Romans 3:25; forgiven, James 5:15. Forgiveness defines redemption."
3. "Lightfoot's suggestion is very interesting that this precise definition may convey an allusion to the perversion of the term ajpolutrwsiv by the Gnostics of a later age, and which was possibly foreshadowed in the teaching of the Colossian heretics."

### John Calvin:
1. "In whom we have redemption...[meaning] the remission of sins...when God remits our transgressions, he exempts us from condemnation to eternal death...This is our liberty, this our glorying in the face of death." 
2. "He says that this redemption was procured through the blood of Christ, for by the sacrifice of his death all the sins of the world have been expiated."
3. "Let us...bear in mind, that this is the sole price of reconciliation, and that all the trifling of Papists as to satisfactions is blasphemy."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The phrase ‘through His blood’ is to be rejected, since it is sustained by no ancient Greek manuscript."
2. "The term ‘sins’ is more general. Redemption and forgiveness are ours only ‘in Christ.’"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In whom (εν ω). In Christ as in Ephesians 1:7. This great sentence about Christ carries on by means of three relatives."
2. "Our redemption (την απολυτρωσιν). See on Romans 3:24 for this great word (Koine), a release on payment of a ransom for slave or debtor."
3. "The forgiveness of our sins (την αφεσιν των αμαρτιων). Accusative case in apposition with απολυτρωσιν as in Ephesians 1:7 (remission, sending away). Only here we have αμαρτιων (sins) while in Ephesians 1:7 we find παραπτωματων (slips, fallings aside)."

### John Gill:
1. "Which is an excellent and wonderful blessing of grace saints have in and by Christ; and lies in a deliverance from sin, all sin, original and actual, under which they are held captive, in a state of nature, and by which they are made subject to the punishment of death."
2. "this redemption is a deliverance out of the hands of all their enemies, and from all evils and misery, the effects of sin, from death, and hell, and wrath to come."
3. "The means by which this blessing is procured, isthrough his blood... it not being to be effected without it, demonstrates the strictness of divine justice, and that the redemption of men is brought about in a way entirely consistent with the righteousness and holiness of God."

### John Wesley:
1. "The voluntary passion of our Lord appeased the Father's wrath, obtained pardon and acceptance for us." 
2. "So that forgiveness is the beginning of redemption, as the resurrection is the completion of it."
