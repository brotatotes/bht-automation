# Colossians 1:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle's intention in this passage is to emphasize the exalted status of Christ and his role as the visible manifestation of the invisible God. Christ is described as the exact image of God, representing and reflecting his divine perfections. By declaring Christ as the firstborn of all creation, the apostle highlights his position of supreme authority and preeminence. This title signifies not only his role as the firstborn son of Mary, but also his eternal existence as the begotten Son of the Father. This designation underscores Christ's divine nature and refutes any notion of his inferiority.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He is described, in His relation to God and His Creation, as the image of the invisible God, the first-born of all creation."
2. "The image of the invisible God refers to Christ as the visible manifestation of that which is invisible in God."
3. "The first-born of all creation implies that Christ is not only the first-born of His mother in the world, but also the first-begotten of His Father before the worlds."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Image" (eicon) involves "likeness" (homoiosis); but "likeness" does not involve "image." "Image" always supposes a prototype, which it not merely resembles, but from which it is drawn: the exact counterpart, as the reflection of the sun in the water: the child the living image of the parent.
2. Even before His incarnation He was the image of the invisible God, as the Word by whom God created the worlds, and by whom God appeared to the patriarchs.
3. This expression is understood by ORIGEN as declaring the Godhead of Christ, and is used by Him as a phrase to mark that Godhead, in contrast with His manhood.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The meaning is, that he represents to mankind the perfections of God, as an image, figure, or drawing does the object which it is made to resemble."
2. "The first-born, or the oldest son, among the Hebrews as elsewhere, had special privileges."
3. "The meaning, then, is, that Christ sustains the most exalted rank in the universe; he is pre-eminent above all others; he is at the head of all things."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Image is more than likeness which may be superficial and incidental. It implies a prototype, and embodies the essential verity of its prototype." 
2. "Of the invisible God [œÑŒøœÖ Œ∏ŒµŒøœÖ œÑŒøœÖ Œ±ŒøœÅŒ±œÑŒøœÖ] . Lit., of the God, the invisible. Thus is brought out the idea of manifestation which lies in image."
3. "The true sense is, born before the creation. Compare before all things, ver. 17. This fact of priority implies sovereignty. He is exalted above all thrones, etc., and all things are unto [ŒµŒπœÇ] Him, as they are elsewhere declared to be unto God."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ is called the image of God on this ground - that he makes God in a manner visible to us."
2. "We must, therefore, beware of seeking him elsewhere, for everything that would set itself off as a representation of God, apart from Christ, will be an idol."
3. "The reason of this appellation is immediately added - For in him all things are created, as he is, three verses afterwards, called the first-begotten from the dead, because by him we all rise again."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In Colossians 1:15-17, the reference is rather to the pre-incarnate Son in His relation to God and to His own creatures, in Colossians 1:18-20 to the incarnate and now glorified Son in His relations to His Church."
2. "The image of the invisible God. This indicates the relation to God, immanent and permanent. On this relation rests the actual revelation of God in the Person of Christ."
3. "The firstborn of (or, 'before') every creature (or, 'all creation'). 'The first born with respect to every creature; He was born before every creature. He is not the first created, the previous clause as well as the terms here chosen forbid such a view."


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus is the very stamp of God the Father as he was before the Incarnation and is now."
2. "But the one who sees Jesus has seen God."
3. "Paul is here refuting the Gnostics who pictured Christ as one of the aeons by placing him before 'all creation'."

### John Gill:
1. "Not of deity, though the fulness of it dwells in him; nor of himself, though he is the true God, and eternal life; nor of the Spirit, who also is God, and the Spirit of the Son; but the Father." 
2. "He is the first Parent of every creature, 'for by him were all things created', or it may be understood of Christ, as the King, Lord, and Governor of all creatures being God's firstborn, he is heir of all things, the right of government belongs to him."
3. "This designs more than a shadow and representation; it includes sameness of nature and perfections; ascertains the personality of the Son, his distinction from the Father, whose image he is; and yet implies no inferiority, as the following verses clearly show, since all that the Father hath are his."

### John Wesley:
1. "By describing the glory of Christ, and his pre-eminence over the highest angels, the apostle here lays a foundation for the reproof of all worshippers of angels."
2. "The image of the invisible God ‚Äî Whom none can represent, but his only begotten Son; in his divine nature the invisible image, in his human the visible image, of the Father."
3. "The first begotten of every creature ‚Äî That is, begotten before every creature; subsisting before all worlds, before all time, from all eternity."
