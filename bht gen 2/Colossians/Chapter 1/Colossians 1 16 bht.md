# Colossians 1:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
All things were created through Christ, indicating that He played a role in the beginning, the ongoing progress, and the ultimate purpose of creation. His involvement in creation is not limited to the visible realm, but also includes the invisible realm of spiritual beings. It is important to recognize that Christ's role in creation signifies His supreme majesty, surpassing every other creature. When considering the hierarchy of angelic beings, thrones are superior to dominions, and principalities hold a higher office than powers, illustrating the various roles these heavenly creatures have in relation to others.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In Him was created the universe—the things in the heavens and things on the earth, things visible and things invisible, whether thrones or lordships or governments or authorities" (on Colossians 1:16). 
2. "All sorts of such interpretations, by Teller and others, not worth recording, may be seen refuted in De W.): the whole universe has been created by Him and for Him" (on Colossians 1:16).
3. "He Himself is before all things, all things, and in Him the universe subsists" (on Colossians 1:17).

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The 'in Him' indicates that the Word is the ideal ground of all existence; the 'by Him,' below, that He is the instrument of actually realizing the divine idea."
2. "His essential nature as the Word of the Father is not a mere appendage of His incarnation, but is the ground of it."
3. "He is the final cause as well as the efficient cause."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He makes God known to us by his creative power, and by the same power in creation shows that he is exalted over all things as the Son of God."
2. "The repetition, and the varied statement here, are designed to express the truth with emphasis, and so that there could not be the possibility of mistake or misapprehension."
3. "The work of creation is the exertion of the highest power of which we can form a conception, and is often appealed to in the Scriptures by God to prove that he is divine..."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In Him, within the sphere of His personality, resides the creative will and the creative energy, and in that sphere the creative act takes place."
2. "All things [τα παντα] . The article gives a collective sense - the all, the whole universe of things."
3. "Here He appears as the mediating cause; through Him, as 1 Corinthians 8:6. Unto Him. All things, as they had their beginning in Him, tend to Him as their consummation, to depend on and serve Him."

### John Calvin:
1. "Not only, therefore, have those heavenly creatures which are visible to our eyes, but spiritual creatures also, been created by the Son of God."
2. "By thrones some understand Angels... let us understand by the term thrones that seat of blessed immortality which is exempted from all change."
3. "It becomes us to understand [the titles] in such a manner as to detract nothing from the glory of God alone; for he does not communicate his power to angels as to lessen his own; he does not work by them in such a manner as to resign his power to them; he does not desire that his glory should shine forth in them, so as to be obscured in himself."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Because (more exact than ‘for’, giving a reason for Colossians 1:15), in him (the emphatic phrase), as the conditional element of the creation, preexistent and all-including, were all things created." 
2. "Things visible and things invisible. To the distinction of place, that of nature is added. There is no necessity for making this pair correspond exactly with the last, although ‘things invisible’ refers mainly to the heavenly world of spirits, which are classified in what follows."
3. "All things have been created through him and unto him. ‘All things’ is solemnly repeated, but besides the fact of creation we have here the permanent result. This result has Him as its end; hence ‘unto Him’ is added. All three phrases are needed to indicate the relation of the Son to creation."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The whole of creative activity is summed up in Christ including the angels in heaven and everything on earth."
2. "The permanence of the universe rests, then, on Christ far more than on gravity. It is a Christo-centric universe."
3. "This is the only remaining step to take and Paul takes it... See Ephesians 1:10 for similar use of εν αυτω of Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "The creation of all things, by him, is not to be understood of the new creation, for whenever that is spoken of, the word 'new' is generally used, or what is equivalent to it, or some clause or phrase added, which determines the sense, and is not the case here."
2. "These 'all things' can only refer to the things that are made: eternal things can never be said to be created; this is a contradiction in terms; the Father is not created by him, nor he himself as the Son of God, nor the Spirit; but everything that is made is created by him."
3. "The apostle's sense is, that the angels, the invisible inhabitants of the upper world, are all created by Christ, let them be called by what names they will, that the Jews, or the false teachers, or any sort of heretics of those times thought fit to give them, whether they called them thrones or dominions, etc." (Total: 137 words)
