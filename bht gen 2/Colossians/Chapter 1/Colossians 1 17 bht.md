# Colossians 1:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He is before all things, existing from everlasting to everlasting, surpassing angels and humans in every aspect of his nature, names, duties, and achievements. He sustains the entire universe by the power of his word, upholding the heavens and supporting the very foundations of the earth. Without him, the entire fabric of creation would collapse, as all things find their foundation and coherence in him. Is there any doubt that he is anything less than the supreme God?

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And He Himself (the great HE) is (implying divine essential being) before all things," in time, as well as in dignity.
2. Since He is before all things, He is before even time, that is, from eternity.
3. The Son of God is the Conserver, as well as the Creator of all things.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "And he is before all things - As he must be, if he created all things."
2. "The fair and proper meaning of the word 'before' is, that he was before all things in the order of existence."
3. "And by him all things subsist - Or are sustained... If this be the proper interpretation, then it is the ascription to Christ of infinite power and infinite wisdom."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He emphasizes the personality, is the preexistence" (Lightfoot).
2. "Christ not only creates, but maintains in continuous stability and productiveness."
3. "He, the Wisdom of God, holds the universe in tune together."

### John Calvin:
1. "All things were created by him, and for him."
2. "He places angels in subjection to Christ, that they may not obscure his glory, for four reasons: In the first place, because they were created by him; secondly, because their creation ought to be viewed as having a relation to him, as their legitimate end; thirdly, because he himself existed always, prior to their creation; fourthly, because he sustains them by his power, and upholds them in their condition."
3. "Thus he places the Son of God in the Highest seat of honor, that he may have the pre-eminence over angels as well as men, and may bring under control all creatures in heaven and in earth."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He (emphatic) is before all things. 'Before' in time, preexistent to 'all things,' not simply 'all beings.' He did not become thus preexistent, but 'is' prior in time."
2. "And in him all things subsist, more literally, 'stand together.' This is not a repetition of the first clause of Colossians 1:16: there the fact of creation is mentioned; here a more permanent relation is set forth. He keeps in organic permanence what was created in Him, through Him and unto Him; comp. Hebrews 1:3."
3. "Christ is the Living Centre, to which all things in creation converge, the Divine Keystone in the arch of the universe, on which the whole fabric leans."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The precedence of Christ in time and the preeminence as Creator are both stated sharply."
2. "The Son of God's love is the Creator and the Sustainer of the universe which is not evil."

### John Gill:
1. "He is before all things, in existence and in dignity, being preferable to angels and men in his nature, names, offices, and works."
2. "He upholds all things by the word of his power; the heavens have their stability and continuance from him; the pillars of the earth are bore up by him."
3. "The whole frame of nature would burst asunder and break in pieces, was it not held together by him; every created being has its support from him, and its consistence in him."

### John Wesley:
1. "And he is before all things — It is not said, he was: he is from everlasting to everlasting."
2. "And by him all things consist — The original expression not only implies, that he sustains all things in being, but more directly, All things were and are compacted in him into one system."
3. "He is the cement, as well as support, of the universe. And is he less than the supreme God?"
