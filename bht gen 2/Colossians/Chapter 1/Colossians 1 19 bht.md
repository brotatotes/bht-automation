### Marvin Vincent:
1. "It pleased the Father that in Him should all fullness dwell." - The subject of was well pleased, God, is omitted as in James 1:12, and must be supplied; so that, literally, the passage would read, God was well pleased that in Him, etc.
2. "The fullness denotes the sum - total of the divine powers and attributes. In Christ dwelt all the fullness of God as deity." - The word must be taken in its passive sense - that with which a thing is filled, not that which fills.
3. "Thus the phrase in Him should all the fullness dwell gathers into a grand climax the previous statements - image of God, first - born of all creation, Creator, the eternally preexistent, the Head of the Church, the victor over death, first in all things."
