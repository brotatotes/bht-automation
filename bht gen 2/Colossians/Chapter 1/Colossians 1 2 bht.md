## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἁγίοις should be taken (Mey.) as a substantive, not (De W.) with ἀδελφοῖς, in which case πιστοῖς, being already (as Mey.) presupposed in ἁγίοις, would be tame and superfluous."
2. "καὶ πιστοῖς ἀδελφοῖς ἐν χριστῷ seems to be a specifying clause, 'viz. to the &c.:"
3. "ἐν χρ. belongs closely to πιστοῖς ἀδελφοῖς or perhaps rather to ἀδελφοῖς alone, as Philippians 1:14; no article before ἐν χριστῷ being wanted, because no distinction between these and any other kind of brethren is needed the idea ἀδελφὸς-ἐν-χριστῷ being familiar."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "As 'saints' implies union with God, so 'the faithful brethren' implies union with Christian men." 
2. "The Lord Jesus Christ—supported by some oldest manuscripts omitted by others of equal antiquity."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Ancient monuments are buried, fertile lands overlaid, river - beds choked up, and streams diverted, fantastic grottos and cascades and arches of stone formed by this strange, capricious power, at once destructive and creative, working silently and relentlessly through long ages." 
2. "Fatal to vegetation, these incrustations spread like a stony shroud over the ground, gleaming like glaciers on the hillside, they attract the eye of the traveler at a distance of twenty miles, and form a singularly striking feature in scenery of more than common beauty and impressiveness."
3. "The city [Colossae] was the least important of any to which Paul's epistles were addressed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In spite of this there was much fertility in the valley with two other prosperous cities some ten or twelve miles away (Hierapolis and Laodicea)." 
2. "The church at Colossae was the least important of any to which Paul's epistles were addressed" (Vincent).
3. "But he had no greater message for any church than he here gives concerning the Person of Christ."

### John Gill:

3. "they were saints in him; they were chosen in him, and sanctified in him their head"
