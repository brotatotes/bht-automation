# Colossians 1:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through the blood of the cross, shed to reconcile mankind to God, we see the extent of God's good will and pleasure in providing salvation. Reconciliation implies a previous state of amity and friendship, reminding us of the original harmonious relationship disrupted by sin. This reconciliation showcases the glory of God's perfections, including grace, mercy, righteousness, and holiness. It addresses the enmity between man and God, as well as restoring harmony among those in paradise. The blood of Christ is the means of reconciliation, demonstrating God's love and desire to restore all things to unity with Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Scripture phrase, 'God reconciles man to Himself,' implies that He takes away by the blood of Jesus the barrier which God's justice interposes against man's being in union with God."
2. "All creation subsists in Christ, all creation is therefore affected by His propitiation: sinful creation is strictly 'reconciled' from its enmity; sinless creation, comparatively distant from His unapproachable purity, is lifted into nearer participation of Him, and in this wider sense is reconciled."
3. "Sin introduced discord not only on earth, but also in heaven, by the fall of demons; it brought into the abodes of holy angels, though not positive, yet privative loss, a retardation of their highest and most perfect development, harmonious gradation, and perfect consummation."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The meaning is, that by his atonement he produces reconciliation between those who were alienated from each other; see the notes at Ephesians 2:14."
2. "By his blood shed on the cross. That blood, making atonement for sin, was the means of making reconciliation between God and man."
3. "The only effect of the blood of the atonement on the 'things' of heaven in effecting the reconciliation is, to render it consistent for God to be at peace with sinners."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The participle is parallel with to reconcile, and marks peace-making and reconciliation as contemporaneous."
2. "The phrase making peace, in which the two factors of this verb appear separately, occurs only Ephesians 2:15."
3. "The compounded preposition ajpo gives the force of back, hinting at restoration to a primal unity."

### John Calvin:
1. "He declares, accordingly, that we are blessed through Christ alone, inasmuch as he is the bond of our connection with God, and, on the other hand, that, apart from him, we are most miserable, because we are shut out from God."
2. "The blood of the cross, therefore, means the blood of the sacrifice which was offered upon the cross for appeasing the anger of God."
3. "Nor is there any injustice done to angels, in sending them to a Mediator, that they may, through his kindness, have a well-grounded peace with God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Through Christ the entire universe is reconciled with God." 
2. "The absolute totality of created things shall be restored into its primal harmony with its Creator." 
3. "The one Reconciler is the Head of these vast dominions, and in Him meet and merge the discordant elements which sin had introduced."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The use of œÑŒ± œÄŒ±ŒΩœÑŒ± (the all things, the universe) as if the universe were somehow out of harmony reminds us of the mystical passage in Romans 8:19-23 which see for discussion. Sin somehow has put the universe out of joint. Christ will set it right." 
2. "Through the blood of his cross (Œ¥ŒπŒ± œÑŒøœÖ Œ±ŒπŒºŒ±œÑŒøœÇ œÑŒøœÖ œÉœÑŒ±œÖœÅŒøœÖ Œ±œÖœÑŒøœÖ). This for the benefit of the Docetic Gnostics who denied the real humanity of Jesus and as clearly stating the causa medians (Ellicott) of the work of reconciliation to be the Cross of Christ, a doctrine needed today." 
3. "Or things in the heavens (ŒµŒπœÑŒµ œÑŒ± ŒµŒΩ œÑŒøŒπœÇ ŒøœÖœÅŒ±ŒΩŒøŒπœÇ). Much needless trouble has been made over this phrase as if things in heaven were not exactly right. It is rather a hypothetical statement like verse Colossians 1:16 not put in categorical form (Abbott), universitas rerum (Ellicott)."

### John Gill:
1. "It was the good will and pleasure of God from all eternity, as to lay up all fulness in Christ for his chosen people, so to reconcile them to himself by him."
2. "Reconciliation supposes a former state of amity and friendship, and in such an one man was originally with God."
3. "The reconciliation of the elect made by Christ, in a way of full satisfaction to law and justice, is to the glory of God, the glory of all his perfections; as of his grace and mercy, wisdom, power, and faithfulness, so of his righteousness and holiness."

### John Wesley:
1. "Through the blood of the cross - The blood shed thereon."
2. "Whether things on earth - Here the enmity began: therefore this is mentioned first."
3. "Or things in heaven - Those who are now in paradise; the saints who died before Christ came."
