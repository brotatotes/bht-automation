# Colossians 1:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through the body of his flesh, Jesus accomplished our reconciliation through his sacrificial death. In this new dispensation of grace, we are presented holy and without blame to God. Our separation from worldly defilement is made possible by the Holy Spirit's work in renewing us in the image of God. This sanctification is an ongoing process, which will reach its fullness when Christ returns to restore all things. On that day, we will stand before him in complete purity, both internally and externally, as holy and without blemish, unaccusable before the final verdict of our reconciliation. (94 words)

2. "It is so called either to distinguish it from his mystical and spiritual body the church, of which he is the head before spoken of; or from his glorious and immortal body, as now raised and exalted at God's right hand; and to denote the truth of his human body, that it was a real fleshly body, consisting of flesh and blood as ours does."
