# Colossians 1:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If you want to fully experience and receive the blessings of the gospel, it is essential to stay rooted and steadfast in your faith. Without this unwavering commitment, you run the risk of losing the incredible blessings you have already tasted. Furthermore, it is crucial that you hold on to the glorious hope that the gospel offers. This hope is not just some fancy idea, but a hope that leads to perfect love and fulfillment. And remember, the gospel is not limited to just a few people; it has been preached and made available to every single creature under heaven.
