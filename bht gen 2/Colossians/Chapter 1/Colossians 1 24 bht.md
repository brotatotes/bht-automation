# Colossians 1:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Even in the midst of his sufferings, Paul rejoiced. His sufferings were not in vain, but a means of participating in the sufferings of Christ and furthering the cause of the Church. These sufferings serve a purpose - they provide an example to others, contribute to the growth of believers, and increase their eternal reward. Just as Christ's sufferings were necessary for redemption, the sufferings of believers have a vital role in God's redemptive plan.
