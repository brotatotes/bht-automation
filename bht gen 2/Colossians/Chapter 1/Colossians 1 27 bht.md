The Gentiles, once considered without hope, are now included in the family of God, receiving the inheritance of salvation. All of this is encapsulated in the truth that Christ, dwelling in believers, is the source of their hope for future glory. This Gospel is a display of God's abundant grace, surpassing all human merits and external causes.
