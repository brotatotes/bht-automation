# Colossians 1:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We give thanks to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, always praying for you. The act of thanksgiving in this passage reminds us to reflect on God's goodness and blessings. It is important to acknowledge and express gratitude not only for what God has done for us individually, but also for what He has done for others. The use of plural pronouns suggests a sense of community and shared responsibility in prayer. As believers, we are called to continually grow and progress in our faith, recognizing our imperfections and dependence on God's grace.
