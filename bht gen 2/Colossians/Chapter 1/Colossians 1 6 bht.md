### Albert Barnes:
1. "It has not been confined to the Jews, or limited to the narrow country where it was first preached, but has been sent abroad to the Gentile world."
2. "The gospel was not without effect wherever it was preached. The same results were observable everywhere else as in Colossae, that it produced most salutary influences on the hearts and lives of those who received it."
3. "Ever since they had heard the gospel it had been producing among them abundantly its appropriate fruit, and that the same thing had also characterized it wherever it had been dispensed."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Which is present unto you. Has come and is present."
2. "In all the world. Hyperbolical. Compare Romans 1:8; 1 Thessalonians 1:8; Acts 17:6."
3. "The best texts omit and. Some join esti is with the previous clause, as it is in all the world, and take bearing fruit as a parallel participle. So Rev. Others, better, join is with the participle, 'even as it is bearing fruit.' This would emphasize the continuous fruitfulness of the Gospel."

### John Calvin:
1. "The faith of it does not, it is true, depend on its success, as though we should believe it on the ground that many believe it. Though the whole world should fail, though heaven itself should fall, the conscience of a pious man must not waver, because God, on whom it is founded, does nevertheless remain true."
2. "Is it a trivial or common aid to faith, to see accomplished before our eyes what the Prophets long since predicted as to the extending of the kingdom of Christ through all countries of the world?"
3. "Paul confirms the doctrine of Epaphras by giving it his approbation, that he may induce the Colossians to adhere to it, and may, by the same means, call them back from those profligates who endeavored to introduce strange doctrines."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This need not be limited to the Roman world, or the chief places, nor be taken literally. ‘The expression is no hyperbole, but the repetition of the Lord’s command. Though not yet announced to all nations, it is present in all the world, the whole world being the area in which it is proclaimed and working.’ (Alford)"
2. "‘The figure is borrowed from a tree which both bears fruit and grows. The former word refers to the faith, the love, the Christian virtues, which the gospel produces in the internal and external life; the latter to the extension and the multiplication of its adherents.’ (Braune)"
3. "'The grace of God' forms the contents of the gospel; by hearing the gospel they came to know this grace. ‘In truth’ suggests more than ‘truly,’ pointing to the element in which they knew the grace of God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A legitimate hyperbole, for the gospel was spreading all over the Roman Empire."
2. "The periphrastic present emphasizes the continuity of the process."
3. "The growing and the fruit-bearing go on simultaneously as always with Christians."

### John Gill:
1. "The Gospel, which came to them from God, from heaven, from Christ, out of Jerusalem, from whence the word of the Lord was to come."
2. "Christ gave his disciples a commission to go into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature; it was no more to be restrained to a particular nation, but was made general and common to all the nations of the world."
3. "The Gospel is always in one place or another, and will be to the end of the world; but it is not always in the same place; but as yet it was not removed from Colosse; it was still with them in the external ministry of it, and it remained in their hearts in the powerful and comfortable experience of it."

### John Wesley:
1. It bringeth forth fruit in all the world — That is, in every place where it is preached.Ye knew the grace of God in truth — Truly experienced the gracious power of God.
