## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "our (not ‚Äòmy‚Äô) beloved fellow-servant, who is a minister of Christ faithful on our behalf." 
2. "He was one acting faithfully 'vice Apostoli' (Ambrst.), and therefore not lightly to be set aside in favour of the new and erroneous teachers."
3. "This love is emphatically a gift, and in its full reference the chief gift of the Spirit, and is thus in the elemental region of the Spirit, as distinct from those unspiritual states of mind which are 'en sarki'."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Epaphras alone was the founder of the Church at Colosse."
2. "Epaphras may have been apprehended for his zealous labors in Asia Minor."
3. "He is faithful in your behalf as a minister of Christ."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He had probably been sent to him by the church at Colossae to consult him in reference to some matters pertaining to the church there."
2. "The apostle here says, that they had learned from Epaphras the true nature of the gospel, and he designs undoubtedly to confirm what he had taught them in opposition to the teachings of errorists."
3. "It is possible, as has been conjectured (see the Introduction), that there was a party in the church at Colossae opposed to Epaphras and to the doctrines which he preached, and if this were so, Paul‚Äôs strong expression of attachment for him would do much to silence the opposition."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Fellow-servant. Used by Paul only here and ch. 4:7."
2. "Minister [Œ¥ŒπŒ±Œ∫ŒøŒΩŒøœÇ]. See on Matthew 20:26; Mark 9:35."
3. "'For you [œÖœÄŒµœÅ œÖŒºœâŒΩ].' Read hJmwn, us as Rev., on our behalf: as Paul's representative."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Ye learned of Epaphras. A resident of Coloss√¶ or its neighborhood, a 'fellow-prisoner' of Paul at Rome. This verse indicates that he was the founder of the Church at Coloss√¶, or one of the first preachers in that city."
2. "The commendation of Epaphras is related to the purpose of the Apostle. What the Apostle would oppose was the error which had sprung up since the true gospel was preached to him by Epaphras. 'Fellow servant,' as related to Christ, their common Lord."
3. "Whether the faithful service was on the Apostle's behalf or on behalf of the Colossians, it was service of Christ. Because he was a minister 'of Christ' he could properly minister in their behalf."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Epaphras...who is the source of their knowledge of Christ."
2. "In a true sense Epaphras was Paul's messenger to Colossae."

### John Gill:
1. "To know the grace of God, believe the truth of the Gospel, and to own and profess it sincerely."
2. "One whom Christ had made a 'minister' and not man, who was qualified, and sent forth, and made successful by him in his service."
3. "He sought not theirs, but them; he had a great zeal for them, dearly loved them, and spent his time and strength, and made use of his gifts and talents while among them, for their use and benefit."

### John Wesley:
1. The fellowservant ‚Äî Of Paul and Timotheus.
