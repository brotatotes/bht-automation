# Colossians 1:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The love that the believers have for one another is not worldly or carnal, but rather spiritual love, rooted in the work of the Holy Spirit. This love is characterized by a sincere affection and a genuine connection, even though they had not met in person. It is a love that is borne of the Spirit, a fruit of the Spirit's work in their hearts.
