# Colossians 2:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers find their completeness and satisfaction in Christ, as they are filled with all they need through their union with Him. In Him, they lack nothing for salvation, and there is no need to seek additional help or merits elsewhere. Christ is the head of all authority and should be worshiped alone, surpassing all angels and earthly rulers. It is in Him alone that believers find their fulfillment and the abundance they need.
