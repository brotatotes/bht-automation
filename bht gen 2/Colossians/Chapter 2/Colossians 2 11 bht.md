# Colossians 2:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers in Christ have received the true circumcision, which is not an external act but a spiritual one. This spiritual circumcision, performed by Christ himself, signifies the putting away of sin and the dedication of one's life to God. It is not simply the removal of physical flesh, but a transformation of the heart. Through Christ's sacrifice, believers are washed clean and clothed in righteousness, experiencing a complete regeneration that goes beyond any external religious practice.
