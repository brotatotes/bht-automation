# Colossians 2:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Baptism is a symbolic act that represents our identification with the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ. The mode of baptism, whether immersion or otherwise, serves as a visual reminder of this spiritual reality. By participating in baptism, we declare our faith in the expiatory death of Christ and the forgiveness of our sins. It is through this faith that we are joined with Christ and experience the transformative power of His resurrection. Baptism serves as a visible testimony of our spiritual rebirth and the new life that comes through our belief in the operation of God's mighty working.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "the process itself of baptism is regarded as the burial of the former life"
2. "the spiritual figures remain"
3. "Faith is the hand by which we lay hold on Christ the Ark of our refuge"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Baptism is regarded as the burial of the old carnal life, to which the act of immersion symbolically corresponds; and in warm climates where immersion is safe, it is the mode most accordant with the significance of the ordinance; but the spirit of the ordinance is kept by affusion, where immersion would be inconvenient or dangerous."  
2. "Faith in God's mighty operation in raising again Jesus, is saving faith; and it is wrought in the soul by His same 'mighty working' whereby He 'raised Jesus from the dead'." 
3. "As His literal resurrection is the ground of the power put forth in our spiritual resurrection now, so it is a pledge of our literal resurrection hereafter."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Buried with him in baptism."
2. "Ye are risen with him."
3. "Through the faith of the operation of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The raising is not the resurrection to eternal life at Christ's second coming, but the moral resurrection to a new life. This corresponds with the drift of the entire passage..."
2. "Through the faith of the operation of God. Not the faith which God works, but your faith in God's working: faith in God's energy as displayed in Christ's resurrection."
3. "Hence the emphasis which is laid on faith in the resurrection."

### John Calvin:
1. "He expressly declares that we obtain this by means of baptism, that it may be the more clearly apparent that there is no advantage from circumcision under the reign of Christ."
2. "By baptism, therefore, we are buried with Christ, because Christ does at the same time accomplish efficaciously that mortification, which he there represents, that the reality may be conjoined with the sign."
3. "He magnifies the grace which we obtain in Christ, as being greatly superior to circumcision. 'We are not only,' says he, 'ingrafted into Christâ€™s death, but we also rise to newness of life:' hence the more injury is done to Christ by those who endeavor to bring us back to circumcision."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The fellowship with Christ finds its sign and seal in the rite of baptism, which, as then administered, had its external resemblance to the burial and resurrection of Christ." 
2. "The baptism signified and sealed a fellowship with the resurrection of Christ."
3. "Godâ€™s working is here set forth as the object of the believing, not as its cause. In this connection it was natural to characterize God as one â€˜who raised Him from the dead.â€™ Only through faith in such a God as able and willing to raise us up spiritually can we partake in this new life."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For all who in the rite of baptism are plunged under the water, thereby declare that they put faith in the expiatory death of Christ for the pardon of their past sins."
2. "In the symbol of baptism the resurrection to new life in Christ is pictured with an allusion to Christ's own resurrection and to our final resurrection."
3. "Baptism gives a picture of the change already wrought in the heart 'through faith'."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ having died for their sins, was laid in the grave, where he continued for a while, and then rose again; and as they were crucified with him, they were also buried with him, as their head and representative; and all their sins too, which he left behind him in the grave, signified by his grave clothes there; and baptism being performed by immersion, when the person baptized is covered with water, and as it were buried in it, is a very significant emblem of all this." (72 words)
2. "Christ is risen from the dead as the head and representative of his people, and they are risen with him; and their baptism is also an emblem of his and their resurrection, being administered by immersion, in which way only this can be signified." (42 words)
3. "This shows now, that baptism was performed by dipping, or covering the whole body in water, for no other form of administration of baptism, as sprinkling, or pouring water on the face, can represent a burial, or be called one." (42 words)

### John Wesley:
1. "The ancient manner of baptizing by immersion is as manifestly alluded to here, as the other manner of baptizing by sprinkling or pouring of water is."
2. "But no stress is laid on the age of the baptized, or the manner of performing it, in one or the other; but only on our being risen with Christ, through the powerful operation of God in the soul; which we cannot but know assuredly, if it really is so: and if we do not experience this, our baptism has not answered the end of its institution."
3. "By which ye are also risen with him â€” From the death of sin to the life of holiness. It does not appear, that in all this St. Paul speaks of justification at all, but of sanctification altogether."
