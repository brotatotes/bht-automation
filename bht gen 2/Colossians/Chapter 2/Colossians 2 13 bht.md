# Colossians 2:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
You were once dead in your sins, both in your outward acts and in the corruption of your nature. But God has delivered you from this state by forgiving your sins and granting you spiritual life. Through the resurrection of Jesus, God has made you alive together with Him. This quickening is not merely the remission of sins, but a complete transformation, freeing you from the bondage of ceremonies and works. It is by God's grace that you have been forgiven and given new life. This is not a gradual forgiveness, but a complete reconciliation with God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Just as Christ's resurrection proved that He was delivered from the sin laid on Him, so our spiritual quickening proves that we have been forgiven our sins." 
2. "Your not having put off the old fleshly nature, the carnal foreskin, or original sin, which now by spiritual circumcision, that is, conversion and baptism, you have put off."
3. "Our spiritual quickening proves that we have been forgiven our sins."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "And the uncircumcision of your flesh - That is, Gentiles, and giving unrestrained indulgence to the desires of the flesh. They lived as those who had not by any religious rite or covenant brought themselves under obligations to lead holy lives."
2. "Hath he quickened - Notes, Ephesians 2:1."
3. "Together with him - In virtue of his being restored to life. That is, the resurrection of the Lord Jesus was the means of imparting to us spiritual life."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Dead [νεκρους] . Morally, as Ephesians 2:1 Ephesians 1:5; Romans 6:11."
2. "Having forgiven us [χαρισαμενος ημιν] . Freely (cariv grace, free gift), as Luke 7:42; 2 Corinthians 2:7, 2 Corinthians 2:10; Colossians 3:13."
3. "This change from the second to the first person, or, vice versa, is common in Paul 's writings."

### John Calvin:
1. "God has called you to himself from uncircumcision, and, therefore, from death."
2. "For the false apostles, by establishing ceremonies, bound them with a halter, from which Christ has set them free."
3. "God does not quicken us by the mere remission of sins, but he makes mention here of this particularly, because that free reconciliation with God, which overthrows the righteousness of works, is especially connected with the point in hand."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The uncircumcision of your flesh. This is the spiritual application of a literal fact. They were Gentiles, as such uncircumcised; this external condition fitly indicated their depraved, carnal condition."
2. "You did he quicken together with him. It is God who quickens; comp. Ephesians 2:5. The reference here is the same as in ‘raised with Him’ (Colossians 2:12), probably the future resurrection is slightly more prominent."
3. "Having forgiven us all our trespasses. The objective ground of this gracious forgiveness is set forth in Colossians 2:14. Notice, however, that while God is still the subject, the language is strictly applicable only to God in Christ, so that the transition to Christ as the subject is easy."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Being dead through your trespasses... a lapse or misstep as in Matthew 6:14; Romans 5:15-18; Galatians 6:1, can be still in the locative, though the instrumental makes good sense also." 
2. "'the uncircumcision' used merely in a metaphorical sense." 
3. "Probably θεος (God) is the subject because expressly so stated in Ephesians 2:4 and because demanded by συν αυτω here referring to Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "They were insensible of their state, their sin, and misery; and altogether inactive and helpless in spiritual things, being destitute of spiritual life, strength, and motion."
2. "They were dead in sin in a moral sense, in conversion a principle of life was implanted in them, or grace, as a living principle, was wrought in their souls by the Spirit of life from Christ."
3. "Forgiveness of sin is not done by piecemeals, or at different times, or by divers acts, but is done at once, and includes sin past, present, and to come; and is universal, reaches to all sin, original and actual, before and after conversion; sins of thought, word, and action."

### John Wesley:
1. "Doubly dead to God, not only wallowing in trespasses, outward sins, but also in the uncircumcision of your flesh - A beautiful expression for original sin, the inbred corruption of your nature, your uncircumcised heart and affections."
2. "Quickened together with him - Making you partakers of the power of his resurrection."
3. "It is evident the apostle thus far speaks, not of justification, but of sanctification only."
