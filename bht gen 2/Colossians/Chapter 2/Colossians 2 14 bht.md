# Colossians 2:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through the sacrificial work of Christ, our sins are blotted out, and the debt that was against us is cancelled. Like a debt that is testified by a handwriting, our sins' guilt and cry before God are destroyed. God's gracious decrees have brought about the obliteration of our sins, and through Christ, we are offered the gift of everlasting life when we believe in him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Having wiped out" coincident in time with "having forgiven you" (Colossians 2:13), the law's indictment against you is hereby cancelled.
2. The law is abrogated to the believer as far as it was a compulsory, accusing code, and as far as "righteousness" and "life" were sought for by it.
3. Christ, by bearing the curse of the broken law, has redeemed us from its curse. In His person nailed to the cross, the law itself was nailed to it.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The burdensome requirements of the Mosaic law are abolished, and its necessity is superseded by the death of Christ."
2. "His death had the same effect, in reference to those ordinances, as if they had been blotted from the statute-book."
3. "The death of Jesus had the same effect, in regard to the rites and institutions of the Mosaic religion, as if they had been affixed to his cross."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The law is against us, because it comes like a taskmaster, bidding us do, but neither putting the inclination into our hearts nor the power into our hands."
2. "And law is against us, because the revelation of unfulfilled duty is the accusation of the defaulter, and a revelation to him of his guilt."
3. "And law is against us, because it comes with threatenings and foretastes of penalty and pain. Thus, as standard, accuser, and avenger it is against us."

### John Calvin:
1. "Now Paul contends that ceremonies have been abolished, and to prove this he compares them to a hand-writing, by which God holds us as it were bound, that we may not be able to deny our guilt."
2. "Hence it follows, that all those who still urge the observance of ceremonies, detract from the grace of Christ, as though absolution were not procured for us through him; for they restore to the hand-writing its freshness, so as to hold us still under obligation."
3. "This is full liberty â€” that Christ has by his blood not only blotted out our sins, but every hand-writing which might declare us to be exposed to the judgment of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Having blotted out, i.e., erased or cancelled, since the tense is the same as â€˜having forgiven.â€™ But it does not follow that this act is contemporaneous. This refers to the objective redeeming work, which must precede the appropriation of it by believers who are thus forgiven."
2. "The handwriting of ordinances, etc. The word â€˜handwritingâ€™ had the technical sense of a bond, obligating the signer against whom it was held. The bond in this case was the law, which was written in, took the form of â€˜ordinances,â€™ i.e., specific commandments."
3. "â€˜It was the law rather than Christ, which was slain and done away with on the cross, because He bore the curse of the law, took away its condemnation. Men slew Christ, but the Lord slew the law on the cross; Galatians 2:13; Galatians 2:0 Pet. 2:24â€™ (Braune)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The bond written in ordinances that was against us...The signature made a legal debt or bond as Paul says in Philemon 1:18: 'I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it.'"
2. "Undoubtedly 'the handwriting in decrees'...was against the Jews...but the Gentiles also gave moral assent to God's law written in their hearts."
3. "God has taken the bond against us 'out of the midst.' Nailing it to the cross...Hence the 'bond' is cancelled for us."

### John Gill:
1. "Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances... cancelled and abolished by Christ..."
2. "The whole law of Moses is intended... this book is of no force..."
3. "It is abolished and done away... all the types and shadows of it..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Having blotted out â€” in consequence of his gracious decrees, that Christ should come into the world to save sinners, and that whosoever believeth on him should have everlasting life."
2. "The handwriting against us â€” Where a debt is contracted, it is usually testified by some handwriting; and when the debt is forgiven, the handwriting is destroyed, either by blotting it out, by taking it away, or by tearing it."
3. "The apostle expresses in all these three ways, God's destroying the handwriting which was contrary to us, or at enmity with us. This was not properly our sins themselves, (they were the debt,) but their guilt and cry before God."
