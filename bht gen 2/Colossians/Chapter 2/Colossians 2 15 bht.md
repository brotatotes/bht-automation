## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The first seems to me to necessitate the rendering of ἀπεκδυσάμενος, not, as the great majority of Commentators, 'having spoiled', a meaning unexampled for the middle, and precluded by the plain usage, by the Apostle himself, a few verses below, of the same word ἀπεκδυσάμενοι, but 'having put off', 'divested himself of.'"
2. "Now the words have occurred before in this very passage, where Christ is exalted as the κεφαλὴ πάσης ἀρχῆς κ. ἐξουσίας: and it is hardly possible to avoid connecting our present expression with that, seeing that in τὰς ἀρχὰς κ. τὰς ἐξουσίας the articles seem to contain a manifest reference to it."
3. "In that, the ἀρχαὶ κ. ἐξουσίαι were all subjected to Christ, all plainly declared to be powerless as regards His work and His people, and triumphed over by Him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "In the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross, God subjected all the principalities, c., to Jesus, declaring them to be powerless as to His work and His people."
3. "But at the ascension, Satan and his demons were 'judged' and 'cast out' by Christ's obedience unto death, and the Son of man was raised to the throne of God; thus His resurrection and ascension are a public solemn triumph over the principalities and powers of death."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "He led Satan and his principalities and powers captive, who had led others, as he passed through the air, the territories of the devil, in the sight of God and the holy angels."
