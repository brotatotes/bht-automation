# Colossians 2:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do not let anyone judge or decide for you when it comes to matters of food and drink or the observance of specific religious rituals and holidays. The apostle Paul reminds the Colossians that they should not be bound by the opinions and regulations of others. He emphasizes that it is not necessary for them to conform to the old Jewish traditions and customs, such as the celebration of new moon festivals and weekly sabbaths. Instead, they should focus on the true essence of faith and freedom in Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Let no one therefore...judge you in eating and drinking." 
2. "...the whole cycle of legal ordinances and prohibitions which regarded eating and drinking..."
3. "...a feast or new-moon or sabbaths."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Pay no regard to any one who sits in judgment on you as to legal observances in respect to foods."
2. "The weekly sabbath rests on a more permanent foundation, having been instituted in Paradise to commemorate the completion of creation in six days."
3. "The sabbath is still needed and is therefore still linked with the other nine commandments, as obligatory in the spirit, though the letter of the law has been superseded by that higher spirit of love which is the essence of law and Gospel alike."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Let no one sit in judgment on you, or claim the right to decide for you in those matters."
2. "No one had a right to impose their observance on Christians, or to condemn them if they did not keep them."
3. "There is no evidence from this passage that he would teach that there was no obligation to observe any holy time, for there is not the slightest reason to believe that he meant to teach that one of the ten commandments had ceased to be binding on mankind."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Mosaic law contained very few provisions concerning drinks. See Leviticus 10:9; Leviticus 11:34, Leviticus 11:36; Numbers 6:3. Hence it is probable that the false teachers had extended the prohibitions as to the use of wine to all Christians."
2. "The festival of the new moon is placed beside the Sabbath, Isaiah 1:13; Ezekiel 46:1. The day was celebrated by blowing of trumpets, special sacrifices, feasting, and religious instruction. Labor was suspended, and no national or private fasts were permitted to take place."
3. "The same enumeration of sacred seasons occurs 1Ch 33:31; 2 Chronicles 2:4; 2 Chronicles 31:3; Ezekiel 45:17; Hosea 2:11."

### John Calvin:
1. "He says, therefore, that it is not in the power of men to make us subject to the observance of rites which Christ has by his death abolished, and exempts us from their yoke, that we may not allow ourselves to be fettered by the laws which they have imposed."
2. "Consider whether it may not be taken to mean separation, for those that make a distinction of days, separate, as it were, one from another. Such a mode of partition was suitable for the Jews, that they might celebrate religiously the days that were appointed, by separating them from others."
3. "I answer, that we do not by any means observe days, as though there were any sacredness in holidays, or as though it were not lawful to labor upon them, but that respect is paid to government and order — not to days."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "‘Therefore’ bases these practical admonitions on the positive truths set forth in Colossians 2:8-15."
2. "The Mosaic law had prohibitions respecting food alone, hence the Phrygian ascetics had probably gone beyond the law."
3. "The Jewish Sabbath was kept by many of the early Christians as well as the Lord’s Day, and the practice was finally condemned at a council in Laodicea."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul has here in mind the ascetic regulations and practices of one wing of the Gnostics (possibly Essenic or even Pharisaic influence)."
2. "He makes a plea for freedom in such matters on a par with that in Colossians 2:1; Colossians 2:14; Colossians 2:15."
3. "The Essenes went far beyond the Mosaic regulations."

### John Gill:
1. "they should be judged by no man; they should not regard or submit to any man's judgment"
2. "the apostle would not have them submit to the yoke they would lay upon them, nor be terrified by their anathemas against them"
3. "the apostle refers to, may be considered:or of the new moon; which the Jews were obliged to observe, by attending religious worship, and offering sacrifices"

### John Wesley:
1. "Let none judge you — That is, regard none who judge you."
2. "In meat or drink — For not observing the ceremonial law in these or any other particulars."
3. "Or in respect of a yearly feast, the new moon, or the weekly Jewish sabbaths."
