# Colossians 2:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The danger of false teachers lies in their attempt to deceive and defraud believers of their eternal reward. They aim to snatch away the crown of victory that is rightfully theirs through cunning and deceit. These false teachers disguise themselves as humble and reverent, invoking angels as intermediaries to God. However, their worship of angels is not true humility, but rather an act born out of their own arrogance. It is important for believers not to be led astray by such false humility, but to approach God directly with sincere hearts and humble spirits.
