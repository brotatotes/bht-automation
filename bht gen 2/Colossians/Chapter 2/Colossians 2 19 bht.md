# Colossians 2:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In order to truly hold fast to the Head, which is Christ, one must not rely on anyone or anything else in the faith. This is essential for the preservation and growth of all other doctrines of religion. By maintaining a proper understanding and devotion to Christ, one can avoid straying from the truth in other areas of belief. The connection between the members of the body of Christ is strengthened by the spiritual bonds of faith, love, and peace. It is through these bonds that the body increases and grows in alignment with God's divine plan.

3. "As, however, we do not there see what Paul here requires in the Church, what shall we say, but that it is a humpbacked body, and a confused mass that will fall to pieces of itself."
