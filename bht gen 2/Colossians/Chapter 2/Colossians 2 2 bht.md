## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The prayer 'that their hearts may be comforted' must include in it the Colossians for whom he expressly says, 'I have conflict.' Thus it is an abbreviated mode of expression for, 'That your and their hearts may be comforted.'" ALFORD
2. "Their hearts would be comforted by 'knowing what conflict he had for' them, and how much he is interested for their welfare; and also by being released from doubts on learning from the apostle, that the doctrine which they had heard from Epaphras was true and certain."
3. "The accumulation of phrases, not only 'understanding,' but 'the full assurance of understanding'; not only this, but 'the riches of,' c., not only this, but 'all the riches of,' c., implies how he desires to impress them with the momentous importance of the subject in hand."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Being knit together in love...It means, properly, to make to come together, and hence, refers to a firm union, as where the heart of Christians are one." 
2. "The meaning is, that the thing referred to - 'the full understanding' of the 'mystery' of religion - was an invaluable possession, like abundant wealth." 
3. "The desire of the apostle that they might have entire conviction of the truth of the Christian doctrines."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Comforted (paraklhqwsin). Not so much tranquilized as braced."
2. "Knit together [συμβιβασθεντες]. Used of putting together in one's mind, and so to conclude by comparison."
3. "Full assurance [πληροφοριας]. Or fullness. See Hebrews 6:11; Hebrews 10:22. Of understanding [συνεσεως]."


### John Calvin:
1. "He shews, accordingly, that it was by no unreasonable affection (as happens in the case of some) that he had been led to take upon himself so great a concern for the Colossians and others, but because the duty of his office required it."
2. "From this it appears where the chief good is, and in what things it consists — when mutually agreed in one faith, we are also joined together in mutual love. This, I say, is the solid joy of a pious mind — this is the blessed life."
3. "The doctrine, therefore, of the schoolmen is devilish, inasmuch as it takes away assurance, and substitutes in its place moral conjecture, as they term it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word rendered ‘comfort’ also means ‘exhort,’ and may include the idea of confirming; but the usual sense is preferable...especially in connection with the word ‘hearts.’"
2. "This describes the manner in which the comforting should take place: by their being closely joined together ‘in love,’ brotherly love, which is here represented, not as the instrument, but as the element of this union."
3. "The purpose of this union in love is the entire possession of full certainty of Christian insight...The ‘assurance’ here spoken of is commonly termed ‘assurance of knowledge,’ not ‘assurance of faith.’"
4. "This clause is exactly parallel to the preceding one describing further the purpose of the union in love, but emphasizing the object of the understanding and ‘full knowledge,’ namely, the mystery of God, even Christ. The reading is very doubtful; the variations numerous."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Being knit together... Love is the συνδεσμος (Colossians 3:14) that binds all together."
2. "Paul desires the full use of the intellect in grasping the great mystery of Christ and it calls for the full and balanced exercise of all one's mental powers."
3. "This use of επιγνωσις (full, additional knowledge) is Paul's reply to the Gnostics with the limited and perverted γνωσις (knowledge)."

### John Gill:
1. "The hearts of God's people often need comfort, by reason of indwelling sin, the temptations of Satan, the hidings of God's face, and afflictive providences."
2. "Love is the bond of union between God and his people, Christ and his members, so between saints and saints; it is the cement that joins and keeps them together."
3. "Such a knowledge and understanding of divine things is intended, as is large and abundant, signified by 'all riches'; for though it is not complete and perfect in this life, yet it takes a vast compass, and reaches to all the deep things of God."

### John Wesley:
1. Unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, unto the acknowledgment of the mystery of God — That is, unto the fullest and clearest understanding and knowledge of the gospel.
