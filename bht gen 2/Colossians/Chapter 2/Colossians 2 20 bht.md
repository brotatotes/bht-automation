# Colossians 2:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If you have truly died with Christ and have been freed from the principles of the world, why then do you submit to these human regulations and laws? You have a new identity in Christ, no longer bound by the worldly practices and standards. So why do you allow these external rules and restrictions to dictate your actions? Remember that your freedom in Christ has set you apart from the bondage of worldly ordinances.
