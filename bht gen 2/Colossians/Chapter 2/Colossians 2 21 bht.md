# Colossians 2:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The strong language used in this passage emphasizes the avoidance of any contact with unclean things, particularly with regard to certain meats and consecrated vessels. It is crucial to understand that these prohibitions stem from the practices of Jewish doctors who not only upheld the Mosaic law but also added their own regulations. While these rules were primarily concerned with ceremonial purity, it is vital to recognize their limited scope and not apply them as universal principles in all aspects of life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Handle not, neither taste, nor even touch." The three refer to meats. "Handle not" (a stronger term than "nor even touch"), "nor taste" with the tongue, "nor even touch," however slight the contact.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Why are ye subject to ordinances of various kinds, such as this - Touch not, taste not, handle not?"
2. "Perhaps there was at Colossae a society of this kind, as there were in many other places out of Judea; and, if there was, it is not improbable that many Christians imitated them in the uniqueness of their rules and observances."
3. "These words are often used as a kind of motto in reference to the use of intoxicating drinks. They express very well what is held by the friends of total abstinence; but it is obvious that they had no such reference as used by the apostle, nor should they be alleged as an authority, or as an argument, in the question about the propriety or impropriety of the use of spirituous liquors."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "'Touch' is properly to fasten one's self to or cling to. So John 20:17 (note). Frequently rendered touch in the New Testament, and used in most cases of Christ's touching or being touched by the diseased." 
2. "To get hands on so as to injure, 1 John 5:18. To have intercourse with, 1 Corinthians 7:1; 2 Corinthians 6:17. Thus, in every case, the contact described exerts a modifying influence, and a more permanent contact or effect of contact is often implied than is expressed by touch."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul points out, (Î¼Î¹Î¼Î·Ï„Î¹Îºá¿¶Ï‚,) by way of imitation, to what length the waywardness of those who bind consciences by their laws is wont to proceed."
2. "When persons have once taken upon them to tyrannize over menâ€™s souls, there is no end of new laws being daily added to old ones."
3. "Hence Paul acts admirably well in admonishing us that human traditions are a labyrinth, in which consciences are more and more entangled; nay more, are snares, which from the beginning bind in such a way that in course of time they strangle in the end."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The climax is reached in 'do not even touch." 
2. "The prohibitions are specific in form, and refer to certain kinds of food and drink."
3. "This series of condemned prohibitions cannot be used in support of total abstinence from intoxicating liquors, except through culpable ignorance or dishonesty."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Essenes took the Mosaic regulations and carried them much further and the Pharisees demanded ceremonially clean hands for all food."
2. "Even today men are finding that the noble prohibition law needs enlightened instruction to make it effective. That is true of all law."
3. "The Pharisees, Essenes, Gnostics made piety hinge on outward observances and rules instead of inward conviction and principle."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle says, not of himself, but in the person of the Jewish doctors; who urging the use of the ceremonial law, to which they added decrees and constitutions of their own..."
2. "And so they likewise said, 'handle not'; or, as the Syriac and Arabic read, 'do not come near', or 'draw not nigh', to a Gentile, to one of another nation, or any unclean person, to whom they forbid any near approach or conversation..."
3. "Some think that these several rules have respect only to meats; as 'touch not', that is, do not eat of things forbidden ever so little; nay, 'taste not', do not let anything of them come within your lips; yea, 'handle not', do not so much as touch them with your fingers."

### John Wesley:
1. Touch not â€” An unclean thing.Taste not â€” Any forbidden meat.Handle not â€” Any consecrated vessel.
