# Colossians 2:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The actions described in these quotes may appear wise and religious, but they lack true value before God. These practices, such as self-imposed worship and the worship of angels, satisfy the flesh instead of genuinely denying its desires. They can indulge our sinful nature, promoting self-will and pride. However, it is crucial to be aware that these practices are merely a show. Rather than pursuing man-made traditions and superficial appearances, it is more important to cultivate an authentic and heartfelt devotion to God. This sincere worship and faith hold far greater importance in God's eyes.
