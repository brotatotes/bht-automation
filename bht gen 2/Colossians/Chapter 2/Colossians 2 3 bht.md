# Colossians 2:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the person of Christ, all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden, like a valuable mine waiting to be explored. These treasures are not meant to remain hidden, but rather to be discovered and experienced in all their richness. The wisdom and knowledge found in Christ surpass any other source, and seeking to know Him is the key to attaining the true riches of life. While this wisdom and knowledge may seem elusive, it is worth pursuing and seeking from Christ himself.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In whom are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden."
2. "Like a mine of unknown and inexhaustible wealth, the treasures of wisdom are all in Him hidden, but not in order to remain so; they only need to be explored for you to attain 'unto the riches' in them."
3. "Still as the mine is unfathomable, there will, through eternity, be always fresh treasures in Him to be drawn forth from their hidden state."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In whom - Margin, 'wherein.' The more correct translation is 'in whom.' The reference is doubtless to Christ, as his name is the immediate antecedent, and as what is affirmed here properly appertains to him."
2. "Are hid - Like treasures that are concealed or garnered up. It does not mean that none of those 'treasures' had been developed; but that, so to speak, Christ, as Mediator, was the great treasure-house where were to be found all the wisdom and knowledge needful for people."
3. "Wisdom - The wisdom needful for our salvation. Notes, 1 Corinthians 1:24. And knowledge - The knowledge which is requisite to guide us in the way to life. Christ is able to instruct us in all that it is desirable for us to know, so that it is not necessary for us to apply to philosophy, or to the teachings of human beings."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In whom are all the treasures, etc., hidden." 
2. "The words which immediately follow in ver. 4, suggest the possibility that hidden may convey an allusion to the Apocrypha or secret writings of the Essenes."
3. "If such is Paul's allusion, the word suggests a contrast with the treasures of Christian wisdom which are accessible to all in Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "I rather prefer the latter view, and it is the one that is more generally received...all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hid in Christ...we are perfect in wisdom if we truly know Christ, so that it is madness to wish to know anything besides Him."
2. "Should any one choose to interpret it as referring to the mystery, the meaning will be, that all the wisdom of the pious is included in the gospel, by means of which God is revealed to us in his Son."
3. "He says, however, that the treasures are hidden, because they are not seen glittering with great splendor, but do rather, as it were, lie hid under the contemptible abasement and simplicity of the cross."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This presents Christ Himself as the mystery of God."
2. "These treasures are in Christ (or the mystery of God), but hid, not known until revealed."
3. "The hid treasures could become theirs: they did not need 'more than Christ, but more of Christ.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Christ is the mystery of God."
2. "Christ sums up all wisdom and knowledge."
3. "These treasures are hidden... whether the Gnostics have discovered them or not."

### John Gill:
1. "In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge... the unsearchable riches of Christ." 
2. "...our highest wisdom and knowledge lies in knowing him, whom to know is life eternal; and the excellency of whose knowledge surpasses everything else; it is the greatest riches, and most valuable treasure." 
3. "...it is imperfect in the present state, and is not yet fully and clearly revealed; and therefore should be inquired after, and searched for, and Christ should be applied unto for it."
