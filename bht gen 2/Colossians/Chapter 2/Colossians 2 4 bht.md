# Colossians 2:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In order to prevent deception and maintain the integrity of the Truth, it is crucial to acknowledge that the knowledge of Christ is sufficient in itself. The dangers lie in the allure of enticing, plausible arguments that may lead one astray. This cunning persuasion and sophistical reasoning can easily captivate and deceive those who seek wisdom outside of Christ. Therefore, it is essential to discern between the genuine gold of divine truths and the mere appearance of truth woven by the fallacy of men.
