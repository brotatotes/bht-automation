# Colossians 2:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are like trees deeply rooted in Christ, the source from which they derive their vitality and spiritual growth. They are built upon the solid foundation of the teachings and truths of the Gospel. Just as a strong tree stands firm against storms, those who are firmly rooted and built up in faith in Christ are able to withstand the challenges that come their way. Their faith is not stagnant, but continually growing as they walk in obedience and thanksgiving, advancing to fuller maturity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Rooted" implies their vitality; so "builded up," massive solidity.
2. "Walking," a third image (Colossians 2:6), expresses the thought which "rooted" and "built," though each suggesting a thought peculiar to itself, could not express, namely, onward motion.
3. "Rooted" is in the past tense, implying their first conversion and vital grafting "in Him." "Built up" is present (in the Greek), implying their progressive increase in religion by union with Him.
4. "Stablished" means confirmed.
5. "Abounding therein with thanksgiving" - advancing to fuller maturity in the faith, "with thanksgiving" to God as the gracious Author of this whole blessing.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "As a tree strikes its roots deep in the earth, so our faith should strike deep into the doctrine respecting the Saviour."
2. "Expressing overflowing thanks to God that you have been made acquainted with truths so precious and glorious."
3. "If there is anything for which we ought to be thankful, it is for the knowledge of the great truths respecting our Lord and Saviour."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The metaphors of rooting and being founded occur together." 
2. "The whole upbuilding of the Church proceeds within the compass of Christ's personality, life, and power."

### John Calvin:
1. "The prosecution of the way, the support of the root, and of the foundation, is firmness and steadfastness of faith."
2. "He would not have them simply remain immovable, but would have them grow every day more and more."
3. "He would have them always keep in mind from what source faith itself proceeds, that they may not be puffed up with presumption, but may rather with fear repose themselves in the gift of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The first participle points to taking root once for all and continuing rooted; the second to the progressive building up."
