# Colossians 2:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Beware of falling prey to the empty deceit of philosophy mixed with Christianity, which promises happiness but offers none. This philosophy, based on human traditions and shallow knowledge of sensible things, fails to grasp the true depths of God's wisdom. Instead, let us focus on Christ who possesses the fullness of the Godhead. In him, we find the true measure of divine nature and power, for he alone contains the very substance of God in the most complete sense.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Take heed lest there shall be any one who leads you away as his prey by means of his philosophy and empty deceit."
2. "The character of the philosophy here meant was that mixture of Jewish and Oriental, which afterwards expanded into gnosticism."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Beware lest there shall be any man leading you away as his spoil through his philosophy."
2. "You, who may have 'the riches of full assurance' and 'the treasures of wisdom,' should not suffer yourselves to be led away as a spoil by empty, deceitful philosophy."
3. "Their boasted higher 'philosophy' is but human tradition, and a cleaving to the carnal and worldly, and not to Christ."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Take heed lest anyone plunder or rob you of your faith and hope by philosophy."
2. "The danger of the Colossians was, that they would rely rather on the deductions of that specious reasoning, than on what they had been taught by their Christian teachers."
3. "The doctrines which were advanced in those systems were maintained by plausible, not by solid arguments; by considerations not fitted to lead to the truth, but to lead astray."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Beware... lest there shall be any one that maketh spoil." 
2. "The warning is not against all philosophy... but against philosophy which is also vain deceit."
3. "Rudimentary teachings, as in Hebrews 5:12; applicable alike to Jewish and to Gentile teaching."

### John Calvin:
1. "Beware, says he, lest any one plunder you. He makes use of a very appropriate term, for he alludes to plunderers, who, when they cannot carry off the flock by violence, drive away some of the cattle fraudulently."
2. "Would you then be reckoned as belonging to Christ’s flock? Would you remain in his folds? Do not deviate a nail’s breadth from purity of doctrine."
3. "He intimates, that all doctrines are foreign to Christ that make the worship of God, which we know to be spiritual, according to Christ’s rule, to consist in the elements of the world, and also such as fetter the minds of men by such trifles and frivolities, while Christ calls us directly to himself."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The false teachers sought to lead them away captive, body and mind; the former by ritualistic restrictions, the latter by heretical teaching."
2. "The Apostle means 'not philosophy in itself and in general, however much it had, in its decay and according to its manifestation in that age, proven itself to the Apostle as folly in comparison with the wisdom of the gospel, but the definite speculation, known to his readers, which obtained in Colossae and that region."
3. "To go back to rudiments was to show themselves children; all teaching that does not make Him [Christ] the centre only serves to lead men captive."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Take heed. Lest there shall be anyone that maketh spoil of you." 
2. "Paul does not condemn knowledge and wisdom, but only this false philosophy, 'knowledge falsely named,' and explained here by the next words."
3. "Christ is the yardstick by which to measure philosophy and all phases of human knowledge. They have it backwards. Christ is the measure for all human knowledge since he is the Creator and the Sustainer of the universe."

1. "Rob you of the rich treasure of the Gospel, strip you of your spiritual armour."

3. "Christ and his Gospel, the revelation he has made, are the standard of doctrine and worship; he only is to be heard and attended to."

### John Wesley:
1. "Through philosophy and empty deceit — That is, through the empty deceit of philosophy blended with Christianity. This the apostle condemns, 1. Because it was empty and deceitful, promising happiness, but giving none."
2. "Because it was grounded, not on solid reason, but the traditions of men, Zeno, Epicurus, and the rest."
3. "Because it was so shallow and superficial, not advancing beyond the knowledge of sensible things; no, not beyond the first rudiments of them."
4. "For in him dwelleth - Inhabiteth, continually abideth, all the fulness of the Godhead. Believers are 'filled with all the fulness of God,' Ephesians 3:19. But in Christ dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead; the most full Godhead; not only divine powers, but divine nature, Colossians 1:19."
5. "Bodily — Personally, really, substantially. The very substance of God, if one might so speak, dwells in Christ in the most full sense."
