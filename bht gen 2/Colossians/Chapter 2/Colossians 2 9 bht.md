# Colossians 2:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Christ alone dwells the fullness of the Godhead, not merely certain aspects or the Church. This divine indwelling is not just metaphorical, but actual and bodily, emphasizing the reality of Christ's incarnation. By uniting with Christ, believers share in His divine nature and are liberated from the empty philosophies and traditions of the world. The tabernacle and temple serve as symbolic reminders of the dwelling of God's presence, pointing to Jesus as the ultimate manifestation of God's glory in human form.
