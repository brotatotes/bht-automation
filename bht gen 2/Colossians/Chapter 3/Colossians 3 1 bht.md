# Colossians 3:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers, having been risen with Christ, are called to seek the things above. This exhortation assumes their union with Christ and serves as a motivation for focusing their minds on heavenly matters. Just as Christ, being raised, ascended to heaven, so too should the believers direct their thoughts and desires towards the eternal realm.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The participation is an objective one, brought about by that faith which was the condition of their baptismal admission into Him."
2. "For if the participation were an ethical one, what need to exhort them to its ethical realization?"
3. "The only real life of the Christian is his resurrection life in and with Christ. The fact is, Ellic. has mistaken my meaning in this term."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If then ye have been once for all raised up together with Christ."
2. "Where Christ is, sitting on the right of God."
3. "We should trample upon and subdue our lusts that our conversation may correspond to our Savior's condition."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There was such an union between Christ and his people, that in virtue of his death they become dead to sin."
2. "As Christ now lives in heaven, they should live for heaven, and fix their affections there."
3. "Since Christ is there, and since he is the object of our supreme attachment, we should fix our affections on heavenly things, and seek to be prepared to dwell with him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Be risen...in their baptism in which they died." (see ch. Colossians 2:12)
2. "Where Christ is, seated... hidden." (compare Ephesians 2:4-6; Revelation 3:21)

### John Calvin:
1. "To those fruitless exercises which the false apostles urged, he opposes those true exercises in which it becomes Christians to employ themselves."
2. "Paul here exhorts the Colossians to meditation upon the heavenly life."
3. "Now, we seek those things which are above, when in our minds we are truly sojourners in this world, and are not bound to it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The rite was the sign and seal of their participation in the resurrection of Christ. But baptism and this raising are not identical. The latter is the reality of which the former is the sign." 
2. "This being raised together with Christ implies ethical renewal of the believer, and hence it forms an appropriate motive to the exhortations which follow." 
3. "For these heavenly things are where Christ is, and we have been raised together with Him."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The things that are above" - Paul gives this ideal and goal in place of merely ascetic rules.
2. "Seated on the right hand of God" - Christ is up there and at God's right hand.
3. "Condition of the first class, assumed as true" - like that in Colossians 2:20 and the other half of the picture of baptism in Colossians 2:12.

### John Gill:
1. "For he does not here call in question their being risen with Christ, but takes it for granted that they were, and makes use of it as an argument for his present purpose."
2. "Wherefore being thus raised again in every sense, it highly became them to seek those things which are above; the better and heavenly country, the continuing city, which is above the heavens."
3. "He is 'on the right hand of God'; in human nature, an honour which none of the angels were ever admitted to: here he 'sitteth', as having done the work of redemption, and entered into his rest, beholding the travail of his soul with satisfaction."

### John Wesley:
1. If ye are risen, seek the things above â€” As Christ being risen, immediately went to heaven.
