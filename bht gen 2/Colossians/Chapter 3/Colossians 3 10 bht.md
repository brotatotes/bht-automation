# Colossians 3:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The new man is continuously renewed in knowledge, specifically the knowledge of God, His will, and His word. This renewal is not a mere intellectual understanding, but a transformation by the illuminating power of the Holy Spirit. Through this lively and effectual illumination, the entire person is enlightened and transformed, bearing the image of God Himself. Thus, the highest aspiration and blessedness for believers is to reflect the image of God, which is attained through the renewing work of the Spirit.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The recently-put-on nature"; that lately received at regeneration.
2. "Its development into a perfectly renewed nature is continually progressing to completion."
3. "The image of God formed in us by the Spirit of God, is as much more glorious than that borne by Adam, as the Second Man, the Lord from heaven, is more glorious than the first man."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This passage, in connection with Ephesians 4:24, proves that before man fell he was endowed with 'righteousness, true holiness, and knowledge.' The knowledge here referred to, is not the knowledge of everything, but the knowledge of God."
2. "Man was acquainted with his Creator. He resembled him in his capacity for knowledge. He was an intelligent being, and he had an acquaintance with the divine existence and perfections."
3. "But especially had he that knowledge which is the fear of the Lord; that knowledge of God which is the result of love. Piety, in the Scriptures, is often represented as the 'knowledge' of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Is renewed: in process of continuous renewal."
2. "The word 'new,' which enters into the composition of the verb, gives the idea of quality."
3. "The distinction is from the Greek and Roman point of view, where the line is drawn by culture, as between the Jew and the Greek it was drawn by religious privilege."

### John Calvin:
1. "He shews in the first place, that newness of life consists in knowledge — not as though a simple and bare knowledge were sufficient, but he speaks of the illumination of the Holy Spirit, which is lively and effectual, so as not merely to enlighten the mind by kindling it up with the light of truth, but transforming the whole man."
2. "We are renewed after the image of God. Now, the image of God resides in the whole of the soul, inasmuch as it is not the reason merely that is rectified, but also the will."
3. "He teaches, that there is nothing more excellent at which the Colossians can aspire, inasmuch as this is our highest perfection and blessedness to bear the image of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This is coincident in time with the 'putting off,' but in the workings of grace 'the initiative is with the new man and in virtue of the Divine power creating him' (Braune)."
2. "The new man which was put on is thus developed unto full knowledge; possibly in contrast with the 'knowledge' (gnosis) of the false teachers. This perfect knowledge is the aim of the renewal."
3. "Here, as there, there is an unmistakable allusion to Genesis 1:26-27; hence to God (not Christ) as the creator. The entire phrase qualifies 'renewed,' not 'full knowledge.' That was the aim of the renewal, this is its norm."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "First aorist middle participle (in causal sense as before) of ενδυνω, old and common verb (Latin induo, English endue) for putting on a garment. Used of putting on Christ (Galatians 3:27; Romans 13:14)."

3. "The new man...is made not after the image of the first man, no not as innocent, and much less as fallen; but after the image of Christ, to which the elect of God are predestinated to be conformed."

### John Wesley:
1. In knowledge — The knowledge of God, his will, his word.
