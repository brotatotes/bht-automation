# Colossians 3:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the context of these quotes, it is clear that external factors such as nationality, religious practices, or social status hold no significance in the eyes of God. What truly matters is one's new birth in Christ, as it is this transformation that unites all believers under the common element of Christ. The distinctions that exist in the world fade away in the realm of the new creation, where Christ is all and in all. This truth highlights the universal scope of salvation and the all-encompassing presence of Christ in the lives of believers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The present Church is one called out of the flesh, and the present world-course, wherein such distinctions exist, to life in the Spirit, and to the future first resurrection."
2. "As expressly as Scripture abolishes the distinction of Jew and Greek now as to religious privileges, so does it expressly foretell that in the coming new order of things, Israel shall be first of the Christian nations, not for her own selfish aggrandizement, but for their good, as the medium of blessing to them."
3. "The unity of the divine life shared in by all believers, counterbalances all differences, even as great as that between the polished 'Greek' and the rude 'Scythian.' Christianity imparts to the most uncivilized the only spring of sound, social and moral culture."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The meaning here is, that all are on a level; that there is no distinction of nation in the church; that all are to be regarded and treated as brethren..."
2. "No one is admitted into that blessed society because he is circumcised; no one is excluded because he is uncircumcised."
3. "Even such a ferocious and uncivilized people were not excluded from the gospel, but they were as welcome as any other, and were entitled to the same privileges as others."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christian perfection does not stand in need of those outward observances, nay, that they are things that are altogether at variance with it."
2. "Christ alone holds the prow and the stern - the beginning and the end."
3. "They are, therefore, superfluous in a state of true perfection, nay more, they ought to have no place, inasmuch as injustice would otherwise be done to Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Where, in the region of the new creation, in contrast with that in which the old man dwelt, there is not only does the distinction not exist, but it cannot exist." 
2. "But Christ is all and in all. Christ is the aggregation of all things, distinctions, prerogatives, blessings, and moreover is in all, dwelling in all, and so uniting all in the common element of Himself."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "There does not exist this ideal which is still a long way ahead of modern Christians as the Great War proved."
2. "Race distinctions disappear in Christ and in the new man in Christ."
3. "Christ occupies the whole sphere of human life and permeates all its developments."

### John Gill:
1. "It matters not of what nation a man is; this has no influence on his new birth, either to forward or hinder it."
2. "Neither one nor the other [circumcision or uncircumcision] is of any account with God, nor makes the man either better or worse."
3. "It is not nation, nor outward privileges, nor the civil state and condition of men, which are regarded by God, or are any motive to him, or have any influence upon the salvation of men: but Christ is all, and in all."

### John Wesley:
1. "In which case, it matters not what a man is externally."
2. "Christ is in all that are thus renewed, and is all things in them and to them."
