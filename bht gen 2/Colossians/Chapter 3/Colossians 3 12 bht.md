# Colossians 3:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To be chosen by God is a privilege that carries the responsibility of reflecting this divine calling. Believers, as the elect of God, are set apart as holy and cherished by Him. They are called to manifest this holiness through acts of compassion, kindness, humility, meekness, and long-suffering, exhibiting forgiveness just as the Lord forgave them. This transformation is empowered by the Holy Spirit, who renews and enables believers to live according to their chosen status. Through their actions and attitudes, they display the transformative power of the gospel and exemplify their identity as the elect of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Put on therefore (as a consequence of having put on the new man, to whom these belong) as the elect of God, holy and beloved..."
2. "...bowels of compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness, long-suffering, forbearing one another and forgiving each other..."
3. "...as also the Lord forgave you, so also ye..."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The order of the words 'elect, holy, beloved,' answers to the order of the things. Election from eternity precedes sanctification in time; the sanctified, feeling God's love, imitate it." 
2. "Bowels express the yearning compassion, which has its seat in the heart, and which we feel to act on our inward parts."
3. "True 'lowliness of mind'; not the mock 'humility' of the false teachers."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The fact that you thus belong to one and the same church; that you have been redeemed by the same blood, and chosen by the same grace, and that you are all brethren, should lead you to manifest a spirit of kindness, gentleness, and love."
2. "Bowels of mercies - Notes, Philippians 2:1."
3. "Kindness ... - See the notes at Ephesians 4:32. The language here is a little different from what it is there, but the sentiment is the same."

### John Calvin:
1. "Then will it appear that ye are renewed by Christ, when ye are merciful and kind. For these are the effects and evidences of renovation."
2. "He mentions, first, bowels of mercy, by which expression he means an earnest affection, with yearnings, as it were, of the bowels."
3. "He confirms this doctrine by the example of Christ, and teaches, that the same thing is required from us, that as we, who have so frequently and so grievously offended, have nevertheless been received into favor, we should manifest the same kindness towards our neighbors, by forgiving whatever offenses they have committed against us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For although the putting on of the new man as a fact, has historically occurred through the conversion to Christ, yet it has, according to the nature of the new man, its continued acts, which should occur, namely, through the appropriation of those virtues, which the new man as such must possess." (Meyer)
2. "The consciousness of this extraordinary privilege, of being the elect of God, who as such are holy and beloved of God how it must have affected the conscience of the readers and aroused them to the very virtues, corresponding with so high a position, which Paul here enjoins." (Meyer)
3. "The figure is a common one in the New Testament, expressing the same idea conveyed by 'heart' in modern speech." (Lightfoot)

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He explains and applies the figure of 'the new man' as 'the new garment'."
2. "The items in the new clothing for the new man in Christ Paul now gives in contrast with what was put off."
3. "The garments include a heart of compassion, kindness, humility, meekness, and long-suffering."

### John Gill:
1. "to be clothed with the Holy Spirit", is a phrase used by the Cabalistic doctors and is indeed a Scripture phrase
2. "as becomes the elect of God", as the Arabic version renders it; as such who were chosen in Christ from eternity, according to the sovereign will and pleasure of God, and his free grace unto salvation and eternal life
3. The apostle calls all the members of this church by this name, though every individual of them might not be chosen of God; but because they were all under a visible profession of faith and holiness, and the greater part of them were truly believers, he in a judgment of charity gives them all this appellation.

### John Wesley:
1. All who are thus renewed are elected of God, holy, and therefore the more beloved of him. Holiness is the consequence of their election, and God's superior love, of their holiness.
