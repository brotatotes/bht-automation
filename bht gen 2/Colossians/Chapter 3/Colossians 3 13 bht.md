# Colossians 3:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Not only should we bear with one another in the present, refraining from retaliating or seeking revenge, but we should also be willing to forgive each other for past offenses. Regardless of the person's status or the seriousness of their complaint, we should be ready to put up with it and extend our forgiveness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Forbearing—as to present offenses."
2. "forgiving—as to past offenses."
3. "quarrel—rather as Greek, 'cause of blame,' 'cause of complaint.'"
4. "Christ—who had so infinitely greater cause of complaint against us."
5. "The oldest manuscripts and Vulgate read 'the Lord.'" 
6. "English Version is supported by one very old manuscript and old versions."
7. "It seems to have crept in from Romans 14:10."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If another one has given us just occasion of complaint, we are to forgive him; that is, we are: (1) To harbor no malice against him; (2) We are to be ready to do him good as if he had not given us occasion of complaint; (3) We are to be willing to declare that we forgive him when he asks it; and, (4) We are always afterward to treat him as kindly as if he had not injured us."
2. "Learn here that Christ has power to forgive sin; Christ forgave us: (1) Freely - he did not hesitate or delay when we asked him; (2) Entirely - he pardoned all our offences; (3) Forever - he did it so as to remember our sins no more, and to treat us ever onward as if we had not sinned."
3. "So we should forgive an offending brother."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "For a similar variation of the pronoun see Ephesians 4:32; 1 Peter 4:8-10. The latter pronoun emphasizes the fact that they are all members of Christ's body - everyone members one of another - so that, in forgiving each other they forgive themselves."
2. "Quarrel [μομφην]. Only here in the New Testament. Cause of blame. Rev., complaint. The A. V. uses quarrel in its earlier sense of cause of complaint. So Shakespeare: 'The lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you.' 'Much Ado,' 2, 1. 'Against whom comest thou, and what's thy quarrel?' 'Richard ii,' 1, 3, 33."
3. "It was used of a plaintiff's action at law, like the Latin querela."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The pronouns are different, as in Ephesians 4:32; the latter marking more strongly the relation of Christians as members of Christ."
2. "If (as is probable) any man have a complaint (a cause of blame) against any: even as the Lord forgave you."
3. "So also do ye. In English we supply an imperative (‘do’), but the grammatical ellipsis is that of a participle (‘so also doing yourselves’)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Forbearing one another (holding yourselves back from one another)."
2. "Forgiving each other... instead of the reciprocal just before."
3. "Christ's forgiveness of us is here made the reason for our forgiveness of others."

### John Gill:
1. "Not only bearing one another's burdens, and with one another's weaknesses, but forbearing to render evil for evil, or railing for railing, or to seek revenge for affronts given, in whatsoever way, whether by words or deeds."
2. "Let him be who he will, high or low, rich or poor, of whatsoever age, state, or condition, and let his quarrel or complaint be what it will, ever so great, or ever so just and well founded, yet let him put up with it, and forgive it."
3. "As Mediator, he has procured the remission of sins by the shedding of his blood; and as God he forgives sins freely, fully, forgetting the injuries done, not upbraiding with former offences, and that too without asking, and before there is any appearance of repentance; and so should the saints forgive one another."

### John Wesley:
1. Forbearing one another — If anything is now wrong.And forgiving one another — What is past.
