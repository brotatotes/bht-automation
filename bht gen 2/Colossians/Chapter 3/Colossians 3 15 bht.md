# Colossians 3:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let the peace of Christ be the deciding factor in every situation, ruling over anger and discord, and calming the tumultuous passions of our hearts. This peace is not simply an absence of conflict, but the presence of God's peace that surpasses all understanding. We are called to be thankful, constantly growing in gratitude for the peace that God has bestowed upon us as members of the body of Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The peace of CHRIST." Therefore Christ is God. Peace was His legacy to His disciples before He left them. Peace is peculiarly His to give.
2. "Let the peace of Christ act as umpire when anger, envy, and such passions arise; and restrain them." Let not those passions give the award, so that you should be swayed by them, but let Christ's peace be the decider of everything.
3. Many wear a peaceful countenance and speak peace with the mouth, while war is in their hearts. Not to have "peace ruling in your hearts" would be inconsistent with the "calling in one body," and would be practical unthankfulness to God who called us.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The peace which God gives to the soul is to be to us what the brabeutes, or governor at the games was to those who contended there."
2. "The soul is liable to the agitations of passion and excitement - like an assembled multitude of men. It needs something to preside over it, and keep its various faculties in place and order."
3. "The 'peace of God' will thus calm down every agitated element of the soul; subdue the tumult of passion, and preserve the mind in healthful action and order."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Peace of Christ. Which comes from Christ." 
2. "The previous references to occasions for meekness, long - suffering, forbearance, forgiveness, etc., indicate a conflict of passions and motives in the heart."
3. "Christ is the one who adjusts all these, so that the metaphorical sense is appropriate."

### John Calvin:
1. "He would have the peace of God be superior to all carnal affections, which often hurry us on to contentions, disagreements, quarrels, secret grudges."
2. "Hence he says, in our hearts; because we constantly feel there great conflicts, while the flesh lusteth against the Spirit."
3. "He adds, in one body, meaning by this, that we cannot be in a state of agreement with God otherwise than by being united among ourselves as members of one body."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts." - The word ‘rule’ is more exactly: ‘act as umpire,’ a figure borrowed from the Grecian games. The idea is...substantially the same. It is from God, but Christ’s gift and is to be here understood in its widest sense.
2. "If the sense of arbitrating, acting as umpire, is retained, then the reference is to internal conflict in which this peace decides." - The word itself favors the latter view.
3. "The ‘one body’ is the body of Christ, the Church... To have become through the call one body with the sharers in that call, and yet not to permit the holy moral disposition, for the sake of which one is called, to be the common controlling power of life, what a contradiction!" - Meyer.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The peace of Christ... The peace that Christ gives."
2. "Rule... to act as umpire."
3. "Be ye thankful... Keep on becoming thankful."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'the peace of God' is meant...that peace which does, or should subsist among the saints themselves, which God is the author of, calls for, and requires, and encourages in them."
2. "This may be said to 'reign' in their hearts, when it is the governing principle there; when it restrains the turbulent passions...and composes differences."
3. "The saints in their effectual calling are called to peace by God, who is the God of peace; by Christ, who is the Prince of peace; and by the Spirit, whose fruit is peace; and through the Gospel, which is the Gospel of peace...and they are not only called to this, but they are called 'in one body'; though they are many members, yet they are but one body; and therefore ought to be in peace, and that should bear the sway in them."

### John Wesley:
1. "The peace of God shall rule in your hearts - Shall sway every temper, affection, thought, as the reward (so the Greek word implies) of your preceding love and obedience."
