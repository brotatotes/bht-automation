# Colossians 3:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let Christ's divine word take up its residence in you abundantly, filling and governing your entire being. This word of Christ, which encompasses the entire Scripture and exalts His divinity, should be known and understood with wisdom. Let it dwell in you richly, not sparingly, so that it may be taught and proclaimed to one another, through psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. Sing in your hearts to God, allowing your thoughts and praises to be directed solely to Him. May the word of Christ dwell in you abundantly, inspiring teaching, admonition, and heartfelt worship to the Lord.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Let Christ’s word dwell in you richly, in all wisdom, teaching and warning each other in psalms, hymns, spiritual songs, in grace, singing in your hearts to God." 
2. "The word dwelling in them richly, many would arise to speak it to edification, and many would be moved to the utterance of praise."
3. "The singing in grace is an analogous expression to that in 1 Corinthians 14:28, ἐὰν δὲ μὴ ᾖ διερμηνευτής, ... ἑαυτῷ... λαλείτω κ. τῷ θεῷ. So the ἐν ταῖς καρδ. ὑμ. describes the method of uttering this praise, viz. by the thoughts only: τῷ θεῷ designates to whom it is to be addressed, not, as before, to one another, but to God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Let the word of Christ—the Gospel word by which ye have been called—richly—in all wisdom—ALFORD joins this clause with 'teaching,' c., not with 'dwell in you,' as English Version, for so we find in Romans 15:14- :, 'teaching in all wisdom,' and the two clauses will thus correspond, 'In all wisdom teaching,' and 'in grace singing in your hearts' (so the Greek order)."
2. "At the Agapæ or love-feasts, and in their family circles, they were to be so full of the Word of Christ in the heart that the mouth should give it utterance in hymns of instruction, admonition, and praise (compare Deuteronomy 6:7)."
3. "Paul contrasts (as in Ephesians 5:18 Ephesians 5:19) the songs of Christians at their social meetings, with the bacchanalian and licentious songs of heathen feasts. Singing usually formed part of the entertainment at Greek banquets (compare Ephesians 5:19- :)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Let the word of Christ - The doctrine of Christ. Dwell in you richly in all wisdom - Abundantly, producing the spirit of true wisdom. That doctrine is adapted to make you wise."
2. "The only additional thought here is, that their psalms and hymns were to be regarded as a method of 'teaching' and 'admonishing;' that is, they were to be imbued with truth, and to be such as to elevate the mind, and withdraw it from error and sin."
3. "Hence, it is indispensable, in order to the preservation of the truth, that the sacred songs of a church should be imbued with sound evangelical sentiment."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word of Christ. The only occurrence of the phrase. The word spoken by Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "He would have the doctrine of the gospel be familiarly known by them."
2. "He exhorts that it should dwell in them; that is, that it should have a settled abode, and that largely, that they may make it their aim to advance and increase more and more every day."
3. "He requires mutual teaching and admonition."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "'The word of Christ’ is the word which Christ has spoken, or caused to be proclaimed."
2. "‘Richly;’ ‘not with a scanty foothold, but with a large and liberal occupancy.’"
3. "The words refer (though not exclusively) to the Old Testament psalms, to hymns of praise to Christ, and to other poetic productions, the result of the indwelling of the Holy Ghost."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul is exalting Christ in this Epistle." 
2. "The same song can have all three words applied to it."
3. "Without this there is no real worship 'to God' (τω θεω)."

### John Gill:
1. "By which may be meant the whole Scripture, all the writings of the Old and New Testament, which are by inspiration of God."
2. "The Gospel, which Christ is the author of as God, the preacher of as man, and the subject matter of as God-man and Mediator."
3. "Singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord; that is, singing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs; and what is meant by singing of them, see the note on the above place."

### John Wesley:
1. "Let the word of Christ...asserts the divinity of his Master."
2. "Dwell...take up its stated residence."
3. "Richly...in the largest measure...fill and govern the whole soul."
