# Colossians 3:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is fitting and proper for wives to be in subjection to their husbands, as it is a reflection of the original creation of man and woman, and the woman's role in the transgression. This submission is not only required by the law of God, but also commanded by Christ in the Gospel. The idea of submission carries the connotation of a complete submission, like the obedience of soldiers to their general.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The verb is in the imperfect as ἔδει and χρῆν, conveying always in its form a slight degree of blame, as implying the non-realization of the duty pointed out just as when we say, 'It was your duty to,' &c."
2. "The words ἐν κυρίῳ belong to ἀνῆκεν, not to ὑποτάσεσθε; as is shown by the parallel expression in Colossians 3:20; was fitting, in that element of life designated by ἐν κυρίῳ."


### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Unto your own husbands—The oldest manuscripts omit 'own,' which crept in from 1 Corinthians 7:39." 
2. "As it is fit in the Lord—Greek, 'was fit,' implying that there was at Colosse some degree of failure in fulfilling this duty." 
3. "As it was your duty to have done as disciples of the Lord."

### Albert Barnes:
1. Wives, submit yourselves ... - Notes on the parallel passage in Ephesians 5:21-24.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The imperfect tense, was fitting, or became fitting, points to the time of their entrance upon the Christian life."
2. "The past tense perhaps implies an essential a priori obligation."
3. "Connect with is fitting, and compare well-pleasing in the Lord."

### John Calvin:
1. "He commands wives to be subject...so that he confirms the subjection of wives by the authority of God."
2. "He requires love on the part of husbands, and that they be not bitter, because there is a danger lest they should abuse their authority in the way of tyranny."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Bible everywhere recognizes the relation as of this character (from Genesis 2:18-24 to Revelation 22:17)."
2. "Hence the submission is to be a loving one, with a Christian motive."
3. "As if fitting (as it should be) in the Lord. This means: as should be the case, in consequence of the fellowship with Jesus Christ."

1. "Ye wives, be in subjection to your husbands." 
2. "The verb υποτασσομα has a military air, common in the Koine for such obedience."
3. "Recognition of the husband's leadership is essential to a well-ordered home, only the assumption is that the husband has a head and a wise one."

### John Gill:
1. "Subjection of wives to their own husbands is 'fit' and proper in its own nature, by reason of the original creation of man, and of the woman from him." 
2. "Moreover, the woman was made for the man, and not the man for the woman; add to this, that the woman was in the transgression, and the means of the fall of man, which gave a fresh reason for, and made the obligation to subjection to him the stronger."
3. "It is what is fitting 'in the Lord': it is what he requires, not only what the law of God requires,...but is what is commanded by Christ under the Gospel dispensation, and is to be observed by all those that are 'in' him, that profess to be new creatures, converted persons."

### John Wesley:
1. Wives, submit — Or be subject to. It is properly a military term, alluding to that entire submission that soldiers pay to their general. Ephesians 5:22, etc.
