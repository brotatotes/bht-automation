# Colossians 3:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Husbands, loving your wives is not just about displaying affection or passion, but also about avoiding bitterness and ill-tempered behavior. Be mindful not to let anger or harsh words poison the relationship. Instead, choose kindness and respect. Maintaining a loving and harmonious marriage is of utmost importance, for when bitterness seeps in, it corrodes the sacred bond. Let us remember that our actions towards our spouses have a profound impact on the community around us. Therefore, let us strive to love and cherish our wives, nurturing a marriage that reflects the values of the Gospel.
