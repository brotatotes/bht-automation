# Colossians 3:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As believers, we are called to set our minds on things above and not on earthly matters. This does not mean that we should completely ignore or neglect earthly responsibilities, but rather that our primary focus and affection should be directed towards heavenly pursuits. We should not be captivated by worldly pleasures or trivial traditions, but rather seek and think about the things that are above. By doing so, we align our hearts and minds with the eternal purposes of God and strive to cultivate a heavenly-mindedness that transforms our perspective on life and helps us bring a taste of heaven to earth.
