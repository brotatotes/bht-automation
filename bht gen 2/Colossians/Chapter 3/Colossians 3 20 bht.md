# Colossians 3:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Children, it is important to listen and heed the commands of your parents, for their instructions are for your benefit. While you should obey your parents in all things that are good and lawful, it is important to note that you should not obey if they ask you to do something sinful. Even when their instructions are difficult or challenging, remember that obeying them is pleasing to the Lord. Ultimately, when we act out of love, faith, and a desire to bring glory to God, our actions become acceptable in His sight through Jesus Christ.

2. "It is best to take εὐάρεστον, as Mey. absolutely, as προσφιλῆ, Philippians 4:8; the Christian qualification being given by the ἐν κυρίῳ."

2. "In all things, therefore, that they may not refuse anything, however difficult or disagreeable... in all things, that they may not put themselves on a footing of equality with their parents, in the way of questioning and debating, or disputing, it being always understood that conscience is not to be infringed upon." (460-461)
3. "He prohibits parents from exercising an immoderate harshness, lest their children should be so disheartened as to be incapable of receiving any honorable training; for we see, from daily experience, the advantage of a liberal education." (461)

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Obey your parents. Old verb to listen under, to hearken, to heed, to obey."
