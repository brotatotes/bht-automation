# Colossians 3:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Fathers, be careful not to provoke your children to anger, for this may cause them to become discouraged and disheartened. Such treatment can break their spirits, leading them to be indolent and unfit for life's tasks. When children feel they are not loved or valued, they may disregard their parents' instructions and become rebellious. Let us remember the importance of offering affection and encouragement to our children, so that they may grow up with confidence and motivation.
