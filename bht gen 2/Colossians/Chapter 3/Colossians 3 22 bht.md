# Colossians 3:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Servants are instructed to obey their masters in all physical matters, not matters of conscience or religion. They are urged to avoid performing their duties only when their masters are watching, and instead to act with sincerity and integrity. They should have a single-minded devotion to doing what is right, without any ulterior motives. Their actions should be driven by their fear and reverence for God, acknowledging His presence and accountability for their actions.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The ὀφθαλμοδουλεῖαι here are the concrete acts of the εία of Ephesians 6:6, the abstract spirit."
2. "τὸν κύριον, Him who is absolutely, and not merely κατὰ σάρκα, your master."
3. "τοῦτό ἑστι φοβεῖσθαι τὸν θεόν, ὅταν, μηδενὸς ὁρῶντος, μηδὲν πράττωμεν πονηρόν. ἂν δὲ πράττωμεν, οὐχὶ τὸν θεόν, ἀλλὰ τοὺς ἀνθρώπους φοβούμεθα."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This is to fear God, when, though none sees us, we do no evil: but if we do evil, it is not God, but men, whom we fear."
2. "Singleness—'simplicity of heart.'"
3. "Fearing God—The oldest manuscripts read, 'the Lord.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Kuriov Lord and despothv master came to be used interchangeably in the New Testament, though originally the latter involved such authority as is implied in our use of despot, or in the relation of a master to a slave."
2. "The word seems to have been coined by Paul. Men pleasers [ανθρωπαρεσκοι]."
3. "Without duplicity or doubleness. Fearing the Lord [τον κυριον]. The one Master contrasted with the masters [κυριοις] according to the flesh."

### John Calvin:
1. "For we serve the Lord Christ; and, He that will act unjustly will receive the reward of his iniquity. By the former statement he means, that service is done to men in such a way that Christ at the same time holds supremacy of dominion, and is the supreme master."
2. "Here, truly, is choice consolation for all that are under subjection, inasmuch as they are informed that, while they willingly serve their masters, their services are acceptable to Christ, as though they had been rendered to him."
3. "In the second clause he again comforts servants, by saying that, if they are oppressed by the unjust cruelty of their masters, God himself will take vengeance, and will not, on the ground that they are servants, overlook the injuries inflicted upon them, inasmuch as there is no respect of persons with him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word was coined by the Apostle to express the service which aims only to seem faithful."
2. "The motive must be a higher one than that of pleasing men. 'Eyeservices' are the natural result of being 'men-pleasers.'"
3. "The Christian should render the service due another, with a desire to be, not merely to seem, faithful."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Lords" really, but these Christian slaves (δουλο) had Christ as lord, but even so they were to obey their lords in the flesh. (Commentary)
2. "Not with eye-service (μη εν οφθαλμοδουλιαις). Another Pauline word (here only and Ephesians 6:6), elsewhere only in Christian writers after Paul, an easy and expressive compound, service while the master's eye was on the slave and no longer." (Commentary)
3. "In singleness of heart (εν απλοτητ καρδιας). So in Ephesians 6:5. Old and expressive word from απλους (simple, without folds). See 2 Corinthians 11:3." (Commentary)

### John Gill:
1. "Servants, obey in all things your masters,.... That is, in all things relating to the body, and bodily service; not to the conscience, and religious worship; in things worldly, and not spiritual."
2. "Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers, but in singleness of heart;"
3. "Fearing God; who sees and knows all things, what servants do when their masters are absent from them, and to whom they are accountable."

### John Wesley:
1. "Eyeservice — Being more diligent under their eye than at other times."
2. "Singleness of heart — A simple intention of doing right, without looking any farther."
3. "Fearing God — That is, acting from this principle."
