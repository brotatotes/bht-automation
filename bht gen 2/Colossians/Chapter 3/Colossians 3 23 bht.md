# Colossians 3:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do everything with enthusiasm and diligence, not out of obligation or resentment, but with genuine fondness and good intention towards those you serve. This is like the devotion of the Hebrew servant who loved his master and family and chose to stay with them. Your service should be directed towards the Lord, not dependent on the approval or treatment of men. By being wholehearted in your service, you are not easily discouraged or affected by the opinions or actions of others.
