# Colossians 3:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If we serve Christ and leave our wrongs in His hands, He will avenge all the injustices, ensuring that the wrongs committed by both the master and the slave are repaid. God is fair and just, showing no favoritism based on societal status or wealth. He treats everyone equally, not distinguishing between the rich and the poor, the master and the slave. In the end, he will administer justice for both parties involved, doing what is right and just.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This verse seems best to be taken as addressed to the slaves by way of encouragement to regard Christ as their Master and serve Him seeing that all their wrongs in this world, if they leave them in His hands, will be in due time righted by Him, the just judge, with whom there is no respect of persons."
2. "For he that doeth wrong shall receive...that which he did wrongfully...and there is not respect of persons."
3. "So that in your Christian uprightness and conscientiousness you need not fear that you shall be in the end overborne by the superior power of your masters: there is A judge who will defend and right you."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Serve ye the Lord Christ, and leave your wrongs in His hands to put to rights."
2. "For he that doeth wrong shall receive back the wrong which he hath done, and there is no respect of persons with the Great Judge in the day of the Lord."
3. "He favors the master no more than the slave."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "If the slave do wrong, he shall be punished; but the master who does wrong will not be excused, for there is no respect of persons."
2. "Shall receive."
3. "Respect of persons. In the Old Testament it has, more commonly, a good sense, of kindly reception, favorable regard. In the New Testament always a bad sense, which came to it through the meaning of mask which attached to proswpon face."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He that doeth wrong, etc. The general principle is: ‘whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap’ (Galatians 6:7)."
2. "As the admonitions have been addressed to the servants, it seems improper to limit a general statement so as to exclude such a warning here."
3. "Men often talk and act as though God always took the part of the poor and of the laboring class. Yet this view makes Him a respecter of persons. Such a mistake will not aid in solving the serious problems of the ‘labor question;’ problems as real and in some respects as dangerous as those of slavery."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Shall receive again for the wrong that he hath done. It is not clear whether ο αδικων (he that doeth wrong) is the master or the slave. It is true of either and Lightfoot interprets it of both, 'shall receive back the wrong which he did.'" 
2. "This is a general law of life and of God and it is fair and square." 
3. "There is no respect of persons. There is with men, but not with God."

### John Gill:
1. "God will avenge all such injuries, sooner or later."
2. "He regards not the rich more than the poor; he makes no difference between bond and free, the servant and the master."
3. "He will do that which is just and right with regard to them both."
