# Colossians 3:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are called to live a life separate from the world, having died to its ways. This new spiritual life is not focused on earthly and sensual things, but is hidden with Christ in God. Our true life, which is secured by our connection to Christ, is not yet visible to the world, but when Christ reveals Himself in glory, our hidden glory will also be made manifest. This eternal life, which we long for, is secure in the presence of God, and we are called to patiently wait for its full revelation.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "For ye are dead - Dead to the world; dead to sin; dead to earthly pleasures."
2. "The idea of the apostle is, that as Christ became literally dead in the tomb, so we, in virtue of our connection with him, have become dead to sin, to worldly influences, pleasures, and ambition."
3. "Our eternal life, therefore, is as secure as it could possibly be made. The true condition of the Christian is, that he is 'dead' to this world, but that he has immortal life in prospect, and that is secure, being in the holy keeping of his Redeemer, now in the presence of God."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "Is hid (κεκρυπτα). Perfect passive indicative of κρυπτω, old verb, to hide, remains concealed, locked 'together with' (συν) Christ, 'in' (εν) God. No hellish burglar can break that combination."

### John Gill:
1. "Believers being dead with Christ, should have no regard to the rudiments of the world, the ceremonies of the law, and the ordinances of men."
2. "The saint's life is either spiritual, a life of grace from Christ, a life of faith on him, and a life of communion with him, and may be distinguished into a life of sanctification, both internal and external, and into a life of justification; or eternal, which is a life free from all the sorrows of this, both outward and inward; a life of perfection and pleasure, of vision and enjoyment of God and Christ."
3. "Moreover, this phrase is expressive of the safety, as well as of the value and preciousness of this life, things of worth being hid for security."
