# Colossians 3:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ is the source of our spiritual life, being both the origin and object of our existence. But this life, which is hidden now, will be fully revealed when Christ appears in all His glory. Our physical bodies will be raised and joined with our souls, and those who have found life in Christ will appear with Him in the fullness of His glory.
