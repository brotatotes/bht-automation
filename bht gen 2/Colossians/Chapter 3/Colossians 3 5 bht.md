# Colossians 3:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Mortify therefore the members of your body by putting to death the sinful actions which flow from the body of sin. This includes acts of uncleanness, whether in thought, word, or deed, as well as any inordinate affection or passion that does not come from a love of God. Furthermore, evil desires, those cravings of the flesh, the eyes, and the pride of life, must be subdued. This also includes covetousness, the desire for more or anything apart from God, which amounts to idolatry as it turns our hearts away from the Creator.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Follow out to its necessary consequence the fact of your having once for all died with Christ spiritually at your regeneration, by daily 'deadening your members,' of which united 'the body of the sins of the flesh' consists."
2. "Habitually repress and do violence to corrupt desires of which the members are the instruments."
3. "Covetousness—marked off by the Greek article as forming a whole genus by itself, distinct from the genus containing the various species just enumerated. It implies a self-idolizing, grasping spirit; far worse than another Greek term translated 'the love of money' (1 Timothy 6:10)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Mortify therefore your members - Since you are dead to sin and the world, and are to appear with Christ in the glories of his kingdom, subdue every carnal and evil propensity of your nature."
2. "They were wholly to extirpate those evil passions which he specifies as having their seat in the various members of the earthly body."
3. "Of all base passions, this is the one that most dethrones God from the soul."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Mortify is used in its literal sense of put to death."
2. "The physical members, so far as they are employed in the service of sin."
3. "In apposition with members, denoting the modes in which the members sinfully exert themselves."

### John Calvin:
1. "He makes mention of certain vices which he calls, not with strict accuracy, but at the same time elegantly, members. For he conceives of our nature as being, as it were, a mass made up of different vices."
2. "He intimates, however, that we are earthly, so long as the vices of our flesh are vigorous in us, and that we are made heavenly by the renewing of the Spirit."
3. "After fornication he adds uncleanness, by which term he expresses all kinds of wantonness, by which lascivious persons pollute themselves. To these is added, πάθος that is, lust, which includes all the allurements of unhallowed desire."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Kill once for all, is the thought of the original, and the command is an inference, therefore, from Colossians 3:1; Colossians 3:3."
2. "The putting to death is to be understood in an ethical, not in a physical sense; and the list of sins which follow shows that ‘members’ cannot refer to the parts of the body as such, but only as instruments of these sins."
3. "The relative here may be paraphrased thus. There is an intimate connection between sins of lust and sins of greed; they both spring from the same root, ‘the fierce and ever fiercer longing of the creature which has turned away from God, to fill itself with the inferior objects of sense’ (Trench)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul boldly applies the metaphor of death (Colossians 2:20; Colossians 3:3) pictured in baptism (Colossians 2:12) to the actual life of the Christian."
2. "Paul's idea is that the body is the temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19)."
3. "He mentions some of these 'members upon the earth' like fornication (πορνειαν), uncleanness (ακαθαρσιαν), passion (παθος), evil desire (επιθυμιαν κακην), covetousness (πλεονεξιαν) 'the which is idolatry' (ητις εστιν ειδωλολατρια)."

### John Gill:
1. "Mortify therefore your members...of the body of sin...the sins of the flesh, or sinful actions, which are generally performed by the members of the natural body..."
2. "The actions that flow from it, and are done by it, are not to be ascribed to God, nor even to Satan, but they are our own actions..."
3. "fornication; the sin of uncleanness committed by single persons, or out of the state of marriage...all other impure actions...those vile affections, which some in a judicial way are given up unto...every fleshly lust and inordinate desire..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Mortify therefore... Put to death, slay with a continued stroke."
2. "Your members... Which together make up the body of sin."
3. "Uncleanness... In act, word, or thought."
4. "Inordinate affection... Every passion which does not flow from and lead to the love of God."
5. "Evil desire... The desire of the flesh, the desire of the eye, and the pride of life."
6. "Covetousness... Means the desire of having more, or of any thing independent on God."
7. "Which is idolatry... Properly and directly; for it is giving the heart to a creature."
