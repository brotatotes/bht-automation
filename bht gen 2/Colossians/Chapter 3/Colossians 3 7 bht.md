# Colossians 3:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Living in sin refers to the inward inclination towards sinful desires and thoughts, while walking in sin refers to the outward expression of those desires through sinful actions. It's important to understand that sin is a destructive path that leads to darkness and ruin. Persisting in a sinful lifestyle and taking pleasure in it only deepens one's bondage to sin and distances them from the life of righteousness. The contrast between living in sin and walking in righteousness underscores the need for a complete transformation through the power of Christ.
