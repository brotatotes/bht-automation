# Colossians 3:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are called to put off the sins of anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, and filthy communication. These vices are inconsistent with the Christian calling and are to be put away like old clothes, as they hinder the development of the new nature in Christ. Such behavior includes impetuous passion, abusive speech, and obscene language, which are contrary to the pure conversation that should be present among believers. Let us, therefore, lay aside these sins and strive towards perfect love, which casts out both fear and sin.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The new man is not anything ready at once and complete, but ever in a state of development by which a new state and nature is brought about in it, specifically different from that of the old man." 
2. "Whatever may have been God's image in which the first Adam was created, it is certain that the image of God, in which Christ's Spirit re-creates us, will be as much more glorious than that, as the second man is more glorious than the first."
3. "Every distinctive category of humanity is done away as to worth or privilege, and all have been absorbed into and centre in this one, Christ is all, yea Christ is His members, in vital union with Him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But now—that ye are no longer living in them."
2. "Ye also—like other believers; answering to 'ye also' (like other unbelievers formerly)."
3. "Put off—'Do ye also put away all these,' namely, those just enumerated, and those which follow."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "All these which follow, as being also inconsistent with the Christian calling."
2. "The conversation of the pagan everywhere abounds with this. A pure method of conversation among men is the fruit of Christianity."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Put off anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy...out of your mouth." 
2. "Compare Romans 13:12; Ephesians 4:22, Ephesians 4:25; Hebrews 12:1; James 1:21; 1 Peter 2:1."
3. "Filthy communication...not merely filthy talking, but foul-mouthed abuse."

### John Calvin:
1. "For the power and nature of mortification are such, that all corrupt affections are extinguished in us, lest sin should afterwards produce in us its wonted fruits."
2. "What I have rendered indignationem , (indignation,) is in the Greek θυμός — a term, which denotes a more impetuous passionateness than ὀργὴ, (anger.)"
3. "Here, however, he enumerates, as may easily be perceived, forms of vice that were different from those previously mentioned."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But now, in contrast with ‘once’ (Colossians 3:7), ye also, as well as other Christians, put off, as garments are put off (not the same word as in Colossians 3:9, but found in Ephesians 4:22; Ephesians 4:25), all these, ‘the whole of them,’ including the sins named in Colossians 3:5, as well as those now mentioned. This is a command, not a declaration."
2. "Anger, wrath, malice (these three form a climax), evil speaking (lit., ‘blasphemy’). See on Ephesians 4:31, where all the terms occur."
3. "Abusive talking. In Ephesians 5:4 a similar expression is rendered ‘filthiness;’ this word occurs only here, and refers to coarse abusive speech, not exclusively to ‘filthy talking.’ Out of your mouth; this applies to the last two terms."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Put ye also away - Second aorist middle imperative of old verb αποτιθημ, to put away, lay aside like old clothes."
2. "The whole bunch of filthy rags - anger οργην, wrath θυμον, malice κακιαν, railing βλασφημιαν, shameful speaking αισχρολογιαν."
3. "Such language should never come out of the mouth of a Christian living the new life in Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "Intimating, that now since they were converted and delivered out of the former state in which they were once, and professed not to walk and live in sin, it became them to separate, remove, and put at a distance from them all sins, and every vice, to lay them aside as dead weights upon them, and put them off as filthy garments."
2. "Filthy communication is the same with that which is said to be corrupt, Ephesians 4:29; and which, though it is applicable to all speech that is unsavoury, unedifying, idle, and useless, and may be properly enough said of flattery, lying, cursing, and swearing; yet chiefly regards obscene language, unchaste words, and filthy talking, which tend to encourage and cherish the sin of uncleanness in any of its branches."

### John Wesley:
1. "Wrath - Is lasting anger."
2. "Filthy discourse - And was there need to warn even these saints of God against so gross and palpable a sin as this?"
3. "O what is man, till perfect love casts out both fear and sin."
