# Colossians 3:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are commanded to refrain from lying because as members of the same body, it goes against their nature. They have already put off the old man, their unregenerate nature, along with the sinful habits that come with it. This requires a complete renunciation of their former way of life and a commitment to live a new life in Christ. Just as in baptism, believers symbolically put off their old selves and profess a new life. Their actions must align with their profession in order to reflect the transformative work of Christ in them.

2. "The sense is, that lying is one of the fruits of sin. It is that which the corrupt nature of man naturally produces; and when that is put off, then all that that nature produces should be also put off with it."
3. "The vice of lying is a universal fruit of sin, and seems to exist everywhere where the gospel does not prevail."
