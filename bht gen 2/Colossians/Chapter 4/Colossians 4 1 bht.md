# Colossians 4:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Masters, it is important that you not only demand what is rightfully owed to you, but also that you display fairness and generosity in your treatment of your servants. Just as the apostle addresses the duties of servants to their masters, he also directs masters to fulfill their responsibilities towards their servants. This includes providing them with proper sustenance and compensation, treating them with kindness and compassion, supporting them in times of difficulty, and applying discipline within reason and fairness. By doing so, masters not only uphold their contractual obligations but also demonstrate a higher standard of justice and equality.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Seeing that such exhortations occur in Ephesians also in terms so very similar, we are not justified, with Chrys., al., in assuming that there was anything in the peculiar circumstances of the Colossian church, which required more than common exhortation of this kind."
2. "It has been said that it is only in Epistles addressed to the Asiatic churches, that such exhortations are found: but in this remark the entirely general character of the Epistle to the Ephesians is forgotten."
3. "Besides, the exhortations of the Epistle to Titus cannot be so completely severed from these as to be set down in another category, as Eadie has endeavored to do."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "give—Greek 'render': literally, 'afford.' equal—that is, as the slaves owe their duties to you, so you equally owe to them your duties as masters."
2. "ALFORD translates, 'fairness,' 'equity,' which gives a large and liberal interpretation of justice in common matters."
3. "knowing—(Col 4:1) ye also—as well as they."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That which is just and equal - What they ought to have; what is fairly their due."
2. "But it is equally clear that they meant to represent slavery as a hard and undesirable condition."
3. "Though, therefore, it may be true that this passage only enjoins the rendering of that which was 'just' and 'equal' in their condition as slaves, yet it contains a principle which would 'lay the axe at the root' of slavery, and would lead a conscientious Christian to the feeling that his slaves ought to be free."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Greek implies on your part."
2. "Not equality of condition, but the brotherly equality growing out of the Christian relation in which there is neither bond nor free."

### John Calvin:
1. "Masters, what is just...expresses that kindness...by which he has given injunction."
2. "But as masters...think that they are bound by no law, Paul brings them under control."
3. "For masters have not their servants bound to them in such a manner as not to owe something to them in their turn."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The fundamental thought of that Epistle would suggest a fuller treatment."
2. "Nowhere is the division of chapters more infelicitous than here."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "If employers always did this, there would be no labour problem."
2. "A Master in heaven. A wholesome reminder to the effect that he keeps his eye on the conduct of masters of men here towards their employees."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle having observed the duty of servants to their masters, proceeds to direct masters to the discharge of their duty to their servants." 
2. "Giving them that which is just and equal: proper food and raiment, which is sufficient and fitting for them; the wages due unto them by law or contract."
3. "Using them with gentleness and humanity, taking care of them when under affliction, and in sickness; encouraging the diligent and laborious by an addition to their salaries; correcting the disobedient within just bounds, not with too much rigour and severity; and carrying it with an even hand to all, not preferring or indulging one before another, without any reason."

### John Wesley:
1. Just — According to your contract.Equitable — Even beyond the letter of your contract.
