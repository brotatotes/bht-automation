## BHT:
Aristarchus, a close companion and fellow prisoner of Paul, exemplified their shared dedication to their mission.

Without these explicit guidelines, there may have been hesitancy among the Colossians in receiving Mark, emphasizing the importance of receiving and adhering to clear guidance.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "συναιχμάλωτος belongs to the same image of warfare as συνστρατιώτης." 
2. "ἀνεψιός can hardly be other than John Mark, who accompanied Paul and Barnabas in part of their first missionary journey."
3. "What these commands were, must be left in entire uncertainty. They had been sent previous to the writing of our Epistle."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He was now at Rome with Paul... that Paul's friends voluntarily shared his imprisonment by turns, Aristarchus being his fellow prisoner when he wrote to the Colossians, Epaphras when he wrote to Philemon."
2. "The Greek for 'fellow prisoner' is literally, fellow captive, an image from prisoners taken in warfare, Christians being 'fellow soldiers', whose warfare is 'the good fight of faith.'"
3. "The family belonged to Cyprus, this accounts for Barnabas' choice of Cyprus as the first station on their journey and for Mark's accompanying them readily so far, it being the country of his family."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "As he held the same sentiments as Paul, and was united with him in his travels and labors, it was natural that he should be treated in the same manner."
2. "Paul mentions Mark here with affection... Paul did not harbor unkind and unforgiving feelings toward anyone."
3. "Paul retained no malice, and now commended, in the warmest manner, one from whom he was formerly constrained to separate."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Reasons unknown to us may easily have determined the use of one word or the other, independently of the question as to the particular time when they were in imprisonment."
2. "The sense of nephew did not attach to the word until very late."
3. "This incidental notice explains why Barnabas should have taken a more favorable view of Mark's defection than Paul."

### John Calvin:
1. "From this it appears that there were others that were associated with Paul, after he was brought to Rome."
2. "They were careful in furnishing attestations, that they might distinguish good men from false brethren — from pretenders, from impostors, and multitudes of vagrants."
3. "The same care is more than simply necessary at the present day, both because good teachers are coldly received, and because credulous and foolish men lay themselves too open to be deceived by impostors."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A Macedonian from Thessalonica... who was with Paul in Asia Minor, and probably not unknown at Colossæ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "My fellow-prisoner (ο συναιχμαλωτος μου). One of Paul's compounds, found elsewhere only in Lucian. Paul uses it of Epaphras in Philemon 1:23, but whether of actual voluntary imprisonment or of spiritual imprisonment like συνστρατιωτες (fellow-soldier) in Philippians 2:25; Philemon 1:2 we do not know."
2. "Mark (Μαρκος). Once rejected by Paul for his defection in the work (Acts 15:36-39), but now cordially commended because he had made good again."
3. "If he come unto you, receive him (εαν ελθη προς υμας δεξασθε αυτον). This third class conditional sentence (εαν and second aorist active subjunctive of ερχομα) gives the substance of the commands (εντολας) about Mark already sent, how we do not know. But Paul's commendation of Mark is hearty and unreserved as he does later in 2 Timothy 4:11."

### John Gill:
1. "He was a constant companion of the apostle, and one of his fellow labourers."
2. "Barnabas being so great a man as he was, and so well known, it added some credit to Mark, that he was a relation of his."
3. "For this was either the substance of those letters, or what the apostle now adds of his own, for the further confirmation of them."

### John Wesley:
1. "Aristarchus my fellowprisoner."
2. "Ye have received directions."
3. "They might have scrupled to receive him, without this fresh direction."
