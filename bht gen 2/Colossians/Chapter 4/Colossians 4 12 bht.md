# Colossians 4:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
May you be filled with the knowledge of God's will, growing in every Christian grace and being fully equipped with His light, grace, wisdom, and holiness. As a servant of Christ, Epaphras fervently labored in prayers for your well-being, never forgetting his dear flock at Colosse. His desire was that you would stand firm, complete in Christ and fully assured in all that God wills for you, aligning your lives perfectly with His purposes. May you strive earnestly in prayer, seeking to know and fulfill God's perfect will in every aspect of your lives.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "By mentioning Epaphras’s anxious prayers for them, he works further on their affections, giving them an additional motive for stedfastness, in that one of themselves was thus striving in prayer for them." 
2. "That ye may stand, perfect and fully persuaded (see reff.), in (be firmly settled in, without danger of vacillating or falling) all the will of God."
3. "This connexion, of στῆτε with ἐν, as Mey., seems better than, as ordinarily (so also De W. and Ellic.), to join ἐν with the participles."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Christ—The oldest manuscripts add 'Jesus.'"
2. "Translate, 'striving earnestly' (see on Colossians 1:29 and Colossians 1:29- :), literally, 'striving as in the agony of a contest.'"
3. "The oldest manuscripts read, 'fully assured.' It is translated, 'fully persuaded,' Romans 4:21; Romans 14:5."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Always laboring fervently for you in prayers." - The word denotes the intense desire which he had for their salvation; his fervent, earnest pleading for their welfare.
2. "That ye may stand perfect and complete." - The desire was, that they might maintain their Christian principles unadulterated by the mixture of philosophy and error, and completely perform the will of God in every respect.
3. "This is the expression of a pious wish in regard to them, without any affirmation that any had been absolutely perfect, or that they would be perfect in this world." - It is, however, a command of God that we should be perfect, and it is the highest wish of benevolence in reference to anyone that he may be complete in moral character, and may do all the will of God.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Laboring fervently [αγωνιζομενος]...Compare Romans 14:30."
2. "Perfect [τελειοι] ... Complete [πεπληροφορημενοι] ... Rev., fully assured."
3. "In all the will [εν παντι θεληματι] ... everything willed by God."

### John Calvin:
1. "Here we have an example of a good pastor, whom distance of place cannot induce to forget the Church, so as to prevent him from taking the care of it with him beyond the sea."
2. "We must notice, also, the strength of entreaty that is expressed in the word striving."
3. "Lastly, let us infer from Paul’s words, that the perfection of Christians is, when they stand complete in the will of God, that they may not suspend their scheme of life upon anything else."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A servant of Christ Jesus. ‘This title, which the Apostle uses several times of himself, is not elsewhere conferred on any other individual, except once on Timothy (Philippians 1:1), and probably points to exceptional services in the cause of the gospel on the part of Epaphras’ (Lightfoot)."
2. "Always striving, etc. See chaps. Colossians 1:29; Colossians 2:1. The wrestling prayer was due to the zeal of Epaphras and to the danger of the Colossian Church."
3. "That ye may stand, etc. The purpose and purport of the ‘prayers.’ ‘Stand’ points to firmness and constancy, and is further explained by the phrase: perfect and fully assured in all the will of God."

2. "always labouring fervently for you in prayers; in all his prayers, which were many and frequent, he never forgot his dear flock at Colosse."
3. "that ye may stand perfect; in Christ Jesus their head, and in his spotless righteousness... and complete in all the will of God; or 'be filled' in it, have a perfect knowledge of the revealed will of God, both as to doctrine and practice, and be enabled to act according to it."

### John Wesley:
1. "Endued with every Christian grace."
