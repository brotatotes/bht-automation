# Colossians 4:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Luke, the physician, was known for his healing abilities, and it is likely that he served as a physician to others before he became a disciple of Paul. His skills as a doctor would have been valuable to Paul during his ministry.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In ὁ ἰατρὸς ὁ ἀγαπητός there may be a trace of what has been supposed, that it was in a professional capacity that he first became attached to St. Paul."
2. "Δημᾶς, one of Paul’s συνεργοί, who however afterwards deserted him, from love to the world."
3. "The absence of any honourable or endearing mention here may be owing to the commencement of this apostasy, or some unfavourable indication in his character."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Luke ministered to Paul in his last imprisonment."
2. "Demas - included among his 'fellow laborers' but afterwards a deserter from him through love of this world."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "The miraculous power of healing, possessed by the Saviour and his apostles, contributed much to the success of their preaching."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "I do not agree with those who understand this to be Luke the Evangelist; for I am of opinion that he was too well known to stand in need of such a designation, and he would have been signalized by a more magnificent eulogium."
2. "He would, undoubtedly, have called him his fellow-helper, or at least his companion and participant in his conflicts."
3. "Demas, of whom he makes mention, is undoubtedly the person of whom he complains — that he afterwards deserted him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Luke, the beloved physician; undoubtedly the Evangelist, not to be confounded with Lucius (Acts 13:1), this being a shorter form of Lucanus."
2. "He may have been known at Colossæ, but his gospel could scarcely have been known there, if indeed it was written so early."
3. "The absence of any honorable or endearing mention here may be owing to the commencement of this apostasy, or some unfavorable indication in his character."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Luke, the beloved physician...It would seem certain that Luke looked after Paul's health and that Paul loved him." 
2. "Paul was Luke's hero, but it was not a one-sided affection. It is beautiful to see preacher and physician warm friends in the community."
3. "Demas...in 2 Timothy 4:10 he is mentioned as one who deserted Paul."

### John Gill:
1. "Luke the Evangelist...became of a physician of bodies, a physician of souls."
2. "The apostle calls him 'beloved', not on account of his profession, in which he might be useful to many, but as he was a brother in Christ, a minister of the Gospel, and a fellow labourer of his."
3. "Demas greet you; the same who, through the love of the present world, forsook the apostle...which he did either after the writing of this epistle, or if before it, he was now returned again to him."

### John Wesley:
1. Luke, the physician — Such he had been, at least, if he was not then.
