# Colossians 4:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Nymphas was an important figure in the Christian community at Laodicea. It is debated whether Nymphas is a man or a woman, but some suggest that Nymphas is a male name. It is believed that the church in Laodicea gathered at Nymphas' house for worship, prayer, and the study of God's Word. Nymphas and his household exemplified what it means to be a little church, devoted to living according to the teachings of Christ.
