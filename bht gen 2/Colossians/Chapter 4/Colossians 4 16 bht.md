## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "as ποίει, ὅκως … Herod. i. 8. 209, ὡς σαφέστατά γἂν εἰδείην … ἐποίουν , Xen. Cyr. vi. 3. 18."
2. "They cannot well be taken, as τινές in Chrys., to mean οὐχὶ τὴν Π. πρὸς αὐτοὺς ἀπεσταλμένην, ἀλλὰ τὴν παρʼ αὐτῶν Παύλῳ."
3. "We may safely say that a letter not from, but to the Laodiceans is meant."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Epistles from the apostles were publicly read in the church assemblies."
2. "Thus, they and the Gospels were put on a level with the Old Testament, which was similarly read."
3. "The Holy Spirit inspired Paul to write, besides those extant, other Epistles which He saw necessary for that day, and for particular churches."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Laodicea was near to Colossae, and the church there was evidently exposed to the same dangers from philosophy and false teachers as the at Colossae."
2. "It is evident that the apostles designed that the letters which they addressed to the churches should be read also by others, and should become the permanent source of instruction to the friends of Christ."
3. "The ruins of Laodicea and Hierapolis are very extensive. The stadium of the former city, and the gymnasia and theaters of both, are the most complete which I have anywhere seen."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The epistle from Laodicaea [την εκ λαοδικειας]. That is, the letter left at Laodicaea, and to be obtained by you from the church there." 
2. "This letter cannot be positively identified."
3. "The composition known as the Epistle to the Laodicaeans is a late and clumsy forgery, existing only in Latin MSS., and made up chiefly of disconnected passages from Philippians, with a few from other epistles."

### John Calvin:
1. "Though it was addressed to the Colossians, it was, nevertheless, necessary that it should be profitable to others."
2. "They were indeed, in the first instance, addressed to particular Churches, but, as they contain doctrine that is always in force, and is common to all ages, it is of no importance what title they bear."
3. "I have no doubt that it was an Epistle that had been sent to Paul, the perusal of which might be profitable to the Colossians, as neighboring towns have usually many things in common."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The tense used must be thus rendered in English; there is no necessary reference to public reading."
2. "All theories that do not refer it to a letter written by the Apostle Paul must be rejected."
3. "The most probable view is therefore that which accepts the limited encyclical character of the Epistle to the Ephesians, and regards it as here referred to."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The epistle was read in public to the church."
2. "Old Greek preferred οπως for this idiom."
3. "The most likely meaning is that the so-called Epistle to the Ephesians was a circular letter to various churches in the province of Asia."

### John Gill:
1. "And when this epistle is read amongst you...being sent not to any particular person, or persons, but to the whole body, and for their general good and instruction."
2. "his reason might be, not only because this church was near them, but because it was in much the same situation, being infested with the same sort of false teachers; and therefore what was said to the one, was pertinent to the other."
3. "the apostle desires it might be publicly read."

### John Wesley:
1. The epistle from Laodicea — Not to Laodicea. Perhaps some letter had been written to St. Paul from thence.
