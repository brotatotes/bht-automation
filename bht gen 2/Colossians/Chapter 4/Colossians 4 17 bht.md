# Colossians 4:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are urged to pay heed to the ministry, whether it is within the clergy or the laity. The work of ministry is not about power or hierarchy, but rather humble service and fulfilling one's role diligently. It is important for the congregation and the leaders to fulfill their responsibilities for the sake of the gospel. This charge is given in the context of being accountable to Christ, who equips and empowers believers through the Holy Spirit. When ministers fall short, the Church has the authority to lovingly admonish and encourage them to fulfill their duties faithfully.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Meyer well remarks, that the authority hereby implied on the part of the congregation to exercise reproof and discipline over their teachers is remarkable."
2. "Take heed to the ministry which thou receivedst in the Lord, the sphere of the reception of the ministry; in which the recipient lived and moved and promised at his ordination."
3. "That (aim and end of the Œ≤ŒªŒ≠œÄŒµ, in order that) thou fulfil it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This proves that Scripture belongs to the laity as well as the clergy; and that laymen may profitably admonish the clergy in particular cases when they do so in meekness."
2. "The word, 'fulfil,' accords with his ministry being near its close."
3. "The element in which every work of the Christian, and especially the Christian minister, is to be done."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Take heed to the ministry ... - The Greek here is, œÑŒ∑ÃÄŒΩ Œ¥ŒπŒ±Œ∫ŒøŒΩŒπÃÅŒ±ŒΩ teÃÑn diakonian - meaning the office of ministering in divine things."
2. "It seems probable from the language which the apostle applies to him - ‚Äúthe ministry‚Äù - that he was not a deacon, properly so called, but that he was a preacher of the word."
3. "There is no evidence, as has been supposed by some, that he intended to imply, by what he said, that he had been remiss in the performance of his duties, but the apostle doubtless meant to encourage him and to excite him to increased ardor and zeal in the work of the Lord."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul, accordingly, would have him be more fully encouraged by the exhortation of the whole Church." 
2. "For the ministers of the word are endowed with signal authority, but such at the same time as is not exempt from laws."
3. "Paul had previously made mention of his bonds, in the 3rd verse of the chapter."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Archippus might have been a ‚Äòdeacon,‚Äô though the word does not necessarily suggest this; or he may have been the most prominent elder in the Colossian congregation."
2. "Meyer rightly calls attention to the anti-hierarchical tone of this verse; the New Testament Church was an evangelical Church of the people."
3. "Official gifts bring responsibility, both to Christ and to His people. What we receive in the Lord, but increases the need of watchfulness on our part."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Take heed (Œ≤ŒªŒµœÄŒµ). Keep an eye on."
2. "Thou hast received in the Lord (œÄŒ±œÅŒµŒªŒ±Œ≤ŒµœÇ ŒµŒΩ ŒöœÖœÅŒπœâ)."
3. "That thou fulfil it (ŒπŒΩŒ± Œ±œÖœÑŒ∑ŒΩ œÄŒªŒ∑œÅŒøŒπœÇ). Present active subjunctive of œÄŒªŒ∑œÅŒøœâ, 'that thou keep on filling it full.' It is a life-time job."

### John Gill:
1. "Who being negligent in his office, they are called upon to say unto him, take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it."
2. "The 'ministry' he had, was not that of the office of a deacon, as some have thought, but of a preacher of the word; and this he had 'received' gifts for, and was called unto it, and installed in it; and that 'in', and 'by the Lord' himself, and to whom he was accountable for it."
3. "Hence it appears, that when ministers are negligent in the discharge of their duty, the church has a power to admonish and exhort them to a diligent performance of it."

### John Wesley:
1. "Take heed - It is the duty of the flock to try them that say they are apostles to reject the false, and to warn, as well as to receive, the real."
2. "The ministry - Not a lordship, but a service; a laborious and painful work; an obligation to do and suffer all things; to be the least, and the servant, of all."
3. "In the Lord - Christ by whom, and for whose sake, we receive the various gifts of the Holy Spirit."
