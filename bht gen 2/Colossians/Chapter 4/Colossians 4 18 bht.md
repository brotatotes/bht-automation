## BHT:
After the amanuensis finished writing the epistle, the writer added his own salutation with his own hand as a way to prevent any counterfeits. In the salutation, he urges the readers to remember his bonds, not only to inspire them to stay committed to the Gospel, but also to encourage them to patiently endure any afflictions they may face for the sake of the Gospel. The writer's final words, grace be with you, echo the theme of the epistle, emphasizing the abundant grace of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "When we read of 'his chains,' we should not forget that they moved over the paper as he wrote. His right hand was chained to the soldier that kept him."
3. "'The grace' in which we stand: it seems to be a form of valediction belonging to the later period of the Epistles of St. Paul."
