# Colossians 4:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In prayer, we are encouraged to persist and be diligent, for prayer requires both steadfastness and watchfulness. We are urged to continue steadfastly in prayer, being watchful and alert. Prayer should not be done in a lazy or careless manner, but with an attitude of vigilance and attentiveness. Furthermore, we should approach prayer with a heart of thankfulness, not forgetting all the blessings and favors we have received from God. Gratitude in prayer is not only pleasing to God, but it also guards against an ungrateful spirit.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "watching in it, i.e. not remiss and indolent in your occupation of prayer (τῇ πρ.), but active and watchful, cheerful also, ἐν εὐχαριστίᾳ, which defines and characterizes the watchfulness."
2. "ἐπειδή γὰρ τὸ καρτερεῖν ἐν ταῖς εὐχαῖς ῥᾳθυμεῖν πολλάκις ποιεῖ, διὰ τοῦτό φησι γρηγοροῦντες, τουτέστι νήφοντες, μὴ ῥεμβόμενοι."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
2. "Continue perseveringly," "persevere" ... in prayer: watching against the indolence as to prayer, and in prayer, of our corrupt wills. 
"With thanksgiving" - for everything, whether joyful, or sorrowful, mercies temporal and spiritual.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Continue in prayer - That is, do not neglect it; observe it at all stated times; maintain the spirit of prayer, and embrace all proper occasions to engage in it." 
2. "And watch in the same with thanksgiving - Watch for favorable opportunities; watch that your mind may be in a right frame when you pray: and watch, that when your mind is in a right frame you may not neglect to pray."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Continue [προσκαρτερειτε]. See on Acts 1:14. Compare Acts 2:42, Acts 2:46; Acts 6:4; Romans 12:12; Romans 13:6; 1 Thessalonians 5:17. Rev., correctly, continue steadfastly."
2. "Watching [γρηγορουντες]. See on Mark 13:35; 1 Peter 5:8. In Ephesians 6:18, ajgrupnountev watching is used, on which see Mark 13:33."

2. "Watching" (γρηγορουντες). Present active participle of γρηγορεω, late present made on perfect active stem εγρηγορα with loss of ε-, found first in Aristotle.
