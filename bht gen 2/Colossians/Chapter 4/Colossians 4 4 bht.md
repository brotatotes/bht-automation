# Colossians 4:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle desired to make it manifest, to preach, and to make known the mystery of Christ. This mystery, a secret hidden in God from everlasting, was something Paul was never satisfied with. He longed to deliver it with clarity and evidence, using plainness of speech that became the Gospel. His goal was to declare the whole counsel of God, withholding nothing that could benefit the churches. With constancy, boldness, and freedom of mind, he sought to proclaim the truth without fear.
