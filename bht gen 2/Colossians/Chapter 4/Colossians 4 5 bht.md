# Colossians 4:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are called to walk wisely in their interactions with unbelievers in order to win them over to Christ. This does not mean cutting off all communication, but rather engaging with them in the common affairs of life. It is important to conduct oneself in a way that does not provoke or harm them, but rather seeks to gain their favor and ensure the freedom to worship God. This wisdom is necessary for the sake of the Gospel, that it may continue to be proclaimed and spread without reproach.

### John Calvin:
