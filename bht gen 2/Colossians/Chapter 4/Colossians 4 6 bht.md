# Colossians 4:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let your speech always be seasoned with the grace of God, like salt that adds flavor and preserves. As believers, our words should reflect the grace that has been poured out upon us and embody the principles of religion. Our conversation should be a reflection of our unfeigned piety, showing that we are governed by the spirit of grace and displaying a spirit of Christianity in our interactions.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The metaphor is from the office of salt in rendering palatable."

3. "The exhortation to well-seasoned and becoming speech is expanded in Ephesians 4:29; Ephesians 5:4, in a warning against corrupt communication."

### John Calvin:

2. "He indirectly prohibits believers from the practice and familiar use of witticisms, as they are insinuating and often do not edify."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The first characteristic of Christian discourse, especially ‘toward them that are without,’ is here indicated: it should be ‘with (lit., ‘in’) grace,’ attractiveness, the result not of studying to please, but of Divine grace."
2. "'Salt’ preserves both from insipidity and corruption, and Christian speech should not be flat, but fresh and wholesome."
3. "'Sweetness and point,’ adaptation to the hearer; these characteristics of Christian speech, when supported by a wise walk and watchfulness for proper opportunities, will give power to the words of the humblest believer."

### John Gill:
1. "In grace, or concerning grace": let grace be the subject matter of your speech and conversation.
