# Colossians 4:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
That he may know their state and for them to know his, Paul sent Tychicus to relate both the spiritual and temporal aspects of his affairs. This was not only to understand their steadfastness in the Gospel, but also to see how the false teachers were received and how love, concord, and harmony were among the believers. It was a way of comforting their hearts in the midst of afflictions and sufferings. Through this exchange, they would find encouragement and edification, strengthening their faith and bringing glory to God.

2. "Paul was the more anxious to know the state of the Colossians, on account of the seductions to which they were exposed from false teachers; owing to which he had 'great conflict for' them (Colossians 2:1)."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Tychicus carried the letter."
2. "He might know your estate [γνω τα περι υμων]."
3. "The correct reading is gnwte ta peri hJmwn ye might know the things about us, or our estate. Compare Ephesians 6:21."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "Since the discovery of Aleph, which in its corrections presents the entire history of the change, critical editors have usually accepted 'ye' and 'our'."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "That ye may know (ινα γνωτε)... That ye may come to know."
2. "Our estate (τα περ ημων). 'The things concerning us.'"
3. "May comfort (παρακαλεση). First aorist active subjunctive. Proper rendering here and not 'may exhort.'"

### John Gill:
1. "To relate to them his affairs both temporal and spiritual; and also, that he might know your estate."
2. "Whether they continued steadfast in the Gospel, and observed the order, ordinances, and discipline of it; how it prospered, and was succeeded among them, to their comfort and edification, and to the conversion of others; and what reception the false teachers had among them; and what love, concord, and harmony were among themselves; or what were their afflictions and distresses from their enemies."
3. "To comfort your hearts; who might be greatly cast down upon hearing of the sufferings of the apostle, and also with those they themselves endured both from within and from without, from sin, Satan, and the world."
