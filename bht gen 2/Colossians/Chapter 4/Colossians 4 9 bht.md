# Colossians 4:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Onesimus, the slave mentioned in the Epistle to Philemon, was a faithful and beloved brother, who was known by the Colossians as one of their own. Even though he was once a runaway slave, Paul speaks of him with deep affection and urges the Colossians to welcome him as a brother. Tychicus and Onesimus were entrusted with the task of delivering important news to the church in Colossae, and their testimonies would provide valuable information about Paul's circumstances and the state of the church in Rome.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There can hardly be a doubt...that this is the Onesimus of the Epistle to Philemon."
2. "When Calv. wrote 'vix est credibile hunc esse servum illum Philemonis, quia furis et fugitivi nomen dedecori subjectum fuisset,' he forgot that this very term, ἀδελφὸς ἀγαπητός, is applied to him."
3. "A formal restatement of τὰ κατʼ ἐμὲ π. γν. above."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Onesimus—the slave mentioned in the Epistle to Philemon (Philemon 1:10; Philemon 1:16), 'a brother beloved.'"
2. "a faithful...brother—rather, 'the faithful brother,' he being known to the Colossians as the slave of Philemon, their fellow townsman and fellow Christian."
3. "They shall make known unto you all things—Greek, 'all the things here.' This substantial repetition of 'all my state shall Tychicus declare unto you,' strongly favors the reading of English Version in Colossians 4:8, 'that he might (may) know your state,' as it is unlikely the same thing should be stated thrice."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Onesimus had probably been recently converted; and Paul felt toward him the warm attachment of a brother."
2. "Would a minister of the gospel now in the Northern States, who should send a letter by a run-away slave to a community of masters at the South, say of him that he was 'one of them?'"
3. "Other matters he left for those who carried the Epistle to communicate."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Onesimus. See on Philippians 1:10. The faithful and beloved brother. Whom the Colossians had known only as the worthless, runaway slave. See Philippians 1:11, Philippians 1:16.

### John Calvin:
1. "He adds, Onesimus, that the embassy may have the more weight."
2. "He distinguishes both of them by honorable titles, that they may do the more good, and especially Tychicus, who was to exercise the office of an instructor."
3. "The expression made use of by Paul here respecting Onesimus, 'who is one of you,' clearly marks him out as being of the same city, viz., Colosse."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Such a return of fugitive slaves destroys slavery."
2. "How much native truth, courage, and beauty is there in Christianity, which enabled the Apostle to speak thus of a runaway slave, to the inhabitants of that city from which he had fled! What other religion in the world could have done this?"
3. "Notice, that from the first Christian fellowship has been strengthened by the interchange of news respecting the work of the gospel."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Co-bearer of the letter with Tychicus and praised on a par with him, runaway slave though he is."
2. "Said not as a reproach to Colossae for having such a man, but as a privilege to the church in Colossae to give a proper welcome to this returning converted slave and to treat him as a brother as Paul argues to Philemon."

### John Gill:
1. "According to the Apostolic Constitutions, he was afterwards bishop of Beyrhoea; and some say he suffered martyrdom under Domitian."
2. "A faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you; either one of their ministers, as Epaphras was, Colossians 3:12 or one of their city, who was originally a native of that place."
3. "They shall make known unto you all things which are done here; at Rome, either to him in prison, or in the church; and being two of them, were a proper number to bear a testimony, and which ought to be received."
