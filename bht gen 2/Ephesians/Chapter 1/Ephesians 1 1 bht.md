## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "χρ. Ἰησ., as in the case of δοῦλος Ἰησ. χρ., seems rather to denote possession, than to belong to ἀπόστολος and designate the person from whom sent."
2. "On this, and on Ephesus, see Prolegomena. On ἁγίοις, see Ellicott’s note. It is used here in its widest sense, as designating the members of Christ’s visible Church, presumed to fulfil the conditions of that membership."
3. "The ἁγίοις and πιστοῖς denote their spiritual life from its two sides that of God who calls and sanctifies, that of themselves who believe."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "called to the apostleship through that same 'will' which originated the Church"
2. "The sanctification by God is here put before man's faith."
3. "The twofold aspect of salvation is thus presented, God's grace in the first instance sanctifying us, and our faith, by God's gift, laying hold of salvation."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was not uncommon for him thus to give a general character to the epistles which he addressed to particular churches, and so to write that others than those to whom they were particularly directed, might feel that they were addressed to them."
2. "All who are 'faithful in Christ Jesus' may regard the Epistle as addressed by the Holy Spirit to them, and may feel that they are as much interested in the doctrines, promises, and duties set forth in this Epistle, as were the ancient Christians of Ephesus."
3. "The fact that the letter was designed to be published, shows that he was not unwilling that those high doctrines should be made known to the world at large; still they pertained particularly to the church, and they are doctrines which should be particularly addressed to the church."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "By the will of God. As frequently in the introductions of the epistles, to emphasize his divine appointment."
2. "To the saints. See on Romans 1:7; Colossians 1:2; Philippians 1:1."
3. "The faithful. Not faithful in the sense of fidelity and perseverance, but believing, as John 20:27; Acts 10:45. It is to be included with the saints under the one article."

### John Calvin:
1. "He calls himself 'an apostle of Jesus Christ;' for all to whom has been given the ministry of reconciliation are his ambassadors."
2. "He thus meets the jeers of wicked men by holding out the authority of God, and removes every occasion of inconsiderate strife."
3. "No man is a believer who is not also a saint; and, on the other hand, no man is a saint who is not a believer."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "By the will of God (δια θεληματος θεου). As in 1 Corinthians 1:1; 2 Corinthians 1:1; Romans 1:1."
2. "Origen explains the words τοις αγιοις τοις ουσιν as meaning 'the saints that are' (genuine saints), showing that his MSS. did not have the words εν Εφεσω."
3. "The explanation of the insertion of these words has already been given in the remarks on 'The Destination' as one copy of the general letter that was preserved in Ephesus."

### John Gill:
1. "The persons residing there, to whom the epistle is written, are described by their character, as 'saints'; being separated by the grace of God the Father in eternal election; whose sins were expiated by the blood and sacrifice of Christ; and to whom he himself was made sanctification; and who were internally sanctified by the Spirit of God, and lived holy lives and conversations."

### John Wesley:
1. "By the will of God — Not by any merit of my own."
2. "To the saints who are at Ephesus — And in all the adjacent places."
3. "For this epistle is not directed to the Ephesians only, but likewise to all the other churches of Asia."
