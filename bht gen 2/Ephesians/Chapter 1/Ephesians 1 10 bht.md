# Ephesians 1:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the fullness of time, God initiated a dispensation characterized by the completion of various epochs and the manifestation of His abundant grace. This divine plan sought to gather and reconcile all things in Christ, bringing unity and harmony throughout the heavens and the earth. Through Christ's redemptive work, all creations, including angels and humans, are brought together under His headship, establishing a restored and united kingdom. It is important for us to recognize and respect God's timing and providence, trusting that His plan unfolds perfectly according to His wisdom and purposes.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The whole of the Gospel times (plural) is meant, with the benefits to the Church dispensed in them severally and successively."
2. "God's purpose is to sum up the whole creation in Christ, the Head of angels, with whom He is linked by His invisible nature, and of men with whom He is linked by His humanity."
3. "God means to gather up all together in Christ; or as Colossians 1:20 says, 'By Him to reconcile all things unto Himself, whether things in earth or things in heaven.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The plan stretched from before 'the foundation of the world' to the period when all times should be completed; and of course all the events occurring in that intermediate period were embraced in the plan."
2. "The amount of the declaration here is, that there is hereafter to be one kingdom, in which there shall be no jar or alienation; that the now separated kingdoms of heaven and earth shall be united under one head, and that henceforward all shall be harmony and love."
3. "The object of the plan of salvation is to produce a harmony between them [the holy inhabitants of other worlds] and the redeemed on earth, or to produce out of all, one great and united kingdom."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The meaning of the whole phrase, then, is: a dispensation characterized by the fullness of the times: set forth when the times are full."
2. "It means to bring back to and gather round the main point, not the head; so that, in itself, it does not indicate Christ (the Read) as the central point of regathering, though He is so in fact."
3. "God contemplates a regathering, a restoration to that former condition when all things were in perfect unity, and normally combined to serve God's ends."

### John Calvin:
1. "Let human presumption restrain itself, and, in judging of the succession of events, let it bow to the providence of God."
2. "The proper condition of creatures is to keep close to God...We are brought into actual unity by Christ alone."
3. "By gathering both into his own body, Christ hath united them to God the Father, and established actual harmony between heaven and earth."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word itself is that from which our word ‚Äòeconomy‚Äô is taken, first meaning ‚Äòstewardship‚Äô (as in Luke 16:2), then applied in this sense to spiritual things, especially to the apostolic office (1 Corinthians 9:17; Colossians 1:25)."
2. "'God will gather together again for Himself what He has created for Himself.' The fathers found here a reference to Christ as the Head, but this is suggested by the sound of the word, rather than by its sense. That idea is introduced later (Ephesians 1:22), and the reference here is to Christ‚Äôs atonement rather than to His sovereignty."
3. "‚ÄòAs the stone dropped into the lake creates there widening and concentric circles, which ultimately reach the farthest shore, so the deed done on Calvary has sent its undulations through the distant spheres and realms of God‚Äôs great empire‚Äô (Eadie)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

### John Gill:
1. "after many times and seasons were elapsed, from the creation of the world; at the most suitable and convenient time, when a new economy or dispensation began, within which all this was to be effected"
2. "this supposes, that all things were once united together in one; angels and men were united to God by the ties of creation, and were under the same law of nature, and there were peace and friendship between them; and this union was in Christ"
3. "Christ is an head of eminence and of influence, both to angels and men: and there is a collection of these together in one, in Christ; by virtue of redemption by Christ, and grace from him, there is an entire friendship between elect angels and elect men"

### John Wesley:
