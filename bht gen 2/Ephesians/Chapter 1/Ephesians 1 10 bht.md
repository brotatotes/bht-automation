# Ephesians 1:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the grand plan of salvation, encompassing the Gospel times, God's purpose is to gather and reconcile all creation in Christ. From the foundation of the world, the divine plan stretches to unite heaven and earth under one harmonious kingdom. Through Christ, all things are brought back to their proper condition, in perfect unity with God. Human presumption should submit to God's providence in understanding the succession of events. By gathering all things in His body, Christ establishes actual harmony between heaven and earth, uniting angels and men in the Lord.
