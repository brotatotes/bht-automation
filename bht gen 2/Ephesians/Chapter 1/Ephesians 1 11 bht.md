# Ephesians 1:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Christ, we have received an inheritance, becoming partakers of the glorious heavenly Canaan. This inheritance was predestined according to God's purpose, which is not arbitrary but flows from the wisdom and will of the one who orchestrates all things according to his own perfect plan. Our inheritance is like the land of Canaan, which was allotted by lot to the children of Israel, highlighting the certainty and divine arrangement of God's promises. His predestination is rooted in his sovereign wisdom, ensuring that all things work together for the good of those who believe in him.
