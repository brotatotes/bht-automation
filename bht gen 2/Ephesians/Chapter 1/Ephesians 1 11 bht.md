# Ephesians 1:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Christ, we as believers have obtained an inheritance, a glorious and eternal heritage in heaven. Just as the children of Israel were assigned their inheritance by lot, we too have received our portion in the heavenly Canaan. This predestination and purpose, the divine plan that is sovereignly executed, is not arbitrary but rooted in the counsel and wisdom of God. The unchanging decree that whoever believes shall be saved is a manifestation of God's perfect nature and will.
