# Ephesians 1:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Jewish-Christians, we were those who had before hoped in the Christ, eagerly awaiting His coming as the consolation of Israel. Our hope and trust in the Savior form the foundation of our faith. Through Him, we become vessels of God's mercy, illustrating His glory. Believers are not only elected to salvation but also appointed by God to walk in holiness. Like the apostle Paul and other Jews, we were among those who first believed in Christ before the Gentiles. It is our responsibility to praise and glorify God, recognizing that His grace is the source of everything, not our own efforts.
