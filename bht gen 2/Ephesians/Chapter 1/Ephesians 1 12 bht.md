# Ephesians 1:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage highlights the anticipation of Jewish-Christians in the arrival of the Christ, as they hoped for the consolation of Israel. This widespread hope counters the objection that only a few believed. Their hope was grounded in their faith in the Messiah, which served as the foundation for their confidence. By believing in Christ, they not only found salvation but also became participants in the same privileges as other believers. Together, they praised and glorified God for His grace and goodness, attributing all to His favor and acknowledging His desire to be glorified through acts of goodness.
