# Ephesians 1:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers who had been hoping in Christ, particularly the Jewish-Christians, anticipated His coming with the expectation of the consolation of Israel. The objection that only a few looked forward to His coming is countered by the broadness of the Apostle Paul's expression. It is important to note the connection between their hope and the Savior, as their foundation for this hope was based on Him. They not only believed in Him but also preached to others, becoming partakers of the same privileges. This aligns with Ephesians, where the believers emphasized their belief and the proclamation of their faith.
