# Ephesians 1:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers, both Jews and Gentiles, have a part in Christ, as the gospel is not exclusive but inclusive. The sealing of the Holy Spirit is a result of their faith, confirming the favor of God upon them. The gospel, being the word of truth, is certain and trustworthy, leaving no room for doubt or deception. The sealing work of the Spirit goes beyond initial belief, bringing a full assurance of the promises and a complete transformation of the believer's soul.

3. "The coincidence is just such as would occur on the supposition that the transaction actually occurred, and that both the Acts and the Epistle are genuine."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Ye also trusted." Gentile Christians. Trusted, which is not in the Greek, is unnecessary.
2. "Ye were sealed [εσφραγισθητε] . See on John 3:33; Revelation 22:10. Sealed with the assurance of the Holy Spirit. Romans 8:16; 2 Corinthians 1:22; 2 Timothy 2:19.
3. "Spirit of promise. Strictly, the promise. Denoting the promise as characteristic of the Holy Spirit: the Spirit which was announced by promise."

### John Calvin:
1. "Nothing is more earnestly attempted by Satan than to lead us either to doubt or to despise the gospel."
2. "In opposition to every doubt, let us learn to bring forward this testimony, that the gospel is not only certain truth, which cannot deceive, but is, by way of eminence, (κατ ᾿ ἐξοχὴν,) the word of truth, as if, strictly speaking, there were no truth but itself."
3. "Our minds never become so firmly established in the truth of God as to resist all the temptations of Satan, until we have been confirmed in it by the Holy Spirit."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Ye Gentiles (now Christians), in contrast to ημας (we) in Ephesians 1:12." 
2. "First aorist passive indicative of σφραγιζω, old verb, to set a seal on one as a mark or stamp, sometimes the marks of ownership or of worship of deities like στιγματα (Galatians 6:17)." 
3. "See 2 Corinthians 1:22 for the very use of the metaphor here applied to the Holy Spirit even with the word αρραβων (earnest)."

### John Gill:
1. "The promise belonged to all that God called, whether afar off or nigh; and the same common salvation was sent to one as to another; and the same faith was wrought in one as in the other; and they were interested in the same Christ, and were heirs of the same inheritance." 
2. "The Gospel is called 'the word of truth' because of its divine original, coming from the God of truth, who cannot lie; and because it contains nothing but truth, and particularly that eminent one, salvation alone by Christ, for the chief of sinners."
3. "The sealing work of the Spirit is a distinct thing from faith or any other work of the Spirit; it is what follows believing and is something over and above, and more than faith, at least than first believing."
