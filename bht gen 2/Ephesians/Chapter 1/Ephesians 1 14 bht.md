# Ephesians 1:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Holy Spirit is given to us as a pledge, a promise ensuring that we will receive the complete inheritance of eternal life. He is the first payment, a foretaste of the glory and happiness that awaits us. This seal of the Spirit is not temporary but remains in the heart as a perpetual presence. He guarantees our perseverance and security in Christ, abiding with us until we fully experience the joy and freedom of our redemption. All of this is done to the praise and honor of God's glorious attributes, reflecting His wisdom, power, and mercy.
