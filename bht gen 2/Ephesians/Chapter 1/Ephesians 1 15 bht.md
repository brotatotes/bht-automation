# Ephesians 1:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul commends the Ephesian believers for their faith and love, which he had heard about through reports. Their faith is not superficial, but a deep and personal relationship with Christ, encompassing a complete dependence on Him. Their love extends beyond the boundaries of the Christian community, embracing all people. This love is fervent, genuine, and active, displaying the evidence of genuine conversion. Faith and love are inseparable qualities that go hand in hand, always present in those who possess them, and cannot be hidden. Their faith and love serve as a testimony to the Ephesian church and encourage their spiritual growth.
