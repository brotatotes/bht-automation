# Ephesians 1:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The mention of faith and love together signifies the whole excellence of Christian character, encompassing belief and action. The grace of faith is a personal connection with Christ, encompassing beholding His glory, trusting Him, and depending on Him. Love extends to all believers, showing itself in genuine, fervent, and active expressions. These two graces, faith and love, are inseparable and cannot be hidden.
