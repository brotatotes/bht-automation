# Ephesians 1:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Upon learning of the believers' faith and love, it becomes evident that these two graces are inseparable and always present in the same individuals. The grace of faith is characterized by a deep communion with Christ, embracing His glory and relying on Him completely. Love, on the other hand, extends to all believers, regardless of their differences. It is a genuine, fervent, and tireless love that serves as evidence of true regeneration. This combination of faith and love is not something that can go unnoticed, for it is a tangible manifestation of a genuine relationship with God.
