# Ephesians 1:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In my prayers, I cease not to give thanks for you. It is important to note that it was not by their power or will, but by the grace of God that the Ephesians had faith and love. Therefore, I give thanks to God for these gifts bestowed upon them. I continually mention them in my prayers, showing that I am a person dedicated to prayer and seeking the advancement of others. This example should also encourage them to practice these duties themselves, knowing that I pray for all churches in the same manner.
