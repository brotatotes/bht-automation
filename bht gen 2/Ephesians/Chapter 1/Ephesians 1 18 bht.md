# Ephesians 1:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the eyes of your heart are enlightened, the understanding is expanded to see the profound truths of the faith. The heart, serving as the core of life and the fountain of thoughts, becomes awakened to the beauty and glory of Christ as a Savior. Through the Holy Spirit's work, profound revelations of truth are made known, leading to a deeper understanding of sin's gravity and the insufficiency of our own righteousness. The hope of God's calling becomes evident, encompassing the blessings of eternal happiness and the grace of hope itself. Ultimately, this enlightenment opens our hearts to the richness of God's glorious inheritance in the saints.
