# Ephesians 1:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The resurrection of Christ demonstrated a spiritual act of raising His humanity from weakness to glory, showcasing the greatness of God's power. This power extends to every name, both present and future, highlighting its strength and might. Paul's use of intense language reflects the challenge of expressing the immense divine mysteries and abundant grace. The same power displayed in raising Christ is required for the conversion of sinners. God's power is evident in His indwelling strength, might, and efficient working. It is this tremendous power that brings believers from death to life, making them heirs of eternal life, and supporting them in their faith and perseverance.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The resurrection of Christ was not a mere bodily act, an earnest of our bodily resurrection, but was a spiritual act, the raising of His humanity (which is ours), consisting of body and soul, from infirmity to glory, from the curse to the final triumph."
2. "That the evil spirits are included, is therefore manifest."
3. "'every name now named in earth and heaven' and 'every name which we name, not only now, but hereafter.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The whole of the working of His grace, which He is carrying on, and will carry on, in us who believe." 
2. "The same superhuman power was needed and exerted to make us believe, as was needed and exerted to raise Christ from the dead." 
3. "The strength of His might."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There is much emphasis and energy of expression here, as if the apostle were laboring under the greatness of his theme, and wanted words to express the magnitude of his conception."
2. "The religion which they professed was a religion of 'power.' In all the forms and stages of it the power of God was manifested toward them, and would be until they reached their final inheritance."
3. "The power which God has exerted in us is in accordance with the power which was shown in raising up the Lord Jesus. It was the proper result of that, and was power of a similar kind. The same power is requisite to convert a sinner which is demanded in raising the dead."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Compounds with uJper over, beyond, are characteristic of Paul 's intensity of style, and mark the struggle of language with the immensity of the divine mysteries, and the opulence of the divine grace."
2. "The A. V. frequently impairs the force of a passage by combining into a single conception two words which represent distinct ideas; translating two nouns by an adjective and a noun."
3. "Hence we have here God 's indwelling power, which inheres in the divine nature (strength); the relative quality or measure of this power (might); and the efficient exertion of the divine quality (working)."

### John Calvin:
1. "The repetition of the word power, (Î´Ï…Î½á½±Î¼ÎµÏ‰Ï‚) has the appearance of being superfluous; but in the former case it is restricted to one class, â€” in the next, it has a general application."
2. "The power of God is wonderfully displayed, when we are brought from death to life, and when, from being the children of hell, we become the children of God and heirs of eternal life."
3. "We never form adequate conceptions of the treasure revealed to us in the gospel; or, if we do, we cannot persuade ourselves that it is possible for us to do so, because we perceive nothing in us that corresponds to it, but everything the reverse."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There is thus a kind of climax, the hope which the calling awakens, the exhaustless and inexpressible glory of that inheritance to which hope is directed the limitless power that shall bestow it." 
2. "This phrase is to be joined with 'His power,' setting forth the personal objects toward and upon whom the power is exercised."
3. "The greatness of the power which bestows the 'glory' and fulfills the 'hope' is in accordance with a manifestation already made of Godâ€™s strength. 'Strength' is Godâ€™s inherent power; 'might' is the putting forth of that power; 'working' is its actual efficiency."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The exceeding greatness of his power." 
2. "To enlightened eyes the greatness of God's power is even more 'surpassing.'"

### John Gill:
1. "The greatness of this power as displayed in the work of conversion and faith appears, if it be considered what the work itself is called, a creation, a resurrection from the dead, a regeneration, and a transformation of the man into another man, which must needs require almighty power."
2. "So that this work of faith cannot be ascribed to anything short of the exceeding greatness of divine power; and which is seen in supporting faith when it is wrought, under great discouragements; in delivering believers out of divers temptations; in assisting them to discharge their duty, and in their final perseverance."
3. "The strength of his power, in all the mighty energy of it, is exerted towards and upon believers; and which they should know, own, and acknowledge, to the glory of the grace of God: and this is in proportion, and agreeably to that power."

### John Wesley:
1. "The exceeding greatness of his power toward us who believe â€” Both in quickening our dead souls, and preserving them in spiritual life."
2. "According to the power which he exerted in Christ, raising him from the dead â€” By the very same almighty power whereby he raised Christ; for no less would suffice."
