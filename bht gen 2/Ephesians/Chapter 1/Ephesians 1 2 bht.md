# Ephesians 1:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Grace and peace from God is a common form of greeting in the Bible, used in various epistles such as Romans 1:7, 1 Corinthians 1:3, 2 Corinthians 1:2, and Galatians 1:3. The emphasis on grace in the greeting is significant, as it is a leading word in this particular epistle, used thirteen times. This grace and peace coming from God is not limited to the believers but is encompassed by the Father of us and of our Lord Jesus Christ, as stated in Titus 1:4. Let us not overanalyze the terms grace and peace, as they are general expressions of good will.
