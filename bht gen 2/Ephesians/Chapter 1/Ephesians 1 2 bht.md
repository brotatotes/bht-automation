# Ephesians 1:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Grace and peace are extended to you from God, who is the Father of us and of our Lord Jesus Christ. It is crucial to recognize and reject any misinterpretations, which wrongly suggest a different meaning to these words, as it contradicts the true intent behind St. Paul's teachings. Additionally, we should not overcomplicate the understanding of grace and peace, by associating them solely with specific groups, such as the holy ones and the faithful ones.
