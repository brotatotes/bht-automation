# Ephesians 1:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The power of God was evident in the resurrection of Christ, displaying the same power that will bring about the future resurrection of believers. Christ's resurrection serves as a model for the spiritual resurrection that occurs in the souls of believers. This divine power is at work in the work of faith, grace, and conversion, which is wholly accomplished by God. Christ's exaltation to the right hand of God in the heavenly places is a tangible reality, not a mere spiritual expression. Through contemplating Christ's resurrection, believers can see the immense power of God and the future glory that awaits them.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The raising of Christ is not only an earnest of our bodies being hereafter raised, but has a spiritual power in it involving the resurrection, spiritually of the believer's soul now, and, consequently, of his body hereafter."
2. "The Son, too, as God (though not as man), had a share in raising His own human body."
3. "Where He remains till all His enemies have been put under His feet."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The 'power' which was then exerted was as great as that of creation. It was imparting life to a cold and 'mangled' frame. It was to open again the arteries and veins, and teach the heart to beat and the lungs to heave."
2. "It is impossible to conceive of a more direct exertion of 'power' than in raising up the dead; and there is no more striking illustration of the nature of conversion than in such a resurrection."
3. "The idea is, that great power was displayed by this, and that a similar exhibition is made when man is renewed and exalted to the high honor of being made an heir of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Christ's dead body was the point on which this working of divine power was exhibited."  
2. "In that He raised and made Him to sit."  
3. "Local. Not merely of a spiritual state, which does not suit the local expressions made to sit and right hand."

### John Calvin:
1. "With the greatest propriety does he enjoin us to contemplate this power in Christ; for in us, it is hitherto concealed."
2. "Christ alone, therefore, is the mirror in which we can contemplate that which the weakness of the cross hinders from being clearly seen in ourselves."
3. "We shall find our advantage in directing our views to Christ, that in him, as in a mirror, we may see the glorious treasures of Divine grace, and the immeasurable greatness of that power, which has not yet been manifested in ourselves."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Which he wrought, or, ‚Äòhath wrought.‚Äô Good authorities support the latter reading, which presents the matter as an accomplished fact with permanent results."
2. "In Christ; both as the first-fruits and as the Head of the Church."
3. "At his right hand in the heavenly places. These local designations are not to be spiritualized or made indefinite. Christ‚Äôs present bodily existence is a reality; to explain this away is to adopt the most capricious method of interpretation."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "which he has wrought."
2. "trying to express what surpasses expression or comprehension."
3. "Metaphorical local expression like Œ¥ŒµŒæŒπŒ± and ŒµŒΩ œÑŒøŒπœÇ ŒµœÄŒøœÖœÅ Œ±ŒΩŒπŒøŒπœÇ."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ's resurrection from the dead was an instance of peculiar and special power."
2. "There is some proportion between the power put forth on Christ in raising him from the dead, and that which is exerted in the work of conversion and faith."
3. "The work of faith, of grace and conversion, is the entire work of God, which is begun, carried on, and finished wholly by his power."

### John Wesley:
1. "He hath exalted him in his human nature, as a recompence for his sufferings."
2. "to a quiet, everlasting possession of all possible blessedness, majesty, and glory."
