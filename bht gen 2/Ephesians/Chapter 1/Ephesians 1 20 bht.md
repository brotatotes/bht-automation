# Ephesians 1:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The raising of Christ is not only a guarantee of our future bodily resurrection, but it also has a spiritual power that impacts believers in the present. Just as God exerted His power to raise Jesus from the dead, He also works powerfully in the conversion and faith of believers. This display of power is a reflection of the immeasurable greatness of God's power and the treasures of divine grace available to us. By fixating our gaze on Christ, we can see the work of God's power and the transformation He brings, finding hope and reassurance in the resurrection power that awaits us.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The raising of Christ is not only an earnest of our bodies being hereafter raised, but has a spiritual power in it involving the resurrection, spiritually of the believer's soul now, and, consequently, of his body hereafter."
2. "The Son, too, as God (though not as man), had a share in raising His own human body."
3. "Where He remains till all His enemies have been put under His feet."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The 'power' which was then exerted was as great as that of creation. It was imparting life to a cold and 'mangled' frame. It was to open again the arteries and veins, and teach the heart to beat and the lungs to heave."
2. "It is impossible to conceive of a more direct exertion of 'power' than in raising up the dead; and there is no more striking illustration of the nature of conversion than in such a resurrection."
3. "The idea is, that great power was displayed by this, and that a similar exhibition is made when man is renewed and exalted to the high honor of being made an heir of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Christ's dead body was the point on which this working of divine power was exhibited."  
2. "In that He raised and made Him to sit."  
3. "Local. Not merely of a spiritual state, which does not suit the local expressions made to sit and right hand."

### John Calvin:
1. "With the greatest propriety does he enjoin us to contemplate this power in Christ; for in us, it is hitherto concealed."
2. "Christ alone, therefore, is the mirror in which we can contemplate that which the weakness of the cross hinders from being clearly seen in ourselves."
3. "We shall find our advantage in directing our views to Christ, that in him, as in a mirror, we may see the glorious treasures of Divine grace, and the immeasurable greatness of that power, which has not yet been manifested in ourselves."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "which he has wrought."
2. "trying to express what surpasses expression or comprehension."
3. "Metaphorical local expression like Œ¥ŒµŒæŒπŒ± and ŒµŒΩ œÑŒøŒπœÇ ŒµœÄŒøœÖœÅ Œ±ŒΩŒπŒøŒπœÇ."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ's resurrection from the dead was an instance of peculiar and special power."
2. "There is some proportion between the power put forth on Christ in raising him from the dead, and that which is exerted in the work of conversion and faith."
3. "The work of faith, of grace and conversion, is the entire work of God, which is begun, carried on, and finished wholly by his power."

### John Wesley:

2. "to a quiet, everlasting possession of all possible blessedness, majesty, and glory."
