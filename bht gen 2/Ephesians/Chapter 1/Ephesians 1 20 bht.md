# Ephesians 1:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The resurrection of Christ displays divine power, not only in his bodily resurrection, but also in the spiritual resurrection of believers. Christ's role in raising his own body showcases his power as God. This same power is evident in the conversion of believers, which can be likened to a resurrection. By looking to Christ as a mirror, believers can see the immeasurable greatness of God's power and the glorious treasures of his grace. The resurrection of Christ is a clear demonstration of God's power, urging believers to acknowledge and appreciate the magnitude of His work in their lives.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The raising of Christ is not only an earnest of our bodies being hereafter raised, but has a spiritual power in it involving the resurrection, spiritually of the believer's soul now, and, consequently, of his body hereafter."
2. "The Son, too, as God (though not as man), had a share in raising His own human body."
3. "Where He remains till all His enemies have been put under His feet."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The 'power' which was then exerted was as great as that of creation. It was imparting life to a cold and 'mangled' frame. It was to open again the arteries and veins, and teach the heart to beat and the lungs to heave."
2. "It is impossible to conceive of a more direct exertion of 'power' than in raising up the dead; and there is no more striking illustration of the nature of conversion than in such a resurrection."
3. "The idea is, that great power was displayed by this, and that a similar exhibition is made when man is renewed and exalted to the high honor of being made an heir of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Christ's dead body was the point on which this working of divine power was exhibited."  
2. "In that He raised and made Him to sit."  
3. "Local. Not merely of a spiritual state, which does not suit the local expressions made to sit and right hand."

### John Calvin:

3. "We shall find our advantage in directing our views to Christ, that in him, as in a mirror, we may see the glorious treasures of Divine grace, and the immeasurable greatness of that power, which has not yet been manifested in ourselves."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "trying to express what surpasses expression or comprehension."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ's resurrection from the dead was an instance of peculiar and special power."
2. "There is some proportion between the power put forth on Christ in raising him from the dead, and that which is exerted in the work of conversion and faith."
3. "The work of faith, of grace and conversion, is the entire work of God, which is begun, carried on, and finished wholly by his power."
