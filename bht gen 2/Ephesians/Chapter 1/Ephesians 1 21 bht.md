# Ephesians 1:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ's authority extends far above all principality, authority, power, and dominion. He is the King of kings and Lord of lords, exalted above every name and title conceivable. His wisdom surpasses all, and He reigns over all ranks of creatures, no matter how exalted. The glory of men and angels pales in comparison to the unmatched splendor of Christ. His dominion encompasses the present world and the future life, making all things subject to His sovereignty. From the heavenly realms to earthly rulers, there is no authority that does not bow before the majestic power and authority of Christ.
