# Ephesians 1:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ, both as God and man, is exalted above all angels, both good and evil. He triumphed over the evil angels during his time on earth and continues to have authority over them. Additionally, Christ has supreme authority over civil magistrates and all earthly rulers. Not only do they receive their power from him, but they are also accountable to him. Furthermore, Christ's dominion extends beyond the earthly realm to include all those who will be revealed in the future. In summary, Christ's authority is unrivaled, encompassing all realms and all beings, both seen and unseen.
