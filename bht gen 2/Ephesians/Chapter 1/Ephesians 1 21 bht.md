# Ephesians 1:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ, both as God and as man, holds supreme authority over all beings, including demons, angels, and earthly rulers. His power extends over all realms, from hell to heaven, and from present to future. No name or title can surpass the exaltation of Jesus, whose grandeur transcends every created order. Even those who are unknown to us now will ultimately be subject to the sovereignty of Christ. Such is the greatness and preeminence of our Lord, who reigns above all.
