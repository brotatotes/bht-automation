# Ephesians 1:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ is the Head of the Church, possessing unlimited authority over all things. Just as the body is connected to its head, the Church is intimately linked to Christ, receiving guidance, government, life, and influence from Him. This special gift of headship from God has immense value and benefits the Church greatly, ensuring unity and the continuous flow of activity, growth, and strength to every member. This truth is beautifully illustrated in Psalms 8:6, where God puts all things under Christ's feet, reinforcing His supreme reign and the Church's reliance on Him.
