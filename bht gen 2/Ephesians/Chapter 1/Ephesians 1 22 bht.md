# Ephesians 1:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, it is revealed that Christ has been given authority over all things and has been appointed as the head of the church. This headship signifies not only guidance and government but also life and influence. Just as the natural body receives activity, growth, and strength from its head, the members of the church are intimately united with Christ and derive their spiritual sustenance and vitality from Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Christ is Head over all things: the Church is the BODY of Christ, and as such is the fulness of Him who fills all with all."
2. "The church, being the Body of Christ, is dwelt in and filled by God: it is His πλήρωμα in an especial manner His fulness abides in it, and is exemplified by it."
3. "The church... is the receptacle and abiding place, the πλήρωμα κατʼἐξοχήν, of Him who fills all things with all things."
4. "The Apostle’s own usage is our best guide, πληροῦσθε ἐν πνεύματι, and directs us to the instrumental or elemental meaning—the thing with, or by, or in which as an element, the filling takes place."
5. "The reference is, I think, to the Father, not to Christ. The latter has been imagined principally from strictly parallelizing the two clauses, τὸ σῶμα | αὐτοῦ, τὸ πλήρωμα | τοῦ τ. π. ἐν π. πληρουμένου. But this is by no means conclusive: the second definitive clause may assert more than the first; may be, not subordinate to the first, but inclusive of it."

1) "All the elements - the physical works of God - the winds and waves - the seas and rivers - all are under him, and all are to be made tributary to the welfare of the church."

3) "Angels in heaven, with all their ranks and orders, are under his control with reference to the church."
4) "Fallen angels are under his control, and shall not be able to injure or destroy the church."
5) "The church, therefore, is safe. All the great powers of heaven, earth, and hell, are made subject to its Head and King; and no weapon that is formed against it shall prosper."
