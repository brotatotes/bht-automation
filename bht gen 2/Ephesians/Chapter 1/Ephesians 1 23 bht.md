# Ephesians 1:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The church, as the body of Christ, is a remarkable assembly comprising individuals with diverse gifts and contributions, yet all united under the leadership of Christ. It is in this collective body that Christ finds His fulfillment and completeness, and in turn, He fills and completes the church. Every saint, regardless of their capacity or ability, is filled by Christ who enriches their souls, minds, hearts, and all aspects of their being with joy, knowledge, peace, spiritual desires, submission, and love. Christ, as the fulness of God, encompasses and fills not only the church but also the entirety of creation.
