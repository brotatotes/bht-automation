# Ephesians 1:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Church is not merely a symbol but a living organism, with Christ as its head. It is the receptacle of His abundant gifts and graces, representing His divine life. Christ fills all things and desires to be united with the Church, finding completion in its members. The Church is the honor and fulfillment of Christ, as it is through the Church that His fullness is revealed and experienced. This unity and completeness of the Church highlight its significance and role in manifesting the glory of Christ in the world.
