# Ephesians 1:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The church of Christ is a living organism, united under His headship. It is not a mere metaphor, but a genuine body that completes and fills up His power and glory. Through His indwelling presence, the church becomes the fullest representation of His divine life. The church is the receptacle of His gifts and graces, and He desires to be united with her, recognizing her as essential to His own completeness. His presence fills all things, making the church the ultimate recipient of His fulness. This highlights the high honor bestowed upon the church as the mystical body of Christ.
