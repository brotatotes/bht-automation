# Ephesians 1:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The opening declaration of Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ reflects the Apostle Paul's customary expression of praise in his epistles, signifying his gratitude for God's grace. This doxology emphasizes the experience of grace shared between the writer and the readers. The subsequent reference to God as the Father highlights His role in showering blessings upon His children. These blessings are not merely verbal, but are tangible and bestowed upon those who are referred to as saints and believers. Such blessings are found in heavenly realms and originate from a higher spiritual world.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ...Almost all St. Paul‚Äôs Epistles begin with some ascription of praise."
2. "God who is also the Father of...who blessed us...in all blessing of the Spirit...in the heavenly places."
3. "Our country is in heaven...There are our treasures, and our affections to be...and there, in that place, and belonging to that state, is the blessing, the gift of the Spirit, poured out on those who have the mind set on heavenly things."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The doxologies in almost all the Epistles imply the real sense of grace experienced by the writers and their readers."
2. "sets forth summarily the Gospel of the grace of God: the Father's work of love, the Son's redemption and inheritance, the Holy Spirit's sealing and giving an earnest of the inheritance."
3. "God 'blesses' His children; and that not in mere words, but in acts."


### Albert Barnes:

3. "The persons referred to by the word 'us,' are those who are mentioned in Ephesians 1:1, as 'saints,' - Œ±ÃîÃÅŒ≥ŒπÃÅŒøŒπœÇ hagiois - 'holy;' and 'faithful' - œÄŒπœÉœÑŒøŒπÕÇœÇ pistois - 'believing,' or 'believers.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Blessed [ŒµœÖŒªŒøŒ≥Œ∑œÑŒøœÇ]. Placed first in the clause for emphasis, as always in the corresponding Hebrew in the Old Testament."
2. "The word differs from that used in the Beatitudes, makariov. which denotes character, while this word denotes repute. Lit., well-spoken of."
3. "The meaning is that the spiritual blessings of God are found in heaven and are brought thence to us."

### John Calvin:
1. "The design of the apostle, therefore, in asserting the riches of divine grace toward the Ephesians, was to protect them against having their faith shaken by the false apostles, as if their calling were doubtful, or salvation were to be sought in some other way."
2. "The word bless is here used in more than one sense, as referring to God, and as referring to men. I find in Scripture four different significations of this word."
3. "The happiness which it bestows is not in this world, but in heaven and everlasting life. In the Christian religion, indeed, as we are elsewhere taught, (1 Timothy 4:8,) is contained the 'promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come;' but its aim is spiritual happiness, for the kingdom of Christ is spiritual."

### Philip Schaff:

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "The believer is a citizen of heaven and the spiritual blessings count for most to him."
3. "Heaven is the real abode of the citizen of Christ's kingdom who is a stranger on earth."

### John Gill:
1. "Now to 'bless' God is neither to invoke nor confer a blessing on him... but it is either to congratulate his greatness and goodness, to ascribe blessing, glory, and honour to him, or to give thanks unto him, both for temporal and spiritual mercies."
2. "God is the author and giver of all blessings; and he blesses his people with them... if he blesses not, none can; and if he blesses, they are blessed indeed."
3. "And the blessings such are blessed with are spiritual... solid, substantial, and lasting blessings; and which concern the good of the soul or spirit of man; and are agreeable to, and desired by a spiritual man; and are applied by the Holy Spirit of God."

### John Wesley:
1. "God's blessing us is his bestowing all spiritual and heavenly blessings upon us."
