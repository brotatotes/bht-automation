# Ephesians 1:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's eternal choice is the foundation of the blessings bestowed upon believers. This choice was not arbitrary, but in Christ, signifying that it is in Him that we find our worth, apart from any merit of our own. The restoration of love, lost through the Fall, is the essence of all Christian virtues. Our holiness stems from our election in Christ, and it is through His grace that we are made holy and blameless. The purpose of God's redemptive plan is that we may stand before Him in perfect love, evidence of our election through His divine grace.
