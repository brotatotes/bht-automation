# Ephesians 1:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's choice is not limited to a specific group, but extends to both Jews and Gentiles who have faith in Christ. His selection of believers is a demonstration of His grace and sovereignty. This divine election was made before the foundation of the world and is rooted in His foreknowledge. Furthermore, the purpose of this choice is to bring about holiness and blamelessness in believers, a standard that can only be achieved through God's love. This concept of God's electing grace is also reflected in other passages of Scripture, such as 1 Peter 1:2.
