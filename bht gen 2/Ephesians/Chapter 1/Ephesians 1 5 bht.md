# Ephesians 1:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God has predestined us to be adopted as his sons, meaning that he has planned for all who believe in him to become part of his spiritual family. This adoption is not based on our worthiness, but solely on God's grace and love towards us. It is by his free and unchangeable will that he has chosen to bless those who have faith in Christ and make them joint-heirs with him. This was all part of God's divine plan and purpose for our lives.
