# Ephesians 1:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God, in His infinite wisdom and grace, has predestined believers to be adopted as His sons. This divine predestination, according to the good pleasure of His will, ensures that those who believe in Christ will partake in the privilege of being God's children and heirs with Christ. It is not by our own merit but solely by the grace of God, who has chosen us beforehand for this glorious purpose.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "unto adoption (so that we should become His sons, in the blessed sense of being reconciled to Him and having a place in His spiritual family, should have the remission of our sins, the pledge of the Spirit, the assurance of the inheritance) through Jesus Christ"
2. "to (into) Himself, i.e. so that we should be partakers of the divine nature"
3. "according to (in pursuance of) the good pleasure of His will"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "We are 'chosen' out of the rest of the world; 'predestinated' to all things that secure the inheritance for us."
2. "The context favors the explanation of CALVIN: God has regard to Himself and the glory of His grace as His ultimate end."
3. "We cannot go beyond 'the good pleasure of His will' in searching into the causes of our salvation, or of any of His works."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "What God does, he always meant to do. What he permits, he always meant to permit."
2. "If it is right to save a soul, it was also right to intend to save it. If it is right to condemn a sinner to we, it was right to intend to do it."
3. "Now this is about the case in regard to God, and the doctrine of election. All people were guilty and condemned. For wise reasons, which God has not communicated to us, he determined to bring a portion at least of the human race to salvation."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Having predestinated...foreordained...to define or determine beforehand." 
2. "Adoption...Never used of Christ." 
3. "Good pleasure...because it pleased Him...in love."

### John Calvin:
1. "The cause of our salvation did not proceed from us, but from God alone."
2. "In adopting us, therefore, God does not inquire what we are, and is not reconciled to us by any personal worth. His single motive is the eternal good pleasure, by which he predestinated us."

1. "The word 'predestine' (fore-ordain) refers to choosing for a preappointed end; the word translated ‘chose’ (Ephesians 1:4) points to the fact that the choice has been made out of a mass." 
2. "If 'in love' be connected with this verse, it gives special emphasis to the motive of the predestination. These things, at which men cavil, are prompted by love, and will be apprehended only when men respond in love."
3. "The end of the foreordaining is that we may be placed in the position of sons, enjoy the privileges of sons; comp. Romans 8:15-29. Christ is 'the first-born,' the only begotten Son; we are foreordained unto adoption, to become His brethren."

1. "Having predestinated us to the adoption of sons — Having foreordained that all who afterwards believed should enjoy the dignity of being sons of God, and joint-heirs with Christ."
2. "According to the good pleasure of his will — According to his free, fixed, unalterable purpose to confer this blessing on all those who should believe in Christ, and those only."
