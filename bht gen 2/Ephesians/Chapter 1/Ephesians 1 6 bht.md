# Ephesians 1:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's purpose in predestining us to adoption is to showcase the glory, majesty, and kindness of His grace, deserving praise from all creatures. Through His grace, we are accepted and embraced, experiencing the love of the Beloved, who is Christ. This doctrine of predestination and election lays the foundation for adoring gratitude and praise. We have abundant reasons to be thankful for God's redeeming love, mercy, and the blessings poured upon us. His grace is evident in the predestination to adoption, revealing the splendor of His grace. We learn to praise God for both His actions and His attributes.
