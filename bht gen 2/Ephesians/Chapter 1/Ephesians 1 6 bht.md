# Ephesians 1:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The free and glorious love of God is the foundation of His predestination and adoption, where His grace is on full display. We are accepted in Christ, clothed in His righteousness, and our praise and gratitude for His mercy and redemption should resound. Our acceptance and salvation are solely based on His love, and for this, we have every reason to give thanks and praise.
