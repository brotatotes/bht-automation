# Ephesians 1:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The knowledge that God has chosen and predestined us for adoption is not meant to provoke opposition or accusations of unfairness. Instead, it serves as a reason for gratitude and praise. Through our adoption into God's family, His glorious grace is put on display, drawing the admiration and worship of both mankind and heavenly beings. We are privileged recipients of His grace, accepted and embraced with open arms, and it is in the embrace of His beloved Son that God's love for us finds its fullest expression.
