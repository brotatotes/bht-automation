## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In the living knowledge of the thoughts and ways of God we first get a sure and clear light upon ourselves and our ways, a light cast from above upon the import and aim of this our earthly life in the sight of God and His eternity. Here is the true wisdom of the heart, the true prudence of life."
2. "According to this then, ἐν πάσῃ σοφίᾳ κ . φρονήσει must refer to that in the bestowal of which on us He hath made His grace to abound, so that we should thereby become σοφοὶ κ . φρόνιμοι."
3. "It was in His manifold wisdom and prudence, manifested in all ways possible for us, that He poured out His grace upon us: and this wisdom and prudence was especially exemplified in that which follows, the notification to us of His hidden will, &c."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "wisdom" in devising the plan of redeeming mankind; "prudence" in executing it by the means, and in making all the necessary arrangements of Providence for that purpose.
2. Paul attributes to the Gospel of God's grace "all" possible "wisdom and prudence," in opposition to the boasts of wisdom and prudence which the unbelieving Jews and heathen philosophers and false apostles arrogated for their teachings.
3. Christ crucified, though esteemed "foolishness" by the world, is "the wisdom of God" (1 Corinthians 1:24).

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Which he has liberally manifested to us. This grace has not been stinted and confined, but has been liberal and abundant."
2. "He has evinced great wisdom in the plan of salvation; wisdom in so saving people as to secure the honor of his own law, and in devising a scheme that was eminently adapted to save people."
3. "God had evinced great 'intelligence' in the plan of salvation. There was ample proof of 'mind' and of 'thought.' It was adapted to the end in view. It was far-seeing; skillfully arranged; and carefully formed."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Wherein He hath abounded, which He made to abound."
2. "Both words refer here to men, not to God: the wisdom and prudence with which He abundantly endows His followers."
3. "All wisdom is, properly, every kind of wisdom."

### John Calvin:
1. "He now comes to the formal cause, the preaching of the gospel, by which the goodness of God overflows upon us."
2. "Paul gives to the gospel the magnificent appellations of wisdom and prudence, for the purpose of leading the Ephesians to despise all contrary doctrines."
3. "Paul, on the other hand, builds up the authority of the gospel, that believers may rest upon it with unshaken confidence."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Which he caused to abound toward (lit, ‘into’) us. ‘Which’ is preferable to ‘wherein,’ or, ‘wherewith’; the grace itself was made to flow abundantly to us, in fact into us as the subjects of it."
2. "In all wisdom and prudence. This phrase can scarcely be applied to God, for ‘all wisdom’ does not mean the highest wisdom, but every kind of wisdom; and ‘prudence’ is rarely thus applied. The parallel passage (Colossians 1:9) favors the reference to Christians, and this explanation agrees better with the sweep of the thought."
3. "‘Wisdom grasps God’s doings, perceives and understands His counsels of grace; prudence is directed to what we have to do, looks at our problem and how to solve it; the former sees the relations ordered by God, the latter regulates our conduct accordingly’ (Braune)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A thoroughly Pauline phrase, riches of kindness (Romans 2:4), riches of glory (Colossians 1:27; Ephesians 3:16; Philippians 4:19), riches of fulness of understanding (Colossians 2:7), riches of Christ (Ephesians 3:8), and in Ephesians 2:7 'the surpassing riches of grace.'" 


### John Gill:
1. "in the grace which is so abundantly displayed in redemption and forgiveness of sin, through the blood of Christ"
2. "the Gospel is a declaration of the free grace of God, in the salvation of sinners by Christ; in the free justification of them by his righteousness; and in the full pardon of their sins through his blood"
3. "the grace of God is exceeding abundant with faith and love, in regeneration, sanctification, and conversion"

### John Wesley:
1. "In all wisdom — Manifested by God in the whole scheme of our salvation."
