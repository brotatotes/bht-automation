# Ephesians 1:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's abounding grace is manifested in the revelation of the mystery of His will. This mystery, distinct from the secretive rituals of paganism, has been unveiled to believers. The disclosure of this mystery aligns with God's good pleasure, reflecting His loving favor. The mystery of redemption in Christ, an integral part of God's timeless plan, was previously concealed. It originated in God's own thoughts, hidden until He decided to impart it. This mystery, known as the Gospel, reveals the unfathomable riches and depths of God's grace. It transcends human comprehension and is comprehended solely by His sovereign will.
