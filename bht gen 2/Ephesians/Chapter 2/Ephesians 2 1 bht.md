# Ephesians 2:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God has brought you back to life, just as He resurrected Christ from the dead, highlighting your past state of being spiritually dead and separated from Him. This shows the dire condition of mankind in their natural state, void of any spiritual life and incapable of finding life on their own. The distinction between sins and trespasses showcases the reality of both the Gentiles, who were ignorant of God, and the Jews, who disregarded His law. It is through God's remarkable grace and power that He has redeemed and transformed you.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "καί is much more than merely copulative. It selects and puts into prominence ὑμᾶς, who were dead in your trespasses and sins."
2. "The whole of the subsequent mercy of God in His quickening them is spiritual, and therefore of necessity the death also."

2. "Sin is the death of the soul."
3. "'Trespass' in Greek, expresses a FALL or LAPSE, such as the transgression of Adam whereby he fell. 'Sin' implies innate corruption and ALIENATION from God, exhibited in acts of sin."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The words 'hath he quickened' mean, hath he made alive, or made to live."

3. "Let this, then, be held as a fixed principle, that the union of our soul with God is the true and only life; and that out of Christ we are altogether dead, because sin, the cause of death, reigns in us."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The verb fordid he quicken does not occur till verse Ephesians 2:5 and then with ημας (us) instead of υμας (you)."
2. "There is a like ellipsis or anacoluthon in Colossians 1:21; Colossians 1:22, only there is no change from υμας to ημας."
3. "Present active participle referring to their former state. Spiritually dead.Trespasses and sins."

### John Gill:
1. "The design of the apostle in this and some following verses, is to show the exceeding sinfulness of sin, and to set forth the sad estate and condition of man by nature, and to magnify the riches of the grace of God, and represent the exceeding greatness of his power in conversion."
2. "Those who are quickened with Christ, and by the power and grace of God, are described in their natural and unregenerate estate, who were dead in trespasses and sins."
