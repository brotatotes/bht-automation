# Ephesians 2:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's grace has rescued us from destruction and brought us into new life. Before our conversion, we were dead in sins, spiritually lifeless and separated from God. The extent of our depravity is evident in our state of being lost and the present death we were under. Our union with God is the true and only life, and outside of Christ, we are completely dead, as sin reigns within us. Our former state of trespasses and sins is contrasted with the power of God's resurrection, which has made us alive.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "καί is much more than merely copulative. It selects and puts into prominence ὑμᾶς, who were dead in your trespasses and sins."

2. "Sin is the death of the soul."
3. "'Trespass' in Greek, expresses a FALL or LAPSE, such as the transgression of Adam whereby he fell. 'Sin' implies innate corruption and ALIENATION from God, exhibited in acts of sin."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The words 'hath he quickened' mean, hath he made alive, or made to live."
2. "It is affirmed here of those to whom Paul wrote at Ephesus, that before they were converted, they were 'dead in sins.' There is not anywhere a more explicit proof of depravity than this, and no stronger language can be used."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There is, however, no contrast with other Christians, but an application of what precedes to their case, probably with a suggestion of the resemblance to the Resurrection of Christ."
2. "Being dead... Spiritual, not physical, death is referred to."
3. "The former word refers to special transgressions, viewed as misdeeds, faults, failures (and is usually rendered 'trespass'); the latter, in the singular, is used of sin as a power or principle, or in an abstract sense, but, in the plural, as here, embraces all sins, in thought, word, or deed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The verb fordid he quicken does not occur till verse Ephesians 2:5 and then with ημας (us) instead of υμας (you)."

3. "In trespasses and sins - Sins seem to be spoken chiefly of the gentiles, who knew not God; trespasses, of the Jews, who had his law, and yet regarded it not."
