# Ephesians 2:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We are God's workmanship, created by His grace for the purpose of performing good works that He has prepared in advance for us to walk in. This shows that our salvation is not of ourselves, but is a free gift from God. Our good works are not a means to earn salvation, but are the result of our regeneration in Christ. It is through God's divine grace that we are able to fulfill the purpose for which we were created and to live a holy life.

### Albert Barnes:

2. "The primary object was not to bring us to heaven. It was that we should be 'holy.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Created (κτισθεντες). First aorist passive participle of κτιζω, not the original creation as in Colossians 1:16; Ephesians 3:9, but the moral and spiritual renewal in Christ, the new birth, as in Ephesians 2:15; Ephesians 4:24."
2. "For good works (επ εργοις αγαθοις). Probably the true dative of purpose here with επ (Robertson, Grammar, p. 605). Purpose of the new creation in Christ."
