# Ephesians 2:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We, as believers, are the result of God's workmanship, signifying that our salvation is not earned through our own efforts but is instead a gift freely given by God. Our transformation into new creations in Christ Jesus is intended to lead us towards good works, in which we continually offer ourselves as active participants. Furthermore, the initiation and preparation of these good works are rooted in God's preordained plan, emphasizing His sovereignty and divine orchestration in every aspect.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Created (Œ∫œÑŒπœÉŒ∏ŒµŒΩœÑŒµœÇ). First aorist passive participle of Œ∫œÑŒπŒ∂œâ, not the original creation as in Colossians 1:16; Ephesians 3:9, but the moral and spiritual renewal in Christ, the new birth, as in Ephesians 2:15; Ephesians 4:24."
2. "For good works (ŒµœÄ ŒµœÅŒ≥ŒøŒπœÇ Œ±Œ≥Œ±Œ∏ŒøŒπœÇ). Probably the true dative of purpose here with ŒµœÄ (Robertson, Grammar, p. 605). Purpose of the new creation in Christ."
