# Ephesians 2:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Once you were Gentiles, known as the uncircumcision by those who prided themselves as the circumcision. It is crucial for believers to remember their former state in order to cultivate humility, repentance, thankfulness, and love. The converted Ephesians, like all who embrace Christianity, had much guilt to acknowledge and mourn over in their past lives. They had externally adhered to religious practices, but that did not guarantee the circumcision of the heart or true belonging to God's family. Uncircumcision represented their state of pollution, whereas spiritual circumcision by Christ was what truly mattered.
