# Ephesians 2:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Remembering their former condition as Gentiles, who were called the uncircumcision by the Jews, helps the converted Ephesians appreciate the blessings they have received from God. It serves as a reminder that their external adoption of religious practices, such as circumcision, did not guarantee true spiritual transformation. Instead, the Apostle highlights the importance of the circumcision of the heart, which goes beyond external rituals, and emphasizes the need for inner transformation and true connection with God.
