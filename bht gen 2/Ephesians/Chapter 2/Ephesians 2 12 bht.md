# Ephesians 2:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These individuals were devoid of any true knowledge or relationship with Christ, leading to their separation from the promised Messiah. Being without God and forsaken, they found themselves in a state of hopelessness, disconnected from the divine promises that offer true assurance and security. It is a remarkable expression of their condition - to be without God in their own world and to lack evidence of His favor or assurance of His love.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "that ye were at that time without Christ, separate from, having no part in, the promised Messiah."
2. "the commonwealth of Israel...that commonwealth which is designated by the term Israel."
3. "without God...forsaken of God...in the world."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "alienated from," not merely "separated from."
	The Israelites were cut off from the commonwealth of God, but it was
	as being self-righteous, indolent, and unworthy, not as aliens
	and strangers [CHRYSOSTOM].
    
2. The hope of redemption through the Messiah, on their subsequent apostasy, was embodied into a definite "commonwealth" or polity, namely, that "of Israel," from which the Gentiles were alienated.
	Contrast Ephesians 2:13; Ephesians 3:6;
	Ephesians 4:4; Ephesians 4:5;
	Psalms 147:20. 
3. having no . . . hope—beyond this life (1 Corinthians 15:19).
	The CONJECTURES of heathen philosophers as to a future life were at best vague and utterly unsatisfactory. They had no divine "promise," and therefore no sure ground of "hope." Epicurus and Aristotle did not believe in it at all. The Platonists believed the soul passed through perpetual changes, now happy, and then again miserable; the Stoics, that it existed no longer than till the time of the general burning up of all things.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Though they had heard of him, and were constantly under the instruction which reminded them of him, yet they were without any true knowledge of him, and without any of the hopes which result from having embraced him."
2. "It may be remarked, that Walton (Polyglott) and Rosenmuller unite the word “promise” here with the word “hope” - “having no hope of the promise.” But the more obvious and usual interpretation is that in our common version, meaning that they were not by nature favored with the covenants made with Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, etc., by which there was a promise of future blessings under the Messiah."
3. "What an expression! To be without God - without God in his own world, and where he is all around us! To have no evidence of his favor, no assurance of his love, no hope of dwelling with him!"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Paul speaks ideally of a spiritual commonwealth in which Jew and Gentile were together at peace with God, and of which the commonwealth of Israel is a type."
2. "In being separated from Christ, they were separated from that commonwealth in which, according to the promise, Christ would have been to them, as to the faithful Israelites, the object of their faith and the ground of their salvation."
3. "The messianic promise, which was the basis of all the covenants."

### John Calvin:
1. "But for him that is without Christ, there remains nothing but destruction."
2. "Take away the covenant of salvation, and there remains no hope."
3. "From what has been said, the conclusion will be easily drawn, that out of Christ there are none but idols."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The fact that this was their condition being made more prominent by the added phrase 'at that time,' which is stronger than 'once.'" 
2. "The reference is not to a civil constitution, or to citizenship, but rather to the theocratic spiritual privileges which the Jewish people possessed." 
3. "The Gentiles were not only without the Messianic hope but without any hope."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Separate from Christ (χωρις Χριστου). Ablative case with adverbial preposition χωρις, describing their former condition as heathen."
2. "Alienated from the commonwealth of Israel (απηλλοτριωμενο της πολιτειας του Ισραηλ). Perfect passive participle of απαλλοτριοω, for which see Colossians 1:21."
3. "Without God (αθεο). Old Greek word, not in LXX, only here in N.T. Atheists in the original sense of being without God and also in the sense of hostility to God from failure to worship him. See Paul's words in Romans 1:18-32."

### John Gill:
1. "they were without any knowledge of him, faith in him, love to him, communion with him, or subjection to him, his Gospel, government, laws, and ordinances"
2. "so great an alienation and distance were there between these two people"
3. "strangers to the covenant of circumcision given to Abraham; and to the covenant at Mount Sinai, made with Israel; and to the dispensation of the covenant of grace to that people"

### John Wesley:
1. "Were at that time without Christ — Having no faith in, or knowledge of, him."
2. "Being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel — Both as to their temporal privileges and spiritual blessings."
3. "Having no hope — Because they had no promise whereon to ground their hope."
