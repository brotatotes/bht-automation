# Ephesians 2:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through Christ, we find peace. He is not just the peacemaker, but the embodiment of peace itself. In his person, the reconciliation between Jew and Gentile was accomplished. The dividing wall, represented by the ceremonial law, was broken down by Christ's work of atonement. The unity he brings goes beyond external reconciliation, creating a profound sense of universal brotherhood. Christ's sacrifice not only reconciles us with God, but also fosters harmony among his followers. With the barriers removed, we can experience the true peace that comes through Christ alone.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He is our peace, not by metonymy for εἰρηνοποιός, but in the widest and most literal sense, our peace. He did not make our peace and then retire, leaving us to enjoy that peace, but is Himself its medium and its substance; His making both one was no external reconciliation, but the taking both, their common nature, on and into Himself."
2. "The primary allusion seems to be to the rending of the veil at the crucifixion: not that that veil separated Jew and Gentile, but that it, the chief symbol of separation from God, included in its removal the admission to Him of that one body into which Christ made Jew and Gentile."
3. "The enmity in which both were involved against God [...] That it is expressed, now shews that throughout, that union has been thought of only as a subordinate step in a greater reconciliation."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Himself" alone, pre-eminently, and none else.
2. "Himself" the price of our peace with God, and so the bond of union between "both" in God.
3. The middle wall of partition represented the Sinaitic law, which both severed all men, even the Jews, from access to God, and also separated the Gentiles from the Jews.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The best way to produce peace between alienated minds is to bring them to the same Saviour."
2. "The work of the atonement is...to produce peace between alienated and contending minds."
3. "This great work of the atonement is...to produce peace in alienated minds everywhere, and to diffuse abroad the feeling of universal brotherhood."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Christ is not merely our peace-maker, but our very peace itself."
2. "The wall which pertained to the fence; the fact of separation being emphasized in wall, and the instrument of separation in fence."
3. "The hedge was the whole Mosaic economy which separated Jew from Gentile."

### John Calvin:
1. "For he is our peace. He now includes Jews in the privilege of reconciliation, and shows that, through one Messiah, all are united to God."
2. "What a beautiful title is this which Christ possesses, — the peace between God and men! Let no one who dwells in Christ entertain a doubt that he is reconciled to God."
3. "But now, the apostle, says, the enmity is removed, and the wall is broken down. By extending the privilege of adoption beyond the limits of Judea, Christ has now made us all to be brethren."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He is our peace, not simply our peacemaker; for in His person, as God man, the reconciliation took place."
2. "How He is our peace is specified in what follows."
3. "The 'middle wall,' which resulted from and belonged to this economy, was broken down once for all."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He himself, not just what he did (necessary as that was and is). He is our peace with God and so with each other (Jews and Gentiles)." 
2. "Both one (τα αμφοτερα εν). 'The both' (Jew and Gentile). Jesus had said 'other sheep I have which are not of this fold' (John 10:16). One (εν) is neuter singular (oneness, unity, identity) as in Galatians 3:28. Race and national distinctions vanish in Christ."
3. "Brake down the middle wall of partition (το μεσοτοιχον του φραγμου λυσας). 'Having loosened (first aorist active participle of λυω, see John 2:19) the middle-wall (late word, only here in N.T., and very rare anywhere, one in papyri, and one inscription) of partition (φραγμου, old word, fence, from φρασσω, to fence or hedge, as in Matthew 21:33)."

### John Gill:
1. "The author of peace between Jew and Gentile: there was a great enmity of the Jew against the Gentile, and of the Gentile against the Jew." 
2. "Christ has made peace between them by abrogating the ceremonial law, which was the occasion of the difference, and by sending the Gospel of peace to them both."
3. "Christ is the author of peace between God and his people; there is naturally in man an enmity to God; sin has separated chief friends; nor can man make his peace with God."

### John Wesley:
1. "For he is our peace" - Not only as he purchased it, but as he is the very bond and centre of union.
2. "And hath broken down the middle wall of partition" - Alluding to that wall of old, which separated the court of Israel from the court of the gentiles. Such a wall was the ceremonial law, which Christ had now taken away.
