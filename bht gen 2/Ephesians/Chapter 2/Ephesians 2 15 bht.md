Christ, through his sacrifice of himself, abolished the enmity between Jews and Gentiles, which was caused by the ceremonial commandments.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Hath broken down the middle wall of partition (not merely as English Version, 'between us,' but also between all men and God), to wit, the enmity ( :-) by His flesh" (compare Ephesians 2:16; Romans 8:3).
2. Christ has in, or by, His crucified flesh, abolished it, so far as its condemning and enmity-creating power is concerned (Romans 8:7), substituting for it the law of love, which is the everlasting spirit of the law, and which flows from the realization in the soul of His love in His death for us.
3. Translate what follows, "that He might make the two (Jews and Gentiles) into one new man." Not that He might merely reconcile the two to each other, but incorporate the two, reconciled in Him to God, into one new man; the old man to which both belonged, the enemy of God, having been slain in His flesh on the cross.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was not by instruction merely; it was not by communicating the knowledge of God; it was not as a teacher; it was not by the mere exertion of power; it was by his flesh - his human nature - and this can mean only that he did it by his sacrifice of himself."
2. "The ceremonial law of the Jews, on which they so much prided themselves, was the cause of the hostility existing between them. That made them different people, and laid the foundation for the alienation which existed between them."
3.

### John Calvin:
