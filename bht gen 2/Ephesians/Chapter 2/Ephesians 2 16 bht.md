# Ephesians 2:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through Christ's work of reconciliation, complete amity is achieved where there was previously enmity. The crucifixion of Christ not only dealt with the enmity between God and man, but also the enmity between Jew and Gentile. This reconciliation is made possible by Christ's sacrifice on the cross, wherein sinners are brought back into harmony with God. This reconciliation extends beyond our relationship with God to our relationships with one another, resulting in peace among believers. Through the cross, Christ has formed a new unity — the church — where all believers, regardless of their backgrounds, become one body.
