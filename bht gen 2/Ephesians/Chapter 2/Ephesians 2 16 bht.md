# Ephesians 2:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Sinners were once alienated from God and at enmity with Him. However, through the death of Christ on the cross, reconciliation was made for believers to be reconciled to God, and in turn, be at peace with one another. The cross served as the means of reconciliation, as it satisfied the law and justice of God. As a result, believers are united in one body, the church, experiencing a restoration to a primal unity with God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Greek for 'reconcile' (apocatalaxe), found only here and in Colossians 1:20, expresses not only a return to favor with one (catallage), but so to lay aside enmity that complete amity follows; to pass from enmity to complete reconciliation."
2. "Slain the enmity—namely, that had been between man and God; and so that between Jew and Gentile which had resulted from it. By His being slain, He slew it."
3. "Thereby—Greek, 'therein'; 'in' or 'by the cross,' that is, His crucifixion."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was not merely to make them harmonious, but it was that both, who had been alienated from God, should be reconciled to 'him.'"
2. "They who are reconciled to God will be at peace with each other."
3. "By the atonement only that men ever become reconciled to God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The verb contains a hint of restoration to a primal unity."
2. "Thereby [εν αυτω]. Or upon it - the cross"
3. "As children of the messianic covenant"

### John Calvin:
1. "The reconciliation between ourselves which has now been described is not the only advantage which we derive from Christ."
2. "We are all sinners; and forgiveness of sins cannot be obtained but through the grace of Christ."
3. "Sin is the cause of enmity between God and us; and, until it is removed, we shall not be restored to the Divine favor."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The compound verb here used occurs elsewhere only in Colossians 1:20-21. It may either be a strengthened form, or mean 'reconcile again.' The former is preferable, since the context speaks of 'one new man,' 'one body,' not of a restoration."
2. "Jews and Gentiles being, as they are, in this one body, are reconciled to God through the death of Christ. 'Through the cross' points to the expiatory sacrifice of Christ as the ground of the reconciliation, in accordance with the teaching of the entire Bible."
3. "'The enmity' has been explained (1.) of enmity toward God, (2.) of enmity between Jew and Gentile, (3.) of both. The last is preferable, for the complex idea runs through the whole passage."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Final clause with ινα understood of first aorist active subjunctive of αποκαταλλασσω for which see Colossians 1:20; Colossians 1:22."
2. "The 'one new man' of verse Ephesians 2:15 of which Christ is Head (Ephesians 1:23), the spiritual church."
3. "Paul piles up metaphors to express his idea of the Kingdom of God with Christ as King."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ by fulfilling it for them, and thereby abrogating it, reconciled them."
2. "Reconciliation with others depends upon reconciliation with him."
3. "Reconciliation is made in a way of satisfaction to the law and justice of God."

### John Wesley:
1. "In one body — One church."
2. "Having slain — By his own death on the cross."
3. "The enmity — Which had been between sinners and God."
