# Ephesians 2:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He came after his resurrection and proclaimed peace, bringing good news to both Jews and Gentiles.

The gospel of peace was first preached to the Jews, both before and after His resurrection, and later extended to the Gentiles. This distinction emphasizes the opportunity for all, whether near or far off, to receive the message of reconciliation and experience peace with God.
