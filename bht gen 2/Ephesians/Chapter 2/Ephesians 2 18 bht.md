# Ephesians 2:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Being made one, both Jews and Gentiles are reconciled to God and have been given the Gospel of peace through Christ. They now have freedom of access and boldness to approach God. This access is granted through Christ, who has made peace and atoned for their sins, removing all hindrances. Furthermore, this access is made possible by the Holy Spirit, who empowers and encourages believers to approach God as their Father. It is fitting to note that Christ, the Spirit, and the Father often stand together in the same order as a representation of the three-one God.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For it is through Him (John 14:6; John 14:6- :) that we have our access (Ephesians 3:12; Romans 5:2), both of us, in (that is, united in, that is, 'by,' Romans 5:2- :, Greek) one Spirit to the Father,"
2. "The oneness of 'the Spirit,' through which we both have our access, is necessarily followed by oneness of the body, the Church (Romans 5:2- :)."

2. "It was necessary, therefore, to explain the true nature of evangelical peace, which is widely different from a stupefied conscience, from false confidence, from proud boasting, from ignorance of our own wretchedness."
3. "It is a settled composure, which leads us not to dread, but to desire and seek, the face of God."

### Philip Schaff:

### John Gill:
1. "Being made one, and reconciled unto God, and having the Gospel of peace preached to both, they have through Christ freedom of access and boldness in it."
2. "Their access to him is 'through' Christ, who has made peace for them, and atonement for their sins; who has satisfied law and justice, and brought in an everlasting righteousness for them; so that there is nothing lies in their way to hinder them."
3. "And this access is also 'by one Spirit'; the 'Holy Spirit', as the Ethiopic version reads; and who is necessary in access to God, as a spirit of adoption, to enable and encourage souls to go to God as a father; and as a spirit of supplication, to teach both how to pray, and for what, as they should."
