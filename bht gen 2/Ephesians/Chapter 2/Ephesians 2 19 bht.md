# Ephesians 2:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers, who were once strangers and foreigners, have been divinely transformed into citizens of the heavenly Jerusalem. Through the grace of God, they are no longer outsiders but are wholeheartedly embraced as members of His family. In this spiritual household, they have access to the abundant blessings and privileges that come with being in a profound and personal relationship with God. They have been incorporated into a community of faith, united upon the cornerstone of Jesus Christ. Together, as fellow citizens, they are recipients of God's boundless love and grace.
