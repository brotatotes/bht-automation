### Henry Alford:
1. "The meaning of αἰών here is compounded of its temporal and its ethical sense: it is not exactly ‘lifetime,’ ‘duration,’ nor again ‘fashion,’ ‘spirit,’ but some common term which will admit of being both temporally and ethically characterized, ‘career’ or ‘course.’"
2. "We are tempted by evil spirits, who have access to us, and suggest thoughts and desires to our minds. We are surrounded by the air, which is the vehicle of speech and of all suggestions to our senses. Tried continually as we are by these temptations, what so natural, as to assign to their ministers a dwelling in, and power over that element which is the vehicle of them to us?"
3. "The expression ἐξουσία τοῦ πνεύματος, in apposition with it, represents their aggregate character, as an influence on the human mind, a spirit of ungodliness and disobedience."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "He intimates that the death which he had mentioned rages in the nature of man, and is a universal disease.

3. "...there is a prince who is at the head of these, called Beelzebub, the prince of devils, or the lord of a fly, for the devils under him are as so many flies in the air..."
