# Ephesians 2:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The image of a building is appropriate, for the church is like a temple that God delights to dwell in. The doctrines taught by the apostles and prophets lay the foundation upon which the church rests. Christ, as the cornerstone, holds together the entire edifice, and it is on Him that the faith and life of every believer depend. The word of God, declared by the apostles and prophets, sustains the faith of all believers, and it is through Christ, the chief cornerstone, that the church is built and stands firm.
