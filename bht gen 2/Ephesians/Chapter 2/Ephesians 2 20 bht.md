# Ephesians 2:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The church is likened to a building, with the apostles and prophets as its foundation. Their teachings form the basis of the church and sustain the faith of believers. Jesus Christ himself is the chief cornerstone, holding everything together and surpassing all others in importance. This understanding is vital for discerning between a true and false church. By relying solely on the foundation laid by the apostles and prophets, we can be counted among true believers. The authority of our faith rests on listening to the Holy Spirit speaking through the writings of the prophets.
