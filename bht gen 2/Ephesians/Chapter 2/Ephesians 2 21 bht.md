# Ephesians 2:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The building mentioned refers to the universal church, a spiritual structure comprising all believers. Christ acts as the master builder, foundation, and cornerstone of this everlasting edifice. The church's unity and growth revolve around Him, as believers become living stones fit together in Him. This growth includes the increase of believers joining the body and the advancement of their spiritual lives through the Word and ordinances. Comparing the church to the temple of Diana, once worshipped by the Ephesians, emphasizes the superiority and surpassing value of the church as the dwelling place of God.
