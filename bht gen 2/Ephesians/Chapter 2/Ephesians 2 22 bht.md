# Ephesians 2:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are brought together and built as a church, resembling a spiritual structure. The purpose is to become a habitation of God in the Spirit. This building process involves all believers, as they are joined and cemented together in love. Each individual believer is meant to be a dwelling place, or temple, of God in the Spirit. God the Father is distinguished from Christ and the Holy Spirit, as this building process is intended to create a place for God's presence in the lives of believers.
