# Ephesians 2:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In and upon Christ, as the church at Ephesus was, every particular church, including the church universal, is a building that is compact together. It consists of many parts, joined together, knit, and cemented in love. The ultimate purpose of being built together in this way is to become an habitation of God through the Spirit, a dwelling place where God's presence resides in the believers' midst. This includes all believers, both Jews and Gentiles alike, as they are continuously being built together.
