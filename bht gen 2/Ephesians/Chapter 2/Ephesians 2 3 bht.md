# Ephesians 2:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
All people, both Jews and Gentiles, were once caught in a life controlled by the desires of their fallen nature. This includes fulfilling the sinful desires of the flesh and succumbing to the corrupt thoughts that arise from it. It is important to recognize that this sinful inclination is not confined to certain individuals or groups; rather, it permeates the entire human race and marks us all as deserving of the just wrath of God. We cannot escape this truth, as it is woven into our very nature.

2. "This does not affirm 'when' they began to be such, or that they were such as soon as they were born, or that they were such before they became moral agents, whatever may be the truth on these points; but it affirms that before they were renewed, they were the children of wrath."
3. "You have a common inheritance with them. I do not mean to charge you with being the worst of sinners, or as being alone transgressors. It is the common lot of man - the sad, gloomy inheritance to which we all are born."
