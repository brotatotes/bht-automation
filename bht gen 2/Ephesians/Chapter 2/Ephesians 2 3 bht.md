# Ephesians 2:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Before we were renewed, we lived according to the desires of the flesh and the thoughts of our unregenerate minds, similar to the Gentiles. Both Jews and Gentiles were children of wrath by nature, deserving the judgment of God. Our corrupt nature, passed down through generations, led us to live in malice and disobedience. This passage affirms the doctrine of original sin and emphasizes our shared inheritance of a fallen nature. It reminds us that we are all in need of God's grace and redemption from the wrath that awaits us apart from Christ.
