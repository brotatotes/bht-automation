# Ephesians 2:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By God's grace, we have been brought back to life with Christ, even though we were once dead in our sins. This spiritual resurrection is a result of our union with Him. It is important to recognize that our salvation is entirely based on God's undeserved favor. This truth demolishes any pride or self-righteousness and reminds us that our only boast should be in the grace of God.
