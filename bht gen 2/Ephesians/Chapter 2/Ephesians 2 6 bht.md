# Ephesians 2:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Christ Jesus, through His resurrection and our spiritual union with Him, we are raised from the death of sin and granted a spiritual life by the power of God. Christ has gone ahead to heaven as our forerunner, preparing a place for us, and in Him, we find honor, pleasure, rest, and security. Though we do not physically possess our seats in heaven yet, they are already assigned to us, and we anticipate the future glory that we will share with Him.
