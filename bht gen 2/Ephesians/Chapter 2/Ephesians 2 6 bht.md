# Ephesians 2:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Christ Jesus, believers have the assurance of a spiritual resurrection, a life renewed from death in sin, flowing from the power of God's grace and mercy. Through our union with Christ, we are made to sit with Him in heavenly places, sharing in the honor, pleasure, and safety that it entails. While we may not physically see the resurrection and our heavenly seats yet, Christ has gone before us as our forerunner, preparing a place for us in heaven, ensuring that in due time, believers of all backgrounds will experience their rightful place in God's eternal kingdom.
