# Ephesians 2:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Salvation is not earned but rather received by the grace of God. It is not a result of our own merit or works, but solely a gift from God. Faith plays a crucial role in this process, as it is the means by which we receive and experience salvation. However, even faith itself is a gift from God, not something that we can boast about. Our salvation is not something we can achieve on our own; it is entirely initiated and accomplished by God's grace.
