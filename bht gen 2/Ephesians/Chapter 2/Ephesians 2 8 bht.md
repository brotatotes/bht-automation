# Ephesians 2:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Salvation is a gift of God's grace, freely given to us apart from anything we have done. It is not by our own merit or works, but solely by God's favor and love. Faith is the means through which we receive this gift, but even our faith is a gift from God. Our salvation is not based on our own efforts but on God's unmerited favor and the work of Christ. We are saved by grace alone, and our response should be one of humility and gratitude for this amazing gift.
