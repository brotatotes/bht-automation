# Ephesians 2:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Salvation is not based on our works, but solely on God's grace (Romans 4:5; Romans 11:6). It is important to understand that our own efforts cannot earn salvation (Romans 3:20, 27; Romans 4:2). The apostle Paul emphasizes that our justification is not by our own works, but through faith alone (Romans 3:27; Romans 4:4). Our salvation does not depend on what we do, but on God's grace alone (Romans 4:5). Therefore, we should not boast in our own abilities or good deeds, but humbly acknowledge that our salvation is a gift from God (Romans 3:27; Romans 4:2).
