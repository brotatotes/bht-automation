# Ephesians 2:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Salvation is not obtained through works, as the apostle made clear in Romans 3:20 and Romans 3:27. Instead, it is a result of God's grace, not something that can be earned. The purpose of this grace is to ensure that no one can boast or take credit for their own salvation. Human effort, no matter how great, cannot merit justification before God. He has completely excluded works from the equation in order to remove any opportunity for pride or boasting. This highlights the fact that salvation is entirely a work of God's grace and not of our own doing.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Not of works—This clause stands in contrast to 'by grace,' as is confirmed by Romans 4:4; Romans 4:5; Romans 11:6."
2. "lest—rather, as Greek, 'that no man should boast' (Romans 3:27; Romans 4:2)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. Not of works - see the notes at Romans 3:20, Romans 3:27.

### John Calvin:
1. "Hence we see, that the apostle leaves nothing to men in procuring salvation."
2. "This passage affords an easy refutation of the idle cavil by which Papists attempt to evade the argument, that we are justified without works."
3. "Paul excludes man and his utmost ability, - not only from the commencement, but throughout, - from the whole work of obtaining salvation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Not of works. This resumes the negative side, asserting that salvation does not proceed from works, as a meritorious ground."
2. "That no man should boast, or, 'glory;' the purpose of this method of grace is that God alone should have the glory, the negative side of which is 'that no man should boast'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "That no man should glory."
2. "It is all of God's grace."

### John Gill:
1. "Not of works,... nor of these in any sense; works are neither the moving causes, nor the procuring causes, nor the helping causes, nor 'causa sine qua non', or conditions of salvation."
2. "The best works that are done by men, are not done of themselves, but by the grace of God, and therefore can never merit at his hand."
3. "He has denied works any place in justification and salvation, in order to exclude all boasting in man; and has fixed it in a way of grace."

### John Wesley:
1. "Not by works — Neither this faith nor this salvation is owing to any works you ever did, will, or can do."
