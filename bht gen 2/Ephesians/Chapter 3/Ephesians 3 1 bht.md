# Ephesians 3:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul's imprisonment, a consequence of his bold proclamation of the Messiahship of Christ to the Gentiles, provided a tangible confirmation of his apostleship. Although others may have regarded his chains as a reproach, Paul saw them as a source of profit and honor for the Gentiles. His unwavering dedication to the name of Christ compelled him to view what the world saw as disgrace as the highest esteem. As a prisoner, Paul sought to build unity and extend the blessings of Christ to the Gentiles, which provoked the jealousy and anger of the Jews.
