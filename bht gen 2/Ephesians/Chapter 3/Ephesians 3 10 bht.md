# Ephesians 3:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The purpose of Paul's ministry was to proclaim the hidden mystery of salvation to the Gentiles, revealing God's wisdom to heavenly powers. Through the Church, God's infinite and diverse wisdom is displayed in different ways, encompassing various powers, characters, providences, and organizations. The Church serves as a mirror, reflecting the rainbow colors of God's undivided light, and a theater for the display of God's manifold wisdom. This wisdom, which includes the redemption of the world and the unity of Jews and Gentiles, should be admired and revered by all, even by the angels in heaven.
