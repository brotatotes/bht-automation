# Ephesians 3:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through our faith in Him, we may come to God now in prayer with confidence, boldly approaching the throne of grace for mercy. By trusting in Christ as Mediator and having a firm conviction of our heavenly Father's love, we can have a joyful and free attitude toward God, freely expressing our needs and desires. This access to God is granted through our union with Christ and allows us to come before Him with fearless confidence, just as favored petitioners have access and boldness in the presence of a monarch.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "‘Boldness’ is frequently used by Paul (see references), and here denotes the believer’s free joyous attitude toward God, the result of assurance of His favor."
2. "Some take ‘access’ here (comp. chap. Ephesians 2:18) in its primary sense of ‘introduction;’ but its connection with ‘boldness’ (especially if the article is omitted) favors the other and subjective meaning, our continued access."
3. "'That faith whose object is Jesus is the means to all who are Christ’s: first, of “boldness,” for their belief in the Divine Mediator gives them courage; secondly, of “access,” for their realization of His glorified humanity warrants and enables them to approach the throne of grace; and, thirdly, these blessings are possessed 'in confidence,' for they feel that for Christ’s sake their persons and services will be accepted by the Father’ (Eadie)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In confidence. Late and rare word from πεποιθα. See 2 Corinthians 1:15."
2. "Through our faith in him. Clearly objective genitive αυτου (in him)."

2. "And this access is with boldness; which denotes liberty of coming, granted by God, and a liberty in their own souls to speak out their minds plainly and freely; and a holy courage and intrepidity of soul, being free from servile fear, or a spirit of bondage."
3. "And this access may be had with confidence by the faith of him; with confidence of interest in the everlasting love of God; of relation to him, as a covenant God and Father; of his power, faithfulness, and willingness to fulfil his promises; of his hearing and answering prayer."

### John Wesley:
1. "By whom we have free access — Such as those petitioners have, who are introduced to the royal presence by some distinguished favourite."
2. "And boldness — Unrestrained liberty of speech, such as children use in addressing an indulgent father, when, without fear of offending, they disclose all their wants, and make known all their requests."
