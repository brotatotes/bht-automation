# Ephesians 3:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We are granted the remarkable privilege of coming to God boldly and confidently through our faith in Christ. It is through Him that we have free access to God's presence, much like petitioners who are introduced by a distinguished advocate. This access allows us to speak openly and honestly, without fear of offending, just as children approach a loving and indulgent father, expressing all their needs and desires. We can have assurance that our prayers will be heard and answered because of our trust in God's love, power, and faithfulness.
