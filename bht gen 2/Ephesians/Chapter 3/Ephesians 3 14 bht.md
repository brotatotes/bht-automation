# Ephesians 3:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For this reason, the apostle emphasizes his prayer to God, demonstrating the importance of pastors seeking the Lord's blessing on their ministry. It reminds us that our efforts, no matter how diligent, will be in vain without the gracious hand of the Father upon them. The Holy Spirit's work is crucial in illuminating our understanding and enabling us to fully grasp the weight of heavenly truth. Let us learn from Paul's example and not only exhort and admonish, but earnestly entreat the Lord to bless our labor, that it may bear fruit in abundance.

2. "It is difficult to convey in another language any trace of the deep connexion of πατήρ and πατριά here expressed."
3. "The Apostle seems, regarding God as the Father of us His adopted children in Christ, to go forth into the fact, that He, in this His relation to us, is in reality the great original and prototype of the paternal relation, wherever found."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Because ye have such a standing in God's Church."
2. "The proper attitude in humble prayer. Posture affects the mind, and is not therefore unimportant."
3. "The foundation of all sonship is in Jesus Christ." 

### Albert Barnes:

### John Calvin:
1. "Let pastors learn from Paul’s example, not only to admonish and exhort their people, but to entreat the Lord to bless their labors, that they may not be unfruitful."
2. "Nothing will be gained by their industry and toil, — all their study and application will be to no purpose, except so far as the Lord bestows his blessing."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I bow my knees. So Philippians 2:10. The full form is rhetorical. The reference is not to the actual bending of the knees, but to his earnest prayer."
2. "Unto the Father. God the Father, so in chaps. Ephesians 2:18; Ephesians 5:20; Colossians 1:12, without any added phrase, since the words ‘of our Lord Jesus Christ’ are not found in the oldest and best manuscripts, are rejected expressly by some of the Fathers, and by nearly every modern editor of any critical judgment. The grand thought of the passage is obscured by the insertion."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I bow my knees (καμπτω τα γονατα μου). He now prays whether he had at first intended to do so at Ephesians 3:1 or not."
2. "Calvin supposes that Paul knelt as he dictated this prayer, but this is not necessary."
3. "This was a common attitude in prayer (Luke 22:41; Acts 7:40; Acts 20:36; Acts 21:5), though standing is also frequent (Mark 11:25; Luke 18:11; Luke 18:13)."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle's view might be also to stir up these saints to pray for themselves."
2. "The gesture he used in prayer was bowing the knees; a man is not tied to any particular gesture or posture in prayer, the main thing is the heart."
3. "This gesture may be expressive of reverence, humility, and submission in prayer."
