# Ephesians 3:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul, by bowing his knees in prayer, demonstrates the importance of pastors seeking the Lord's blessing upon their labors. The posture of kneeling signifies reverence and humility before God. Without His divine favor, the efforts of pastors will be in vain. Through the illuminating work of the Holy Spirit, the teachings and guidance of pastors are made effective, leading believers to embrace the truth and live in accordance with God's will. Pastors should therefore learn from Paul's example, not only admonishing and exhorting their congregations but also imploring the Lord to bless their work, ensuring fruitful ministry.
