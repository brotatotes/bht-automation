# Ephesians 3:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The concept of family in the Bible extends beyond earthly relationships. Just as earthly families share a common ancestry, the family of God includes angels, saints in heaven, and believers on earth. This universal family is named after Christ, who is the master and governor of the family, providing for their needs. Through Christ, a relationship has been established between Jews and Gentiles, uniting them as one family. The Lord's Prayer reflects the idea of the kingdom of God as a divine community. We are reminded that all classes of beings, whether in heaven or on earth, derive their family name from God the Father.
