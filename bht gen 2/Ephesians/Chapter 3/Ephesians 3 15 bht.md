# Ephesians 3:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God, as our Father, serves as the prototype for paternal relationships. The 'family of God' encompasses all His children, who bear the same name derived from Christ. This united community, referred to as the 'kingdom' of God, is exemplified in the Lord's Prayer. This familial connection extends beyond earthly relationships to include angels, referred to as our 'brethren' and 'sons of God.' Regardless of their origin, all believers share a common name and belong to one family. Through the mediation of Christ, Jews and Gentiles are reconciled, uniting them as one family under God.
