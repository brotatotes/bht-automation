# Ephesians 3:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are called to seek strength and fortitude from God's inexhaustible abundance, which is according to the richness of His glory. This strength enables them to endure trials, perform their duties, and glorify His name. It is through the Holy Spirit that believers are empowered in the depths of their inner being. The inner man, the very essence of our moral and conscious self, needs constant invigoration and daily grace to navigate the challenges of life. It is through the Spirit's work in us that we grow, gain understanding, and experience the transformative power of God's love.
