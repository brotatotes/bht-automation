# Ephesians 3:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ being constantly and sensibly present in our hearts is the ideal state that we should strive for. It is not enough for Him to merely be a passing thought or a distant belief, but rather He should truly take up residence in the core of our beings. By having a deep and abiding connection with Christ, we are able to fully experience His love and grace, and be transformed by His indwelling presence. May we earnestly seek to have Christ dwell in our hearts in a tangible and enduring way.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is not enough that He be on the tongue, or flit through the brain: the heart is His proper seat." 
2. "You being rooted and grounded in love" is connected to the clause "that ye may be able to comprehend." 
3. "Love, the first-fruit of the Spirit, flowing from Christ's love realized in the soul, was to be the basis on which should rest their further comprehension of all the vastness of Christ's love."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith." - Expressions like this often occur in the Scriptures, where God is said to dwell in us, and we are said to be the temples of the Holy Spirit.
2. "That ye being rooted - firmly established - as a tree is whose roots strike deep, and extend afar." - The meaning is, that his love should be as firm in our hearts, as a tree is in the soil, whose roots strike deep into the earth.
3. "And grounded - 'founded' - as a building is on a foundation." - The word is taken from architecture, where a firm foundation is laid, and the meaning is, that he wished them to be as firm in the love of Christ, as a building is that rests on a solid basis.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "May dwell [κατοικησαι] . Settle down and abide." 
2. "Take up His permanent abode, so that ye may be a habitation [κατοικητηριον] of God."
3. "By faith [δια της πιστεως] . Through your (the article) faith, as the medium of appropriating Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is a mistake to imagine that the Spirit can be obtained without obtaining Christ; and it is equally foolish and absurd to dream that we can receive Christ without the Spirit."
2. "The method by which so great a benefit is obtained is also expressed. What a remarkable commendation is here bestowed on faith, that, by means of it, the Son of God becomes our own, and 'makes his abode with us!'"
3. "The firmness and constancy which our love ought to possess are pointed out by two metaphors. There are many persons not wholly destitute of love; but it is easily removed or shaken, because its roots are not deep. Paul desires that it should be rooted and grounded, — thoroughly fixed in our minds, so as to resemble a well-founded building or deeply-planted tree."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word 'dwell' points to a permanent indwelling of one who takes entire possession."
2. "Christ dwells in us by faith, because it is by faith we perceive His presence, His excellence and His glory."
3. "The figures are taken respectively from a tree and a building; but the former word was frequently used to indicate 'firmness at the base or foundation'."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Christ is asked to make his home in our hearts. This is the ideal, but a deal of fixing would have to be done in our hearts for Christ." 
2. "Being rooted and grounded in love." 
3. "Paul piles up metaphors (dwelling, rooted, grounded)."

### John Gill:
1. "The inhabitant Christ is he who dwells in the highest heavens, who dwells in the Father, and the Father in him, in whom all fulness dwells, the fulness of the Godhead, and the fulness of grace."
2. "It is in consequence of their union to him, and is expressive of their communion with him, and is perpetual; where he once takes up his residence, he never totally and finally departs."
3. "But saints have not always the manifestations of it, and sometimes call it in question, and have need to be rooted and grounded in it; which is to have a lively sense of it, and to be persuaded of interest in it, and that nothing shall be able to separate from it."

### John Wesley:
1. Dwell — That is, constantly and sensibly abide.
