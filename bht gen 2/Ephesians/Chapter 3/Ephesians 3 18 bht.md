# Ephesians 3:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The purpose of being rooted and grounded in love is so that believers, along with all the saints, may have a broader understanding of the vast dimensions of Christ's love. It is a love that extends across the world, embracing all people, and possesses a depth that cannot be fully comprehended by any creature. Furthermore, its height cannot be reached by any enemy. It is in this love that we find our firm foundation and deep-rooted faith.
