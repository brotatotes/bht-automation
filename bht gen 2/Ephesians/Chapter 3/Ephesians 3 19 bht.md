# Ephesians 3:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The depth of the love of Christ is unfathomable. While we can have a taste and experiential knowledge of it, it remains beyond our understanding. It is a love that is special, free, and unchanging. The goal is for us to be filled with all the fullness of God, to have a comprehensive understanding and experience of His wisdom, love, and power. This surpasses any other knowledge and exceeds all expectations. May we continually seek to know more of this extraordinary love that defies human comprehension.
