# Ephesians 3:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The love of Christ is beyond our comprehension, surpassing all knowledge and understanding. It is special, eternal, and matchless in its strength and affection. While we can have a taste of this love and a partial understanding of it, it ultimately surpasses our knowledge. Yet, despite its surpassing greatness, the apostle encourages us to seek to know more of this love, to be filled with all the fullness of God, and to experience the riches of His light, love, wisdom, holiness, power, and glory.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The paradox 'to know . . . which passeth knowledge' implies that when he says 'know,' he does not mean that we can adequately know; all we know is, that His love exceeds far our knowledge of it, and with even our fresh accessions of knowledge hereafter, will still exceed them."
2. "Filled even unto all the fulness of God (this is the grand goal), that is, filled, each according to your capacity, with the divine wisdom, knowledge, and love."
3. "Even as God is full, and as Christ who dwells in your hearts, hath 'all the fulness of the Godhead dwelling in Him bodily'."

### John Calvin:

2. "The love of Christ is held out to us as the subject which ought to occupy our daily and nightly meditations...He who is in possession of this alone has enough."

2. "The saints have some knowledge of this love, some tastes of it; their knowledge is a feeling and experimental one, fiducial and appropriating, and what influences their faith, and love, and cheerful obedience, but it is but imperfect; though the knowledge they have of it is supereminent, it exceeds all other knowledge, yet this love passes knowledge." 
3. "Now the apostle prays, that these saints might know more of this love; that their knowledge, which was imperfect, might be progressive."
