# Ephesians 3:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The phrase If, as I presume indicates that the assumption being made is based on what the readers have heard. It is not a statement of doubt, but rather a recognition of their prior knowledge. The term dispensation refers to a divine arrangement or commission, specifically in this case, the grace of God given to Paul for the purpose of sharing it with others. This reflects the divine order and command to spread the gospel, particularly to the Gentiles.
