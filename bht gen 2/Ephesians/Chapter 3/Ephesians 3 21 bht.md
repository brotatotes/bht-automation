# Ephesians 3:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The church, both on earth and in heaven, is where the glory of God is to be given. This includes the celebration of His perfections and the commendation of His works of creation and Providence. The glory of salvation, from beginning to end, is ascribed to God's free grace. Faith is to be exercised in Him as a promising and covenant-keeping God, and our lives are to be ordered by His word. The church, comprising true believers, uniquely understands the blessings and mysteries of divine grace and knows how to truly glorify God.
