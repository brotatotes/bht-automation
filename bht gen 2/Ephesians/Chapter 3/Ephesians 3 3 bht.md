# Ephesians 3:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Gospel, known as a mystery, encompasses the doctrines of the kingdom of heaven and the essence of faith. This spiritual truth was revealed to the apostle Paul through Jesus Christ and the spirit of wisdom and revelation. The mystery of the Gospel, including predestination, redemption, and salvation through grace, is expounded upon in the first two chapters of this epistle. Thus, the mystery of salvation through Christ applies to both Jews and Gentiles, as previously written in Ephesians 1:9-10.
