# Ephesians 3:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The revelation of the mystery of the Gospel, concerning the salvation of both Jews and Gentiles, was made known to the apostle Paul. This revelation was not a mere intellectual understanding, but a spiritual and transformative experience received through the revelation of Jesus Christ and the wisdom and knowledge given by the Holy Spirit. In his previous writings, Paul had already touched upon this mystery of the Gospel, including teachings on predestination, election, redemption, regeneration, and salvation by grace. The repetition of these teachings emphasizes their significance in the overall message of the Gospel.
