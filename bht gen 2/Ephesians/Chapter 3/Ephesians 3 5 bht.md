# Ephesians 3:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The mystery of the Gospel, particularly the inclusion of the Gentiles in God's plan of salvation, was not fully revealed in earlier generations. The prophets of the Old Testament did prophesy about the Gentiles coming to worship God, but they did not have the same explicit understanding as the apostles and New Testament prophets. These apostles and prophets were specially inspired by God and played a crucial role in establishing the early church. The revelation they received was necessary for the permanent establishment of the church and was made known through preaching and teaching.
