# Ephesians 3:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The mystery of the Gentiles being fellow-heirs and partakers of God's promise in Christ was not fully revealed in previous generations. The prophets in the Old Testament had some knowledge of this, but not to the extent that it has now been made known to the apostles and prophets of the New Testament. It was necessary for this revelation to be made known to establish the church and fulfill God's plan of salvation for all nations.
