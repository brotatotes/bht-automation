# Ephesians 3:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
That the Gentiles should be joint-heirs with the Jews, entitled to the same privileges and blessings of salvation, is a hidden truth that is revealed in Christ Jesus. As fellow-heirs, they belong to the family of God and are part of the same body, with Christ as the head. They are also joint-partakers of the promise through the communion of the Holy Spirit. This unity and inclusion of the Gentiles in God's plan of salvation is a testament to the power of the gospel and the grace of God.
