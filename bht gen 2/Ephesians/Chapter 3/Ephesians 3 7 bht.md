The apostle acknowledges that his calling and ministry as an ambassador of the Gospel to the Gentiles are solely due to the gift of God's grace. Without any merit or personal achievement, he has been entrusted with this important task. His appointment is a result of the powerful and effective work of God, surpassing any of his native abilities. The true essence of the grace of God is revealed in the transformation of Saul, a persecutor, into Paul, an apostle to the Gentiles.
