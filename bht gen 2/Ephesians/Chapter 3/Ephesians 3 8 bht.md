# Ephesians 3:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle's words reveal his profound humility, as he considers himself to be the least among all saints. This humble mindset is often found in the greatest of believers. When we have a deeper understanding of God's love and grace, it leads us to a place of humility. The riches of Christ are beyond measure, encompassing an abundance of blessings that are unsearchable and impossible to fully comprehend.
