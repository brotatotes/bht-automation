# Ephesians 3:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle's deep humility is evident in his declaration of being less than the least of all saints. He uses bold language to express his low opinion of himself, highlighting his unworthiness for the great calling placed upon him. This profound humility is often found in the greatest saints, as they are most aware of the immeasurable love and grace of God. Through Christ, there are boundless blessings and riches available, which are beyond comprehension. These riches encompass the grace bestowed upon believers and the glorious inheritance awaiting them.
