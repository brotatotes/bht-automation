# Ephesians 3:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The purpose of the gospel is not merely to teach men, but to enlighten them by shining the light on the fellowship of the mystery. This mystery refers to the union of Jews and Gentiles in Christ, a plan that had been concealed in the depths of God's wisdom. The revelation of this mystery through the Church demonstrates God's sovereignty as the creator of all things. It is a truth that exceeds our understanding but should be approached with reverence and admiration, for it unveils the unsearchable riches of Christ. (91 words)
