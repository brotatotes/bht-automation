# Ephesians 4:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
I therefore, as a prisoner of the Lord, urge you to walk in a manner worthy of God's calling. The apostle's imprisonment is not a reason for disregard, but rather a confirmation of his authority. Let us live in a way that reflects the great privilege we have received and the fellowship we share with Christ.
