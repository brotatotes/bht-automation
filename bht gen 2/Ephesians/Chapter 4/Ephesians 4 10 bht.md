## BHT:
He that descended is the same also that ascended above all the heavens, emphasizes the continuity of the divine Person, the Son of God, who both came down in human form and ascended to heaven. Christ's ascension is described as going far above the heavens, symbolizing His exaltation above all created realms. This exaltation was intended to fulfill the prophecies and typify the high priest's entry into the Holy of Holies. Ultimately, Christ's purpose in ascending was to fill all things, encompassing the entire church with His Spirit, presence, and divine workings.
