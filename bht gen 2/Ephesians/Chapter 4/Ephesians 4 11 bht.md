# Ephesians 4:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The divine gift of men filling the office is crucial for the unity of faith and guarding against false teachings. The office, separate from that of pastors, teachers, and prophets, emphasizes the importance of preaching. This external ministry of the word is a means through which the Lord governs and sustains His church, fostering its growth and perfection. Those appointed to this office have the responsibility of proclaiming the gospel, ensuring the existence and edification of the church. Its significance lies in the advantages it offers and its role in fulfilling God's purposes.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The â€˜objectâ€™ here is to show that he has made ample provision for the extension and edification of his church."
2. "The evangelist â€˜mayâ€™ have been one whose main business was â€˜preachingâ€™ and who was not particularly engaged in the â€˜governmentâ€™ of the church."

### John Calvin:
1. "The external ministry of the word is also commended, on account of the advantages which it yields. Certain men appointed to that office, are employed in preaching the gospel.

2. "The government of the church, by the ministry of the word, is not a contrivance of men, but an appointment made by the Son of God. As his own unalterable law, it demands our assent. They who reject or despise this ministry offer insult and rebellion to Christ its Author."
