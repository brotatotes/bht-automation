# Ephesians 4:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The ministry of the Church is a divine gift from God. He has graciously provided various ministers with specific roles and gifts for the extension and edification of the Church. These ministers, including apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers, serve to preach the Gospel, guide believers, and promote unity of faith. While New Testament church polity does not prescribe a specific form, the apostolic order of bishops, presbyters, and deacons, overseen by higher overseers, has historical support. These ministers, equipped with their unique gifts, work together to fulfill their calling, ensuring the well-being and growth of the Church.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The men who filled the office, no less than the office itself, were a divine gift."
2. "True and full unity of faith is then found, when all thoroughly know Christ, the object of faith, alike."
3. "Having been so once, [we should] be no more children, tossed and borne about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness, furthering the system of error."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The men who filled the office, no less than the office itself, were a divine gift."
2. "As the apostles, prophets, and evangelists were special and extraordinary ministers, so 'pastors and teachers' are the ordinary stated ministers of a particular flock."
3. "No one form of Church polity as permanently unalterable is laid down in the New Testament though the apostolical order of bishops, or presbyters, and deacons, superintended by higher overseers (called bishops after the apostolic times), has the highest sanction of primitive usage."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The â€˜objectâ€™ here is to show that he has made ample provision for the extension and edification of his church."
2. "The evangelist â€˜mayâ€™ have been one whose main business was â€˜preachingâ€™ and who was not particularly engaged in the â€˜governmentâ€™ of the church."
3. "The office was distinct from that of the â€˜pastor,â€™ the teacher, and the â€˜prophet:â€™ and was manifestly an office in which â€˜preachingâ€™ was the main thing."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The distinguishing features of an apostle were, a commission directly from Christ: being a witness of the resurrection: special inspiration: supreme authority: accrediting by miracles: unlimited commission to preach and to found churches."
2. "The two belong together. No man is fit to be a pastor who cannot also teach, and the teacher needs the knowledge which pastoral experience gives."

### John Calvin:
1. "The external ministry of the word is also commended, on account of the advantages which it yields. Certain men appointed to that office, are employed in preaching the gospel. This is the arrangement by which the Lord is pleased to govern his church, to maintain its existence, and ultimately to secure its highest perfection."
2. "The government of the church, by the ministry of the word, is not a contrivance of men, but an appointment made by the Son of God. As his own unalterable law, it demands our assent. They who reject or despise this ministry offer insult and rebellion to Christ its Author."
3. "The gifts bestowed on individuals are intended, not to be held for their personal and separate interests, but to be employed for the benefit of the whole. Every ground of emulation, and envy, and ambition, being thus removed."

2. "The term was sometimes loosely applied to others, especially Barnabas."
3. "The Apostle seems to have avoided the use of the technical terms then applied in the churches."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The word Ï€Î¿Î¹Î¼Î·Î½ is from a root meaning to protect." 
2. "Jesus said the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep."
3. "Here Paul groups 'shepherds and teachers' together."

### John Gill:
1. "he gave them gifts by which they were qualified to be apostles"
2. "extraordinary ones, who had a peculiar gift of interpreting the Scriptures, the prophecies of the Old Testament, and of foretelling things to come"
3. "undoubtedly Gospel ministers are meant: from the whole it may be observed, that as there have been various officers and offices in the Gospel dispensation, various gifts have been bestowed"

### John Wesley:
1. "And, among other his free gifts, he gave some apostles - His chief ministers and special witnesses, as having seen him after his resurrection, and received their commission immediately from him."

3. "Some pastors â€” Watching over their several flocks.And some teachers â€” Whether of the same or a lower order, to assist them, as occasion might require."
