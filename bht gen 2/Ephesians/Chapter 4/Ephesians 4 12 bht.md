## BHT:
The goal of the ministry of the word is to perfect and complete the saints, both in number and in their various gifts and graces.

2. "perfecting—The Greek implies correcting in all that is deficient, instructing and completing in number and all parts."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is that Christians may have every possible advantage for becoming complete in love, and knowledge, and order."
2. "But is it not clear from this that Christ did not appoint 'merely' three orders of clergy to be permanent in the church? ... The presumption is rather that he meant that there should be but one permanent order of ministers."
3. "In founding churches among the pagan, and in instructing and governing them there, there is need of reviving nearly all the offices of teacher, helper, evangelist, etc., which Paul has enumerated as actually existing in his time."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "For the perfecting, see on mending, Matthew 4:21; perfected, Matthew 21:16; Luke 6:40; 1 Peter 5:10. Compare 1 Corinthians 1:10; Hebrews 13:21."
2. "The prevailing sense of diakonia ministry, in the New Testament, is spiritual service of an official character. See Acts 1:25; Acts 6:4; Acts 20:24; Romans 11:13; 1 Timothy 1:12; 2 Timothy 4:5."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Greek word employed by Paul is καταρτισμός, which signifies literally the adaptation of things possessing symmetry and proportion; just as, in the human body, the members are united in a proper and regular manner; so that the word comes to signify perfection."
2. "Our true completeness and perfection consist in our being united in the one body of Christ. No language more highly commendatory of the ministry of the word could have been employed, than to ascribe to it this effect."
