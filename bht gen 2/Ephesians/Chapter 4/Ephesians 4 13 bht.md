# Ephesians 4:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The goal for all believers is to reach a complete agreement in our understanding of Christian doctrine and to have a personal, experiential knowledge of Christ as the Son of God. This unity of faith and knowledge is necessary for us to grow and mature spiritually, both in our understanding and strength. Ultimately, our aim is to reach a level of spiritual maturity where we are filled with Christ and He becomes the all-consuming focus in our lives.
