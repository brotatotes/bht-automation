# Ephesians 4:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through the gospel ministry, believers are called to come together in a complete unity of faith and knowledge about Christ. This unity involves not only agreeing on the Christian doctrine but also experiencing a personal knowledge of Christ as the Son of God. The goal is for believers to reach a state of spiritual maturity, where they have a deep understanding and strength in their faith. This maturity is symbolized by the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ, where believers are filled with Christ, making Him their all in all.
