# Ephesians 4:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are warned not to remain children in their understanding and faith, constantly susceptible to the influence of false teachings. Just as ships without a fixed course are tossed about by every wind, those who lack solid knowledge of Christ are easily swayed by the changing philosophies and doctrines of others. These deceitful teachings, presented with cunning and manipulation, aim to lead believers astray and cloud their judgment. It is crucial to anchor oneself in the truth of God's Word and be discerning, as the enemies of Christ employ clever tactics to deceive and mislead.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The various teachings are the 'winds' which keep them tossed on a sea of doubts."
2. "The player frames his throws of the dice so that the numbers may turn up which best suit his purpose."
3. "Craftiness tending to the methodized system of deceit."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "But children have other characteristics besides simplicity and docility. They are often changeable...influenced easily by others, and led astray." 
2. "The idea is that of a vessel on the restless ocean, that is tossed about with every varying wind...So many persons are in regard to religious doctrines...they yield to every new opinion, and submit to the guidance of every new teacher."
3. "A man who forms his religious principles by chance, can un 'form' them in the same way...allowing yourself to be influenced by them without any settled principles."
4. "People would use plausible pretences, and would, if possible, deceive the professed friends of Christ. Against such we should be on our guard; and not by their arts should our opinion be formed, but by the word of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Ver. 14 is subordinate to ver. 13, as is shown by the retention of the same figure, and is remotely dependent on vers 11, 12. The remote end, ver. 13, is placed before the more immediate one, as in ver. 12."
2. "The different teachings of philosophers or of religious quacks are represented as winds, blowing the unstable soul in every direction."
3. "Error organizes. It has its systems and its logic. Ellicott remarks that here it is almost personified."

### John Calvin:
1. "Those are 'children' who have not yet advanced a step in the way of the Lord, but who still hesitate, — who have not yet determined what road they ought to choose, but move sometimes in one direction and sometimes in another, always doubtful, always wavering."
2. "The distressing hesitation of those who do not place absolute reliance on the word of the Lord, is illustrated by two striking metaphors. The first is taken from small ships, exposed to the fury of the billows in the open sea, holding no fixed course, guided neither by skill nor design, but hurried along by the violence of the tempest."
3. "When Papists avail themselves of the disguise of the church for burying doctrine, they give sufficient proof that they have a diabolical synagogue."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Some Christians are quite content to remain 'babes' in Christ and never cut their eye-teeth... the victims of every charlatan who comes along." 
2. "If not anchored by full knowledge of Christ, folks are at the mercy of these squalls."
3. "Paul has covered the whole ground in this picture of Gnostic error."

### John Gill:
1. "That we henceforth be no more children....in such sense children, as they were when first converted, newborn babes, little children."
2. "But not in understanding; they should not always remain ignorant, imprudent, or be always fed with milk, and not able to digest meat; nor be unable to go unless led, and be tender and incapable of bearing hardships for Christ and his Gospel, and of defending it, and his cause and interest; but should play the man, and quit themselves as such and be strong."
3. "To be tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine...implies hesitation, and doubts and scruples, and shows credulity, fickleness, and inconstancy."

### John Wesley:
1. "Fluctuating to and fro — From within, even when there is no wind."
2. "And carried about with every wind — From without; when we are assaulted by others, who are unstable as the wind."
3. "By the sleight of men — By their 'cogging the dice;' so the original word implies."
