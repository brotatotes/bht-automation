# Ephesians 4:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Growing in every department of our spiritual journey, we are to be followers of truth in love. Speaking the truth, not just in words, but in our actions and manner, we aim to avoid error and lead others to truth. As we incorporate ourselves more and more with Christ, our Head, we become one with him and strive towards the stature of a complete person in him. This growth is possible because Christ is the truth, and as we speak and live in truth, we are drawn closer to his image and Spirit.

2. "(2) The second thing is, that the truth should be spoken 'in love.' There are other ways of speaking truth. It is sometimes spoken in a harsh, crabby, sour manner, which does nothing but disgust and offend."

1. "Speaking the truth [αληθευοντες]. Only here and Galatians 4:16. In classical Greek it means to be true, to arrive at truth, and to speak truth." 
2. "Here the idea is rather that of being or walking in truth."
3. "The parallel construction, tossed and carried about in the sleight, in craftiness, speaking truth in love, favors the A. V. and Rev., as does the awkwardness of speaking truth standing alone."

1. "The truth of God ought to have such a firm hold of us, that all the contrivances and attacks of Satan shall not draw us from our course."

3. "If each individual, instead of attending exclusively to his own concerns, shall desire mutual intercourse, there will be agreeable and general progress. Such, the Apostle assures us, must be the nature of this harmony, that men shall not be suffered to forget the claims of truth, or, disregarding them, to frame an agreement according to their own views."
