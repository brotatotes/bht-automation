# Ephesians 4:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Growth in the Christian faith is not simply about acquiring knowledge or adhering to certain behaviors. It is a transformative process where believers become more and more like Christ, both in character and in their relationship with him. This growth involves speaking and living out the truth in love, following the example of Christ himself. As we grow in our understanding of the truth and in our love for God and others, we become more deeply united with Christ and reflect his image more fully.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἀληθεύοντες ἐν ἀγάπῃ" - being followers of truth in love.
2. "in all things wherein we grow" - in every department of our growth.
3. "who is the Head, namely, Christ" - the Head, the Christ.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Truth in word and act, love in manner and spirit, are the Christian's rule."
2. "There is growth only in the spiritually alive, not in the dead."
3. "More and more incorporated with Him, and become one with Him."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "(1) The truth is 'to be spoken' - the simple, unvarnished truth. This is the way to avoid error, and this is the way to preserve others from error."
2. "(2) The second thing is, that the truth should be spoken 'in love.' There are other ways of speaking truth. It is sometimes spoken in a harsh, crabby, sour manner, which does nothing but disgust and offend."
3. "May grow up into him - Into Christ; that is, to the stature of a complete man in him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Speaking the truth [αληθευοντες]. Only here and Galatians 4:16. In classical Greek it means to be true, to arrive at truth, and to speak truth." 
2. "Here the idea is rather that of being or walking in truth."
3. "The parallel construction, tossed and carried about in the sleight, in craftiness, speaking truth in love, favors the A. V. and Rev., as does the awkwardness of speaking truth standing alone."

### John Calvin:
1. "The truth of God ought to have such a firm hold of us, that all the contrivances and attacks of Satan shall not draw us from our course."
2. "A healthful condition of the church requires that Christ alone 'must increase,' and all others 'must decrease.' Whatever increase we obtain must be regulated in such a manner, that we shall remain in our own place, and contribute to exalt the head."
3. "If each individual, instead of attending exclusively to his own concerns, shall desire mutual intercourse, there will be agreeable and general progress. Such, the Apostle assures us, must be the nature of this harmony, that men shall not be suffered to forget the claims of truth, or, disregarding them, to frame an agreement according to their own views."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In love. If truth were always spoken only in love!" 
2. "May grow into him. It is the metaphor of verse Ephesians 4:13 (the full-grown man). We are the body and Christ is the Head. We are to grow up to his stature."

### John Gill:
1. "Either Christ himself, who is the truth, and is to be preached, and always spoken of with strong affection and love."
2. "The Gospel, the word of truth, so called in opposition to that which is false and fictitious."
3. "The work of grace upon the soul is a gradual work, and an increase of this in the exercise of faith, hope, love, and spiritual knowledge, is a growth."

### John Wesley:
1. Into him — Into his image and Spirit, and into a full union with him.
