# Ephesians 4:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The body of believers is intricately arranged and unified, with each member contributing to its growth and strength. This unity is not of human achievement, but is brought about by the Spirit of God Himself. Through the bond of love, the church is built up and strengthened, with each member finding their rightful place and purpose. As the body is fitted together and compacted, the collective effort of every joint supplies what is needed for the growth of the whole. This harmonious cooperation ensures that the body of Christ continues to increase and thrive.
