# Ephesians 4:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The church, which is the body of Christ, finds its unity and growth from the Lord Himself. The members of this body are fitted together in perfect harmony, each part contributing to the health and well-being of the whole. It is through the Spirit of God that this union is formed, and it is sustained by the love and support that each member provides to one another. This results in a constant increase and edification of the body, as each joint supplies what is needed for its growth and flourishing.
