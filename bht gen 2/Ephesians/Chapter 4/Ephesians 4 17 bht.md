# Ephesians 4:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle solemnly testifies, in the name and authority of the Lord Jesus, that believers should no longer walk in the vanity of their mind. This refers to the emptiness and destitution of the mind, which naturally lacks God, the knowledge of God, and faith in Jesus Christ. Continuing in this vanity would be foolish, resembling those who have never known the truth. It is evident in the foolish thoughts, worldly pursuits, and sinful actions that stem from it. Therefore, believers are urged to repent, turn away from this empty way of thinking and living, and embrace the truth and guidance of God.
