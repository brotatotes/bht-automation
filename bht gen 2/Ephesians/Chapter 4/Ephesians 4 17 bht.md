# Ephesians 4:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Therefore, I testify in the Lord that we should no longer walk in the vanity of our mind. It is important that we remember the lost state of our original condition, when God was our Life and Light, before the darkness entered our human nature. This is why we must strive to walk worthy of our calling and not be entangled in the worthless pursuits of idolatry. Let us reject the emptiness of our intellect and instead focus on the truth and grace of God, for it is through Him that we find fulfillment and purpose.
