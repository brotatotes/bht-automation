# Ephesians 4:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Human understanding is described as being darkened and ignorant, lacking both intellectual and spiritual clarity. This state stems from being separated from the life of God, resulting in a deep-rooted ignorance and a hardened heart. It is a state void of God's light and knowledge of His will, completely alienated from the divine and spiritual life. This ignorance and hardness of heart are intertwined, as a callous and senseless heart cannot truly experience life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Being darkened in their understanding, that is, their intelligence, or perceptions."
2. "Alienated... imply that before the fall they had been partakers of life and light."
3. "Spiritual life in believers is kindled from the life itself of God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A man who indulges in low vices will weaken his mental powers, and render himself incapable of intellectual effort."
2. "If a man wishes to be blessed with a clear understanding, he should be a 'good man.'"
3. "The way to elevate the understandings of mankind is to purify the heart. Let people 'feel' right toward God, and they will soon 'think' right; let the heart be pure, and the understanding will be clear."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The life which God bestows; life in Christ."
2. "Through the ignorance. The cause of the alienation."
3. "The participle of the substantive verb expresses the deep-seated, indwelling character of the ignorance."

### John Calvin:
1. "Our ordinary life, as men, is nothing more than an empty image of life, not only because it quickly passes, but also because, while we live, our souls, not keeping close to God, are dead."
2. "There are three kinds of life in this world. The first is animal life, which consists only of motion and the bodily senses, and which we have in common with the brutes; the second is human life, which we have as the children of Adam; and the third is that supernatural life, which believers alone obtain."
3. "The regeneration of believers is here called, by way of eminence, the life of God, because then does God truly live in us, and we enjoy his life, when he governs us by his Spirit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Being darkened in their understanding. The participle points to a condition which has been effected in the past, and the seat of this darkened condition was the intellectual part of our nature."
2. "Being alienated from the life of God... ‘The life of God’ means the true spiritual life which belongs to God, and which He bestows on men. The two clauses stand related, the one is the internal condition, the other the external result."
3. "Because of the ignorance... This is an ‘ignorance’ which is now natural and peculiar to them. It is the ground of the darkening of the understanding... the ignorance peculiar to heathenism was the ground of growing mental obscuration."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Being darkened (εσκοτωμενο οντες)."
2. "In their understanding (τη διανοια)."
3. "Hardening (πωρωσιν)."


### John Gill:
1. "Not that the natural faculty of the understanding is lost in men, nor the understanding in things natural and civil, and which is quick enough, especially in things that are evil; but in things spiritual it is very dark and ignorant..."
2. "Wicked and unconverted men are alienated from this life; they are estranged from God the fountain of it; and go astray from the law, the rule of an holy life; and are entirely destitute of a principle of life..."
3. "Every unregenerate man is an ignorant man, and especially the Gentiles were very ignorant of God, and of divine things; ignorance is natural to men, it comes by sin, and is itself sinful..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Having their understanding darkened, through the ignorance that is in them — So that they are totally void of the light of God, neither have they any knowledge of his will."
2. "Being alienated from the life of God — Utter strangers to the divine, the spiritual life."
3. "Through the hardness of their hearts — Callous and senseless. And where there is no sense, there can be no life."
