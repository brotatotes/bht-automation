# Ephesians 4:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Wicked and unconverted individuals have their understanding darkened through ignorance, resulting in a complete lack of knowledge and insight into God's will. They are alienated from the life of God, completely disconnected from the divine and spiritual realm. This is due to the hardness of their hearts, as their callousness and lack of sensitivity creates a void where there can be no sense or life.

2. "Wicked and unconverted men are alienated from this life; they are estranged from God the fountain of it; and go astray from the law, the rule of an holy life; and are entirely destitute of a principle of life..."
3. "Every unregenerate man is an ignorant man, and especially the Gentiles were very ignorant of God, and of divine things; ignorance is natural to men, it comes by sin, and is itself sinful..."
