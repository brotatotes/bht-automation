# Ephesians 4:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who are past feeling have become completely hardened in their sin, without any sense of guilt or shame. This state of being is the result of a gradual process of heart-hardening, where their consciences are seared and they are blinded to the consequences of their actions. They willingly give themselves over to their sinful desires, lacking any self-control or restraint. Their pursuit of these desires is marked by greediness and a disregard for the moral boundaries that should guide their behavior.
