# Ephesians 4:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The individuals being described here have undergone a process of hardening in sin that has led to a state of being completely devoid of moral sensitivity. They have reached a point where they no longer experience the pain or conviction that comes from a guilty conscience. As a consequence, they have become indifferent to the consequences of their sinful actions, living a life driven by an insatiable desire for more and more sin. This uncontrolled pursuit of all forms of impurity and debauchery reveals their utter lack of restraint and disregard for moral boundaries.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The obduration described may spring in ordinary life from despair."
2. "Certainly despair has nothing to do with the matter here, but rather the carrying on of the πώρωσις to positive ἀπάλγησις by the increasing habit of sin."
3. "πλεονεξία, the desire of having more, is obviously a wider vice than mere covetousness, though this latter is generally its prominent form."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Past feeling—senseless, shameless, hopeless; the ultimate result of a long process of 'hardening,' or habit of sin."
2. "Their giving themselves to it was punished in kind, God giving them up to it by withdrawing His preventing grace."
3. "It does not necessarily include lasciviousness; but it means intemperate, reckless readiness for it, and for every self-indulgence."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Who being past feeling - Wholly hardened in sin. There is a total want of all emotion on moral subjects."
2. "He has no 'feeling,' no emotion. He often gives an intellectual assent to the truth, but it is without emotion of any kind."
3. "They have done it voluntarily. Whatever was the agency of God in it, they preferred it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Where men persistently give themselves up to evil, God gives them up to its power."
2. "They gave themselves up as to the prosecution of a business."
3. "In an eager grasping after more and more uncleanness."

### John Calvin:
1. "Having destroyed the sensibilities of the heart, and allayed the stings of remorse, they abandon themselves to all manner of iniquity."
2. "The gnawing of a guilty conscience, tormented by the dread of the Divine judgment, may be compared to the porch of hell; but such hardened security as this — is a whirlpool which swallows up and destroys."
3. "Lasciviousness appears to me to denote that wantonness with which the flesh indulges in intemperance and licentiousness, when not restrained by the Spirit of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Being past feeling. One word in Greek, meaning to be unsusceptible of pain, and in this connection, referring to moral pain, not feeling the punishment of conscience."
2. "Gave themselves up. The same verb is used in Romans 1:24 of the other side of the matter: ‘God gave them up,’ etc. Here, where ‘themselves’ is the emphatic word, the freedom and guilt of men is described. The two are not antagonistic ‘Self-abandonment to deeper sin is the Divine judicial penalty of sin’ (Eadie)."
3. "To wantonness. The term, derived from the verb meaning to overeat, refers to an unbridled course of conduct, defying public decency, not to any special sin of sensuality. As however sensuality is always implied, ‘wantonness ‘fairly expresses the sense."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Being past feeling (απηλγηκοτες). Perfect active participle of απαλγεω, old word to cease to feel pain, only here in N.T."
2. "To lasciviousness (τη ασελγεια). Unbridled lust as in 2 Corinthians 12:21; Galatians 5:19."
3. "With greediness (εν πλεονεξια). From πλεονεκτης, one who always wants more whether money or sexual indulgence as here. The two vices are often connected in the N.T."

### John Gill:
1. "Their consciences being cauterized or seared as with a red-hot iron, which is the consequence of judicial hardness."
2. "They have lost all sense of sin, and do not feel the load of its guilt upon them."
3. "They stand in no fear of a future judgment, which they ridicule and despise."

### John Wesley:
1. "Who being past feeling pain." 
2. "Pain urges the sick to seek a remedy, which, where there is no pain, is little thought of."
3. "Lasciviousness is but one branch of uncleanness, which implies impurity of every kind."
