# Ephesians 4:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In cultivating brotherly kindness, we begin with humility, thinking truly and lowly of ourselves. We lay aside haughtiness and self-centeredness to become meek and gentle, showing moderation and forgiveness to others. This requires longsuffering, patiently bearing with the weaknesses and faults of our brethren. As we remember that our privileges are evidence of God's patience, we practice forbearance and love, creating opportunities for others to do the same. Walking in humility, meekness, and longsuffering reflects our obedience to God's will and the example of Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "the Gospel has elevated the word to express a Christian grace, namely, the esteeming of ourselves small, inasmuch as we are so; the thinking truly, and because truly, therefore lowlily, of ourselves." 
2. "meeknessâ€”that spirit in which we accept God's dealings with us without disputing and resisting; and also the accepting patiently of the injuries done us by men, out of the thought that they are permitted by God for the chastening and purifying of His people."
3. "It is only the lowly, humble heart that is also meek (Colossians 3:12)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The idea is, that humility of mind becomes those who are 'called'...and that we walk worthy of that calling when we evince it."
2. "We adorn the gospel when we show its power in enabling us to bear injuries without anger or a desire of revenge, or with a mild and forgiving spirit."
3. "It is in such gentle and quiet virtues as meekness and forbearance, that the happiness and usefulness of life consist, far more than in brilliant eloquence, in splendid talent, or illustrious deeds."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Lowiness - meekness. See on Matthew 11:29; Matthew 5:5. Long - suffering. See on James 5:7. Forbearing [Î±Î½ÎµÏ‡Î¿Î¼ÎµÎ½Î¿Î¹] . See on Luke 9:41.

### John Calvin:
1. "Let us remember, therefore, that, in cultivating brotherly kindness, we must begin with humility."
2. "By laying aside haughtiness and a desire of pleasing ourselves, we shall become meek and gentle, and acquire that moderation of temper which will overlook and forgive many things in the conduct of our brethren."
3. "Forbearing one another in love. This agrees with what is elsewhere taught, that 'love suffereth long and is kind.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The former is humility: â€˜the esteeming ourselves small, inasmuch as we are so; the thinking truly, lowlily of ourselvesâ€™."
2. "'Longsuffering' means, not taking swift vengeance, not inflicting speedy punishment, though it sometimes has the more general sense of 'forbearance.' It is meekness toward the sins of others, and the more difficult to exercise because justice seems at times to be against it is promoted by recalling that we were called when sinners, that all our privileges are proofs of Godâ€™s longsuffering."
3. "This clause defines the walk still further, but is in reality a vivacious setting forth of how 'longsuffering' is exhibited. 'One another' suggests that each one who forbears gives occasion to others for forbearance."

### John Gill:
1. "In the exercise of humility, which shows itself in believers, in entertaining and expressing the meanest thoughts of themselves, and the best of others."
2. "To walk humbly before God and man, is to walk according to the will of God that calls; and it is walking as Christ walked, who is meek, and lowly; and is agreeable to the blessed Spirit, one of whose fruits is meekness."
3. "With longsuffering; bearing much and long with the infirmities of each other; without being easily provoked to anger by any ill usage; and not immediately meditating and seeking revenge for every affront given, or injury done."
