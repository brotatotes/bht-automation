# Ephesians 4:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In cultivating brotherly kindness, we must begin with humility, by laying aside haughtiness and a desire of pleasing ourselves. We shall become meek and gentle, acquiring a moderation of temper that overlooks and forgives many things. In walking humbly before God and man, we follow the will of God and imitate Christ, who is meek and lowly. This is necessary for the exercise of humility, which shows itself in believers by entertaining and expressing the meanest thoughts of themselves and the best of others. Bearing with each other's infirmities and showing longsuffering is an essential part of brotherly love.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "the Gospel has elevated the word to express a Christian grace, namely, the esteeming of ourselves small, inasmuch as we are so; the thinking truly, and because truly, therefore lowlily, of ourselves." 
2. "meekness—that spirit in which we accept God's dealings with us without disputing and resisting; and also the accepting patiently of the injuries done us by men, out of the thought that they are permitted by God for the chastening and purifying of His people."
3. "It is only the lowly, humble heart that is also meek (Colossians 3:12)."
