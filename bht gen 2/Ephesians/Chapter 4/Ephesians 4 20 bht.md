# Ephesians 4:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Regenerate persons are not like others, they do not walk in vain and empty thoughts, but are filled with God. They have truly learned Christ and know Him as God and Savior. This knowledge of Christ teaches them to live differently from others, to deny ungodliness and to live righteously and godly. The Christian life does not allow for sin, and understanding this truth should shape how we live.
