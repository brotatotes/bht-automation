# Ephesians 4:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Regenerate individuals, having learned Christ, have a different way of life compared to others. Their minds are not empty and vain, but instead filled with the knowledge of God. They understand Christ as the Lord and heir of all things, the Alpha and Omega of the covenant of grace, and as the Saviour of sinners. This knowledge compels them to live differently, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, and instead leading lives of sobriety, righteousness, and godliness. Sin is not permitted in the Christian life, as the Christian dispensation forbids it.
