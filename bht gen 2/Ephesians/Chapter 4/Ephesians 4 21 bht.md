# Ephesians 4:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through the Gospel message, you have not simply listened to Christ preaching, but you have received the truth that is found in Jesus Himself. This truth is not heard merely with the ears, but it brings about true faith, spiritual conviction, and a genuine assurance of our relationship with Him. It is by His Spirit and through His ministers that we are taught and directed to Christ for righteousness, pardon, cleansing, and all the grace we need. Therefore, let the truth that is in Jesus guide and transform your life, standing in direct opposition to the ways of the world.
