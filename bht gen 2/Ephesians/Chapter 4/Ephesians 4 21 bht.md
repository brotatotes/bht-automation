# Ephesians 4:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If you have truly heard and received the teachings of Jesus, not just externally but with spiritual conviction, illumination, and genuine faith, you have been taught by him through his Spirit and ministers. Jesus himself is the embodiment of truth, and his gospel is pure and unmixed. As you continue to be taught by him, remember to walk in accordance with the truth he has revealed, living in direct opposition to the ways of the world.
