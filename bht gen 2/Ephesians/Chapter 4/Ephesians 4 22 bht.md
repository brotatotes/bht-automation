# Ephesians 4:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To experience true transformation, we must let go of our old nature and embrace the new life in Christ. This requires putting aside the old man, symbolizing our sinful desires that deceive us with empty promises of pleasure and fulfillment. The old man represents the inherent corruption we are born with, but through Christ, we can be reborn and put off this sinful nature. The deceitful lusts serve as tools of corruption, leading us astray. Let us be aware of the deceptive nature of these desires and choose to walk in the truth and righteousness that comes from following Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "That ye put off...the old man...which is being corrupted according to the lusts of deceit."
2. "The lusts...are the servants, the instruments of deceit."
3. "Beware of the unsatisfactory hendiadys, 'deceitful lusts,' E.V., which destroys the whole force and beauty of the contrast below to the holiness of the truth."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The old man—your old unconverted nature (Romans 6:6)."
2. "Deceit is personified; lusts are its servants and tools."
3. "Corruption and destruction are inseparably associated together."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That ye put off - That you lay aside, or renounce. The manner in which the apostle states those duties, renders it not improbable that there had been some instruction among them of a contrary character, and that it is possible there had been some teachers there who had not enforced, as they should have done, the duties of practical religion."
2. "The special characteristics of an unconverted man you are to put off, and are to assume those which are the proper fruits of a renewed heart."
3. "All the passions and pleasures of the world are illusive. They promise more than they perform; and they leave their deluded votaries to disappointment and to tears. Nothing is more 'deceitful' than the promised pleasures of this world; and all who yield to them find at last that they 'flatter but to betray.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "That ye put away. Dependent upon ye were taught, and specifying the purport of the teaching."
2. "The old man. See on Romans 6:6. Compare Colossians 3:9. Which is corrupt [τον φθειρομενον] . The A. V. misses the force of the participle. The verb is passive, which is being corrupted, and marks the progressive condition of corruption which characterizes 'the old man.'"
3. "According to the deceitful lusts [κατα τας επιθυμιας της απατης] . Rev., correctly, lusts of deceit. On the vicious rendering of similar phrases in A. V., see on ch. Ephesians 1:19. Deceit is personified."

### John Calvin:
1. "He demands from a Christian man repentance, or a new life, which he makes to consist of self-denial and the regeneration of the Holy Spirit."
2. "The old man,...means the natural disposition which we bring with us from our mother's womb."
3. "As we are born again in Christ, the amendment of this sinful nature is called the New man."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The emphasis is on the verb, which is used of throwing off garments."
2. "This putting off of the old man is indispensable, because in their former way of life this old man was, as it were, the garment in which they were clothed."
3. "It is 'old,' because it is regarded as condemned, done away, and in Romans 6:6 is spoken of as 'crucified.'"
4. "The idea of growing corruption was probably suggested by the figure of putting off an old garment."
5. "Sin being characterized as deceit because of its power of deceiving."
6. "These 'lusts' are the instruments which carry on the process of corruption, and their agency is so potent, because the subjects are deceived as to the true character of the desires they cherish."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "That ye put away (αποθεσθα). Second aorist middle infinitive of αποτιθημ with the metaphor of putting off clothing or habits as αποθεσθε in Colossians 3:8 (which see) with the same addition of 'the old man' (τον παλαιον ανθρωπον) as in Colossians 3:9."
2. "For αναστροφην (manner of life) see Galatians 1:13."
3. "Which waxeth corrupt (τον φθειρομενον). Either present middle or passive participle of φθειρω, but it is a process of corruption (worse and worse)."

### John Gill:
1. "The change lies not in the old man, who can never be altered, but in the conversation."
2. "He is put off, but he is not put out; and though he does not reign, he rages, and often threatens to get the ascendant."
3. "The old man, or the vitiosity of nature, has its lusts; and these are deceitful; they promise pleasure and profit, but yield neither in the issue."

### John Wesley:
1. "All sinful desires are deceitful; promising the happiness which they cannot give."
2. "The old man - That is, the whole body of sin."
3. "All sinful desires are deceitful; promising the happiness which they cannot give."
