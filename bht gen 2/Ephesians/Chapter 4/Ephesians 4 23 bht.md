# Ephesians 4:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are called to be renewed in the spirit of their mind, allowing the Holy Spirit to transform the very depths of their hearts. This renewal of the mind is an ongoing process that gradually shapes believers into the image of God, as they are continually being renewed day by day through the work of the Holy Spirit.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The process here insisted on is one carried on by the Spirit of God, not by themselves."
2. "The distinction between ἀνακαίνωσις and ἀνανέωσις is important. The reference in καινός (novus) to the objective is prominent, in νέος (recens) to the subjective."
3. "The disciples of Christ are ἀνανεούμενοι, undergoing a process of renewal in the life of God, by the agency of the πνεῦμα of their minds, the restored and divinely-informed leading principle of their νοῦς."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The continued renewal in the youth of the new man."
2. "By the Spirit of your mind, that is, by your new spiritual nature; the restored and divinely informed leading principle of the mind."
3. "The 'spirit' of man in New Testament is only then used in its proper sense, as worthy of its place and governing functions, when it is one spirit with the Lord."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The spirit is the human spirit, having its seat in and directing the mind."
2. "The apostle's object is to set forth the moral self-activity of the Christian life."
3. "The renewal takes place, not in the mind, but in the spirit of it."

### John Calvin:
1. "Be renewed, not only with respect to the inferior appetites or desires, which are manifestly sinful, but with respect also to that part of the soul which is reckoned most noble and excellent."
2. "And here again, he brings forward to view that Queen which philosophers are accustomed almost to adore."
3. "How much there is in us that is sound or uncorrupted may be easily gathered from this passage, which enjoins us to correct chiefly the reason or mind, in which we are apt to imagine that there is nothing but what is virtuous and deserves commendation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The paradox is frequent in the Scriptures, and need occasion no practical difficulty."
