# Ephesians 4:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The process of renewal mentioned here is carried out by the Spirit of God, not by humans. It is a renewal that affects not only the inferior desires but also the noble and excellent part of the soul. This renewal takes place not in the mind alone, but in the human spirit, specifically the seat and director of the mind. It is a process that requires the intervention of the Holy Spirit, who is the author of renovation in the believers and the source of spiritual light, knowledge, life, strength, joy, comfort, and grace.
