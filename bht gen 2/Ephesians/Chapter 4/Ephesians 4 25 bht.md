# Ephesians 4:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers, having been transformed by putting off our old sinful nature and being made new in Christ, are called to walk in a way that aligns with this new identity. This includes speaking truthfully and abstaining from deceit in our interactions with one another. Lying not only contradicts the righteousness and holiness we have embraced, but it also undermines the unity and trust within the body of Christ. We are intricately connected as members of one another, and falsehood has no place among us. Let us therefore commit to speaking the truth and upholding the integrity of our shared faith.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Having put off falsehood...the man must have once for all put off falsehood as a characteristic before he enters the habit of speaking truth." 
2. "Speak truth each one with his neighbour...our inner connection with one another as á¼€Î»Î»Î®Î»Ï‰Î½ Î¼Î­Î»Î·."
3. "For we are members of one another...all mutual duties of Christians are grounded on their union to and in Christ, and not on mere ethical considerations."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The new man will necessarily result in particular features."
2. "Union to one another in Christ, not merely the external command, instinctively leads Christians to fulfill mutual duties."
3. "One member could not injure or deceive another, without injuring himself, as all have a mutual and common interest."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The effects of former habits abide long, often, after a man is converted."
2. "No professing Christian can do any good who has not an unimpeachable character for integrity and truth."
3. "Falsehood tends to loosen the bonds of brotherhood."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Members one of another." Compare Romans 12:5; 1 Corinthians 12:12-27.
2. "Let not the eye lie to the foot, nor the foot to the eye."
3. "If there be a deep pit, and its mouth covered with reeds shall present to the eye the appearance of solid ground, will not the eye use the foot to ascertain whether it is hollow underneath, or whether it is firm and resists?"

### John Calvin:
1. "From this head of doctrine, that is, from the righteousness of the new man, all godly exhortations flow, like streams from a fountain."
2. "Having concluded from the truth of the gospel, that righteousness and holiness ought to be true, he now argues from the general statement to a particular instance, that every man should speak truth with his neighbor."
3. "He demands that every kind of communication between them shall be sincere; and enforces it by this consideration, for we are members one of another."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The mention of â€˜truthâ€™ (Ephesians 4:24) seems to have suggested this precept. But lying is a fundamental vice. It comes from the devil (comp. John 8:44). The motive with which the verse closes shows that it is inconsistent with love, and a lie spoken out of love is still a lie."
2. "Falsehood includes deceptive acts and looks, and this single precept, if obeyed, would revolutionize many a community, and destroy some kinds of business."
3. "For we are members one of another. Comp. Romans 12:5-8; 1 Corinthians 12:15-27. More than members of human society, and hence mutually dependent; in close fellowship as holding the same views and laboring for the same end; as members of the body of Christ we become members of one another; as He is true, we should be truthful."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Because of putting off the old man, and putting on the new man." 
2. "Lying in direct contrast with truth." 
3. "Each one, in partitive apposition with Î»Î±Î»ÎµÎ¹Ï„Îµ."

### John Gill:
1. "A lie is a voluntary disagreement of the mind and speech, with a design to deceive; it is to speak that which is false, contrary to truth shining in the mind; and it is spoken knowingly and willingly, and with a design to impose upon others..."
2. "It is a sin exceeding sinful; it is a breach of God's law; an aping of the devil; it is against the light of nature, and is destructive of civil society, and very abominable in the sight of God."
3. "...should not attempt to deceive one another by lying, since there is such a near relation and close union of one to another."

### John Wesley:
1. "Seeing ye are thus created anew, walk accordingly, in every particular."
2. "For we are members one of another."
3. "To which intimate union all deceit is quite repugnant."
