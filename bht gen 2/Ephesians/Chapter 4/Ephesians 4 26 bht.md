# Ephesians 4:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When faced with anger, it is important to remember that there is a distinction between righteous anger and sinfulness. Righteous anger is directed at sin itself, not at the person committing the sin, and should be accompanied by a sense of pity for the sinner. However, we must be cautious not to let our anger extend beyond the fault and onto the person, as this is when we cross the line into sin. Instead, we are encouraged to address the issue with our brother and seek immediate reconciliation, not allowing a single day to pass in unresolved anger.

2. "Anger may be excited against a 'thing' as well as a 'person'; as well against an act as a 'man.' We are suddenly excited by a wrong 'thing,' without any malignancy against the 'man;' we may wish to rebuke or chide 'that,' without injuring 'him.'"
3. "When the sun sets on a man's anger, he may be sure it is wrong."

### Marvin Vincent:
