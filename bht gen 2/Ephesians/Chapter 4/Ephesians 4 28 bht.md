# Ephesians 4:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who once engaged in theft or fraudulent behavior are urged to cease such actions. The transition from a life of dishonesty to one of integrity involves actively participating in productive and honorable work. By toiling diligently with their own hands, individuals not only support themselves but also acquire resources to share with those in need. This passage emphasizes the moral responsibility of Christians to live in a manner that benefits others, rather than exploiting or taking advantage of them. It encourages a shift from self-centeredness to compassion and generosity, cultivating a community characterized by righteousness and mutual care.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Let him that stealeth steal no longer, but rather let him labor, working with his hands that which is good." (Commentary: "The word lies between ÎºÎ»Î­ÏˆÎ±Ï‚ and ÎºÎ»Î­Ï€Ï„Î·Ï‚: the former would be too mild, the latter too strong.")
2. "Let him labor, working with his hands that which is good, in order that he may have to impart to him that has need." (Commentary: "As a purpose to be set before every Christian in his honest labour.")
3. "Let him that stealeth steal no longer, but rather let him labor, working with his hands that which is good, in order that he may have to impart to him that has need." (Commentary: "Antitheton ad furtum prius manu piceata commissum.")

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Let the stealing person steal no more." Bandits frequented the mountains near Ephesus. Such are meant by those called "thieves" in the New Testament. 
2. "It is not enough to cease from a sin, but the sinner must also enter on the path that is its very opposite."
3. "The thief, when repentant, should labor more than he would be called on to do, if he had never stolen."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The object of the apostle was to show that the gospel requires holy living in all its friends, and to entreat Christians at Ephesus in a special manner to avoid the vices of the surrounding pagan."
2. "Christians should have some 'useful' and 'honest' employment. They should work 'that which is good.'"
3. "The main business of a Christian is not to 'make money' and to become rich. It is that he may have the means of benefiting others."

### John Calvin:
1. "Let him that stole steal no more. This includes not merely the grosser thefts which are punished by human laws, but those of a more concealed nature, which do not fall under the cognizance of men, â€” every kind of depredation by which we seize the property of others."
2. "Thou who formerly stolest must not only obtain thy subsistence by lawful and harmless toil, but must give assistance to others."
3. "No condition, however hard or disagreeable, can entitle any man to do injury to another, or even to refrain from contributing to the necessities of his brethren."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "One who acts thus, not quite so strong as â€˜thief,â€™ But were there any such among the Ephesian Christians? Possibly there were, comp. 1 Corinthians 5:1; 2 Corinthians 12:21; but more probably the term should be understood in the spirit of Christian ethics, of those who lived by their wits, cheating their neighbors, or in indolence neglected to labor for themselves, becoming a burden on the charity of others. Certainly the context points to such, as included."
2. "Laziness is but a form of dishonesty; and manual labor is far more honorable than many forms of â€˜business,â€™ so-called."
3. "The precept of this verse is the very opposite of communism, which encourages men to take as their right, not to give as their privilege. Here is the germ of Christian social science."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Steal no more. Clearly here, cease stealing."
2. "The good thing" opposed to his stealing and "with his hands" that did the stealing.
3. "Even unemployment is no excuse for stealing."

### John Gill:
1. "Stealing, or theft, is a fraudulent taking away of another man's goods, without the knowledge and will of the owner, for the sake of gain."
2. "Labouring with diligence and industry, at any manufacture, trade, or business, which is honest, lawful, and of good report, is a proper antidote against theft."
3. "Needy persons are the objects of charity; and what is given to them, should be a man's own; and what a man gets by his hand labor, he should not prodigally spend, or covetously lay up, but should cheerfully distribute it to indigent persons."

### John Wesley:
1. "But rather let him labour â€” Lest idleness lead him to steal again."
2. "And whoever has sinned in any kind ought the more zealously to practise the opposite virtue."
3. "That he may have to give â€” And so be no longer a burden and nuisance, but a blessing, to his neighbours."
