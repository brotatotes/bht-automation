## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Let every worthless saying not come forth from your mouth, but whatever saying is good for edification of the (present) need." 
2. "The χρεία is the deficiency: the part which needs οἰκοδομεῖσθαι, = the defect to be supplied by edification; and so is the regular objective genitive after οἰκοδομήν, which has no article, because it has a more general reference than merely to τῆς χρείας, which afterwards limits it."
3. "That it may give grace to them that hear: minister spiritual benefit: be a means of conveying through you the grace of God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Without the salt of grace, [communication] becomes corrupt."
2. "Words should be as nails fastened in a sure place, suiting the present time and the present person."
3. "The word spoken 'gives grace to the hearers' when God uses it as His instrument for that purpose."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The importance of this admonition will be appreciated when it is remembered... Scarcely anything can be conceived more corrupt or corrupting, than that which often prevails among young men - and even young men in the academies and colleges of this land."
2. "A Christian should be pure in his conversation. His Master was pure. His God is pure. The heaven to which he goes is pure. The religion which he professes is pure."
3. "Speech is an invaluable gift; a blessing of inestimable worth. We may so speak as 'always' to do good to others. He who talks for the mere sake of talking will say many foolish things; he whose great aim in life is to benefit others, will not be likely to say that which he will have occasion to regret."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Corrupt [σαπρος]." 
2. "That which is good [ει τις αγαθος]."

### John Calvin:
1. "No filthy speech." 
2. "He enjoins them to frame their discourse for edification."
3. "The edification of use will thus mean the progress of our edification, for to edify is to carry forward."

1. "‘Corrupt’ is used of what is decayed and loathsome, but the idea of worthlessness is included."
2. "Good (i.e., fitting, though possibly suggesting the moral quality) for the building up of the need."
3. "Profitable conversation is so rare, because our social intercourse has no such exalted aim as this."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Corrupt. Rotten, putrid, like fruit (Matthew 7:17), fish (Matthew 13:48), here the opposite of αγαθος (good)." 
2. "For edifying as the need may be. 'For the build-up of the need,' 'for supplying help when there is need.' Let no other words come out."
3. "That it may give. For this elliptical use of ινα see on Ephesians 5:33."

### John Gill:
1. "Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth,.... As unsavoury speech, foolish talking, light and frothy language, that which is filthy, unprofitable, noxious, and nauseous, and all that is sinful..."
2. "...men have not a right to say what they please; good men will be cautious what they say, otherwise their religion is in vain..."
3. "...and conscious of their own weakness, they will pray to God to set a watch before their mouth, and to keep the door of their lips, and not suffer anything to come out,but that which is good for the use of edifying..."
