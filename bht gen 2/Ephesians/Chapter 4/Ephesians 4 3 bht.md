# Ephesians 4:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christians should strive to be united in their temper and affection, displaying harmony and avoiding division. The unity they are called to maintain is not simply an outward conformity or superficial agreement, but rather an internal bond of love and shared purpose. This unity is produced by the Holy Spirit, who fills the hearts of believers with the same love, joy, and peace. It is through the bond of peace that this unity is upheld and nourished. Therefore, Christians should diligently pursue actions that promote peace and edification, keeping the unity of the Spirit.
