# Ephesians 4:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The love of God, manifested in our hearts through His Spirit, is a tender condescension to our human experience. Though the Holy Spirit cannot be literally grieved, the language used conveys the conduct that can cause Him sorrow. As believers, we are urged not to grieve the Spirit through disobedience or unkind behavior. Instead, we should strive to maintain a dwelling that invites His joy and presence. The sealing of the Spirit signifies our ongoing relationship with Him, assuring us of His indwelling and enabling us to face the day of judgment with confidence.
