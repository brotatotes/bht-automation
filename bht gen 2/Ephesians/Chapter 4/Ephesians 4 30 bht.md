# Ephesians 4:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The love of God, shed abroad in our hearts by His Spirit, is a precious gift. We are cautioned not to grieve the Holy Spirit, for it is a serious matter. The Spirit's seal upon believers should not be taken lightly; we must be careful not to cause Him pain through disobedience. Our actions can either invite the Spirit to dwell joyfully within us or cause Him to withdraw. As believers, we look forward to the day of redemption, the day of judgment, where our salvation will be completed. Let us strive to honor and please the Holy Spirit, cherishing His indwelling presence.
