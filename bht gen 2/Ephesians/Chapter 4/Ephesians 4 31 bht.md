# Ephesians 4:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let all bitterness and wrath and anger be put away from you, with all malice. These emotions are interconnected, with bitterness leading to wrath, which then leads to anger. Clamor, evil-speaking, and even evil surmises are the outward manifestations of this deep-seated bitterness, which is rooted in malice. Christians are called to put away all forms of evil, allowing only goodness to manifest in their lives. The removal of malice is crucial in correcting and purifying the heart, enabling a calm and serious disposition among believers.
