# Ephesians 4:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let go of all bitterness, the intense anger rooted in resentment, and the lasting displeasure towards those who are ignorant or misguided. Put aside the initial feelings of anger towards those who have wronged you, and instead, cultivate a spirit of forgiveness and kindness. Rid yourself of all forms of angry outbursts, contentions, and slanderous speech that stem from a bitter, wrathful, and angry disposition.
