# Ephesians 4:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The kindness and tenderheartedness that God has shown towards us should serve as our model for how we interact with one another. Just as God forgave us through Christ, we are called to forgive one another. This forgiveness is not just a one-time action, but a continual process of becoming kind and gracious towards our fellow believers. It is through this kindness and forgiveness that we reflect the love of God in our relationships with one another.
