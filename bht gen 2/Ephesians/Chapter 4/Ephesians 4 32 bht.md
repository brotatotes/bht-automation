# Ephesians 4:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Be kind and tenderhearted toward one another, following the example of God who has forgiven us. We should strive to be polite, gracious, and inoffensive in our interactions, always considering the happiness and well-being of others. Just as God's forgiveness cost Him the death of His Son, our forgiveness towards others should also be generous and free. God has already forgiven sin in Christ as a historical fact, and so we should treat others as though they have not offended us, extending the same forgiveness that God has shown us.
