# Ephesians 4:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We are reminded that the Church is a unified body in Christ, guided by the Holy Spirit, and sharing the same hope of heaven. This unity encompasses believers from all backgrounds and is exemplified by the oneness of the Trinity. As the Church, it is our responsibility to ensure the preservation of this unity, not only in our profession of faith but also in our support of one another. In this unity, we find strength and assurance of our calling to fellowship with Christ and the promise of eternal rewards.
