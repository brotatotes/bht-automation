# Ephesians 4:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are urged to unity, as they are part of the universal church, a single body in Christ. The oneness of the body is a result of the reconciling work of Christ, and believers are brought into this body through the baptism of the Holy Spirit. This unity extends to all believers, regardless of their background or ethnicity. They are part of one political body, the kingdom of Christ, with Him as the sole King. This unity is grounded in the hope of heaven, which is the same for all believers, and will be equally possessed by all.
