# Ephesians 4:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Baptism serves as an outward and visible sign of one's faith and incorporation into the body of Christ. It symbolizes the unity among Christians who share the same Lord and Savior. Through baptism, individuals are marked with the name of Christ, visibly demonstrating their belonging to Him. This one baptism, performed in various ways and at different stages of life, unites believers in their commitment to live as members of the Church, following the example of Jesus.

### Henry Alford:
1. "the co-existence of the ἓν σῶμα κ . ἓν πνεῦμα in the three great facts on which it rests"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Faith" is not here that which we believe, but the act of believing, the mean by which we apprehend the "one Lord." "Baptism" is specified, being the sacrament whereby we are incorporated into the "one body." - 1 Corinthians 12:13.
2. The Church is one in unity of faith, unity of origination, unity of sacraments, unity of "hope," unity of charity. - Ephesians 4:5, Judges 1:3, Ephesians 2:19-21, Titus 1:2, Ephesians 4:4.
3. The Church is one in unity of discipline and government: for where there is no order, no ministry with Christ as the Head, there is no Church. - Pearson, Exposition of the Creed, Article IX.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There ought to be unity among Christians, because they have one Lord and Saviour."
2. "Let them feel that they have one Lord and Saviour, and they will lay aside their contentions and be one again."
3. "Whether by immersion, or by pouring, or by sprinkling, they have all been baptized with water; whether it is done in adult years, or in infancy, the same solemn act has been performed on all - the act of consecration to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The principle of faith; not that which is believed - the body of Christian doctrine, which does not promote unity."
2. "Baptism is emphasized instead of the Eucharist, because the latter assumes and recognizes unity as an established fact; while faith and baptism precede that fact, and are essential to it."
3. "Baptism, moreover, is not administered to the Church as a body, but to individuals, and therefore emphasizes the exhortation to each member to be in vital union with the whole body."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ cannot be divided. Faith cannot be rent. There are not various baptisms, but one which is common to all."
2. "Faith, and baptism, and God the Father, and Christ, ought to unite us, so as almost to become one man."
3. "Baptism possesses such force as to make us one; and in baptism, the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Spirit, is invoked. Will they deny that one Godhead is the foundation of this holy and mysterious unity?"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "One Lord (εις Κυριος). The Lord Jesus Christ and he alone (no series of aeons)."
2. "One faith (μια πιστις). One act of trust in Christ, the same for all (Jew or Gentile), one way of being saved."
3. "One baptism (εν βαπτισμα). The result of baptizing (βαπτισμα), while βαπτισμος is the act. Only in the N.T. (βαπτισμος in Josephus) and ecclesiastical writers naturally."

### John Gill:
1. "The Lord Jesus Christ, who, by right of creation, is Lord of all; and by right of marriage, and redemption, is the one and only Lord of his church and people."
2. "There is but one true grace of faith; and which, though it is in different subjects, and its degrees and acts are various, yet as to its nature, it is like precious faith in all; and has the same author and object, Jesus Christ, and springs from the same cause, the free grace of God."
3. "There is but one baptism under the Gospel; for John's and Christ's are the same: there are, besides, figurative or metaphorical ones, which are so in an improper sense, as the baptism of the Spirit, and the baptism of blood, or of sufferings; but there is but one baptism, literally and properly so called, which is water baptism."

### John Wesley:
1. One outward baptism.
