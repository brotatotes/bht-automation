# Ephesians 4:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Once individuals have believed and been baptized into Christ, a visible act of faith, they become united in one body, the Church. This outward baptism serves as a seal of their faith, marking them as members of Christ and demonstrating their commitment to following Him. Through this act, the Church is unified, as all believers partake in the same baptism, regardless of the mode or timing. It is a reminder that we are one in Christ, our one Lord.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "the co-existence of the ἓν σῶμα κ . ἓν πνεῦμα in the three great facts on which it rests"
2. "the subjective medium by which that one Lord is apprehended and appropriated"
3. "the objective seal of the subjective faith, by which, as a badge, the members of Christ are outwardly and visibly stamped with His name"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Faith" is not here that which we believe, but the act of believing, the mean by which we apprehend the "one Lord." "Baptism" is specified, being the sacrament whereby we are incorporated into the "one body." - 1 Corinthians 12:13.
2. The Church is one in unity of faith, unity of origination, unity of sacraments, unity of "hope," unity of charity. - Ephesians 4:5, Judges 1:3, Ephesians 2:19-21, Titus 1:2, Ephesians 4:4.
3. The Church is one in unity of discipline and government: for where there is no order, no ministry with Christ as the Head, there is no Church. - Pearson, Exposition of the Creed, Article IX.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There ought to be unity among Christians, because they have one Lord and Saviour."
2. "Let them feel that they have one Lord and Saviour, and they will lay aside their contentions and be one again."
3. "Whether by immersion, or by pouring, or by sprinkling, they have all been baptized with water; whether it is done in adult years, or in infancy, the same solemn act has been performed on all - the act of consecration to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The principle of faith; not that which is believed - the body of Christian doctrine, which does not promote unity."
2. "Baptism is emphasized instead of the Eucharist, because the latter assumes and recognizes unity as an established fact; while faith and baptism precede that fact, and are essential to it."
3. "Baptism, moreover, is not administered to the Church as a body, but to individuals, and therefore emphasizes the exhortation to each member to be in vital union with the whole body."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ cannot be divided. Faith cannot be rent. There are not various baptisms, but one which is common to all."
2. "Faith, and baptism, and God the Father, and Christ, ought to unite us, so as almost to become one man."
3. "Baptism possesses such force as to make us one; and in baptism, the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Spirit, is invoked. Will they deny that one Godhead is the foundation of this holy and mysterious unity?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "‘One Lord’ is the Personal Christ. The whole Epistle shows that out of Him there is no unity of the Spirit."
2. "He is not only the one object of faith, but the Lord to whom allegiance is due, and the loyal trust in Him, exercised by all who are Christians, is the ‘one faith.’"
3. "To this subjective fact of believing in the one Lord, there is added a third: ‘one baptism,’ the external sign and seal of faith, by which, as a badge, the members of Christ are outwardly and visibly stamped with His name."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "One Lord (εις Κυριος). The Lord Jesus Christ and he alone (no series of aeons)."
2. "One faith (μια πιστις). One act of trust in Christ, the same for all (Jew or Gentile), one way of being saved."
3. "One baptism (εν βαπτισμα). The result of baptizing (βαπτισμα), while βαπτισμος is the act. Only in the N.T. (βαπτισμος in Josephus) and ecclesiastical writers naturally."

### John Gill:
1. "The Lord Jesus Christ, who, by right of creation, is Lord of all; and by right of marriage, and redemption, is the one and only Lord of his church and people."
2. "There is but one true grace of faith; and which, though it is in different subjects, and its degrees and acts are various, yet as to its nature, it is like precious faith in all; and has the same author and object, Jesus Christ, and springs from the same cause, the free grace of God."
3. "There is but one baptism under the Gospel; for John's and Christ's are the same: there are, besides, figurative or metaphorical ones, which are so in an improper sense, as the baptism of the Spirit, and the baptism of blood, or of sufferings; but there is but one baptism, literally and properly so called, which is water baptism."

### John Wesley:
1. One outward baptism.
