# Ephesians 4:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The distinct witness to the doctrine of the Holy Trinity is seen in the existence of one God who dwells in believers and is professed in baptism. He is the supreme Father above all, filling all things through the Son and revealed by the indwelling Spirit. This unity is essential, as different pursuits and objects of supreme affection hinder true union. The common worship and acknowledgment of the same great God should be a unifying force among believers, leading them to embrace the oneness that comes from having the same indwelling Spirit.
