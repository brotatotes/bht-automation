# Ephesians 4:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God is the one true God, above all and through all things. He is the Father of all, both angels and souls of men. He governs the world with His providence, extending His care to all His creation. In the context of believers, God is not only their Creator, but also their covenant God and Father. He is the source of all unity among His children, as they all share the same great object of worship. Through His Spirit, God dwells in the hearts of believers, spreading Himself through all members of the church and uniting them as one body.
