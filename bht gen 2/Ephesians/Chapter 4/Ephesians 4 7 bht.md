# Ephesians 4:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Each member of the body of Christ is given a specific gift by the One Spirit, which they are to use for the well-being of the whole Church. While each individual has their own particular gift, there is unity among believers as they all share in the grace bestowed by Christ. This grace enables them to live in accordance with God's will and contributes to the diversity and unity found within the Church. These individual gifts, when combined and utilized collectively, strengthen the body of Christ and lead to its growth and edification.
