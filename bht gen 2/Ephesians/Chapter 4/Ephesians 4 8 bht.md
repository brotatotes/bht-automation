# Ephesians 4:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Christ ascended to heaven, he achieved a profound victory over his enemies, including Satan and death. Through this triumph, Christ obtained various gifts, which he graciously bestows upon his people. Just as conquerors in ancient times led their captives in chains, Christ led captivity captive, demonstrating his complete victory. In doing so, he not only triumphed over his foes but also rescued those who were held captive by Satan, leading them in a glorious procession. As believers, we are recipients of these gifts, which are given according to Christ's distribution of grace.
