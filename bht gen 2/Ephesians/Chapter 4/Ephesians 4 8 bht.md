# Ephesians 4:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Christ ascended to heaven, he triumphed victoriously over all his enemies, including Satan, sin, and death, which had held the entire world captive. This imagery parallels the ancient practice of conquerors leading the conquered in chains behind them. In a similar manner, Christ bestowed gifts upon humanity, both the ordinary and extraordinary gifts of the Holy Spirit, mirroring the donatives given to the people upon the conqueror's return from victory. Through his ascension, Christ not only conquered his foes but also generously provided gifts to empower and bless mankind.
