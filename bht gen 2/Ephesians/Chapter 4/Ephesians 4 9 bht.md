# Ephesians 4:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The ascension of Christ, as highlighted in the passage, necessitates a prior descent. This descent refers to Christ's incarnation, where he humbled himself and took on human form. By descending to the lowest parts of the earth, Christ exemplified his profound humility and his willingness to identify with humanity. This descent served as the foundation for his future ascension and return to heaven. The passage emphasizes the divine nature of Christ, as his descent and subsequent ascent reveal his authority over all creation. Through his incarnation and ascension, Christ fulfills his purpose of redeeming and reconciling humanity to God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Ascension here spoken of was not a first exaltation, but a return to heaven of one who dwelt in heaven." 
2. "The fact of descent being the primary thought, we have only to ask...how far that descent is carried in the Apostleâ€™s mind. The greater the descent, the greater the ascent." 
3. "And if the Î±á¼°Ï‡Î¼Î±Î»Ï‰ÏƒÎ¯Î± consisted of Satan and his powers, the warfare in which they were taken captive would most naturally be contemplated in all its extent, as reaching to their habitation itself: 'this ascent, what does it imply but a descent, and that even to the lower parts of the earth from which the spoils of victory were fetched?'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "His ascent implies a previous descent; and that the language of the Psalm can only refer to Christ, who first descended, then ascended."
2. "The antithesis or contrast to 'far above all heavens,' is the argument of ALFORD and others, to show that this phrase means more than simply the earth, namely, the regions beneath it..."
3. "Christ, as Lord of all, took possession first of the earth the unseen world beneath it, then of heaven."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is affirmed in the Psalm that he 'ascended' - 'Thou hast ascended on high.' This implies that there must have been a previous 'descent.'"
2. "He came not only to the earth, but he stooped to the most humble condition of humanity here."
3. "The idea is, that the Redeemer descended from his lofty eminence in heaven, and became a man of humble rank and condition."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "By descending into the depths and ascending above all, He entered upon His function of filling the whole universe, in virtue of which function He distributes gifts to men." 
2. "His ascent implies a previous descent."
3. "The reference is to Christ's descent into Hades."

### John Calvin:
1. "And at what time did God descend lower than when Christ emptied himself?"
2. "If ever there was a time when, after appearing to lay aside the brightness of his power, God ascended gloriously, it was when Christ was raised from our lowest condition on earth, and received into heavenly glory."
3. "To torture them so as to make them mean purgatory or hell, is exceedingly foolish."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul picks out the verb Î±Î½Î±Î²Î±Ï‚ (second aorist active participle of Î±Î½Î±Î²Î±Î¹Î½Ï‰, to go up), changes its form to Î±Î½ÎµÎ²Î· (second aorist indicative), and points the article (Ï„Î¿) at it."
2. "If the Î±Î½Î±Î²Î±Ï‚ is the Ascension of Christ, then the ÎºÎ±Ï„Î±Î²Î±Ï‚ would be the Descent (Incarnation) to earth."
3. "Otherwise one must think of the death of Christ (the descent into Hades of Acts 2:31)."

### John Gill:
1. "These words are a conclusion of Christ's descent from heaven, from his ascension thither; for had he not first descended from thence, it could not have been said of him that he ascended."
2. "It may rather design the whole of his humiliation, as his descent from heaven and incarnation in the virgin's womb, where his human nature was curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth."
3. "The spirits or souls of the patriarchs returned to God that gave them, when separated from their bodies, as the souls of men do now, Ecclesiastes 12:7."

### John Wesley:
1. "Now this expression, He ascended, what is it, but that he descended â€” That is, does it not imply, that he descended first?".
2. "Certainly it does, on the supposition of his being God. Otherwise it would not".
3. "Into the lower parts of the earth â€” So the womb is called, Psalm 139:15; the grave, Psalm 63:9".
