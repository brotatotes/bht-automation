# Ephesians 5:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As believers, we are called to imitate God by forgiving and loving, just as He has forgiven and loved us. We are to be like dear children, dearly loved and adopted by God's grace. We are not called to imitate the great figures of human history, but to imitate our heavenly Father, who in His infinite wisdom and love looks upon us as His beloved children.
