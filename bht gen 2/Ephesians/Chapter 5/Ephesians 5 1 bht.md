# Ephesians 5:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Be imitators of God in forgiving and loving, just as He forgave us. It is an honor and a blessing to follow in God's footsteps and imitate His character. As beloved children, we are loved with an everlasting and unchanging love. Our greatest aim should be to imitate God, who is infinitely wise and powerful, rather than aiming to imitate mere human figures.
