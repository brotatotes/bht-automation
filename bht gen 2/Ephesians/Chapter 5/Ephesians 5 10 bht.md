# Ephesians 5:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are encouraged to live in a way that reflects what is acceptable to the Lord. This requires continuously testing and proving through study and practical application. Just as we test the authenticity of a coin, we should strive to discern and approve of what pleases God. By walking as children of light, we have the opportunity to manifest the true nature of things, whether good or bad. Our goal should be to live in a manner that is pleasing to the Lord and to accurately discern what aligns with His will.
