# Ephesians 5:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord is a continual process of testing and evaluating various aspects of faith. As believers, we must walk in the light, demonstrating what is pleasing to God. Our understanding of what is acceptable should not be based on human reason alone, but on the authority of Scripture. Through this testing and approval, we can come to value and cling to what is right and pleasing to the Lord.
