Reprove them by shining the light of truth on their darkness, not just avoiding them. By exposing their works of darkness, we can bring conviction to their hearts and potentially lead them to a path of repentance and transformation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "vitia in semetipsa finiuntur et pereunt, virtutes frugibus pullulant et redundant."
2. "on which Jer., vol. vii. p. 505, says ‚Äòvitia in semetipsa finiuntur et pereunt, virtutes frugibus pullulant et redundant.‚Äô"
3. "not only abstain from fellowship with them, but attack them and put them to shame"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Sins are terminated in themselves, and therefore are called 'works,' not 'fruits'."
2. "Graces...are reproductive, and abound in fruits; which, as harmoniously combining in one whole, are termed 'the FRUIT of the Spirit'."
3. "Not only 'have no fellowship, but even reprove them,' namely, in words, and in your deeds, which, shining with 'the light,' virtually reprove all that is contrary to light."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "And have no fellowship - See the sentiment here expressed fully explained in the notes on 2 Corinthians 6:14-18."
2. "The unfruitful works - The deeds of darkness that produce no 'benefit' to the body or the soul. The word 'unfruitful' is used here in contrast with the 'fruit of the Spirit,' Ephesians 5:9."
3. "But rather reprove them - By your life, your conversation, and all your influence. This is the business of Christians. Their lives should be a standing rebuke of a sinful world, and they should be ever ready to express their disapprobation of its wickedness in every form."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Have fellowship." (œÉœÖŒ≥Œ∫ŒøŒπŒΩœâŒΩŒµŒπœÑŒµ) 
2. "Unfruitful works." (ŒµœÅŒ≥ŒøŒπœÇ œÑŒøŒπœÇ Œ±Œ∫Œ±œÅœÄŒøŒπœÇ) 
3. "Reprove." (ŒµŒªŒµŒ≥œáŒµœÑŒµ)

### John Calvin:
1. "It is not enough that we do not, of our own accord, undertake anything wicked. We must beware of joining or assisting those who do wrong."
2. "We must abstain from giving any consent, or advice, or approbation, or assistance; for in all these ways we have fellowship."
3. "Where a manifest offense is committed against God, every man will be eager to vindicate himself from any share in the guilt, but very few will guard against connivance; nearly all will practice some kind of dissimulation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Neither be partakers with the disobedient, nor have fellowship with their works, which are unfruitful works of darkness."
2. "To have no fellowship is not enough... 'Reprove' points to oral rebuke, such as shows the immorality of such works, quickens the conscience of the person doing them, with a view to his improvement."
3. "The danger in the application of this command arises from wrong motives in the heart of the reprover, not from any too strict view of the sinfulness of the works of darkness."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Have no fellowship with...unfruitful works."

### John Gill:
1. "Fellowship is not to be maintained 'with the works of darkness'; which are sins, so called, because they are opposite to light...and because they are generally committed in the dark; and because the effect and consequence of them is utter darkness, and blackness of darkness." 
2. "It is contrary to the character of saints to have fellowship with such..." 
3. "But rather reprove [them]; both by words and by deeds, by an agreeable life and conversation...because it is not a brother, but such who are in darkness, and live in works of darkness; yea, not sinners, but sins are to be reproved, which can be done no other way; nor are all saints proper to reprove verbally, nor are they qualified for it; but all should, and may by facts; and the light discovers darkness, by its own splendour."

### John Wesley:
1. Reprove them ‚Äî To avoid them is not enough.
