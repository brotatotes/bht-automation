# Ephesians 5:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Sin loves the dark. Works of darkness thrive and flourish hidden from the light. There are those who engage in shameful and scandalous acts that they would never speak of openly. Even the mere mention of these deeds fills the righteous and virtuous with shame. Therefore, it is our duty as believers to distance ourselves from such acts and have no fellowship with those who commit them. We must instead shine a light on these works of darkness, reproving them with the hope that shame may lead to repentance.
