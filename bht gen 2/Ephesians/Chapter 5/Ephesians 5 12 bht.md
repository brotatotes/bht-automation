# Ephesians 5:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is important to remember that there are things done in secret that are shameful and should not even be spoken of. Darkness, sin, and evil often hide in secret, far away from the light. These actions, so disgraceful and scandalous, should not be named or given any fellowship. Let us remember the power of light and the need to expose the works of darkness through reproof, leading to repentance and shame.
