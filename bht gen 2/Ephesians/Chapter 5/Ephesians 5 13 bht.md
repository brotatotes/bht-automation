# Ephesians 5:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Exposing and confronting wrongdoings is an important aspect of living a Christian life. By reproving the actions of darkness, we bring them into the light and reveal their true nature. As Christians, we are called to shine as light in this world and by doing so, we have the power to transform and bring clarity to the darkness around us. It is through this process of reproof that light is shed upon the deeds of darkness, prompting change and guiding us towards the path of righteousness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The light of your Christian life, which will be by your reproof shed upon these deeds of darkness, will bring them out of the category of darkness into light" (ἐπειδὰν φανερωθῇ, γίνεται φῶς).
2. "Every thing which is made manifest is no longer darkness, but light: and thus you will be, not compromised to these works of darkness, but making an inroad upon the territory of darkness with the ὅπλα τοῦ φωτός" (φανερούμενον is passive, not middle).
3. "The objection to this that 'light does not always exercise this transforming influence, for the devil and all the wicked are themselves condemned by the light, without becoming themselves light,' is null, being founded on misapprehension of the φῶς ἐστιν" (every thing shone upon IS LIGHT).

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Everything that is (that is, suffers itself to be) made manifest (or 'shone upon,' namely, by your 'reproving') is (thenceforth no longer 'darkness,' Ephesians 5:11- :, but) light."
2. "The devil and the wicked will not suffer themselves to be made manifest by the light, but love darkness, though outwardly the light shines round them."
3. "Your consistent lives and faithful reproofs will be your 'armor of light' in making an inroad on the kingdom of darkness."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The sense is, that 'its true nature is demonstrated;' that is, it is made known."
2. "The gospel - the light of the world - enables us to see the true nature of actions."
3. "Anything which will show the real form and nature of an object, deserves to be called light."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Reproved is to be taken in the same literal sense as in ver. 11, and not metaphorically in the sense of being demonstrated by light, or brought to light, which is almost synonymous with are made manifest." 
2. "Whatsoever doth make manifest is light. Wrong. The A. V. renders doth make manifest, as in the middle voice, but the verb is in the passive voice. It occurs nearly fifty times in the New Testament, and never as middle. Hence Rev., correctly, everything that is made manifest."
3. "Manifestation is a law of good and evil alike. That which is of the truth seeks the light and cometh to the light. That which is evil avoids the light, and loves darkness better than light, but none the less is brought to the light and appears in its own light."

### John Calvin:
1. "It may be either rendered, that which is made manifest, or that which doth make manifest."
2. "The context appears to me to show clearly that this is Paul’s meaning. He had exhorted them to reprove the evil works of unbelievers, and thus to drag them out of darkness; and he now adds, that what he enjoins upon them is the proper business of light — to make manifest."
3. "It is Light, he says, which makes all things manifest; and hence it followed that they were unworthy of the name if they did not bring to light what was involved in darkness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Apostle confirms his precept about reproof, by showing how the light wholesomely affects even these things which it is a shame to speak of."
2. "All things, such as these secret sins, when they are reproved by you (as commanded in Ephesians 5:11) are made manifest by the light, their true moral quality is revealed by the light thus thrown upon them; only the light can do this, for everything which is made manifest is light."
3. "It is not asserted that a moral transformation necessarily results from this revealing process. 'Whether this tends to condemnation or otherwise, depends on the nature of the case, and the inward operation of the outwardly illuminating influence.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Turn on the light. Often the preacher is the only man brave enough to turn the light on the private sins of men and women or even those of a community."


### John Gill:
1. "All sins...will be reproved by God, either by his Spirit convincing of them, or by his judgments, and the letting out of his wrath and fury, either here or hereafter, for the punishment of them."
2. "The word of the Lord...discovers the heinousness of sins."
3. "Christ, the light of the world, will bring to light the hidden things of darkness as Judge."

### John Wesley:
1. "All things which are reproved, are thereby dragged out into the light, and made manifest."
2. "For whatsoever doth make manifest is light."
