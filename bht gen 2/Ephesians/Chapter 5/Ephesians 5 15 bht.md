## BHT:
See then, brethren, to take heed to your walk and watch over it with wisdom and prudence. Let your walk be marked by exactness and accuracy, striving to reach the highest point of holiness. Do not walk as fools, who do not consider where they are going or make the best of their way. Instead, walk as wise men, following the pattern of Christ, guided by the Spirit, and living in a manner that befits the Gospel of Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Take heed, of what sort your ἀκριβῶς περιπατεῖν is: take heed not only that your walk be exact, strict, but also of what sort that strictness is, not only that you have a rule, and keep to it, but that that rule be the best one."
2. "Buying up for yourselves (the) opportunity, viz. of good, whenever occurring; let it not pass by, but as merchants carefully looking out for vantages, make it your own."
3. "Because the days of your time, in which you live, are evil. ἐξαγοράσασθε αὐτόν, ὥστε καταχρήσασθαι αὐτῷ τρὸς εὐσέβειαν."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "See (take heed) how ye walk," and "See that ye walk circumspectly." The manner, as well as the act itself, is included.
2. "See how ye are walking, with a view to your being circumspect (literally, accurate, exact) in your walk."
3. "Walk in wisdom (answering to 'as wise' here) toward them that are without" (answering to "circumspectly," that is, correctly, in relation to the unbelievers around, not giving occasion of stumbling to any, but edifying all by a consistent walk).

### Albert Barnes:
1. "See then that ye walk circumspectly - carefully, anxiously, solicitous lest you fall into sin."
2. "The word rendered 'circumspectly' - ἀκριβῶς akribōs - means 'diligently,' and the idea here is, that they were to take special pains to guard against the temptations around them, and to live as they ought to."
3. "Not as fools, but as wise - Not as the people of this world live, indulging in foolish pleasures and desires, but as those who have been taught to understand heavenly wisdom, and who have been made truly wise."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Look carefully how ye walk." 
2. "Circumspectly is better rendered carefully. It means exactly, accurately."
3. "Not as unwise, but as wise. Explanatory of carefully."

### John Calvin:
1. "See then. If believers must not neglect to drive away the darkness of others by their own brightness, how much less ought they to be blind as to their own conduct in life?"
2. "Placed, as it were, in a crowded theater, they ought to live under the eye of God and of angels. Let them stand in awe of these witnesses, though they may be concealed from the view of all mortals."
3. "Dismissing the metaphor of darkness and light, he enjoins them to regulate their life circumspectly as wise men, who have been educated by the Lord in the school of true wisdom."


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Carefully (ακριβως)...how exactly ye walk." 
2. "On ακριβως (from ακριβης) see Matthew 2:8; Luke 1:3."
3. "Unwise (ασοφο). Old adjective, only here in N.T."

1. "See then, brethren...to take heed to their walk: the believer's walk is both inward and outward; his inward walk is by faith on Christ; his outward walk is his conversation among men..."
2. "This walk should be seen to, and watched over...with wisdom and prudence, looking well to his going..."
3. "And such walk as wise men, who walk according to the rule of God's word, make Christ their pattern, have the Spirit for their guide, and walk as becomes the Gospel of Christ..."
