## BHT:
Believers are urged to carefully examine their conduct, ensuring that they not only have a rule to follow but that the rule itself is the best one.

It is important for believers to be diligent and accurate in their pursuit of holiness, not behaving foolishly but instead displaying wisdom in their actions.

### Henry Alford:
1. "Take heed, of what sort your ἀκριβῶς περιπατεῖν is: take heed not only that your walk be exact, strict, but also of what sort that strictness is, not only that you have a rule, and keep to it, but that that rule be the best one."
2. "Buying up for yourselves (the) opportunity, viz. of good, whenever occurring; let it not pass by, but as merchants carefully looking out for vantages, make it your own."
