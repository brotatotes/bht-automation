# Ephesians 5:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Redeeming the time emphasizes the need to carefully and diligently use our time, improving it to the best advantage. We must recognize the value of time, as it is precious and not to be squandered away. By redeeming the time, we seize every opportunity to fulfill our duties to God and others, to grow spiritually, and to do good. This is especially important in a world filled with evil and moral corruption, where we must diligently seek to make the most of every moment, separating ourselves from sinful influences and worldly distractions.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Redeeming the time— ( :-). Greek, 'Buying up for yourselves the seasonable time' (whenever it occurs) of good to yourselves and to others."
2. "In a narrower sense, special favorable seasons for good, occasionally presenting themselves, are referred to, of which believers ought diligently to avail themselves. This constitutes true 'wisdom' (Ephesians 5:15)."
3. "'Redeem' implies the preciousness of the opportune season, a jewel to be bought at any price. WAHL explains, 'Redeeming for yourselves (that is, availing yourselves of) the opportunity (offered you of acting aright), and commanding the time as a master does his servant.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Redeeming the time - The word rendered here as “redeeming,” means “to purchase; to buy up” from the possession or power of anyone; and then to redeem, to set free - as from service or bondage; notes, Galatians 3:13. Here it means, to rescue or recover our time from waste; to improve it for great and important purposes."
2. "Because the days are evil - Because the times in which you live are evil. There are many allurements and temptations that would lead you away from the proper improvement of time, and that would draw you into sin."
3. "They redeem their time who employ it: (1)In gaining useful knowledge; (2)In doing good to others; (3)In employing it for the purpose of an honest livelihood for themselves and families; (4)In prayer and self-examination to make the heart better; (5)In seeking salvation, and in endeavoring to do the will of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Redeeming the time [εξαγοραζομενοι τον καιπον] . See on Colossians 4:5.

### John Calvin:
1. "By a consideration of the time he enforces his exhortation." 
2. "The days are evil. Everything around us tends to corrupt and mislead." 
3. "To withdraw from the endless variety of allurements which would easily lead us astray; to rid ourselves from the cares and pleasures of the world; and, in a word, to abandon every hinderance."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Buying up the opportunity. This describes the walk of the 'wise.' The impression made by the E. V. ('making the most of our time,' not wasting or abusing it) is quite incorrect. The simple sense is: improve the opportunities which occur, looking out for them as a merchant does. 'Buying up' suggests that these opportunities are rare enough to be sought out."
2. "Because the days are evil; not difficult, or unfavorable, or few (as the common rendering possibly suggests; comp. Genesis 47:9), but morally evil, full of iniquity. Hence every opportunity to do good should be seized upon, as a merchant looks for a good bargain, especially when the current of trade is against him."
3. "But in this respect too often the children of this world are wiser than the children of light."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Redeeming the time  (εξαγοραζομενο τον καιρον). As in Colossians 4:5 which see. 

### John Gill:
1. "Taking time for a space of time, it denotes a careful and diligent use of it, an improvement of it to the best advantage."
2. "It shows that [time] is valuable and precious, and is not to be trifled with, and squandered away, and be lost, as it may be; for it can neither be recalled nor prolonged."
3. "[Redeeming time] signifies that no opportunity of discharging our duty to God and man, of attending on the word and ordinances of the Gospel, and to the private and public exercises of religion, of gaining advantage to our own souls, or of gaining the souls of others, and of doing good either to the bodies or souls of men, should be neglected."

### John Wesley:
1. "Saving all you can for the best purposes; buying every possible moment out of the hands of sin and Satan."
2. "Out of the hands of sloth, ease, pleasure, worldly business."
3. "The more diligently, because the present are evil days, days of the grossest ignorance, immorality, and profaneness."
