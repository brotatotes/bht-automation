# Ephesians 5:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By diligently redeeming the time, we are called to purchase every possible moment out of the hands of sin, sloth, and worldly pursuits. This means using our time wisely for the best purposes, whether in gaining knowledge, doing good to others, earning a livelihood, seeking salvation, or obeying God's will. We must be especially diligent in our time management because the days in which we live are filled with ignorance, immorality, and profaneness. Therefore, we should make the most of every opportunity to fulfill our responsibilities to God and others, and to grow in our faith and righteousness.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Redeeming the time - The word rendered here as “redeeming,” means “to purchase; to buy up” from the possession or power of anyone; and then to redeem, to set free - as from service or bondage; notes, Galatians 3:13. Here it means, to rescue or recover our time from waste; to improve it for great and important purposes."
