# Ephesians 5:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Be wise and do not waste your time senselessly, but instead understand what is the will of the Lord. Seek to discern intelligently the specific will of Christ, not just in general, but in every aspect of your life. Do not be unwise and ignorant, but rather strive to know and do the will of God, allowing your heart and actions to align with it. Remember that understanding the will of the Lord is not just about having knowledge, but about applying it practically in your life in every situation.
