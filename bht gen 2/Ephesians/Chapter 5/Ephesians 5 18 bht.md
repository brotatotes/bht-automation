# Ephesians 5:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Drunkenness, characterized by excessive drinking and the loss of reason, is contrary to the Christian life. Instead, believers are encouraged to be filled with the Spirit, to allow the grace and presence of the Holy Spirit to permeate their lives. This filling brings spiritual peace, joy, and a deeper pleasure than any worldly indulgence can provide. Let us pursue a life filled with the Spirit and be mindful of the contrast between the wild and dissolute habits of the world and the spiritual devotion that marks our worship.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But as spendthrifts are almost of necessity self-indulgent and reckless, the word comes to have the meaning of 'dissoluteness,' 'debauchery,' 'profligacy.'"
2. "If you are full of the Spirit, full in Spirit, there will be a joy indeed, but not that of ἀσωτία: one which will find its expression not in drunken songs, but in Christian hymns, and continual thankfulness."
3. "The name of the Lord is there, where He is named. How He is named, depends on the particular circumstances... The Apostle says, that all the Christian would do, he must do in the name of Christ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The effect in inspiration was that the person was 'filled' with an ecstatic exhilaration, like that caused by wine; hence the two are here connected."
2. "Hence arose the abstinence from wine of many of the prophets, for example, John the Baptist, namely, in order to keep distinct before the world the ecstasy caused by the Spirit, from that caused by wine."
3. "Such a one expresses his joy, not in drunken or worldly songs, but in Christian hymns of thankfulness."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To these things the apostle opposes psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs, as much more appropriate modes of devotion, and would have the Christian worship stand out in strong contrast with the wild and dissolute habits of the pagan."
2. "All intoxication is prohibited in the Scriptures - no matter by what means it is produced. There is, in fact, but one thing that produces intoxication. It is 'alcohol' - the poisonous substance produced by fermentation."
3. "But be filled with the Spirit - The Holy Spirit. How much more appropriate to Christians than to be filled with the spirit of intoxication and revelry! Let Christians, when about to indulge in a glass of wine, think of this admonition."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Be not drunk [μη μεθυσκεσθε]. See on John 2:10."
2. "Wherein. In drunkenness, not in wine."
3. "Excess [ασωτια]. Rev., riot. Lit., unsavingness. See on riotous living, Luke 14:13."

### John Calvin:
1. "Be not intemperate in drinking."
2. "The meaning therefore is, that drunkards throw off quickly every restraint of modesty or shame; that where wine reigns, profligacy naturally follows; and consequently, that all who have any regard to moderation or decency ought to avoid and abhor drunkenness."
3. "To what does drunkenness lead? To unbounded licentiousness, — to unbridled, indecent merriment."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Be not drunken with wine...forbidden as a habit and to stop it also if guilty."

3. "But be filled with the Spirit (αλλα πληρουσθε εν πνευματ). In contrast to a state of intoxication with wine."

### John Gill:
1. "The sin of drunkenness here dehorted from, is a custom, or habit, of voluntary excessive drinking of any strong liquor, whereby the mind is disturbed, and deprived of the use of reason."
2. "Excessive drinking deprives persons of the use of reason, though not always; and such are criminal, who are mighty to drink wine, and strong to mingle strong drink."
3. "They are filled with the Spirit, in whom his grace is a well of living water, and out of whose belly flow rivers of it; and who have a large measure of spiritual peace and joy."
