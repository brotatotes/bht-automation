# Ephesians 5:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible warns against the dangers of excessive drinking, which leads to debauchery and reckless behavior. Instead, Christians are called to be filled with the Spirit, expressing their joy and thankfulness through psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. The contrast between the ecstasy caused by the Spirit and that caused by wine is emphasized, with the former bringing genuine joy and gratitude. Christians are encouraged to prioritize the fullness and fellowship of the Holy Spirit over the temporary pleasure of alcohol, as the Spirit brings lasting peace and joy that surpasses any worldly intoxication.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But as spendthrifts are almost of necessity self-indulgent and reckless, the word comes to have the meaning of 'dissoluteness,' 'debauchery,' 'profligacy.'"
2. "If you are full of the Spirit, full in Spirit, there will be a joy indeed, but not that of ·ºÄœÉœâœÑŒØŒ±: one which will find its expression not in drunken songs, but in Christian hymns, and continual thankfulness."
3. "The name of the Lord is there, where He is named. How He is named, depends on the particular circumstances... The Apostle says, that all the Christian would do, he must do in the name of Christ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The effect in inspiration was that the person was 'filled' with an ecstatic exhilaration, like that caused by wine; hence the two are here connected."
2. "Hence arose the abstinence from wine of many of the prophets, for example, John the Baptist, namely, in order to keep distinct before the world the ecstasy caused by the Spirit, from that caused by wine."
3. "Such a one expresses his joy, not in drunken or worldly songs, but in Christian hymns of thankfulness."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To these things the apostle opposes psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs, as much more appropriate modes of devotion, and would have the Christian worship stand out in strong contrast with the wild and dissolute habits of the pagan."
2. "All intoxication is prohibited in the Scriptures - no matter by what means it is produced. There is, in fact, but one thing that produces intoxication. It is 'alcohol' - the poisonous substance produced by fermentation."
3. "But be filled with the Spirit - The Holy Spirit. How much more appropriate to Christians than to be filled with the spirit of intoxication and revelry! Let Christians, when about to indulge in a glass of wine, think of this admonition."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Be not drunk [ŒºŒ∑ ŒºŒµŒ∏œÖœÉŒ∫ŒµœÉŒ∏Œµ]. See on John 2:10."
2. "Wherein. In drunkenness, not in wine."
3. "Excess [Œ±œÉœâœÑŒπŒ±]. Rev., riot. Lit., unsavingness. See on riotous living, Luke 14:13."

### John Calvin:
1. "Be not intemperate in drinking."
2. "The meaning therefore is, that drunkards throw off quickly every restraint of modesty or shame; that where wine reigns, profligacy naturally follows; and consequently, that all who have any regard to moderation or decency ought to avoid and abhor drunkenness."
3. "To what does drunkenness lead? To unbounded licentiousness, ‚Äî to unbridled, indecent merriment."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Be not made drunk. To be taken literally, since the vice deserved then, and has ever since deserved, such special mention."
2. "But be filled in the Spirit. Over against the temporary intoxication, is the permanent state of fulness; the contrast is between the verbs, as the original indicate."
3. "The Christian‚Äôs joy is not brief intoxication, but abiding exaltation in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. The next verses show how this spiritual joy expresses itself."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

3. "But be filled with the Spirit (Œ±ŒªŒªŒ± œÄŒªŒ∑œÅŒøœÖœÉŒ∏Œµ ŒµŒΩ œÄŒΩŒµœÖŒºŒ±œÑ). In contrast to a state of intoxication with wine."

### John Gill:

3. "Who gives a more noble pleasure than wine can do."
