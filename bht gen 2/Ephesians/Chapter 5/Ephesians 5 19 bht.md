# Ephesians 5:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The early Christians had the practice of gathering before daylight to worship and recite hymns to Christ, as if he were God. These hymns were spiritual songs and not the drunken songs of heathen feasts. Singing was meant to come from the heart, with the focus being on praising God and not just on the tongue. The singing of psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs was not limited to the Psalms of David, but included other compositions. Singing in worship is a way to express devotion to Jesus, with the understanding that he is Lord and can search the heart.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "They are wont on a fixed day to meet before daylight [to avoid persecution] and to recite a hymn among themselves by turns, to Christ, as if being God."
2. "Contrast the drunken 'songs,' James 5:13."
3. "Let your songs be not the drinking songs of heathen feasts, but psalms and hymns; and their accompaniment, not the music of the lyre, but the melody of the heart."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Nothing is more clear than that it was practiced by the Saviour himself and the apostles, and by the primitive church, as well as by the great body of Christians in all ages."
2. "One thing is proved clearly by this passage, that there were other compositions used in the praise of God than the Psalms of David; and if it was right then to make use of such compositions, it is now."
3. "If instruments are employed, they should be so subordinate that the service may be characterized as singing."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The A. V. is literally correct, but is open to the misinterpretation each one communing with himself."
2. "The meaning is as in Colossians 3:13, and Rev. is better."
3. "Hymns - spiritual songs."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Spirit means 'joy in the Holy Ghost,' and the exhortation, be ye filled, alludes to deep drinking, with which it is indirectly contrasted."
2. "Let your praises be not merely on the tongue, as hypocrites do, but from the heart."
3. "The appellation spiritual, given to these songs, is strikingly appropriate; for the songs most frequently used are almost always on trifling subjects, and very far from being chaste."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The reciprocal influence on their hearts is meant; and that in social intercourse as well as in their public assemblies."
2. "There is no warrant for confining public praise to the use of the Old Testament psalms, or of paraphrases of other Scripture passages."
3. "The view which takes this clause as subordinate to the preceding part of the verse is open to objection. It usually explains 'in your heart' as = heartily, which is incorrect. It is this private singing which best fits us for public praise."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "To the Lord (œÑœâ ŒöœÖœÅŒπœâ). The Lord Jesus. In Colossians 3:16 we have œÑœâ Œ∏Œµœâ (to God) with all these varieties of praise, another proof of the deity of Christ."
2. "See Colossians 3:16 for discussion."

### John Gill:
1. "By psalms are meant the Psalms of David, and others which compose the book that goes by that name...to be sung along with them, to the edification of churches..."
2. "The psalm which our Lord sung with his disciples after the supper, is called an hymn...and by 'spiritual songs' are meant the same Psalms of David...designed for spiritual edification..."
3. "Singing, as it is a distinct thing from prayer, so from giving of thanks...it is a praising of God with the modulation of the voice; and is rightly performed, when the heart and voice agree..."

### John Wesley:
1. "By there being no inspired songs, peculiarly adapted to the Christian dispensation, as there were to the Jewish, it is evident that the promise of the Holy Ghost to believers, in the last days, was by his larger effusion to supply the lack of it."
2. "Singing with your hearts ‚Äî As well as your voice."
3. "To the Lord ‚Äî Jesus, who searcheth the heart."
