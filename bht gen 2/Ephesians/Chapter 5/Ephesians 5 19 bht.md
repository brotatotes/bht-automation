# Ephesians 5:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The early Christians would gather together before daylight on a fixed day to recite hymns to Christ, to avoid persecution. This practice was followed by the Savior, the apostles, and the primitive church. It is clear that there were other compositions used in the praise of God, aside from the Psalms of David. When singing hymns, it is important that they come from the heart, not merely on the tongue like hypocrites. These spiritual songs should be sung to the Lord Jesus, who searches the heart.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "They are wont on a fixed day to meet before daylight [to avoid persecution] and to recite a hymn among themselves by turns, to Christ, as if being God."

### John Calvin:

3. "To the Lord — Jesus, who searcheth the heart."
