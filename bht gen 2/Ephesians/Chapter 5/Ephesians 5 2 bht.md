# Ephesians 5:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As believers, we are called to imitate God's love in our lives, just as Christ loved us by offering himself as a sacrifice for our sake. This sacrificial offering made by Christ is like a pleasant aroma to God, pleasing and acceptable to Him. Through His death on the cross, Christ reconciled us to God, becoming the true model for us to embrace and love one another. Walking in love means not only speaking of love, but also actively practicing it, motivated by our deep gratitude for God's love and grace towards us.
