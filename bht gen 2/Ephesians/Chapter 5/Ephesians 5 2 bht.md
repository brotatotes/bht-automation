# Ephesians 5:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To walk in love is to imitate God and Christ who have loved us. It is not just about words, but about actively demonstrating love to others. Christ's death was an offering to God on our behalf and his atoning death reconciles us to God. We are called to constantly embrace each other with the love that Christ has shown us because that is our true guide.
