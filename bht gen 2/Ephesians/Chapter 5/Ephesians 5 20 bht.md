# Ephesians 5:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Giving thanks always, for all things, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ is an essential part of our Christian life. We are to be grateful to God for both temporal and spiritual blessings, recognizing that everything we have comes through Christ. This gratitude should extend to all circumstances, whether they are favorable or difficult, as we trust that God is working all things together for our good. Through Jesus, we have access to offer our thanksgiving to God, acknowledging His role as the source of every blessing.
