# Ephesians 5:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In every situation and circumstance, we are called to continually offer our thanks and gratitude. We should give thanks not only for the blessings we easily recognize, but also for the trials and challenges that shape us. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the source of all good things, we can approach God with our thanksgiving and praise. Every aspect of our lives, whether joyous or difficult, can become an opportunity to express our thankfulness to the One who provides for us.
