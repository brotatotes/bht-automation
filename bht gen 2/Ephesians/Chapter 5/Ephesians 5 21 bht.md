# Ephesians 5:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Submitting yourselves to one another means acknowledging and respecting the authority and responsibilities we have towards each other. This applies not just to the relationship between God and humans, but also to our interactions with fellow human beings. Whether it is submitting to civil authorities, honoring familial roles, or respecting the guidance of church leaders, there is a call to mutual submission and obedience. Ultimately, this submission is rooted in a reverential fear of displeasing Christ, and it serves to maintain order and harmony in our relationships and society.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Here he passes from our relations to God, to those which concern our fellow men." 
2. "The believer passes from under the bondage of the law as a letter, to be 'the servant of Christ'." 
3. "Thus reverential fear of displeasing Him is the motive for discharging our relative duties as Christians."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Maintaining due subordination in the various relations of life."
2. "The general meaning here is, that Christianity does not break up the relations of life, and produce disorder, lawlessness, and insubordination; but that it will confirm every proper authority, and make every just yoke lighter."
3. "Infidelity is always disorganizing; Christianity, never."

### John Calvin:
1. "God has bound us so strongly to each other, that no man ought to endeavor to avoid subjection; and where love reigns, mutual services will be rendered."
2. "It is highly proper that all should be exhorted to be subject to each other in their turn."
3. "He directs us to the fear of Christ, who alone can subdue our fierceness, that we may not refuse the yoke, and can humble our pride, that we may not be ashamed of serving our neighbors."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Subjecting yourselves to one another (υποτασσομενο αλληλοις). Present middle participle of υποτασσω, old military figure to line up under (Colossians 3:18)." 
2. "The construction here is rather loose, coordinate with the preceding participles of praise and prayer." 
3. "It is possible to start a new paragraph here and regard υποτασσομενο as an independent participle like an imperative."

### John Gill:
1. "Submitting yourselves one to another,.... Which may be understood either in a political sense, of giving honour, obedience, and tribute, to civil magistrates..."
2. "Thus the wife should be subject to the husband, children to their parents, and servants to their masters..."
3. "Members of churches should be subject to their pastors... honour and esteem are due to them, and submission and obedience should be yielded to their doctrines, precepts, and exhortations, when they are agreeably to the word of God..."
