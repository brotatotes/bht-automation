# Ephesians 5:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Submitting ourselves to one another is essential in various aspects of life. It means obeying civil authorities, showing respect to our spouses, parents, and employers, and being obedient to the leaders within our churches. This submission is not meant to be a display of weakness or servitude, but rather a demonstration of humility and a recognition of God's ordained order. It is through this submission that we maintain harmony and show reverence for Christ, who exemplifies true humility and servanthood.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Here he passes from our relations to God, to those which concern our fellow men." 
2. "The believer passes from under the bondage of the law as a letter, to be 'the servant of Christ'." 
3. "Thus reverential fear of displeasing Him is the motive for discharging our relative duties as Christians."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Maintaining due subordination in the various relations of life."
2. "The general meaning here is, that Christianity does not break up the relations of life, and produce disorder, lawlessness, and insubordination; but that it will confirm every proper authority, and make every just yoke lighter."
3. "Infidelity is always disorganizing; Christianity, never."

### John Calvin:
1. "God has bound us so strongly to each other, that no man ought to endeavor to avoid subjection; and where love reigns, mutual services will be rendered."
2. "It is highly proper that all should be exhorted to be subject to each other in their turn."
3. "He directs us to the fear of Christ, who alone can subdue our fierceness, that we may not refuse the yoke, and can humble our pride, that we may not be ashamed of serving our neighbors."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Submitting yourselves one to another. While this precept is expounded in several directions in the sections which follow, it stands here as a fourth qualification of being ‘filled with the Spirit’ (so nearly all recent commentators), not as an imperative."
2. "Such submission is not cringing obsequiousness, which is always selfish; but it is opposed to rudeness, insolence, haughtiness, and kindred manifestations of unchristian temper."
3. "The relation to Christ involves humility, and only true humility can produce the submission here required."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Subjecting yourselves to one another (υποτασσομενο αλληλοις). Present middle participle of υποτασσω, old military figure to line up under (Colossians 3:18)." 
2. "The construction here is rather loose, coordinate with the preceding participles of praise and prayer." 
3. "It is possible to start a new paragraph here and regard υποτασσομενο as an independent participle like an imperative."

### John Gill:
1. "Submitting yourselves one to another,.... Which may be understood either in a political sense, of giving honour, obedience, and tribute, to civil magistrates..."
2. "Thus the wife should be subject to the husband, children to their parents, and servants to their masters..."
3. "Members of churches should be subject to their pastors... honour and esteem are due to them, and submission and obedience should be yielded to their doctrines, precepts, and exhortations, when they are agreeably to the word of God..."
