# Ephesians 5:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Wives are called to submit to their husbands, just as the church submits to Christ. This submission establishes a proper order in the family, where the husband is the head, mirroring Christ's role as the Head of the church. This subjection is rendered under the watchful eye of Christ Himself. While the husband should be respected and obeyed, a wife's ultimate obedience is to God. She should assist him in caring for the family and seek his consent in all matters. By recognizing the parallel between the roles of the husband and Christ, wives can embrace their subjection willingly and joyfully.
