# Ephesians 5:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Ephesians 5:22-23, the apostle Paul emphasizes the importance of marital submission. Wives are instructed to submit to their husbands, just as the church submits to Christ. This submission is not a sign of inferiority or oppression, but a reflection of the divine order within marriage. The husband, in his role as the head, is called to love his wife sacrificially, just as Christ loves the church. This mutual submission fosters a harmonious relationship where both husband and wife can fulfill their God-given roles and experience the abundant blessings that come from following God's design for marriage.
