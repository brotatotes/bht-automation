# Ephesians 5:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In marriage, the husband serves as the head, the one who governs, guides, and protects his wife. This parallels the relationship between Christ and the church, where Christ acts as the head, the Savior who delivers the church from sin and suffering. Just as Christ is the source of salvation for the church, the husband assumes a role of authority and responsibility in marriage. It is through this framework that the husband can fulfill his role of loving and caring for his wife, and the wife can find security and support in being subject to her husband.
