# Ephesians 5:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For the husband is the head of the wife, just as Christ is the head of the church. In this case, the headship of the husband over his wife is like the headship of Christ over the church. Christ is not just the head, but also the Savior of the body, the church. He lovingly provides, preserves, and protects the church, offering salvation to all its members. Similarly, the husband serves as the governor, guide, and guardian of his wife, ensuring her well-being and spiritual growth.
