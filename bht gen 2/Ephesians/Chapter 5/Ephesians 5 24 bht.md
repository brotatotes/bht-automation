# Ephesians 5:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Church submits to Christ as the wife submits to her husband, recognizing his authority and seeking his provision, protection, and happiness. In the same way, husbands should exercise their authority in accordance with God's will and commands. Wives should respect and obey their husbands, not in the same way as they do to Christ for salvation, but with a sincere and voluntary obedience rooted in love. This submission encompasses all aspects of life, as long as it aligns with God's commands.
