# Ephesians 5:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Church, in its submission to Christ, exemplifies the wife's submission to her husband. This submission extends to everything that is not contrary to God's will. The husband has authority over the wife, just as Christ has authority over the Church. Wives should respect and obey their husbands, considering his commands to be right and obeying them willingly out of love for him, coupled with honor, fear, and reverence.
