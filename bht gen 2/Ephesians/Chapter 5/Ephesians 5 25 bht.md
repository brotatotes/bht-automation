# Ephesians 5:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave Himself for her. This love should be strong, sincere, and selfless, manifesting in both private and public. Husbands should recognize that their wives are their companions, helpers, and even part of themselves, and therefore should show them honor and respect. They should look to Christ as the ultimate example of sacrificial love, giving their all to promote the well-being and growth of their wives.

### Henry Alford:
1. "Husbands, love your wives, as also Christ loved the church and gave Himself for her... He might sanctify her, having purified her by the laver of the water in the word." (Commentary on Ephesians 5:25-26) 
2. "We can hardly set aside the reference to the purifying bath of the bride previous to marriage... the 'mandatum divinum' on which Baptism rests... the preached word of faith of which confession is made in baptism, and which carries the real cleansing and regenerating power." (Commentary on Ephesians 5:26)
3. "Thus, the word, preached and received, is the conditional element of purification, the real water of spiritual baptism; that wherein and whereby alone the efficacy of baptism is conveyed, that wherein and whereby we are regenerated, the process of sanctification being subsequent and gradual." (Commentary on Ephesians 5:26)

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Thou hast seen the measure of obedience; now hear also the measure of love."
2. "Do you wish your wife to obey you, as the Church is to obey Christ? Then have a solicitude for her as Christ had for the Church."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The duty of the wife is to obey; the right of the husband is to command. But the apostle would guard against the abuse of that right by enjoining the manifestation of such a spirit on the husband as would secure obedience on the part of the wife."
2. "If a husband wished a rule that would be short, simple, clear, and efficacious, about the manner in which he should regard and treat his wife, he could not find a better one than that here suggested."
3. "Christ laid down his life to save the church; and a husband should feel that it should be one great object of his life to promote the salvation of his wife."

1. "From husbands, on the other hand, the apostle requires that they cherish toward their wives no ordinary love; for to them, also, he holds out the example of Christ..."
2. "If they are honored to bear his image, and to be, in some measure, his representatives, they ought to resemble him also in the discharge of duty."
3. "Let husbands imitate Christ in this respect, that he scrupled not to die for his church."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The husband’s love for his wife is to be of such a kind as leads to self-sacrifice, since the next clause is explanatory: and gave himself up for it."
2. "The exhortation is to the husband, and is no warrant for the selfish exactions of a wife; just as in the other case the duty of submission is no warrant for tyranny."
3. "The fulfilment of one’s own duty is, however, the surest way to secure the fulfilment of the reciprocal duty."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This is the wonderful new point not in Colossians 3:19 that lifts this discussion of the husband's love for his wife to the highest plane."

### John Gill:
1. "Husbands, love your wives, which consists in a strong and cordial affection for them; in a real delight and pleasure in them; in showing respect, and doing honour to them."
2. "This love ought to be hearty and sincere, and not feigned and selfish; it should be shown in private, as well as in public."
