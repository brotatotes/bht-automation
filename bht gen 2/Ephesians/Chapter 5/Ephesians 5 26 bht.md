# Ephesians 5:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through Christ's sacrifice, believers are delivered and atoned for their sins. Baptism serves as a symbol of sanctification, offering a visible confirmation of the inward cleansing. By being washed in the waters of baptism, we are cleansed from both the guilt and power of sin. This act of baptism connects us to the grace that justifies and presents us as pure in the sight of divine justice. The blood of Christ acts as a fountain, providing the necessary cleansing from all sin. Baptism serves as the ordinary means by which believers receive these blessings, linking them to the redemptive power of Christ's sacrifice and the transformative washing in baptism.
