# Ephesians 5:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In His love, God sacrificed Himself to purify and save the church. Baptism serves as a visible confirmation of the inward sanctification that is offered. Through the faithful application of truth to the heart, believers are sanctified, and baptism symbolizes the washing of the soul and union with Christ. The benefits of redemption are connected to the reception of the truth in both the Word and the sacrament of baptism. By His sacrifice, Christ delivers believers from sin, cleanses them with His blood, and justifies them with His righteousness. Baptism, accompanied by the Word, sanctifies and cleanses believers from sin.
