# Ephesians 5:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The purpose of Christ is to present the church as a holy and blameless bride, a church filled with honor and splendor, without any stains or defects. This presentation of the church is not just a future event at the Lord's coming, but it is ongoing in this life as well. Christ adorns the church with holiness, adorning it with internal glory that shines forth outwardly. The goal of this presentation is for the church to live in a holy and unblamable manner before God, free from all spots and blemishes of sin.
