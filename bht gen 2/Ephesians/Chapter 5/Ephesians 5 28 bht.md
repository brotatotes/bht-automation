# Ephesians 5:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A husband should love his wife just as much as he loves himself, taking the same care for her comfort and well-being as he does for his own body.

The kindness and solicitude shown towards a wife will bring happiness and fulfillment, making any effort worth it. Indeed, it is a natural and noble duty for a man to love his wife, for she is as much a part of him as his own body.
