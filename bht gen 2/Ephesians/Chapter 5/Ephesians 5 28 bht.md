# Ephesians 5:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Husbands are instructed to love their wives just as they love themselves, treating them with the same care and consideration they would give to their own bodies. By nurturing and cherishing their wives, husbands are fulfilling their responsibility and nurturing their own well-being. A man's love for his wife is not only a duty but also a source of great happiness and fulfillment, for the love and happiness she imparts to him far exceeds any effort he puts into making her happy.
