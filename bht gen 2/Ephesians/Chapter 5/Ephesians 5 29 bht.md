# Ephesians 5:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For no man ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it. This means that no one neglects or mistreats their own body. In the same way, we should show equal care and concern for our spouse, nourishing them not only physically but also providing emotional support and love. Just as Christ demonstrates his love for the Church, we should exemplify that same kind of love towards our spouse.
