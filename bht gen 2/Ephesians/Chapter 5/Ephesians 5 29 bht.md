# Ephesians 5:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Apologies for the oversight. Taking care of one's own flesh is a natural instinct, as no one has ever hated their own body. This care involves nourishing and cherishing, providing both sustenance and protection. Just as a person should not neglect their own well-being, they should also show the same level of care and concern for their spouse.
