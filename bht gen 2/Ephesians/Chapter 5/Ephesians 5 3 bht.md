# Ephesians 5:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle warns against impurity and covetousness, vices that should not even be mentioned among believers. These sins are closely related, often used interchangeably for sins of impurity and lust. Such sins are unbecoming for saints and followers of Christ, who are called to live a life separated unto God. Instead, Christians are called to gratitude, constantly giving thanks to God for His grace and mercy. Let us distance ourselves from these sins and strive to live a life worthy of our calling.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But fornication and all impurity or covetousness, let it not be even named among you, as becometh saints."
2. "Obscenity and foolish talking or jesting, which are not becoming."
3. "But rather thanksgiving."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Uncleanness" and "covetousness" are taken up again from Ephesians 5:12. The two are so closely allied that the Greek for "covetousness" is used sometimes in Scripture, and often in the Greek Fathers, for sins of impurity.
2. The common principle is the longing to fill one's desire with material objects of sense, outside of God.
3. The expression, "not be even named," applies better to impurity than to "covetousness."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The covetous man, according to Paul, is to be ranked with the sensual, and with idolaters." 
2. "The time 'may' come, therefore, when the covetous man will be regarded as deserving the same rank in the public estimation with the most vicious."
3. "Let it not be once named among you - That is, let it not exist; let there be no occasion for mentioning such a thing among you; let it be wholly unknown."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Or covetousness. Or sets this sin emphatically by itself."
2. "Let it. It refers to each of the sins."

### John Calvin:
1. "Three things are here enumerated, which the apostle desires Christians to hold in such abhorrence, that they shall not even be named, or, in other words, shall be entirely unknown among them."
2. "By uncleanness he means all base and impure lusts; so that this word differs from fornication, only as the whole class differs from a single department."
3. "To this precept he adds the authoritative declaration, that he demands nothing from them but that which becometh saints, — manifestly excluding from the number and fellowship of the saints all fornicators, and impure and covetous persons."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Fornication; to be taken in its strict sense, since this was scarcely accounted a sin among the heathens of that time."
2. "Or covetousness. 'Or' sets this sin by itself, giving special emphasis to the prohibition, while the mention of it here indicates its close connection with sensual sins."
3. "Let it not be even named among you. 'It' refers to each of the sins mentioned. None of them should be talked about unnecessarily."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Debasing like sensuality."
2. "It is 'unbecoming' for a saint to be sensual or covetous."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle proceeds to dehort from several vices, which are unbecoming the dear children and followers of God; and which the love of Christ should constrain them to avoid."
2. "The reason why it is so often taken notice of is, because it was very frequent among the Gentiles, and not thought criminal."
3. "For thus it becomes such who are set apart by God the Father, whose sins are expiated by the blood of Christ, and whose hearts are sanctified by the Spirit of God; who profess the Gospel of Christ, and have a place and a name in God's house, better than that of sons and daughters."

### John Wesley:
1. "Let not any impure love be even named or heard of among you."
2. "Keep at the utmost distance from it, as becometh saints."
