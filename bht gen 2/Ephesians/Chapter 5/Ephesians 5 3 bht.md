# Ephesians 5:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle Paul warns believers against engaging in fornication, impurity, or covetousness. These sins are closely connected and should not even be mentioned among the saints. The covetous person, like the sensual one, is to be counted among idolaters. Christians should hold these vices in such abhorrence that they remain unknown and unheard of within their community. These behaviors are unbecoming for children of God and go against the principles of thanksgiving and holiness. By rejecting impurity and covetousness, believers demonstrate their commitment to living a life that reflects their identity as saints.

2. "By uncleanness he means all base and impure lusts; so that this word differs from fornication, only as the whole class differs from a single department."
