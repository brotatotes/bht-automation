# Ephesians 5:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The connection between Christ and the Church is an unparalleled union. It is a bond that surpasses all other affections and commitments. Just as a woman owes her existence to the man, we owe our entire spiritual being to Christ, our source and head. This union extends beyond the physical, as we are members of His body, of His flesh, and of His bones. This spiritual union with Him is characterized by an extraordinary attachment, stronger than the love for our own flesh and bones. It is a union that nourishes and cherishes us, a sacred connection that defines and transforms our lives.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "As the woman owed her natural being to the man, her source and head, so we owe our entire spiritual being to Christ, our source and head."
2. "we in our entire spiritual relation, body, soul, and Spirit, are one with Christ, God manifested in our humanity, parts and members of His glorified Body."
3. "I would regard the saying as applied to that, past, present, and future, which constitutes Christâ€™s Union to His Bride the Church: His leaving the Fatherâ€™s bosom, which is past; His gradual preparation of the union, which is present; His full consummation of it, which is future."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Christ nourisheth and cherisheth the Church as being of one flesh with Him."
2. "Adam's deep sleep, wherein Eve was formed from out of his opened side, is an emblem of Christ's death, which was the birth of the Spouse, the Church."
3. "It is not our bones and flesh, but 'we' that are spiritually propagated from the manhood of Christ which has flesh and bones."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Scriptures make use of language which is stronger than that employed to describe any other connection; and there is no union of affection so powerful as that which binds the Christian to the Saviour."
2. "So strong is it, that he is willing for it to forsake father, mother, and home; to leave his country, and to abandon his possessions; to go to distant lands and dwell among barbarians to make the Redeemer known; or to go to the cross or the stake from simple love to the Saviour."
3. "There has been manifested on earth nowhere else so strong an attachment as that which binds the Christian to the cross. It is stronger love than that which a man has for his own flesh and bones; for it makes him willing that his flesh should be consumed by fire, or his bones broken on the wheel rather than deny him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Omit of His flesh and of His bones.

### John Calvin:
1. "For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. First, this is no exaggeration, but the simple truth."
2. "Secondly, he does not simply mean that Christ is a partaker of our nature, but expresses something higher and more emphatic."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This holds good, even if we omit the latter half of the verse, which seems necessary, now that the weight of the Sinaitic manuscript (first hand) has been added to that of the two next in age (and of other authorities)."
2. "As however the omission can be accounted for, many good editors retain it. If retained it should be referred to the mystical relation between Christ and His people, which is analogous to the physical derivation of Eve from Adam (comp. Genesis 2:23, of which the clause is a reminiscence) and the union between them."
3. "The idea of vital union with Christ is included as well as that of the derivation of our spiritual life from Him."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "These words are in the Textus Receptus (Authorized Version) supported by D G L P cursives Syriac, etc." 
2. "Certainly not genuine."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ, as man, is of our flesh and of our bones, or a partaker of the same flesh and blood with us; or otherwise, his incarnation would have been of no service to us."
2. "Christ indeed, as God, is the former of all human nature, and, as man, was set up in God's thoughts as the pattern of it; but the apostle is here speaking of the saints, not as men, but as Christians, as new creatures in Christ."
3. "The church may be called, his own flesh, his flesh and bones, on account of the marriage relation she stands in to him, and that spiritual union there is between them, which these phrases are expressive of."

### John Wesley:
1. "Christ nourishes and cherishes the church."
2. "Are as intimately united to Christ, in a spiritual sense, as if we were literally 'flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone'."
