# Ephesians 5:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The powerful bond between Christ and the Church surpasses any other connection. Scripture uses strong language to describe this union, which is rooted in our shared humanity with Christ. Through His incarnation, Christ became a partaker of our flesh and bones, and it is through this connection that He nurtures and cares for the Church. This is not an exaggeration, but a fundamental truth. Our spiritual union with Christ is profound and intimate, making us one with Him. In this union, Christ lovingly nourishes and cherishes the Church, as we are united to Him, like flesh and bone.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "As the woman owed her natural being to the man, her source and head, so we owe our entire spiritual being to Christ, our source and head."
2. "we in our entire spiritual relation, body, soul, and Spirit, are one with Christ, God manifested in our humanity, parts and members of His glorified Body."
3. "I would regard the saying as applied to that, past, present, and future, which constitutes Christâ€™s Union to His Bride the Church: His leaving the Fatherâ€™s bosom, which is past; His gradual preparation of the union, which is present; His full consummation of it, which is future."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Christ nourisheth and cherisheth the Church as being of one flesh with Him."
2. "Adam's deep sleep, wherein Eve was formed from out of his opened side, is an emblem of Christ's death, which was the birth of the Spouse, the Church."
3. "It is not our bones and flesh, but 'we' that are spiritually propagated from the manhood of Christ which has flesh and bones."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Scriptures make use of language which is stronger than that employed to describe any other connection; and there is no union of affection so powerful as that which binds the Christian to the Saviour."
2. "So strong is it, that he is willing for it to forsake father, mother, and home; to leave his country, and to abandon his possessions; to go to distant lands and dwell among barbarians to make the Redeemer known; or to go to the cross or the stake from simple love to the Saviour."
3. "There has been manifested on earth nowhere else so strong an attachment as that which binds the Christian to the cross. It is stronger love than that which a man has for his own flesh and bones; for it makes him willing that his flesh should be consumed by fire, or his bones broken on the wheel rather than deny him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Omit of His flesh and of His bones.

### John Gill:

2. "Christ indeed, as God, is the former of all human nature, and, as man, was set up in God's thoughts as the pattern of it; but the apostle is here speaking of the saints, not as men, but as Christians, as new creatures in Christ."
3. "The church may be called, his own flesh, his flesh and bones, on account of the marriage relation she stands in to him, and that spiritual union there is between them, which these phrases are expressive of."

### John Wesley:
1. "Christ nourishes and cherishes the church."
2. "Are as intimately united to Christ, in a spiritual sense, as if we were literally 'flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone'."
