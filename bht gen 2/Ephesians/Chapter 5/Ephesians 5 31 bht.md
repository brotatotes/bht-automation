# Ephesians 5:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Because of the intimate union between Christ and the Church, the spiritual marriage is established. Just as Eve was formed from Adam, the Church is formed from Christ. Although the natural marriage between a man and a woman is referenced here, the true focus is on the spiritual marriage symbolized by it. Christ is the perfect example for the Church, serving as both the pattern by whom she is formed and her Head, just as a husband is to his wife.

2. "The natural marriage, wherein 'a man leaves father and mother and is joined unto his wife,' is not the principal thing meant here, but the spiritual marriage represented by it."
3. "He is the archetype of the Church, from whom and according to whom, as the pattern, she is formed. He is her Head, as the husband is of the wife."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The meaning of the phrase rendered 'for this cause' is, 'answerably to this; or corresponding to this - that is, to what Paul had just said of the union of believers and the Redeemer."
2. "There is no evidence that the marriage connection was originally designed to symbolize or typify this union, but it may be used to illustrate that connection, and to show the strength of the attachment between the Redeemer and his people."

3. "The saying as applied to that, past, present, and future, which constitutes Christ‚Äôs union to His Bride the Church: His leaving the Father‚Äôs bosom, which is past. His gradual preparation of the union which is present; His full consummation of it, which is future."
