# Ephesians 5:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The spiritual marriage between Christ and the Church mirrors the union of Adam and Eve. Christ, as the archetype and head of the Church, shares His substance with believers, forming one body. This spiritual bond signifies a deep connection and loyalty. The institution of marriage serves as a symbolic representation of this divine union, emphasizing the profound attachment between Christ and His people. It is important to note that the comparison made in this context should be understood solely within the teachings of the New Testament. This perspective on marriage promotes love, unity, and the sacredness of the marital relationship.
