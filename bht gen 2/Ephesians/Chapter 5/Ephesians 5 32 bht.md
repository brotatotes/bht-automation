# Ephesians 5:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The deep and profound truth revealed here is the spiritual union of Christ and the Church, which is likened to the close bond of marriage. This mystery, beyond human understanding, is a figure and emblem of the intimate relationship between Christ and his people. Just as a husband cleaves to his wife, so does Christ have a strong and affectionate bond with his Church. The bringing of Eve to Adam by God himself also carries a mysterious significance, as she was made from Adam's rib and presented to him, signifying the union between them.
