# Ephesians 5:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle redirects his focus to the mutual responsibilities of husbands and wives, reiterating their duties based on the example of Christ and the church. Husbands are called to love their wives as they love themselves, recognizing their unity as one flesh. Conversely, wives should respect and honor their husbands, acknowledging their role as the head and the sacrifice they made in leaving their family for the sake of their marital union.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Nevertheless (not to go further into the mystical bearings of the subject so Meyer), you also (as well as Christ) every one, let each, so love his own wife as himself." 
2. "The wife, for her part, 'I order,' or, 'let her see,' that she fear her husband."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Do ye also (as Christ does) severally each one so love," &c. The words, "severally each one," refer to them in their individual capacity, contrasted with the previous collective view of the members of the Church as the bride of Christ.

### Albert Barnes:
(1) "It is true the world over, that the views which prevail in regard to this relation, determine everything in reference to all other relations of life, and to all other sources of enjoyment."
(2) "No imaginary good that can come out of the violation of the original design; no benefits which females, individual or associated, can confer on mankind by disregarding this arrangement, can be a compensation for the evil that is done."
(3) "When 'commands' begin in the relation of husband and wife, 'happiness' flies; and the moment a husband is 'disposed' to command his wife, or is 'under a necessity' of doing it, that moment he may bid adieu to domestic peace and joy."


### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Not to dwell longer on the mystical aspect of the subject."
2. "Even as himself."
3. "Not as much as he loves himself, but as being his very self."

### John Calvin:
1. "Husbands are required to love their wives, and wives to fear (Ï†Î¿Î²á½¢Ï„Î±Î¹) their husbands, understanding by fear that reverence which will lead them to be submissive. Where reverence does not exist, there will be no willing subjection."
2. "One peculiarity in this injunction has been usually overlooked. What is instructive on either side is not enforced, but what is necessary to direct and hallow such an instinct is inculcated. The woman loves in deep, undying sympathy; but, to teach her how this fondness should know and fill its appropriate sphere, she is commanded to obey and honor."
3. "The man, on the other hand, feels that his position is to govern; but, to show him what should be the essence and means of his government, he is enjoined to love."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Do ye also severally love" - An unusual idiom. The verb Î±Î³Î±Ï€Î±Ï„Ï‰ (present active imperative) agrees with ÎµÎºÎ±ÏƒÏ„Î¿Ï‚ and so is third singular instead of Î±Î³Î±Ï€Î±Ï„Îµ (second plural) like Ï…Î¼ÎµÎ¹Ï‚. The use of Î¿ ÎºÎ±Î¸' ÎµÎ½Î± after Ï…Î¼ÎµÎ¹Ï‚ = "ye one by one" and then ÎµÎºÎ±ÏƒÏ„Î¿Ï‚ takes up (individualizes) the "one" in partitive apposition and in the third person.
2. "Let the wife see that she fear" - There is no verb in the Greek for "let see" (Î²Î»ÎµÏ€ÎµÏ„Ï‰). For this use of Î¹Î½Î± with the subjunctive as a practical imperative without a principal verb (an elliptical imperative) see Mark 5:23; Matthew 20:32; 1 Corinthians 7:29; 2 Corinthians 8:7; Ephesians 4:29; Ephesians 5:33.
3. "Fear" - Here is "reverence."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle returns to his former subject, and recapitulates the mutual duties of husband and wife, after he had enforced them from the instance and example of Christ, and his church." 
2. "The husband should love his wife even as himself; since they two are one flesh."
3. "The wife should reverence her husband; since he leaves father and mother for her, and is the head of her."
