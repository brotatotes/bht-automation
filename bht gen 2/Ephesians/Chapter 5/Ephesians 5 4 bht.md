# Ephesians 5:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let our conversations be marked by sincerity, seriousness, and sensibility, for we are accountable for every idle word spoken. Levity and jesting have no place in the life of a Christian, as they are inconsistent with true dignity and the gospel. Our speech should be both gracious and grateful, filled with thanksgiving to God, driving away all unwholesome talk. Let us guard against filthiness, foolish talking, and jesting, for they corrupt the mind, hinder spiritual growth, and do not honor our calling as followers of Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "filthiness—obscenity in act or gesture."
2. "foolish talking—the talk of fools, which is folly and sin together."
3. "refined 'persiflage' and 'badinage,' for which Ephesus was famed."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Christians should aim to have their conversation sensible, serious, sincere - remembering the words of the Lord Jesus, 'that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.'"
2. "Levity and jesting, though often manifested by ministers and other Christians, are as inconsistent with true dignity as with the gospel."
3. "The true course of life is midway between moroseness and levity; sourness and lightness; harshness and jesting. Be benevolent, kind, cheerful, bland, courteous, but serious."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Words obtain a new earnestness when assumed into the ethical terminology of Christ's school."
2. "The sense of the word here is polished and witty speech as the instrument of sin; refinement and versatility without the flavor of Christian grace."
3. "Sometimes it is lodged in a sly question, in a smart answer, in a quirkish reason, in shrewd intimation, in cunningly diverting or cleverly retorting an objection: sometimes it is couched in a bold scheme of speech, in a tart irony, in a lusty hyperbole, in a startling metaphor, in a plausible reconciling of contradictions, or in acute nonsense.... Its ways are unaccountable and inexplicable, being answerable to the numberless rovings of fancy and windings of language."

### John Calvin:
1. "By filthiness I understand all that is indecent or inconsistent with the modesty of the godly."
2. "But as it is exceedingly difficult to be witty without becoming satirical, and as jesting itself carries in it a portion of conceit not at all in keeping with the character of a godly man, Paul very properly dissuades from this practice."
3. "All our conversations ought to be, in the true sense of the words, sweet and graceful; and this end will be gained if the useful and the agreeable are properly mingled."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Neither filthiness, or, 'obscenity;' whether of thought, word, or deed; in Colossians 3:8 the reference is to words."
2. "Nor foolish talking; insipid, stupid speech, perhaps including more than this: 'the talk of fools, which is folly and sin together' (Trench)."
3. "But rather giving of thanks. Either, thanksgiving rather is 'fitting,' or, let it be among you (from Ephesians 5:3). The latter is preferable. 'Thanksgiving' is not to be explained as 'gracious speech,' or 'devoutness,' but means giving of thanks to God. This is the proper tone of Christian speech, and this will drive off the evil habits just spoken of: 'to the abuse of the tongue is opposed this holy and yet glad use; Ephesians 5:18-19' (Bengel)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Filthiness (αισχροτης). Old word from αισχρος (base), here alone in N.T."
2. "Foolish talking (μωρολογια). Late word from μωρολογος (μωροσ, λογος), only here in N.T."
3. "Jesting (ευτραπελια). Old word from ευτραπελος (ευ, τρεπω, to turn) nimbleness of wit, quickness in making repartee (so in Plato and Plutarch), but in low sense as here ribaldry, scurrility, only here in N.T."

### John Gill:
1. "The former of these may include all filthy gestures and behaviour, every indecent habit and attire, and all actions which have a tendency to excite lust; and also all impure words, these discover an impure heart, and are the means of corrupting men's minds and manners."
2. "Foolish talking does not so much design every imprudent thing that is said, as that which is wicked, corrupt, unsavoury, light, vain, idle, and unprofitable; and takes in all fabulous stories, and mimicking of fools in words and gestures."
3. "Jesting, when it is with wantonness, and excites unto it, and is inconsistent with truth, and when the Scriptures are abused by it, and not our neighbour's edification, but hurt, is promoted by it, ought not to be used."

### John Wesley:
1. "Nor foolish talking - Tittle tattle, talking of nothing, the weather, fashions, meat and drink."
2. "Or jesting - The word properly means, wittiness, facetiousness, esteemed by the heathens an half-virtue. But how frequently even this quenches the Spirit, those who are tender of conscience know."
3. "Which are not convenient - For a Christian; as neither increasing his faith nor holiness."
