# Ephesians 5:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Engaging in sexual immorality, covetousness, or idolatry can have serious consequences, as it may prevent individuals from inheriting the Kingdom of God. These warnings serve as reminders that our actions have eternal significance. Covetousness, in particular, is a dangerous form of idolatry, as it replaces God with a desire for material wealth. However, it is essential to remember that the exclusion from the Kingdom of God is not predetermined, as there is still hope for redemption and salvation through God's grace and the righteousness of Christ. It is through this grace that individuals can find forgiveness and restoration.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For this ye know... being aware that every fornicator or unclean man, or covetous man, which is an idolater, hath not inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ and God." 
2. "The present implying more the fixedness of the exclusion, grounded on the eternal verities of that Kingdom, than mere future certainty."
3. "Nor is any specification needed that the Kingdom of Christ is also the Kingdom of God, as would be made with the second article. This follows as a matter of course: and thus the words bear no legitimate rendering, except on the substratum of our Lordâ€™s Divinity."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Covetousness is worship of the creature instead of the Creator, the highest treason against the King of kings."
2. "The present implies the fixedness of the exclusion, grounded on the eternal verities of that kingdom."
3. "The perfect oneness of Christ and God is consistent only with the doctrine that Christ is God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The object here is to deter from indulgence in those vices by the solemn assurance that no one who committed them could possibly be saved." 
2. "To worship money is as real idolatry as to worship a block of stone."
3. "What a world of shame will hell be! How dishonorable and disgraceful to be damned forever, and to linger on in eternal fires, because the man was too polluted to be admitted into pure society!"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The A. V. fails to give the whole force of the expression, which is, ye know recognizing."
2. "Rev., ye know of a surety."
3. "Idolater. Compare Colossians 3:5, and see on 1 Corinthians 5:10."

### John Calvin:
1. "He determines, therefore, to alarm them by this weighty and dreadful threatening, that such vices shut against us the kingdom of God."
2. "After addressing the Corinthians in the same language, he adds: 'And such were some of you; but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified, in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.'"
3. "All covetous men must deny God, and put wealth in his place; such is their blind greediness of wretched gain."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The covetous man makes wealth his God; this is now the most common form of idolatry, and the Scriptures plainly reveal its sinfulness."
2. "There is no cure for this destructive love of money, but using it for other than selfish purposes. Riches, therefore, must ruin their possessor unless he employs them for the good of others and for the glory of God."

2. "The covetous man may be called an idolater, because the idolater and he worship the same in substance, gold and silver..."
3. "Now the meaning of these words is, not that all who have been guilty of these sins shall be excluded the kingdom of God, but all such who live and die in them, without the grace of God, and righteousness of Christ."
