# Ephesians 5:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Anyone who engages in immoral practices such as fornication, adultery, or incest is not fit for the Kingdom of God. The covetous person is also considered an idolater because both the idolater and the covetous person worship material possessions such as gold and silver. However, it is important to note that these verses do not imply that everyone who has committed these sins will be excluded from the Kingdom of God, but rather those who persist in these sins without repentance and without the transforming power of God's grace and righteousness.

2. "The present implying more the fixedness of the exclusion, grounded on the eternal verities of that Kingdom, than mere future certainty."
