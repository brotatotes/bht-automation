# Ephesians 5:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let no one deceive you with empty words, for these things are not as innocent and insignificant as the heathens may think. Those who try to convince you otherwise are mere dealers in vain and empty words. Be aware that the wrath of God will come upon those who engage in such disobedient behavior.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Let no one deceive you with vain sayings, for on account of these things cometh the wrath of God."
2. "The caution was especially needed, at a time when moral purity was so generally regarded as a thing indifferent."
3. "The active and practical side of the state of the disobedient is here brought out, implying their identity in a manner full of the highest instruction."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "vain—empty, unreal words,
	namely, palliations of 'uncleanness,' Ephesians 5:3;
	Ephesians 5:4; Isaiah 5:20
	(that it is natural to indulge in love), 'covetousness'
	(that it is useful to society that men should pursue gain), and
	'jesting' (that it is witty and clever, and that God will
	not so severely punish for such things)."
2. "because of these
	things—uncleanness, covetousness, c. (Isaiah 5:20- :). 
	cometh—present, not
	merely 'shall come.' Is as sure as if already come."
3. "children—rather, 'sons
	of disobedience' (Ephesians 2:2
Ephesians 2:3). The children of
	unbelief in doctrine (Deuteronomy 32:20)
	are 'children of disobedience' in practice, and
	these again are 'children of wrath'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Let no man deceive you... there will be no danger from practicing these vices."
2. "It required, therefore, all the authority of an apostle to convince them, that however plausible were the arguments in defense of them, they certainly exposed those who practiced them to the wrath of God."
3. "For because of these things cometh the wrath of God... upon the children of disobedience."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Vain. Plausible, but devoid of truth, and employed to palliate heathen vices.

### John Calvin:
1. "Let no man deceive you. There have always been ungodly dogs, by whom the threatenings of the prophets were made the subject of merriment and ridicule."
2. "Paul...exclaims that we must guard against that sophistry by which consciences are ensnared to their ruin."
3. "God does not make himself an object of terror to his children, that they may avoid him, but does all that can be done in a fatherly manner, to draw them to himself."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "With empty words (κενοις λογοις). Instrumental case."
2. "Probably Paul has in mind the same Gnostic praters as in Colossians 2:4."
3. "See Ephesians 2:2."

### John Gill:
1. "Let no man deceive you with vain words... for because of these things... the wrath of God cometh upon the children of disobedience." 
2. "There have been instances of it; it is usually the case, and always if grace prevents not; this wrath comes down from above, and sometimes suddenly, with great force and power, like a mighty flood; and there is no standing up under it, and against it." 
3. "It shows how much these things are displeasing to God, and resented by him, and therefore should be avoided by his people; and the consideration of their not being appointed to this wrath, though deserving of it as others, and of their deliverance from it by Christ, should engage them the more to abstain from these sins."

### John Wesley:
1. "As innocent as the heathens esteem them."
2. "Those dealers in vain words would persuade you to think them."
