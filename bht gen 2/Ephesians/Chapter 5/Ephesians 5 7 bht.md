# Ephesians 5:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Be not ye therefore partakers with them warns against lapsing into old vices and becoming joint shares with those who engage in sinful acts of disobedience. It is a call to avoid fellowship with wicked workers and to disassociate oneself from their wicked works. Believers are urged to refrain from becoming like them, abetting and encouraging sinful practices, or committing the same things. By doing so, they can avoid displeasing God and exposing themselves to His wrath.
