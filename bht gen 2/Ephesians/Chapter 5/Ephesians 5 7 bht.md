# Ephesians 5:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Be not ye therefore partakers with them is a warning against lapsing into old vices and becoming like those who practice wickedness. It is a call to avoid fellowship with the sons of disobedience and to distance oneself from their sinful actions. Instead of becoming partakers with them, believers are called to walk in the light, living in a way that pleases God and brings glory to His name.
