# Ephesians 5:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The fruit of the light consists in goodness, righteousness, and truth, as opposed to the unfruitful works of darkness. Believers are called to exhibit these qualities in their lives, showing that they are children of light. Such obedience is a testimony of the work of the Holy Spirit and the grace of God. Just as a tree is nourished by its roots and produces fruit, so too are believers, with Christ as their foundation and the Spirit as their sustenance, called to bear the fruit of righteousness.
