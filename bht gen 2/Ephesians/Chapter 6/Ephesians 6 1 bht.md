# Ephesians 6:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Children should obey and submit to their parents. This means carrying out their parents' commands and subjecting themselves to their authority. Obedience to parents is essential to the Christian faith and is an act of honor. It extends to all that is lawful and good. This obedience is not limited to matters that are sinful or unlawful. It is a sincere and heartfelt obedience, expressing gratitude for past favors. Obedience to parents is supported by the light of nature and is just and reasonable according to God's commandments.

3. "Even by natural law we should render obedience to them from whom we have derived life."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Obey your parents - This is the first great duty which God has enjoined on children. It is, to do what their parents command them to do."
2. "No child that is disobedient to a parent will be obedient to God; and that child that is most obedient to a father and mother will be most likely to become a Christian, and an heir of heaven."
3. "When a parent, however, is opposed to a child; when he expresses an unwillingness that a child should attend a particular church, or make a profession of religion, such opposition should in all cases be a sufficient reason for the child to pause and re-examine the subject."

### Marvin Vincent:
