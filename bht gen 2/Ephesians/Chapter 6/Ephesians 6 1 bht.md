# Ephesians 6:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Children should wholeheartedly obey their parents in all things that are lawful, just, and good, as it is their duty to submit to those who have authority over them. This obedience, rooted in gratitude and heartfelt sincerity, goes beyond mere words or appearance. The obligation to obey parents is not only recognized by nature and reason, but it is also justified by God's law, which commands only what is holy and just. Ultimately, children should obey their parents as a way of honoring and pleasing the Lord, who has given this command for their own good.
