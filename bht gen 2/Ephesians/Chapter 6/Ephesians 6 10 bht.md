# Ephesians 6:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might. To face the battles of the Christian life, we need to be strong. It is not enough to be weak and remain so, as it would lead to our downfall. We require great assistance, the powerful exertion of God's might. We must rely on Him and His strength, which is communicated to us through our meditation, prayer, faith, and the enabling of the Holy Spirit.
