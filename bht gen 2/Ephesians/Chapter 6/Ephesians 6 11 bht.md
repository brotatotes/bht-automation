# Ephesians 6:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Put on the complete armour of God, which God himself has provided for us and furnishes us with, in order to stand against our crafty and strong adversary. It is a full suit of armour that we need, not just a piece or two. The repeated call to put it on reminds us of the strength and subtlety of our adversaries and the challenge that lies ahead. With the whole armour of God, we not only stand our ground, but also confound our enemies' schemes and overcome them through the strength and love of Christ.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "No opening at the head, the feet, the heart, the belly, the eye, the ear, or the tongue, is to be given to Satan."
2. "Believers have once for all overcome him; but on the ground of this fundamental victory gained over him, they are ever again to fight against and overcome him."
3. "The armor of God is furnished by God; not our own, else it would not stand. It is spiritual, therefore, and mighty through God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That we are not to provide in our warfare such weapons as people employ in their contests, but such as God provides."
2. "A man needs 'all' that armor if he is about to fight the battles of the Lord; and if he lacks 'one' of the weapons which God has appointed, defeat may be the consequence."
3. "Satan does not carry on an open warfare. He does not meet the Christian soldier face to face. He advances covertly; makes his approaches in darkness; employs cunning rather than power, and seeks rather to delude and betray than to vanquish by mere force."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The armor is a defense against strategy as well as assault."
2. "The devil...used as the equivalent of Satan (hater or accuser)...the enemy of mankind."
3. "In the New Testament... as a proper name, except in the Pastoral Epistles, where it has its ordinary meaning slanderous."

### John Calvin:

2. "To quicken our vigilance, he reminds us that we must not only engage in open warfare, but that we have a crafty and insidious foe to encounter."

2. "Of God. Supplied by God, 'altogether of a Divine kind, in contrast to the arms of the opponent.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Put on (ενδυσασθε). Like Ephesians 3:12. See also Ephesians 4:24."
2. "Our 'panoply.' Polybius gives this list of Thayer. Paul omits the lance (spear). Our museums preserve specimens of this armour as well as the medieval coat-of-mail."
