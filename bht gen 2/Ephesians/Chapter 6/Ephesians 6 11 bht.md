# Ephesians 6:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are encouraged to put on the complete suit of armor that God has provided to stand against and overcome Satan's tactics. This armor, which is furnished by God, is not to be taken lightly and must be worn in its entirety. As believers face their crafty foe, they can confidently engage in the spiritual battle, confounding his schemes and emerging as more than conquerors. It is crucial to put on the full armor of God due to the strength and subtlety of our adversaries, especially during challenging times.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "No opening at the head, the feet, the heart, the belly, the eye, the ear, or the tongue, is to be given to Satan."
2. "Believers have once for all overcome him; but on the ground of this fundamental victory gained over him, they are ever again to fight against and overcome him."
3. "The armor of God is furnished by God; not our own, else it would not stand. It is spiritual, therefore, and mighty through God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That we are not to provide in our warfare such weapons as people employ in their contests, but such as God provides."
2. "A man needs 'all' that armor if he is about to fight the battles of the Lord; and if he lacks 'one' of the weapons which God has appointed, defeat may be the consequence."
3. "Satan does not carry on an open warfare. He does not meet the Christian soldier face to face. He advances covertly; makes his approaches in darkness; employs cunning rather than power, and seeks rather to delude and betray than to vanquish by mere force."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The armor is a defense against strategy as well as assault."
2. "The devil...used as the equivalent of Satan (hater or accuser)...the enemy of mankind."
3. "In the New Testament... as a proper name, except in the Pastoral Epistles, where it has its ordinary meaning slanderous."

### John Calvin:
1. "God has furnished us with various defensive weapons, provided we do not indolently refuse what is offered."

3. "He is a crafty foe and knows the weak spots in the Christian's armour."

### John Gill:

2. "The armour of God should be put on, which is proof against all his might and craft, in order to stand against him, oppose him, and fight, and get the victory over him." 
3. "They not only stand their ground in the strength of Christ, and by the use of their armour confound his schemes, and baffle all his arts and stratagems, but are more than conquerors through him that has loved them."
