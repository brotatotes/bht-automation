# Ephesians 6:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our wrestling is not merely a physical battle against human opponents, but it extends far beyond that. We face a spiritual conflict against the rulers, powers, and world-rulers of darkness. These are not earthly adversaries, but rather the evil spiritual armies that oppose us. They are like wicked spirits lurking in the heavenly places, always seeking to imitate and corrupt the work of God. The Christian journey is one of constant warfare against these forces, and we must be equipped with the panoply of God, the spiritual armor, to withstand their attacks.

### Henry Alford:
1. "our wrestling is not with men but against the governments, against the powers, against the world-rulers...of this darkness"
2. "the spiritual armies of wickedness"
3. "That habitation of the evil spirits which...was said, when speaking of mere matters of fact, to be in the air, is, now that the difficulty and importance of the Christian conflict is being forcibly set forth, represented as in the heavenly places over us, and too strong for us without the panoply of God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The real foe lurking behind them is Satan himself, with whom our conflict is."
2. "Nowhere does the satanic kingdom come more clearly into view than in the Gospels which treat of Christ, the true Light."
3. "Satan tries to parody, or imitate in a perverted way, God's working."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "The apostle does not mean to say that Christians had no enemies among men that opposed them, for they were exposed often to fiery persecution..."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Our wrestling is, palh wrestling, only here."
2. "Principalities and powers...world-rulers of this darkness."
3. "The phrase is collective, of the evil powers viewed as a body."

### John Calvin:
1. "The meaning is, that our difficulties are far greater than if we had to fight with men."
2. "Our natural disposition would lead us to direct all our exertions against the men themselves; but this foolish desire will be restrained by the consideration that the men who annoy us are nothing more than darts thrown by the hand of Satan."

### John Gill:
1. "This is a reason why saints should be strong in the Lord, and why they should put on the whole armour of God, and prepare for battle, since their enemies are such as here described: not 'flesh and blood'."
2. "The enemy being the devil, and the armour spiritual; wherefore the devils are here designed, who are described from their power, rule, and government."
3. "These wicked spirits may be said to be in 'high' or 'heavenly places'; not in places super celestial, or in the highest heavens, in the third heaven, where God, angels, and saints are; but in the aerial heavens, where the power or posse of devils reside, and where they are above us, over our heads, overlooking us, and watching every advantage against us."

### John Wesley:
1. "For our wrestling is not only, not chiefly, against flesh and blood - Weak men, or fleshly appetites.But against principalities, against powers â€” The mighty princes of all the infernal legions."

3. "Against wicked spirits â€” Who continually oppose faith, love, holiness, either by force or fraud; and labour to infuse unbelief, pride, idolatry malice, envy, anger, hatred."
