# Ephesians 6:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the face of the evil day, we are called to take up the complete armor of God, not to create it ourselves, but to receive what God has already provided. This armor is necessary to withstand the ongoing battle, for the war against evil is perpetual and may intensify or lessen with each passing day. Our objective is to accomplish all that is necessary for the fight, to leave no task unfinished, and to stand firm, having vanquished every enemy that opposes us.
