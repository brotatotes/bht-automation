# Ephesians 6:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To withstand the attacks of evil, we are called to take up the entire armor of God. This armor is not something we create, but rather something we receive from God. It is crucial to always have our armor on, ready for the ongoing spiritual battle. We must fully equip ourselves and accomplish all that is necessary for the fight. By putting on this armor and relying on the power of God, we can confidently face the challenges and temptations of the evil day. With God's armor, we are assured of safety and victory in the battle against darkness.
