# Ephesians 6:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Christians, our aim is to stand firm in the face of conflict, not yielding or fleeing. Truth is the band that girds up and keeps together our character, allowing us to act unencumbered. Our righteousness is not just imputed, but inwrought by the Spirit, preserving us from attacks. The breastplate covers our vital parts, just as righteousness preserves our hearts. Let us stand our ground, equipped with the truth and integrity, with the righteousness of Christ as our defense.
