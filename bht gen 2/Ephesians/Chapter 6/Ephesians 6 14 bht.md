# Ephesians 6:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Christian soldier's primary objective is to stand firm and unwavering, not yielding or fleeing. The girdle of truth, which signifies a heart aligned with God's truth, is crucial for preserving unity, consistency, and sincerity. The righteousness of Christ, both imputed and inwrought, acts as a protective breastplate, guarding against Satan's accusations and securing us from condemnation. By continuing in our station, with an obedient heart and adorned with the righteousness of Christ, we can be prepared for the battles we face as believers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Truth is the band and expediter of the Christianâ€™s work in the conflict, without which all his armour would be but encumbrance."
2. "The righteousness spoken of is the purity and uprightness of Christian character which is the result of the work of the Spirit of Christ; the inwrought righteousness of Christ, not merely the imputed righteousness."
3. "The shield of faith will at all times and in all combats quench the fiery darts of the wicked one."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Standing, that is, maintaining our ground, not yielding or fleeing, is the grand aim of the Christian soldier."
2. "Truth is the band that girds up and keeps together the flowing robes, so as that the Christian soldier may be unencumbered for action."
3. "Christ's righteousness inwrought in us by the Spirit."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The girdle was often highly ornamented, and was the place where they carried their money, their sword, their pipe, their writing instruments, etc.; see the notes on Matthew 5:38-41."
2. "Truth preserves a man from those lax views of morals, of duty and of religion, which leave him exposed to every assault. It makes the soul sincere, firm, constant, and always on its guard."
3. "The integrity of life, and righteousness of character, is as necessary to defend us from the assaults of Satan, as the coat of mail was to preserve the heart from the arrows of an enemy."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The principal terms in this description of the christian armor are taken from the Septuagint of Isaiah."
2. "Truth gives unity to the different virtues, and determinateness and consistency to character."
3. "The breastplate covers the vital parts, as the heart."

### John Calvin:
1. "Nothing can be more idle than the extraordinary pains which some have taken to discover the reason why righteousness is made a breastplate, instead of a girdle."
2. "Paul's design was to touch briefly on the most important points required in a Christian, and to adapt them to the comparison which he had already used."
3. "He enjoins us to be adorned, first, with integrity, and next with a devout and holy life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Stand ready for the fight, as the description of the armor indicates; others include the thought of standing in the fight." 
2. "By [the girdle of truth] is not meant the word of God, which is mentioned in Ephesians 6:17, nor sincerity, nor mere truthfulness (in the sense of telling the truth); nor does the figure suggest a mere ornament. It refers to the state of heart answering to Godâ€™s truth, the agreement of our convictions with what God has revealed."
3. "But righteousness from Him is both imputed and inwrought; He both justifies and sanctifies His people. Both are probably included here, but more particularly the moral purity wrought in us by the Spirit of God, which has as its necessary basis Godâ€™s accounting us righteous for Christâ€™s sake."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Take your stand therefore" (in view of the arguments made).

3. "Same metaphor of righteousness as breastplate."

### John Gill:
1. "Continue in the station in which you are placed, keep your post, be upon your watch, stand upon your guard."
2. "The girdle is a part of armour, and so considerable as sometimes to be put for the whole."
3. "Understand this of the righteousness of Christ, which being imputed by God, and received by faith, is a guard against, and repels the accusations and charges of Satan, and is a security from all wrath and condemnation."

### John Wesley:
1. "Not only with the truths of the gospel, but with 'truth in the inward parts;' for without this all our knowledge of divine truth will prove but a poor girdle 'in the evil day.'" 
2. "And as a girded man is always ready to go on, so this seems to intimate an obedient heart, a ready will." 
3. "The righteousness of a spotless purity, in which Christ will present us faultless before God, through the merit of his own blood."
