## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The 'preparedness,' or 'readiness of,' that is, arising from the 'Gospel.'"
2. "Preparedness to do and suffer all that God wills; readiness for march, as a Christian soldier."
3. "The 'peace' within forms a beautiful contrast to the raging of the outward conflict."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There is undoubtedly an allusion here to what was worn by the ancient soldier to guard his feet."
2. "The Christian soldier is to be prepared with the gospel of peace to meet attacks similar to those against which the ancient soldier designed to guard himself."
3. "Christians were to have the principles of the gospel of peace - the peaceful and pure gospel - to facilitate them; to aid them in their marches; to make them firm in the day of conflict with their foes."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Preparation. Only here in the New Testament."
2. "The Roman soldier substituted for the greaves of the Greek the caligae or sandals, bound by thongs over the instep and round the ankle, and having the soles thickly studded with nails."
3. "Etoimasia means readiness; but in Hellenistic Greek it was sometimes used in the sense of establishment or firm foundation, which would suit this passage: firm - footing."

### John Calvin:
1. "We must be shod with the gospel, if we would pass unhurt through the world."
2. "It is the gospel of peace...from its effects; for it is the message of our reconciliation to God, and nothing else gives peace to the conscience."
3. "We are enjoined to lay aside every hinderance, and to be prepared both for journey and for war. By nature we dislike exertion, and want agility. A rough road and many other obstacles retard our progress, and we are discouraged by the smallest annoyance. On these accounts, Paul holds out the gospel as the fittest means for undertaking and performing the expedition."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Roman soldier wore sandals, in the soles of which nails were thickly studded, to give firm footing. Doubtless Paul had this in mind."
2. "This 'preparedness' is more than a natural readiness or courage, it comes from the gospel of peace, the gospel whose contents are peace with God. This gives alacrity and courage to fight boldly for the sake of eternal peace."
3. "Peaceableness toward men is not excluded; but there is no reference to readiness to preach the gospel. That is the aggressive, not the defensive part, of our duty."

2. "Readiness of mind that comes from the gospel whose message is peace." (2)

### John Gill:
1. "The Gospel is so called, because it makes men to be of peaceable tempers and behaviour, and gives peace to distressed minds."
2. "The 'preparation' of it does not design a promptitude or readiness to preach the Gospel, but a firm and solid knowledge of the Gospel, as it publishes peace by Jesus Christ, which yields a sure foundation for the Christian soldier to set his foot upon, and stand fast on."
3. "For the feet to be 'shod with' it, does not mean the outward conversation being agreeably to the Gospel, but it designs the constant and firm standing of believers in the faith of the Gospel, and so striving and contending for it, without being moved from it, that it may continue with them."

### John Wesley:
1. "And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel — Let this be always ready to direct and confirm you in every step."
2. "Our feet must be so shod, that our footsteps slip not. To order our life and conversation aright, we are prepared by the gospel blessing, the peace and love of God ruling in the heart."
3. "By this only can we tread the rough ways, surmount our difficulties, and hold out to the end."
