# Ephesians 6:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Faith is a shield that covers and defends the Christian, protecting them from the attacks of the enemy. It is like a large stone against the door, solid and substantial, able to repel and conquer. Furthermore, Christ Himself is a shield, holding up and opposing all charges and objections of Satan. With faith, we can quench the fiery darts of temptation, preventing their malignant influence. These temptations are like violent and sudden injections from the devil, but with a strong and lively faith, we can overcome.
