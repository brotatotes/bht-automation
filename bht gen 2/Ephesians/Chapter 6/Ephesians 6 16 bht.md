# Ephesians 6:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The shield of faith serves as the ultimate defense, covering all that came before it. Just as a soldier uses a shield to intercept and extinguish the fiery darts of the enemy, faith conquers the temptations that come our way. The fiery darts of the wicked, which are like spiritual attacks and suggestions of evil, can be deflected and quenched by the shield of faith. By exercising a strong and lively faith, holding it up as a shield, we can overcome even the most furious and violent temptations that the devil throws our way.
