# Ephesians 6:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The helmet of salvation protects the head, defending the soul with a firm hope that shields against disappointment. The sword of the Spirit, the word of God, is a potent weapon for the Christian, capable of both attacking and parrying the enemy. It is a vital offensive tool given by the Spirit, made and wielded by the Spirit. The Bible, particularly the New Testament, has long been the primary weapon in the Christian's warfare throughout history, making it the sword of the Spirit. The simple declarations of Scripture safeguard us against false doctrines and temptations, proving more effective than worldly philosophies.
