# Ephesians 6:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The helmet of salvation is a vital piece of armor that protects the head. It is not just a mere hope, but a confident hope that brings no shame or disappointment. The word of God, which is likened to a two-edged sword, serves as both an offensive and defensive weapon. It convicts of sin and cuts down all human pride. Armed with the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, we are equipped to defend ourselves against falsehoods and boldly proclaim the mystery of the gospel with confidence and freedom.
