# Ephesians 6:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of all our activities, we are called to pray without ceasing, on all occasions, inwardly and outwardly, constantly repeating and urging our prayers, just as Christ did in the garden. We are to persevere in fervent intercession, praying for all the saints, that they may fulfill God's will and remain steadfast until the end. Through prayer, we crown our endeavors with success, find strength in times of temptation, and experience the victory that comes from relying on God.
