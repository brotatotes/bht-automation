# Ephesians 6:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul's plea for prayer reveals the humility and awareness of the immense task of ministry. No matter how gifted or capable one may be, the support of fellow believers is indispensable. The Gospel is not a matter of human reasoning but a divine mystery unveiled by revelation. Therefore, it requires boldness and courage to proclaim it openly. Paul's desire for prayer demonstrates his reliance on God's strength to overcome obstacles and speak forthrightly. Just as he sought the support of others, we should also intercede for one another, praying for the courage to boldly proclaim the Gospel.
