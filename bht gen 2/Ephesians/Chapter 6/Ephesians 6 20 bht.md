# Ephesians 6:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul, as Christ's ambassador, is a striking contrast to the customary display of pomp that characterizes human ambassadors. The humbled state of Paul, bound in chains, sets him apart and highlights the essence of his role. Unlike worldly ambassadors who rely on grandeur and ostentation, Paul's commitment to representing Christ is characterized by humility and endurance. Although physically restrained, Paul's unwavering mission as an ambassador continues to shine through, demonstrating the true call and dedication of one who represents Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Ambassadors were held inviolable by the law of nations, and could not, without outrage to every sacred right, be put in chains." 
2. "Yet Christ's 'ambassador is in a chain!'" 
3. "The Greek is singular. The Romans used to bind a prisoner to a soldier by a single chain, in a kind of free custody."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There is something especially touching in this. He was 'an ambassador' - sent to proclaim peace to a lost world. But he was now in chains."
2. "An ambassador is a sacred character. No greater affront can be given to a nation than to put its ambassadors to death, or even to throw them into prison."
3. "Paul felt that the gospel ought always to be spoken with plainness, and without the fear of man. It is remarkable that he did not ask them to pray that he might be released."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "Fear hinders us from preaching Christ openly and fearlessly, while the absence of all restraint and disguise in confessing Christ is demanded from his ministers."
3. "Paul does not ask for himself the powers of an acute debater, or, I should rather say, of a dexterous sophist, that he might shield himself from his enemies by false pretences. It is, that I may open my mouth, to make a clear and strong confession; for when the mouth is half shut, the sounds which it utters are doubtful and confused."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Even when chained to a Roman soldier, he was still an ambassador of God to proclaim the gospel mystery."
2. "They ought thus to pray for him, still more in view of his condition."
3. "That he might expound his message in a manner that became him and his high commission, that his imprisonment might have no dispiriting effect upon him, and that he might not in his addresses compromise the name and dignity of an ambassador for Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul is now an old man (πρεσβυτης, Philemon 1:9) and feels the dignity of his position as Christ's ambassador though 'in a chain' (εν αλυσε, old word αλυσις, from α privative and λυω, to loosen)." 
2. "Paul will wear a chain at the close of his life in Rome (2 Timothy 1:16)."
3. "This is probably a second purpose (ινα), the first for utterance (ινα δοθη), this for boldness (ινα παρρησιασωμα, first aorist middle subjunctive, old word to speak out boldly)."

### John Gill:
1. "The character the apostle bore was that of an ambassador… he represented him, he was sent by him."
2. "He was chiefly an ambassador to the Gentiles, which showed great condescension in Christ to send him to them."
3. "An ambassador, especially an ambassador of Christ, that comes with his Gospel, and more especially that is suffering for it, ought to be received, heard, and honoured."

### John Wesley:
1. "The ambassadors of men usually appear in great pomp."
2. "How differently does the ambassador of Christ appear!"
3. "An ambassador in bonds."
