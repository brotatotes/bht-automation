# Ephesians 6:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul's identity as an ambassador for Christ is highlighted through his situation as an ambassador in chains. While ambassadors are usually respected and honored, Paul's circumstances in chains showcase the stark contrast. However, despite being physically bound, Paul's role as an ambassador remains unaltered. His commitment to proclaim the gospel fearlessly is unwavering, even in the face of adversity. The chains he wears do not diminish his authority or dampen his zeal. Instead, they serve as a catalyst for him to boldly articulate the message of peace and reconciliation, demonstrating his unwavering faith in Christ.
