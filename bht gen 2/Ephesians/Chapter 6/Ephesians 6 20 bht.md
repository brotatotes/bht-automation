# Ephesians 6:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle Paul, as an ambassador of Christ, found himself in an unexpected and humbling position – in chains. Ambassadors are typically treated with respect and protected, yet Paul was sentenced to imprisonment for his faith. However, Paul did not let this hinder him from boldly proclaiming the truth of the gospel. He valued the importance of speaking the message of Christ clearly and fearlessly, without relying on clever tactics or false pretenses. Despite his circumstances, Paul recognized the honor and dignity of his role as Christ's representative, willing to suffer for the sake of the gospel.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Ambassadors were held inviolable by the law of nations, and could not, without outrage to every sacred right, be put in chains." 
2. "Yet Christ's 'ambassador is in a chain!'" 
3. "The Greek is singular. The Romans used to bind a prisoner to a soldier by a single chain, in a kind of free custody."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There is something especially touching in this. He was 'an ambassador' - sent to proclaim peace to a lost world. But he was now in chains."
2. "An ambassador is a sacred character. No greater affront can be given to a nation than to put its ambassadors to death, or even to throw them into prison."
3. "Paul felt that the gospel ought always to be spoken with plainness, and without the fear of man. It is remarkable that he did not ask them to pray that he might be released."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "I am an ambassador in bonds."
2. "The verb to be an ambassador occurs only here and 2 Corinthians 5:20."
3. "In bonds, lit., in a chain."

### John Calvin:
1. "To proclaim the truth of the gospel as it ought to be proclaimed, is a high and rare attainment."
2. "Fear hinders us from preaching Christ openly and fearlessly, while the absence of all restraint and disguise in confessing Christ is demanded from his ministers."
3. "Paul does not ask for himself the powers of an acute debater, or, I should rather say, of a dexterous sophist, that he might shield himself from his enemies by false pretences. It is, that I may open my mouth, to make a clear and strong confession; for when the mouth is half shut, the sounds which it utters are doubtful and confused."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul is now an old man (πρεσβυτης, Philemon 1:9) and feels the dignity of his position as Christ's ambassador though 'in a chain' (εν αλυσε, old word αλυσις, from α privative and λυω, to loosen)." 
2. "Paul will wear a chain at the close of his life in Rome (2 Timothy 1:16)."
3. "This is probably a second purpose (ινα), the first for utterance (ινα δοθη), this for boldness (ινα παρρησιασωμα, first aorist middle subjunctive, old word to speak out boldly)."

### John Gill:
1. "The character the apostle bore was that of an ambassador… he represented him, he was sent by him."
2. "He was chiefly an ambassador to the Gentiles, which showed great condescension in Christ to send him to them."
3. "An ambassador, especially an ambassador of Christ, that comes with his Gospel, and more especially that is suffering for it, ought to be received, heard, and honoured."

### John Wesley:
1. "The ambassadors of men usually appear in great pomp."
2. "How differently does the ambassador of Christ appear!"
3. "An ambassador in bonds."
