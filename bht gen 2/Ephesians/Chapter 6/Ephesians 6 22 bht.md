# Ephesians 6:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle's purpose, in sharing these messages with the churches, was to provide comfort and support to their hearts. He understood that believers often face various challenges and difficulties, such as indwelling sin, temptations, afflictions, and sufferings. It is the duty of ministers to console and encourage them in such times. The state of the church is disheartening when it lacks comforters. Paul sought to bring solace to the hearts of the believers by sharing the supports he found from God and the success of the gospel.
