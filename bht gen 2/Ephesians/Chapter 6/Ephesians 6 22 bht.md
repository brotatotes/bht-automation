# Ephesians 6:22 Commentary Help Text

These messengers were not sent for Paul alone, but to bring comfort and strength to the believers by sharing essential news about his condition and the progress of the gospel. By offering consolation to dispirited believers facing trials, ministers play a vital role in providing support and encouragement. Through these messengers and letters, Paul aimed to bring solace and hope to the churches, assuring them of God's presence and the successes of the gospel.
