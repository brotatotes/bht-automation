# Ephesians 6:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peace to you is a common greeting used in the East and here it means prosperity, both outward and inward, in every area of life. The apostle Paul wishes the Ephesians to live in peace and harmony with one another, and he prays that their love for one another may always accompany their faith. This love is a love for the brotherhood, expressing itself in acts of kindness and unity. This peace, love, and faith are all gifts from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, and they are equally desired and bestowed by both.
