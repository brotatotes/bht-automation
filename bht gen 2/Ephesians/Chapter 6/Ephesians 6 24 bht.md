May the incorruptible grace of God be with all who truly love our Lord Jesus Christ. This is not a fleeting or earthly love, but a spiritual and eternal love.

It is essential to have sincere love for Jesus, without any hypocrisy or corruption. This genuine love will bring greater blessings than any worldly wealth or fame. May this love for Christ be imperishable and incorruptible, rooted in a pure conscience. Amen.
