# Ephesians 6:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle wishes for the genuine gospel to remain uncorrupted and for those who have a sincere and pure love for Jesus Christ to receive God's grace. This love is not mixed with any corrupt affections, and it will continue until it brings them to glory. It is through the unadulterated message of the gospel and a steadfast love for Christ that believers can experience the fullness of God's grace and ultimately be united with Him in glory.
