# Ephesians 6:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Children who honor and obey their parents are promised long life in this world as a blessing from God. This promise is fulfilled in the lives of those who are obedient, granting them a longer and more fruitful life. However, the concept of length of days extends beyond the physical realm, as in the Christian faith, it is understood to hold a deeper and more spiritual significance. Disobedience to parents, on the other hand, can lead to divine judgment and premature death, reminding us of the importance of honoring our parents and living in accordance with God's commandments.
