# Ephesians 6:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When children disobey their parents, they may face the judgments of God that result in an untimely death. On the other hand, those who show kindness and obedience to their parents are assured of a favorable outcome in this life. Living a long and virtuous life is a blessing, providing ample time to cultivate a foundation for eternity. It is important to note that this promise extends beyond a literal interpretation, as it holds deeper spiritual significance in the context of the Christian dispensation.

1. "The godly are equally blessed in every land, as the Jews were in the land which God gave them."
2. "This promise is always fulfilled, either literally, or by the substitution of a higher blessing, namely, one spiritual and eternal."
3. "The substance and essence of the law are eternally in force: its accidents alone (applying to Israel of old) are abolished."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The meaning here is, that they would be more happy, useful, and virtuous if they obeyed their parents than if they disobeyed them."
2. "We may remark here: (1) That long life is a blessing. It affords a longer space to prepare for eternity; it enables a man to be more useful; and it furnishes a longer opportunity to study the works of God on earth."
3. "Obedience to parents is conducive to length of life, and that those who are most obedient in early life, other things being equal, have the best prospect of living long."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Thou mayest live long [ŒµœÉŒ∑ ŒºŒ±Œ∫œÅŒøœáœÅŒøŒΩŒπŒøœÇ] . Lit., mayest be long - lived. The adjective occurs only here.

### John Calvin:
1. "The promise is - a long life; from which we are led to understand that the present life is not to be overlooked among the gifts of God."
2. "Those who show kindness to their parents from whom they derived life, are assured by God, that in this life it will be well with them."
3. "But as the same divine blessing is extended to the whole world, Paul has properly left out the mention of a place, the peculiar distinction of which lasted only till the coming of Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Apostle here follows Deuteronomy 5:16, rather than Exodus 20:12; the two passages differing slightly from each other."
2. "This omission gives the promise a wider reference to all lands, since ‚Äòland‚Äô (here rendered ‚Äòearth‚Äô) meant in the Old Testament promise the land of Canaan."
