# Ephesians 6:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Fathers are often prone to be stern and severe, which can lead to anger and rebellion in their children. Parents should be careful not to unnecessarily provoke their children to anger, as this can alienate them and render their guidance ineffective. Instead, parents should bring up their children with tenderness and mildness, nurturing and correcting them in a manner that reflects the love and admonition of the Lord.
