# Ephesians 6:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Parents, particularly fathers, should be careful not to provoke their children to anger. While it is their responsibility to correct and rebuke them, they must be aware that provoking them alienates their minds and renders their instructions useless. Fathers, in particular, may be prone to being too stern and severe. Instead, parents should bring up their children with tenderness and mildness, nurturing them in the ways of the Lord through instruction, setting good examples, and providing a nurturing and loving environment.
