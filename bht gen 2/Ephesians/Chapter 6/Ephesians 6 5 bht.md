# Ephesians 6:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The exhortation to servants acknowledges the difficulty of their condition, urging them to subject themselves to their masters with fear and trembling. The apostle emphasizes the importance of serving with sincerity, integrity, and a single-minded devotion to God. While the ultimate goal is the abolition of slavery, the apostle prioritizes the establishment of Christian ethics within existing social structures. This perspective should guide Christian reformers, ensuring that their efforts are rooted in the principles of obedience and faithfulness to God, rather than pursuing secular motivations. Through faithful service, even in adverse circumstances, believers can honor and serve Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "A consolatory hymn that the mastership to which they were subject, was but for a time."
2. "Their real liberty was still their own."
3. "Fear and trembling... an anxious eagerness to do your duty, and a fear of displeasing."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was not the design of the Christian religion to produce a rude sundering of the ties which bind man to man, but to teach all to perform their duties aright in the relations in which Christianity found them, and gradually to modify the customs of society, and to produce ultimately the universal prevalence of that which is right."
2. "If they could be made free, they were to prefer that condition to a state of bondage 1 Corinthians 7:21, but while the relation remained, they were to be kind, gentle, and obedient, as became Christians."
3. "Fidelity, in whatever situation we may be in life, is acceptable service to the Lord. A Christian may as acceptably serve the Lord Jesus in the condition of a servant, as if he were a minister of the gospel, or a king on a throne."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "According to the flesh. Regarded in their merely human relation."
2. "With fear."
3. "Unto Christ. 'Common and secular inducements can have but small influence on the mind of a slave.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "His exhortation to servants is so much the more earnest, on account of the hardship and bitterness of their condition, which renders it more difficult to be endured."
2. "To such he says, obey your masters, lest they should vainly imagine that carnal freedom had been procured for them by the gospel."
3. "When they serve their masters faithfully, they obey God. As if he had said, 'Do not suppose that by the judgment of men you were thrown into slavery. It is God who has laid upon you this burden, who has placed you in the power of your masters.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The application of the principles here involved must legitimately result in the abolition of slavery; but the Apostle rightly deemed it of more importance to secure Christian ethics in the already existing relation than to violently overthrow it. Here is the true point of view for Christian reformers."
2. "With fear and trembling; with anxious, conscientious solicitude, in singleness of heart, as the element of their anxious service; opposed to duplicity, in which the inner disposition and outward appearance do not correspond."
3. "The distinctly Christian motive is especially important here, as common and secular inducements can have but small influence on the mind of a slave. The same motive ought to have validity in connection with the duties of any Christian employ√©, from a cabinet minister to a day laborer. Fidelity is a rare virtue when this basis does not exist."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  With fear and trembling  (ŒºŒµœÑŒ± œÜŒøŒ≤ŒøœÖ Œ∫Œ± œÑœÅŒøŒºŒøœÖ). This addition to Colossians 3:22. 

### John Gill:
1. "The persons exhorted are 'servants', bond servants, and hired servants; who are to be subject to, and obey their 'masters', of each sex, whether male or female, of every condition, whether poor or rich, believers or unbelievers, good or bad humoured, gentle or froward."
2. "Obedience is to be yielded to them with fear and trembling; with great humility and respect, with reverence of them, and giving honour to them, with carefulness not to offend them, with submission to their reproofs and corrections, and with fear of punishment; but more especially with the fear of God, being by that influenced and constrained to obedience."
3. "In singleness of heart; with readiness and cheerfulness, without hypocrisy and dissimulation, and with all integrity and faithfulness: as unto Christ; it being agreeable to his will, and what makes for his glory, and serves to adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things."

### John Wesley:
1. "According to the present state of things: afterward the servant is free from his master."
2. "With fear and trembling - A proverbial expression, implying the utmost care and diligence."
3. "In singleness of heart - With a single eye to the providence and will of God."
