# Ephesians 6:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In our daily lives, it is important for us to not just be men-pleasers, seeking to please others only when they are watching us. Instead, as servants of Christ, we should strive to do the will of God from the depths of our hearts. This means giving our best effort in all that we do, whether our masters or authorities are present or not. Our ultimate aim should be to seek to please God, for He is always watching and knows the motives of our hearts.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Seeking to please their masters only so long as these have their eyes on them: as Gehazi was a very different man in his master's presence from what he was in his absence."
2. "Men-pleasers - not Christ-pleasers."
3. "Doing the will of God - the unseen but ever present Master: the best guarantee for your serving faithfully your earthly master alike when present and when absent."
4. "From the heart - literally, soul."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The apostle has here adverted to one of the evils of involuntary servitude as it exists everywhere. It is, that the slave will usually obey only when the eye of the master is upon him."
2. "They are bound to perform their duty with as much fidelity as though the eye of the employer was always upon them, remembering that though the eye of man may be turned away, that of God never is."
3. "We render acceptable service to God when, from regard to his will, we perform the services which are demanded of us in the situation in life where we may be placed, however humble that may be."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Eye service - men - pleasers. See on Colossians 3:22.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "'Eyeservice' is a word coined by the Apostle to express that kind of service which seeks the appearance of fidelity, namely, under the master's eye; hence rendered as 'men-pleasers,' solely to please the master."
2. "But as servants (bondmen) of Christ (not 'as men-pleasers'); doing the will of God from the heart (Greek, 'soul'), not 'in the way of eye-service.'"
3. "The last clause, however, defines how 'as servants of Christ' their service is rendered. Some without sufficient reason join 'from the heart' to the next verse."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Better 'slaves of Christ' as Paul rejoiced to call himself."

### John Gill:
1. "Doing nothing but when under the master's eye, and then pretending a great deal of diligence and industry, in order to ingratiate themselves into his affections, and neglecting his business when he is absent; whereas they ought to attend his service in his absence, as well as in his presence, and so seek to please him, which is commendable."
2. "acting in like manner as the servants of Christ, who are not menpleasers; or as if they themselves were serving Christ, as indeed they are, when they are doing that which is the will of Christ."
3. "doing the will of God from the heart; meaning not the will of God in a religious, but in a civil sense, yielding a cheerful and hearty obedience to their own masters."

### John Wesley:
1. "Not with eye-service — Serving them better when under their eye than at other times."
2. "But doing the will of God from the heart — Doing whatever you do, as the will of God, and with your might."
