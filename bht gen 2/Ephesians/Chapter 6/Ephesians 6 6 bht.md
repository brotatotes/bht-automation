# Ephesians 6:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When serving our earthly masters, it is common for us to seek their approval and work diligently only when they are watching. However, as followers of Christ, our mindset should be different. We should strive to please God above all else and not be people-pleasers. In doing so, we are called to do the will of God from the depths of our hearts, with sincerity and wholeheartedness. This means faithfully serving our masters even when they are not present, recognizing that our ultimate service is to our unseen but ever-present Master, Christ himself.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Seeking to please their masters only so long as these have their eyes on them: as Gehazi was a very different man in his master's presence from what he was in his absence."
2. "Men-pleasers - not Christ-pleasers."
3. "Doing the will of God - the unseen but ever present Master: the best guarantee for your serving faithfully your earthly master alike when present and when absent."
4. "From the heart - literally, soul."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The apostle has here adverted to one of the evils of involuntary servitude as it exists everywhere. It is, that the slave will usually obey only when the eye of the master is upon him."
2. "They are bound to perform their duty with as much fidelity as though the eye of the employer was always upon them, remembering that though the eye of man may be turned away, that of God never is."
3. "We render acceptable service to God when, from regard to his will, we perform the services which are demanded of us in the situation in life where we may be placed, however humble that may be."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Eye service - men - pleasers. See on Colossians 3:22.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Better 'slaves of Christ' as Paul rejoiced to call himself."

### John Gill:
1. "Doing nothing but when under the master's eye, and then pretending a great deal of diligence and industry, in order to ingratiate themselves into his affections, and neglecting his business when he is absent; whereas they ought to attend his service in his absence, as well as in his presence, and so seek to please him, which is commendable."
2. "acting in like manner as the servants of Christ, who are not menpleasers; or as if they themselves were serving Christ, as indeed they are, when they are doing that which is the will of Christ."
3. "doing the will of God from the heart; meaning not the will of God in a religious, but in a civil sense, yielding a cheerful and hearty obedience to their own masters."

### John Wesley:
1. "Not with eye-service â€” Serving them better when under their eye than at other times."
2. "But doing the will of God from the heart â€” Doing whatever you do, as the will of God, and with your might."
