# Ephesians 6:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To their masters, slaves are encouraged to approach their responsibilities not grudgingly or with ill will, but with a readiness and cheerfulness. They should take delight in their work and view it as a sacrifice to God. This mindset of doing everything as unto the Lord, rather than for men, is emphasized. By having an eye to God in all things, slaves can serve their masters with a sense of purpose and devotion, recognizing that ultimately it is God who appointed and regulates all the arrangements of society.
