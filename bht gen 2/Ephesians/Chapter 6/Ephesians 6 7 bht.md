# Ephesians 6:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are urged to serve their masters with good will and a ready mind, not begrudgingly or with an ill will. They are called to approach their work with a cheerful spirit, taking delight in what they do. This should be done as if they are offering every action as a sacrifice to God, having an eye to Him in all things, even as if there were no other master. Their service should be done not just because it is the will of men, but because it is the will of the Lord.
