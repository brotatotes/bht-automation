# Ephesians 6:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When a person does good according to God's will, they will receive a full and adequate recompense for their actions. This reward is not merely a penalty for doing wrong, but a fruit and advantage given in grace. The receiving of this reward is not limited to specific classes, but encompasses all individuals regardless of their social status. Whether one is a master or a servant, a free man or a bondman, the reward for their good deeds done in alignment with God's will is assured.
