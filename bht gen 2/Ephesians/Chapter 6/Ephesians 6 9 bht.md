# Ephesians 6:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Show kindness and fairness in your treatment of servants, just as they are also to be mindful of their duty towards you. Let love guide both masters and servants in their actions, as it brings harmony and equality in their relationship. Masters should forsake threatening and instead govern with love, knowing that they too have a Master in heaven. God does not show favoritism, so let respect of persons not be found among you. The principles laid down by Paul apply to all relationships between employers and employees, and our ultimate duty is to Christ in all that we do.
