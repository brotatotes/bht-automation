# Ephesians 6:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Masters are called to treat their servants with the same love and kindness that they expect from their servants. In doing so, they emulate the example of Christ and fulfill their duty according to the will of God. Masters should refrain from threatening or using harshness towards their servants but instead show forgiveness and understanding, just as their heavenly Master does towards them. They should be mindful that God, who oversees all, sees their actions and has the power to defend the oppressed.
