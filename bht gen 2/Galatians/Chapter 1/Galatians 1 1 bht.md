# Galatians 1:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul emphasizes his divine calling as an apostle, distinguishing himself from false apostles and highlighting the grand and illustrious nature of his appointment. His apostleship had a higher source, as he was directly called and commissioned by Jesus Christ and God the Father. This divine authority enabled Paul to teach with infallibility and authority, making him one of the special messengers of Christ. He asserts this authority to assert himself against any human source and to emphasize that his teaching is from God alone.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The strongest possible contrast is here drawn between man, in the ordinary sense, on the one side, and Jesus Christ, and God the Father, on the other."
2. "The Resurrection, including and implying the Ascension, was the Father's bestowal on Christ of gifts for men, by virtue of which Paul's Apostleship had been received."
3. "In St. Paul's case, neither of these [prepositions] was merely human; the Lord Jesus was both the original Sender, and Himself the Announcer of the mission."

3. "He had seen and been constituted an apostle by Him in His resurrection power."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Paul means to say, that he was not 'sent' to execute any purpose of human beings, or commissioned by them. His was a higher calling; a calling of God, and he had been sent directly by him."
2. "He designs to exclude all people from having had any agency in his appointment to the apostolic office. He was neither sent out from any body of people to execute their purposes; nor did he receive his commission, authority, or ordination through the medium of any man."
3. "He had been called by him, and commissioned by him, and sent by him, to engage in the work of the gospel."

2. "Whoever assumes a right to instruct us, must speak in the name of God or of Christ."
3. "But to make the statement more complete, the Father is also mentioned; as if he had said, 'If there be any one whom the name of Christ is not sufficient to inspire with reverence, let him know that I have also received my office from God the Father.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "An Apostle, lit., messenger; here in the highest sense: one of the special messengers of Christ and witnesses of his resurrection who were (1) directly called by him, (2) inspired by the Holy Spirit, and hence infallible in their religious teaching, and (3) commissioned to all nations; hence the founders and authoritative teachers of the whole church in all ages."
2. "Not from men, nor through man. Paul’s apostleship is entirely independent of human agency, direct or indirect. The preposition ‘from’ denotes the origin or fountain, the preposition ‘through’ the instrumentality or channel."
