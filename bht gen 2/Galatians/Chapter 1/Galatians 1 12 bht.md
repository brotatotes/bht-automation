# Galatians 1:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul emphasizes that the gospel he received was not given to him by any man, nor was he taught it by human instruction. Instead, he received it through a direct revelation from Jesus Christ himself. This revelation was not a gradual learning process, but a sudden and divine communication. Paul's authority as an apostle and the authenticity of his gospel were not derived from human sources, but from the direct revelation of Jesus Christ.

### John Calvin:
1. "We must take into account, all along, the weapons with which the false apostles attacked him, alleging that his gospel was defective and spurious... It was therefore necessary that Paul should state his doctrine in opposition to the whole world, and should rest it on this ground, that he had acquired it not in the school of any man, but by revelation from God."
2. "His divine instruction, communicated to him by immediate inspiration, did not render it improper that a man should be employed in teaching him, were it only to give weight to his public ministry."
3. "In like manner, we have already shown, that he had a direct call from God by revelation, and that he was ordained by the votes and the solemn approbation of men. These statements are not inconsistent with each other."

### Philip Schaff:

1. "He did not receive it 'from man' (παρα ανθρωπων, which shuts out both απο and δια of verse Galatians 1:1), whether Peter or any other apostle, nor was he taught it in the school of Gamaliel in Jerusalem or at the University of Tarsus."
2. "He 'received' his gospel in one way, 'through revelation of Jesus Christ' (δι' αποκαλυψεως Ιησου Χριστου)."
3. "The Lord Jesus revealed his will to Paul."

### John Gill:
1. "Not from Gamaliel, at whose feet he was brought up...no, nor from the apostles of Christ neither...nor from Ananias, nor any other man."
2. "He did not learn it of men, as men learn law, physics, logic, rhetoric, natural philosophy, and other things at school."
3. "By the revelation of Jesus Christ...either the time of his rapture into the third heaven, when he heard words not to be uttered; or rather...the time of his conversion, when Christ personally appeared unto him."
