# Galatians 1:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul acknowledges that he was once a persecutor of the church of God, meaning he targeted and oppressed those who believed in Christ. This highlights his past hostility towards Christianity and serves as a reminder of the transformative power of God's grace in his life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ye heard, viz. when I was among you: from myself: not as E. V., ‘ye have heard.’ γάρ binds the narrative to the former verses, as in the opening of a mathematical proof."
2. "for solemnity, to set himself in contrast to the Gospel, and shew how alien he then was from it."
3. "he was verily destroying the Church of God, as far as in him lay. Nor must we think of merely laying waste; the verb applies to men, not only to cities and lands."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Heard—even before I came among you." 
2. "Conversation—"my former way of life." 
3. "Wasted—laid it waste: the opposite of 'building it up.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Paul had not derived his knowledge of the Christian religion from any instruction which he had received in his early years, or any acquaintance which he had formed with the apostles."
2. "In the belief and practice of Judaism; that is, as it was understood in the time when he was educated."
3. "Beyond all limits or bounds; exceedingly. The phrase which Paul uses here...is one which he frequently employs to denote anything that is excessive, or that cannot be expressed by ordinary language."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Conversation [αναστροφην] . Better, manner of life. See on 1 Peter 1:15."
2. "In the Jews' religion [εν τω ιουδαισμω] . Only here and verse 14. Lit. in Judaism. It signifies his national religious condition."
3. "Beyond measure [καθ υπερβολην] . P?. Lit. according to excess. The noun primarily means a casting beyond, thence superiority, excellency."

### John Calvin:
1. "He relates that, during his whole life, he had such an abhorrence of the gospel, that he was a mortal enemy of it, and a destroyer of the name of Christianity."
2. "Hence we infer that his conversion was divine."
3. "Having been strongly attached to the customs of his fathers, it would have been no easy matter to tear him from them, had not the Lord drawn him by a miracle."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Paul appeals to the well-known fact of his past career as a persecutor, which formed a part of his teaching, and conclusively proved that no mere human teaching could have converted him."
2. "All his antecedents were of such a character that nothing but a divine intervention could produce so great a change."
3. "Paul intended to annihilate Christianity, was actually employed in the attempt and carried it out as far as he could."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "My manner of life (την εμην αναστροφην). Late word in this sense from Polybius on from αναστρεφομα. In the older writers it meant literally 'return' or 'turning back.'"
2. "In the Jews' religion (εν τω Ιουδαισμω). 'In Judaism.' The word in N.T. only here and next verse, already in II Macc. 2:21; 8:1; 14:38; IV Macc. 4:26. In these passages it means the Jewish religion as opposed to the Hellenism that the Syrian Kings were imposing upon the Jews."
3. "Made havock of it (επορθουν αυτην). Customary action again, imperfect of old verb πορθεω, to lay waste, to sack. In N.T. only here, verse Galatians 1:23, and Acts 9:31 (used by Christians in Damascus of Saul after his conversion of his former conduct, the very word of Paul here)."

### John Gill:
1. "His manner and course of life, in his state of unregeneracy, how diametrically opposite his education and behaviour, his principles and practices, were to the Gospel..."
2. "He was brought up in the religion of the Jews, not as it was founded and established by God, but as it was corrupted by them..."
3. "He persecuted the saints in a most violent and outrageous manner, beyond all others that were concerned with him..."

### John Wesley:
1. I Persecuted the church of God — That is, the believers in Christ.
