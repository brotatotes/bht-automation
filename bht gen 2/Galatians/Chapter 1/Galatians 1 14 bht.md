# Galatians 1:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul's passion for Judaism and the unwritten traditions of his ancestors set him apart from his contemporaries. He excelled in Jewish learning, thanks to his formidable mentor Gamaliel and his own exceptional abilities. However, his zeal was not guided by true understanding, as he prioritized the oral law and customs over the written law. This misguided fervor fueled his persecution of the early Christians and initially kept him distant from the Gospel of Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The compound form (compare συμμέτοχος, Ephesians 3:6; Ephesians 5:7; συγκοινωνός, 1Co 9:23 al,) is condemned by the Atticists: Attic writers using only the simple form." - Ellicott
2. "a zealous assertor (or defender) of my ancestral traditions (i.e. those handed down in the sect of the Pharisees, Paul being Φαρισαῖος, υἱὸς Φαρισαίων, Acts 23:6, not, the law of Moses. This meaning is given by the μου: without it the παραδόσεις of the whole Jewish nation handed down from οἱ πατέρες, might be meant: cf. Act 26:5)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I was becoming a proficient"; "I made progress."
2. "Of mine own age, among my countrymen."
3. "Namely, those of the Pharisees, Paul being 'a Pharisee, and son of a Pharisee' (Acts 23:6; Acts 26:5)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Paul made advances not only in the knowledge of the Jewish religion, but he also surpassed others in his zeal in defending its interests."
2. "He surpassed those of the same age with himself. Possibly there may be a reference here to those of the same age who attended with him on the instructions of Gamaliel."
3. "All this is fully sustained by all that we know of the character of Paul, as at all times a man of singular and eminent zeal in all that he undertook."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Paul means that he outstripped his Jewish contemporaries in distinctively Jewish culture, zeal, and activity."
2. "The extreme party of the Pharisees called themselves 'zealots of the law'; 'zealots of God.'"
3. "The Pharisaic traditions which had been engrafted on the law."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Paul far surpassed in zeal for the Jewish religion his contemporary kinsmen or fellow-religionists."
2. "‘Traditions of my fathers’ are the law of Moses with all the explanations and additions of the Pharisees, which concealed rather than unveiled the Word of God and either hindered or destroyed its direct effect."
3. "Our Saviour never appeals to tire Jewish traditions except to oppose them; and this is of great moment in the controversy with Romanism, which relies more on ecclesiastical traditions than on the Bible."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I advanced (προεκοπτον). Imperfect active again of προκοπτω, old verb, to cut forward (as in a forest), to blaze a way, to go ahead."
2. "Paul modestly claims that he went 'beyond' (υπερ) his fellow-students in his progress in Judaism."
