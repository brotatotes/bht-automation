# Galatians 1:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's sovereign grace and predestination are seen in Paul's calling and separation for the ministry. It was not by Paul's own merits or efforts, but by God's pleasure and divine appointment from even before his birth. Paul recognizes that his calling was not of his own doing, but a result of God's grace and love. This reminds us that our own calling and purpose in life are also the result of God's sovereign will, and we can trust in His perfect plan for our lives.

1.
