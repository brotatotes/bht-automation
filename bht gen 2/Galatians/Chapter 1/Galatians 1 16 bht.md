# Galatians 1:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ was revealed to me within my innermost being through the work of the Holy Spirit. This revelation was not merely intellectual knowledge, but a personal, experiential encounter with the Savior. As a result, I was called to proclaim Christ among the Gentiles, sharing the truth of the Son of God who is both fully divine and fully human. Instead of seeking the opinions or approval of others, I immediately obeyed and did not consult with anyone, recognizing that my calling came directly from God and not from human reasoning or worldly considerations.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "to reveal his Son (viz. by that subsequent revelation, of which before, Galatians 1:12; not by his conversion, which, as above, answers to καλέσας) in me" 
2. "ἐν τ  .   ἔθν  .] the main object of his Apostleship"
3. "σαρκὶ κ  .   αἵμ  .] i.e. with mankind, 'generally with the idea of weakness and frailty'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "reveal his Son in me—within me, in my inmost soul, by the Holy Spirit." 
2. "The revealing of His Son by me to the Gentiles was impossible, unless He had first revealed His Son in me."
3. "I conferred not—Greek, 'I had not further recourse to...for the purpose of consulting.' The divine revelation was sufficient for me."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The phrase evidently means, to make me acquainted with the Lord Jesus, or to reveal his Son to me..."
2. "The main idea is, that there was no delay, no consultation, no deferring it..."
3. "When the Lord Jesus calls us to follow him we should promptly and decidedly obey."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "God revealing himself, living and working in man's inner personality."
2. "He is speaking of the initial stages of his experience."
3. "Flesh and blood. Always in N. T. with a suggestion of human weakness or ignorance."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ was revealed to Paul, not that he might alone enjoy, and silently retain in his own bosom the knowledge of Christ, but that he might preach among the Gentiles the Savior whom he had known." 
2. "To confer with flesh and blood, is to consult with flesh and blood. So far as the meaning of these words is concerned, his intention was absolutely to have nothing to do with any human counsels." 
3. "'Flesh and blood,' is used to denote men... no man hath made this discovery; and thus it hath the same meaning in the place before us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Within me, in my inmost soul and consciousness. The external manifestation of the exalted Redeemer from heaven on the way to Damascus was accompanied by an inner illumination."
2. "The conversion of Paul coincided with his call to the apostleship, but the latter was also newly revealed or confirmed to him in a vision at Jerusalem. He usually addressed himself first to the Jews, but this was only the natural and divinely appointed bridge to the mission among the Gentiles."
3. "'Immediately,' forthwith, straightway... When God calls we must obey at once without asking anybody’s advice. 'Flesh and blood' is a Hebrew term for man with the accessory idea of weakness or frailty. Paul means here not his sinful nature which rebelled against the divine grace, but other weak men; for his object is to prove his entire independence of human instruction and counsel."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "By 'in me' (εν εμο) Paul can mean to lay emphasis on his inward experience of grace or he may refer objectively to the vision of Christ on the way to Damascus, 'in my case.'" 
2. "Certainly Paul could not preach Christ among the Gentiles without the rich inward experience and in the objective vision he was called to that task." 
3. "Second aorist middle indicative of προσανατιθημ, old verb, double compound (προσ, ανα), to lay upon oneself in addition, to betake oneself to another, to confer with, dative case as here."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ was revealed to him...not objectively in the Gospel, but spiritually, experimentally, and savingly."
2. "Christ was the subject of his ministry...the Son of God, God and man in one person...the high priest over the house of God, and King of saints."
3. "Immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood;...he did not stand reasoning and debating...whether it would be for his credit and reputation, for his worldly interest...to enter upon the ministry of the word."

### John Wesley:
1. "To reveal his Son in me — By the powerful operation of his Spirit."
2. "I did not confer with flesh and blood — Being fully satisfied of the divine will, and determined to obey, I took no counsel with any man, neither with my own reason or inclinations, which might have raised numberless objections."
