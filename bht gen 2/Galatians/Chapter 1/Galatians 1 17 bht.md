# Galatians 1:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul is making it clear that he did not seek validation or approval from the apostles in Jerusalem, nor did he receive the gospel from them. Instead, he immediately went to Arabia and then returned to Damascus. His purpose in mentioning this journey is to show that he was not dependent on the apostles for his commission. He wanted to demonstrate that his ministry was owned and blessed by God, and through his increased spiritual strength and knowledge, he was able to prove that Jesus of Nazareth was the true Messiah.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The repetition of ἀπῆλθον is quite in the Apostle’s manner."
2. "Its object does not seem to have been (as Chrys., al., Meyer, al.) the preaching of the gospel, but preparation for the apostolic work."
3. "The journey is mentioned here, to account for the time, and to show that he did not spend it in conferring with men, or with the other Apostles."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This journey (not recorded in Acts) was during the whole period of his stay at Damascus, called by Luke ('many [Greek, a considerable number of] days.')" 
2. "He also here had that comparative retirement needed, after the first fervor of his conversion, to prepare him for the great work before him. Compare Moses (Acts 7:29; Acts 7:30). His familiarity with the scene of the giving of the law, and the meditations and revelations which he had there, appear in Galatians 4:24; Galatians 4:25; Hebrews 12:18."
3. "The Lord from heaven communed with him, as He on earth in the days of His flesh communed with the other apostles."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The design of this statement is to show that, in no sense, did he derive his commission from man."
2. "He has mentioned it [the journey into Arabia] for a different purpose altogether, to show that he did not receive his commission from the apostles, and that he did not go at once to consult them. He went directly the other way."
3. "He did not go to Jerusalem to consult with the apostles after his visit to Arabia, but returned again to the place where he was converted and preached there, showing that he had not derived his commission from the other apostles."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Went I up [ανηλθον] . Comp. verse 18. Only in this chapter, and John 6:3."
2. "Apostles before me. In point of seniority. Comp. Romans 16:7."
3. "It is entirely impossible to decide what Paul means by this term, since the word was so loosely used and so variously applied."

### John Calvin:
1. "I did not ask the authority of any man, not even of the apostles themselves."
2. "The false boasting of unprincipled men laid him under the necessity of contrasting the authority of the apostles themselves with the authority of God."
3. "Let godly readers consider the severe temptation with which Paul was called to struggle at the very commencement of his course."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To those who were apostles before me...Paul concedes to the other Apostles no other preference but the priority of call."
2. "This retreat took the place of the three years’ preparation of the older Apostles in the school of Christ."

2. "This visit to Arabia has to come between the two visits to Damascus which are not distinguished in Acts 9:22."
3. "In verse Galatians 1:23 Luke does speak of 'considerable days' and so we must place the visit to Arabia between verses Galatians 1:22; Galatians 1:23."
