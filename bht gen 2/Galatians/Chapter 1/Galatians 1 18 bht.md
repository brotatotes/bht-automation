# Galatians 1:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul's purpose in visiting Peter was not for the purpose of seeking approval or establishing authority, but rather to engage in a meaningful and spiritual conversation. It is worth noting that this visit took place after three years, during which Paul had already proven himself as an apostle. While the visit itself may have been short, it provided an opportunity for both Paul and Peter to deepen their understanding and fellowship with one another.
