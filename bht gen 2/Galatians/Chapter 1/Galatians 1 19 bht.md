# Galatians 1:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
James, the brother of the Lord, is referred to as an apostle in this passage. He is not one of the twelve apostles, but he held a prominent role as the leader of the church in Jerusalem. It is important to note that James was not a biological brother of Jesus, but rather a close kinsman. This distinction is supported by the fact that Paul did not see any other apostle except for James during his visit. When it is mentioned that Barnabas brought Paul to the apostles, it is likely referring to Peter and James.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "That James, the Lord’s brother, was one of the Twelve, and the only one besides Peter whom Paul saw at this visit."
2. "We must then adopt (2): which is besides in consonance with other notices respecting the term ἀπόστολος, and the person heve mentioned."
3. "I reserve the subject for full discussion in the prolegomena to the Ep. of James."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The history speaks of 'apostles'; and Paul's mention of a second apostle, besides Peter, reconciles the Epistle and the history."
2. "James, the Lord's brother—This designation, to distinguish him from James the son of Zebedee, was appropriate while that apostle was alive."
3. "His brethren are never called 'sons of Joseph,' which they would have been had they been the Lord's brothers strictly."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That the James here referred to was an apostle is clear."
2. "It is probable that this was the James referred to here, as it is evident from the Acts of the Apostles that he was a prominent man among the apostles in Jerusalem."
3. "Why James is particularly mentioned here is unknown. Since, however, he was a prominent man in Jerusalem, Paul would naturally seek his acquaintance."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Jas. is counted as an apostle, though not reckoned among the twelve."
2. "The Lord's brother means that James was a son of Joseph and Mary."
3. "The explanations which differ from that of Helvidius have grown, largely, out of the desire to maintain the perpetual virginity of Mary."

### John Calvin:
1. "Almost all the ancients are agreed that he was one of the disciples, whose surname was 'Oblias' and 'The Just,' and that he presided over the church at Jerusalem."
2. "Yet others think that he was the son of Joseph by another wife, and others (which is more probable) that he was the cousin of Christ by the mother’s side."
3. "It appears to me, therefore, far more probable, that the person of whom he is speaking is the son of Alpheus."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The James here spoken of is not James the elder, the son of Zebedee and Salome, and brother of St. John...but the same who, after the departure of Peter from Palestine, presided over the congregation of Jerusalem."
2. "The exceptive words 'but only,'...intimates rather...that he was, like Barnabas, an Apostle only in the wider sense, who...enjoyed apostolical authority."
3. "The brother of the Lord. To distinguish him from the two Apostles of that name. 'Brother' is not cousin...but either a uterine brother...or a son of Joseph from a previous marriage... The cousin-theory...is exegetically untenable...The following reasons are conclusive against it and in favor of a closer relationship."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "James, brother of the Lord, is here termed an apostle, though not one of the twelve." 
2. "Paul is showing his independence of and equality with the twelve in answer to the attacks of the Judaizers."

### John Gill:
1. "This is observed to show, that as he did not receive the Gospel from Peter, so neither from any of the other apostles, whom he did not so much as see, much less converse with."
2. "The relation came in and stood thus; this James was James the less, the son of Mary the wife of Cleophas, which Cleophas was the brother of Joseph, the husband of Mary the mother of our Lord."
3. "Some have been of opinion that a third James, distinct from James the son of Zebedee and James the son of Alphaeus, is here meant; who was not of the twelve apostles, and was surnamed James the just, and called the brother of Christ because of his faith, wisdom, and becoming conversation."

### John Wesley:
1. "Other of the apostles I saw none, save James the brother (that is, the kinsman) of the Lord."
2. "Therefore when Barnabas is said to have 'brought him into the apostles,' Acts 9:27, only St. Peter and St James are meant."
