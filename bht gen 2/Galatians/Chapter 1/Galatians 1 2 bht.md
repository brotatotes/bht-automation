# Galatians 1:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul's fellow brethren, who were united in their agreement with him, are mentioned here. It is important to note that these brethren were not co-authors of the letter but rather individuals who shared the same beliefs and sentiments as Paul. This inclusion of other like-minded believers serves to strengthen the message being communicated and provides support for Paul's teachings.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Their unanimity is here stated, as Chrys., Luther, al., to shew that he was not alone in his doctrine, but joined by all the brethren who were present."
2. "That we have here barely ταῖς ἐκκλ., without any honourable adjunct (as in 1 Cor., 2 Cor., 1 Thess., 2 Thess., &c.), must he explained as Chrys. al.: θέα δέ μοι καὶ ἐνταῦθα τ . πολλὴν ἀγανάκτησιν."
3. "Meyer denies this, alleging (carelessly, which is not usual with him) 1 Thess. and 2 Thess. as addressed barely τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ, whereas in both we have added ἐν θεῷ πατρὶ κ . κυρίῳ Ἰησ. χρ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Not that these were joint authors with Paul of the Epistle: but joined him in the sentiments and salutations."
2. "He does not attach any honorable title to the churches here, as elsewhere, being displeased at their Judaizing."
3. "It is interesting thus to find the apostle of the circumcision, as well as the apostle of the uncircumcision, once at issue, co-operating to build up the same churches."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Though Paul claimed to be inspired, yet it would do much to conciliate favor for what he advanced, if others also concurred with what he said."
2. "It was usual for Paul to associate with him the ministers of the gospel, or other Christians who were with him, in expressing friendly salutations to the churches to which he wrote."
3. "They may have been ministers with Paul, or they may have been the private members of the churches. Commentators have been much divided in opinion on the subject; but all is conjecture."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The circle of Paul's colleagues or more intimate friends." 
2. "The brethren with me are distinguished from all the saints - the church members generally." 
3. "This is a circular letter to several congregations."

### John Calvin:
1. "His general practice is, to insert the salutations from brethren at the conclusion, instead of introducing them at the commencement as joint authors of the epistle: at least, he never mentions more than two names, and those very well known."
2. "The concurrence of so many godly persons must have had some degree of influence in softening the minds of the Galatians, and preparing them to receive instruction."
3. "So long as they professed Christianity, worshipped one God, observed the sacraments, and enjoyed some kind of Gospel ministry, they retained the external marks of a church."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The reason why he mentions others is his strong sense of brotherly communion..."
2. "'Churches' are here (as often) local congregations, which belong to the church universal..."
3. "The mere mention of the name without those honorable epithets... betrays his dissatisfaction with the apostate Galatians."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "All the brethren which are with me (ο συν εμο παντες αδελφο). The same phrase in Philippians 4:21 in distinction from the saints in verse Galatians 1:22. Probably the small company of travelling companions."
2. "Unto the churches of Galatia (ταις εκκλησιαις της Γαλατιας). A circular letter therefore to all the churches in the province (both South Galatia and North Galatia if he really laboured there)."

### John Gill:
1. "The brethren here, whoever are meant, to show that they agreed with him in the doctrines of grace he defends, and in the charges he brought against this church, and in the reproofs and advice he gave them."
2. "Galatia was a country in the lesser Asia, inhabited by the Gauls, who coming thither out of Europe, mixed with the Grecians; whence it was first called Gallo Graecia, and afterwards Galatia."
3. "For quickly after the Gospel was preached unto them, false teachers crept in among them, endeavoring to subvert it, by mixing it with the law, and joining Moses and Christ; and in which they very much succeeded; and is the reason of the apostle's writing this epistle."

### John Wesley:
1. And all the brethren — Who agree with me in what I now write.
