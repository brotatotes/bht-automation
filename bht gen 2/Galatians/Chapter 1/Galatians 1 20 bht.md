## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This asseveration applies most naturally to the important fact just asserted his short visit to Jerusalem, and his having seen only Peter and James."
2. "If a report had been spread in Galatia that after his conversion he spent years at Jerusalem and received regular institution in Christianity at the hands of the Apostles, this last fact would naturally cause amazement, and need a strong confirmatory asseveration."
3. "The word necessary to be supplied to carry on the sense from ἰδοὺ ἐνώπ . τ . θεοῦ to ὅτι, lies under the ἰδού, which here answers to such words as διαμαρτύρομαι, 1 Timothy 5:21; 2Ti 2:14; 2 Timothy 4:1, παραγγέλλω, 1 Timothy 6:13."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Solemn asseveration that his statement is true."
2. "Probably it had been reported by Judaizers that he had received a long course of instruction from the apostles in Jerusalem from the first; hence his earnestness in asserting the contrary facts."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The design of this oath here is to prevent all suspicion of falsehood."
2. "There were no radios which he could appeal to in this case, and he could, therefore, only appeal to God."
3. "The importance of the truth here affirmed was such as to justify this solemn appeal to God."

### John Calvin:
1. "This affirmation extends to the whole narrative."
2. "The vast earnestness of Paul on this subject is evinced by his resorting to an oath, which cannot lawfully be employed but on great and weighty occasions."
3. "Now the modes of swearing used by good men deserve our attention; for we learn from them that an oath must be viewed simply as an appeal to the judgment-seat of God for the integrity and truth of our words and actions; and such a transaction ought to be guided by religion and the fear of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This solemn asseveration refers to the statement Galatians 1:18-19."
2. "Judaizing opponents had probably spread the report in Galatia that Paul spent a much longer time in Jerusalem, and was instructed by the Jewish Apostles, especially by Peter, consequently dependent on them."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  I lie not  (ου ψευδομα). So important does he deem the point that he takes solemn oath about it. 

### John Gill:
1. "Now this being a matter of moment, and what he had been charged with by the false teachers, that the Gospel he preached he had received from men, in order to disqualify him and bring him into contempt as an apostle."
2. "He therefore not only wrote these things, but for the confirmation of them solemnly appeals to God the searcher of hearts for the truth of them."
3. "It is swearing by the God of truth, calling him to be witness of the things that he had written; whence it is manifest that an oath upon proper occasions, where there is a necessity for it, and a good end to be answered by it, may be lawfully made."
