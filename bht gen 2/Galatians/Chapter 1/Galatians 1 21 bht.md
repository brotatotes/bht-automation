# Galatians 1:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul's travels in the region of Syria and Cilicia were significant. After disputing with the Grecians in Jerusalem and escaping an attempt on his life, Paul journeyed to Tarsus, his hometown and a renowned center of education. It was in this area that Barnabas sought Paul and brought him to Antioch in Syria, where they preached the Gospel of Christ. During this time, Paul also preached in Cilicia, which was known as a province in Asia Minor. These regions were instrumental in Paul's early apostolic work among the Gentiles.
