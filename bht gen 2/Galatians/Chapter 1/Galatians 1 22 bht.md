# Galatians 1:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle Paul emphasizes that he was not a disciple of the apostles or known in the churches of Judea, which shows that he did not receive the Gospel he preached from them. The objection that he might have obtained it from the churches in Judea is countered by the fact that there was not only a renowned church in Jerusalem, but also several congregated churches throughout the country. These churches, although considered to be in Christ due to their profession and calling upon His name, were still in need of recognizing the authenticity of Paul's ministry.
