# Galatians 1:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Galatians had only heard second-hand reports about the apostle Paul's conversion and preaching of the faith they once held. Previously, Paul had actively opposed and sought to destroy the faith, but now he stands as a testament to the transformative power of the gospel. This gospel, referred to as the word of faith and the mystery of faith, contains the core truths to be believed and embraced. It is through this message of faith that God's grace is imparted and grows within believers, enabling them to live out their calling in Christ.
