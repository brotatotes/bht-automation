# Galatians 1:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The churches openly praised and thanked God for the transformative work that had taken place in Paul's life. They recognized that his conversion from a persecutor to a preacher of the gospel was a testament to the power and grace of God. Their response stood in marked contrast to the behavior of the Galatians and the false teachers who failed to see or acknowledge the divine work in Paul's ministry. The churches' admiration and thanksgiving served as a reminder to attribute the change in Paul to the work of God and to glorify Him for His mighty acts.
