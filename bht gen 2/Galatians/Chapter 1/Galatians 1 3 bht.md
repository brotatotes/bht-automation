# Galatians 1:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Grace to you, is a common salutation used by Paul in his epistles, signifying the desire for divine favor and peace to be upon the recipients. This wish for grace and peace is not a mere formality for Paul, but rather an earnest expression of his desire for the Galatians. The salutation also reminds us of the close association between God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, as they are mentioned together as the source of grace. The Alexandrian copy and the Ethiopic version even specify that it is from God our Father that this grace is bestowed.
