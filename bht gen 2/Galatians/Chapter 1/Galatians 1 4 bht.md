# Galatians 1:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through the sacrifice of Christ, we are delivered from the bondage of the law and the works of the flesh. Christ willingly gave Himself up as a sacrifice to reconcile us with God and rescue us from the present evil world. This atonement was not based on anything we could do to earn it, but was solely according to the will of God. Paul emphasizes the importance of this truth to the Galatians, highlighting the justification we receive through Christ's sacrifice and our separation from the ways of the world.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He thus obiter reminds the Galatians, who wished to return to the bondage of the law, of the great object of the Atonement, which they had forgotten." 
2. "κατὰ τὸ θέλημα  … And this, (1) not according to our own plan, in proportion to our legal obedience or any quality in us, but according to the Father’s sovereign will, the prime standard of all the process of redemption: and (2) not so that we may trifle with such rescuing purpose of Christ by mixing it with other schemes and fancies, seeing that it is according to a procedure prescribed by Him, who doeth all things after the counsel of His own will."
3. "And this, not as the lord merely of His works, but as πατρὸς ἡμῶν, bound to us in the ties of closest love for our good, as well as to fulfill His own eternal purpose."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Deliver" is the very word used by the Lord as to His deliverance of Paul himself (Galatians 1:1): an undesigned coincidence between Paul and Luke.
2. The present age opposes the "glory" of God, and is under the authority of the Evil One. The "ages of ages" are opposed to "the present evil age."
3. Without merit of ours. His sovereignty as "GOD," and our filial relation to Him as "OUR FATHER," ought to keep us from blending our own legal notions (as the Galatians were doing) with His will and plan.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The reason why Paul so soon introduces this important doctrine, probably is, that this was the cardinal doctrine of the Christian religion, the great truth which was ever to be kept before the mind."
2. "The Lord Jesus became a vicarious offering, and died in the stead of sinners."
3. "The grand purpose was, to rescue sinners from the dominion of this world, and to separate them unto God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Gave himself for our sins. Purposely added with reference to the Galatians' falling back on the works of the law as the ground of acceptance with God."
2. "For or with reference to sins expresses the general relation of Christ's mission to sin."
3. "Out of this present evil world. Lit. out of the world, the present world which is evil. The course and current of this world's affairs as corrupted by sin."

### John Calvin:
1. "The best remedy for purifying our minds from any kind of errors or superstitions, is to keep in remembrance our relation to Christ, and the benefits which he has conferred upon us."
2. "What Paul here ascribes to Christ is, with equal propriety, ascribed in other parts of Scripture to God the Father; for, on the one hand, the Father, by an eternal purpose, decreed this atonement, and gave this proof of his love to us, that he 'spared not his only-begotten Son, but delivered him up for us all;' and Christ, on the other hand, offered himself a sacrifice in order to reconcile us to God."
3. "Those who are born of the world have nothing but sin and wickedness, not by creation, but by corruption. Christ, therefore, died for our sins, in order to redeem or separate us from the world."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He holds up at once before the Galatians, who were returning to the bondage of the law, the picture of the dying Saviour, who, by the one sacrifice on the cross, fully and forever accomplished our redemption, so that we need not resort to any human means of salvation or go back to a preparatory dispensation."
2. "Who gave himself, nothing less than His own person, into death, as a ransom and expiatory sacrifice."
3. "From (or out of) this present evil world, from the state and order of this transitory world, where sin and death reign, from the world which lies in wickedness, in opposition to the supernatural order of the heavenly kingdom."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He refers to the death of Christ... As a rule περ occurs of things, υπερ of persons." 
2. "The gospel is a rescue, an emancipation from a state of bondage."
3. "Not according to any merit in us."

### John Gill:
1. "He gave himself freely, cheerfully, voluntarily, into the hands of men, justice, and death itself, as a sacrifice for sin, to expiate it, make reconciliation and atonement for it, which could not be done by the sacrifices of the legal dispensation..."
2. "and his end in so doing was,that he might deliver us from this present evil world...from the lusts that are predominant in it; from the vain conversation of the men of it; from the general conflagration of it at the last day, and from the perdition of ungodly men, and their eternal destruction in hell."
3. "It was by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God that Christ was delivered up into the hands of wicked men, and put to death by them; it was his will of purpose and decree, to deliver him up into the hands of justice and death..."

### John Wesley:
1. "That he might deliver us from the present evil world — From the guilt, wickedness, and misery wherein it is involved, and from its vain and foolish customs and pleasures."
2. "According to the will of God — Without any merit of ours."
3. "St. Paul begins most of his epistles with thanksgiving; but, writing to the Galatians, he alters his style, and first sets down his main proposition, That by the merits of Christ alone, giving himself for our sins, we are justified: neither does he term them, as he does others, either saints," elect," or churches of God."
