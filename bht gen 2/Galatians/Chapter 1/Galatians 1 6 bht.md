# Galatians 1:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul expresses his astonishment at the Galatians' swift departure from the Gospel of grace. He had hoped for better from them, having considered them to be firmly grounded in the truth. Their abrupt change of course was both surprising and disappointing. Paul acknowledges that their turning away from the gospel they had been called into by the grace of Christ was a cause for concern.
