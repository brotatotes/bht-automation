### Henry Alford:
1. "Even though we or an angel from heaven...let him be accursed." 
2. "The preposition is important here, as it has been pressed by Protestants in the sense of 'besides,' against Roman Catholic tradition, and in consequence maintained by the latter in the sense of 'against.' It in fact includes both."
3. "No reference to ecclesiastical excommunication: for an angel is here included."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "A new revelation, even though seemingly accredited by miracles, is not to be received if it contradict the already existing revelation."
2. "Not that he means, the apostles really supported the Judaizers: but he wishes to show, when the truth is in question, respect of persons is inadmissible."
3. "The Greek expresses not so much 'any other gospel different from what we have preached,' as, 'any gospel BESIDE that which we preached.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is to be held as a fixed and settled position, that the true gospel had been preached to them at first."
2. "The mere rank, character, talent, eloquence, or piety of a preacher does not of necessity give his doctrine a claim to our belief, or prove that his gospel is true."
3. "No matter what their zeal or their apparent sincerity, or their apparent sanctity, or their apparent success, or their real boldness in rebuking vice, we are to withdraw from them."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "In LXX always curse, except Leviticus 27:28, and the apocryphal books, where it is always gift or offering."

### John Calvin:
1. "He demands such unhesitating belief of his preaching, that he pronounces a curse on all who dared to contradict it." 
2. "To show that there is no foundation for such a statement, he instantly surrenders the right of advancing anything against his own doctrine. He claims no superiority, in this respect, over other men, but justly demands from all, equally with himself, subjection to the word of God." 
3. "He meets them by the bold assertion, that even angels are unable to shake his authority. This is no disparagement to angels. To promote the glory of God by every possible means was the design of their creation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is impossible to express more strongly and solemnly the conviction of the unerring truth of the gospel as preached by Paul, the zeal for its purity, and the aversion to every heresy."
2. "The gospel admits of no rival, either in the form of foreign additions or in the form of changes."
3. "Let him be anathema, i.e., devoted (in a bad sense), given over to the judgment of God. It is a solemn judgment of condemnation as in the name of God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Preachers have turned away from Christ, alas, and preached 'humanism' or some other new-fangled notion."

3. "No angel can change Paul now."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle, in order to assert the more strongly the truth, purity, and perfection of the Gospel, as preached by him; and to deter persons from preaching another Gospel, and others from receiving it, supposes a case impossible; and, in such a case, denounces his anathemas."
2. "It was not possible, that he, or any of his fellow apostles, who had been so clearly led and so fully established in the Gospel of Christ, and of which they had had such a powerful and comfortable experience in their souls, could ever preach one different from it."
3. "For such was the perfection of the Gospel, as preached by the apostle, who declared the whole counsel of God, and kept back nothing that was profitable to the churches, that no addition could, or might be made unto it: let him be accursed, or 'anathema'."

### John Wesley:
1. "But if we — I and all the apostles."
