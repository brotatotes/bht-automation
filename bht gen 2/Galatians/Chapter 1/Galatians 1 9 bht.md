# Galatians 1:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul emphasizes the importance of the gospel he preached by repeating his warning against accepting any other gospel. He wants to ensure that the Galatians understand that he is not speaking lightly or without careful consideration. Any deviation from the gospel they had initially received should be rejected, whether it comes from men or even angels. The testimony of other believers who knew the truth of the gospel also underscores the seriousness of Paul's message.
