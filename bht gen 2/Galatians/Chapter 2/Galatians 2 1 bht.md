# Galatians 2:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Fourteen years after my first trip to Jerusalem, I went there again. This second visit to Jerusalem seems to be the same journey mentioned in Acts 15:2. During this time, the apostles gathered for the great council where they demonstrated that they shared the same beliefs and teachings as me.
