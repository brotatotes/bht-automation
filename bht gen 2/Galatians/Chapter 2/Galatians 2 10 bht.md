# Galatians 2:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle Paul was mindful and eager to support the poor Christians in Judea who had suffered great hardships for their faith. He not only desired to provide them with material assistance, but also to stir up other Gentile churches to contribute to their aid. This act of charity would serve as a tangible expression of unity and gratitude between the Jewish and Gentile Christians, demonstrating the Gentiles' appreciation for the gospel they had received from their Jewish brethren.
