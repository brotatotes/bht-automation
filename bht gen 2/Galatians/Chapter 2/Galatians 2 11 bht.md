# Galatians 2:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, Paul openly reprimands Peter for his actions in Antioch. This confrontation challenges the idea of Peter's supremacy and highlights Paul's equal standing as an apostle. It was not about the acceptance of Gentiles, but rather about the social interaction between Jewish and Gentile Christians. Paul's reproof was direct and honest, reflecting his apostolic authority. His intention was not to undermine previous decisions but to address Peter's inconsistency. By standing against Peter, Paul demonstrated his commitment to upholding truth and righteousness, even if it meant opposing someone of great influence.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This visit of Peter to Antioch...will fall most naturally...in the period described..."
2. "One of the most curious instances of ecclesiastical ingenuity on record...They try to make it appear that the reproof was only an apparent one..."
3. "he was (self) convicted: convicted of inconsistency by his conduct."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The oldest manuscripts Paul's withstanding Peter is the strongest proof that the former gives of the independence of his apostleship in relation to the other apostles, and upsets the Romish doctrine of Peter's supremacy."
2. "The question at Antioch was not whether the Gentiles were admissible to the Christian covenant without becoming circumcised...but whether the Gentile Christians were to be admitted to social intercourse with the Jewish Christians without conforming to the Jewish institution."
3. "Regarding the proceeding with prejudice, they explained away the force of the Jerusalem decision; and probably also desired to watch whether the Jewish Christians among the Gentiles violated the law, which that decision did not verbally sanction them in doing, though giving the Gentiles latitude."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Paul says that he did not hesitate to resist him in a case where Peter was manifestly wrong, and thus showed that he was an apostle of the same standing as the others."
2. "Paul thus showed that he was equal with Peter in his apostolical authority and dignity."
3. "The first thing to be noted is, that it was done openly, and with candor. It was reproof addressed to the offender himself."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The meaning is expressed in the familiar phrase faced him down."
2. "Rather before the face, or in the face of, meaning simply in the sight or presence of (Luke 2:31), or according to appearance (2 Corinthians 1:7)."
3. "The explanation that Paul withstood Peter only in appearance or semblance (so Jerome, Chrysostom, Theodoret, and other Fathers) is one of the curiosities of exegesis, and was probably adopted out of misplaced consideration for the prestige of Peter."

### John Calvin:
1. "What reason could there now be for hesitating to receive it as certain and undoubted truth?"
2. "Paul did not simply reprove Peter, as a Christian might reprove a Christian, but he did it officially, as the phrase is; that is, in the exercise of the apostolic character which he sustained."
3. "The whole debate on those two points was nothing less than a manifest overthrow of that tyrannical primacy, which the Romanists foolishly enough allege to be founded on divine right."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "That decree was both emancipating and restrictive; it emancipated the Gentile converts from circumcision as a test of church membership, but it laid on them the restriction of observing the precepts traditionally traced to Noah."
2. "It was a compromise, a step in the right direction, but it stopped half way."
3. "Paul considered this as a matter in itself indifferent and harmless, considering the vanity of idols, provided that no offence be given to weak brethren, in which case he himself would â€˜eat no flesh for evermore,â€™ lest he make his â€˜brother to stumble.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I stood against him face to face."
2. "In Antioch he looked him in the eye as his superior in character and courage."
3. "Because he stood condemned."

### John Gill:
1. "However, the Papists greedily catch at this, to secure the infallibility of the bishops of Rome, who pretend to be the successors of Peter, lest, should the apostle appear blameworthy, and to be reproved and opposed, they could not, with any grace, assume a superior character to his."
2. "He reproved him to his face, freely spoke his mind, boldly resisted him, honestly endeavoured to convince him of his mistake, and to put a stop to his conduct."
3. "His reason for it was, because he was to be blamed; he had done that which was culpable, and for which he was blameworthy."

### John Wesley:
1. "Paul reproves Peter himself. So far was he from receiving his doctrine from man, or from being inferior to the chief of the apostles."
2. "I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed."
3. "For fear of man, for dissimulation, and for not walking uprightly."
