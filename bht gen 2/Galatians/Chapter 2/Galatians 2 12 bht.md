# Galatians 2:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter's actions in this passage reflect his belief in the abolishment of the ceremonial law. He freely dined with Gentiles, disregarding Jewish customs, which expressed his conviction that these laws were no longer necessary. However, his conduct contradicted his true beliefs and caused confusion among Gentile believers, who felt excluded and inferior. Peter's actions were motivated by fear of the circumcised Jews who emphasized the importance of following Jewish customs. This incident highlights the tension between the Jewish converts' adherence to the law and the freedom experienced by the Gentiles.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The candid reader will I think at once recognize in the words a mission from James [...] And this mission may have been for the very purpose of admonishing the Jewish converts of their obligations, from which the Gentiles were free."
2. "συνήσθιεν: As he had done, Acts 10:0, on the prompting of a heavenly vision; and himself defended it, Acts 11:0."
3. "The whole incident is remarkably characteristic of Peter ever the first to recognize, and the first to draw back from, great principles and truths: see this very ably enlarged on in Jowett’s note on Galatians 2:11."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "James' view (in which he was not infallible, any more than Peter) was that the Jewish converts were still to observe Jewish ordinances."
2. "Yet after all, this same Peter, through fear of man, was faithless to his own so distinctly avowed principles."
3. "An undesigned coincidence between the Gospels and the Epistle in the consistency of character as portrayed in both. It is beautiful to see how earthly misunderstandings of Christians are lost in Christ."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "James was a leading man at Jerusalem, and that the rites of Moses were observed there."
2. "Peter had learned that God designed to break down the wall of partition between the Jews and the Gentiles."
3. "No one can read his history without loving his ardent and sincere attachment to his Master; and yet no one can read it without a tear of regret that he was left thus to do injury to his cause."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A.V. misses the force of the imperfect, marking Peter's custom."
2. "Not only at church feasts, but at ordinary meals, in defiance of the Pharisaic that this prohibition was not binding."
3. "Thus of furling sails, closing the fingers. Middle voice, to draw or shrink back from through fear."

### John Calvin:
1. "For before that certain persons came. The state of the case is here laid down."
2. "If Paul had been silent here, his whole doctrine fell; all the edification obtained by his ministry was ruined."
3. "This shows us how cautiously we ought to guard against giving way to the opinions of men, lest an immoderate desire to please, or an undue dread of giving offense, should turn us aside from the right path."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They were strict and extremely conservative Jewish Christians who regarded themselves bound to observe the whole law of Moses, without requiring the same from the Gentile converts."
2. "Confining his labors to Jerusalem and the Jews, James regarded it as his duty to adhere as closely as possible to the old dispensation, in the vain hope of bringing over the nation as a whole to the Christian faith."
3. "He withdrew and separated himself. 'The words describe forcibly the cautious withdrawal of a timid person who shrinks from observation.' Characteristic for Peter, who was the first to confess Christ, and the first to deny him; the first to recognize the rights of the Gentiles, and the first to disown them practically."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For before that certain came from James... 'for before the coming as to some from James.'"

### John Gill:
1. "He made use of his Christian liberty, and ate such food dressed in such manner as the Gentiles did, without any regard to the laws and ceremonies of the Jews; and in this he did well, for hereby he declared his sense of things, that the ceremonial law was abolished."
2. "His conduct did not agree with the true sentiments of his mind, which he covered and dissembled; and which must be very staggering to the believing Gentiles, to see so great a man behave in such a manner towards them, as if they were persons not fit to converse with, and as if the observance of Jewish rites and ceremonies was necessary to salvation."
3. "What induced him to take such a step was, his fearing them which were of the circumcision: that is, the circumcised Jews, who professed faith in Christ, and were just now come from Jerusalem."
