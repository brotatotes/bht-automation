# Galatians 2:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The early believers in Antioch, including Barnabas, joined in hypocrisy with Peter, concealing their true convictions and acting contrary to their former conduct. This act of dissimulation had a significant impact, as it influenced even someone as honorable as Barnabas. The power of example, especially when it comes from respected individuals, is evident in this situation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "They were aware of the liberty in Christ which allowed them to eat with Gentiles, and had practiced it: and now, being still aware of it, and not convinced to the contrary, from mere fear of man they adopted a contrary course."
2. "It was not now a question of using a liberty, but of asserting a truth, that of justification by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law."
3. "As exhibiting Peter’s relation to James, and his fear of those who were of the circumcision, whose leader we should have naturally supposed him to have been. Also, as portraying the state of indecision in which all, except St. Paul, even including Barnabas, were in reference to the observance of the Jewish law."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "joined in hypocrisy," namely, in living as though the law were necessary to justification, through fear of man, though they knew from God their Christian liberty of eating with Gentiles."
2. "It was not a question of liberty, and of bearing with others' infirmities, but one affecting the essence of the Gospel, whether the Gentiles are to be virtually 'compelled to live as do the Jews,' in order to be justified."
3. "Even Barnabas: one least likely to be led into such an error, being with Paul in first preaching to the idolatrous Gentiles: showing the power of bad example and numbers."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is probable that they were induced to do it by the example of Peter, as they would naturally regard him as a leader."
2. "They attempted to conceal from those who had come down from James the fact that they had been in the habit of associating with the Gentiles, and of eating with them."
3. "Paul should publicly notice and reprove the conduct of Peter. It could not but be a painful duty, but the welfare of the church and the cause of religion demanded it, and Paul did not shrink from what was so obvious a duty."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Paul uses a strong word, which is employed only in 1 Timothy 4:2."
2. "Their act was hypocrisy because it was a concealment of their own more liberal conviction, and an open profession of still adhering to the narrow Pharisaic view."
3. "It was 'a practical denial of their better spiritual insight' (Wieseler)."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A denial of the better conviction to the detriment of the Gentile Christians whom Peter acknowledged as brethren in theory, and whom he now disowned in practice."
2. "The logical tendency of this conduct was evidently to break up the communion of the two branches of the church, although he himself would no doubt have deplored such a result."
3. "The word even implies sadness arising from respect and affection. Comp. Caesar's Et tu, Brute!"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "One example in Polybius means to pretend to act a part with."
2. "Insomuch that even Barnabas...was carried away with their dissimulation."
3. "It was a solemn moment when Paul saw the Jerusalem victory vanish and even Barnabas desert him as they followed the timid cowardice of Peter."

### John Gill:
1. "The Jews that were members of this church at Antioch from the beginning; or who came along with Paul and Barnabas, and stayed with them there... concealed their true sentiments, and acted the very reverse of them, and of their former conduct."
2. "Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation; so good a man as he was... and yet so forcible was the example of Peter, and the other Jews, that, as with a mighty torrent, he was carried away with it, and not able to withstand it."
3. "Such is the force of example in men who are had in great veneration and esteem."

### John Wesley:
1. "The other believing Jews dissembled with him, so that even Barnabas was carried away with their dissimulation."
