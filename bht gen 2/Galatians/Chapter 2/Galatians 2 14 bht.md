# Galatians 2:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, the focus is on the conduct of certain individuals, with an emphasis on the need for honesty and integrity in their actions. The disagreement between Peter and Paul is not a private matter but has broader implications for the church and its members. The Gentiles were being influenced to adopt Jewish customs, which contradicted the teachings of the gospel and raised questions about the role of traditions in the Christian faith. This confrontation emphasized the importance of unity without compromising the fundamental truths of the gospel message.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To walk, in the Scriptures, is usually expressive of conduct or deportment; and the idea here is, that their conduct in this case was not honest."
2. "The spirit of the world is crafty, cunning, and crooked. The gospel would correct all that wily policy, and would lead man in a path of entire honesty and truth."
3. "Had this been a private affair, Paul would doubtless have sought a private interview with Peter, and would have remonstrated with him in private on the subject. But it was public. It was a case where many were involved, and where the interests of the church were at stake."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The reference is not strictly temporal, either as referring to Peter's former intercourse with the Gentile Christians, or as indicating that he was now associating with them at table. It is rather the statement of a general principle."
2. "Indirect compulsion exerted by Peter's example. Not that he directly imposed Jewish separatism on the Gentile converts."
3. "It is used by Ignatius, Magn. 10. Cristianizein to practice Christianity occurs in Origen."

### John Calvin:
1. "The proper road to the truth of the gospel was, to unite the Gentiles with the Jews in such a manner that the true doctrine should not be injured."
2. "To bind the consciences of godly men by an obligation to keep the law, and to bury in silence the doctrine of liberty, was to purchase unity at an exorbitant price."
3. "The use of ceremonies was free for the purposes of edification, provided that believers were not deprived of their liberty, or laid under any restraint from which the gospel sets them free."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Before all, i.e., the assembled congregation. For only in this public way the censure could have its desired effect upon the body of the Jewish Christians."
2. "Livest as the Gentiles, according to the manner and custom of the Gentiles in regard to eating...brings out more vividly the inconsistency of Peter, who in the same breath gave up his native Judaism and led the Gentile converts back to Judaism."
3. "Why art thou constraining (or, compelling), not physically and directly, but morally and indirectly, by the force of example which is powerful for good or evil according to the character and position of the man who sets it."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul brought them to face (œÄœÅŒøœÇ) that." 
2. "It was not a private quarrel, but a matter of public policy."
3. "Paul charges Peter with trying to compel (conative present, Œ±ŒΩŒ±Œ≥Œ∫Œ±Œ∂ŒµŒπœÇ) the Gentiles to live all like Jews, to Judaize the Gentile Christians, the very point at issue in the Jerusalem Conference when Peter so loyally supported Paul."

### John Gill:
1. "They halted, as the Jews of old did, between two opinions, being partly for God, and partly for Baal." 
2. "They did not walk in that sincerity, with that uprightness and integrity of soul, they ought to have done."
3. "if thou being a Jew; as Peter was, born of Jewish parents, brought up in the Jews' religion, and was obliged to observe the laws that were given to that people...how he could, I say, make use of any means whatever to engage these to comply with Jewish rites and ceremonies."

### John Wesley:
1. "See Paul single against Peter and all the Jews!"
2. "Not observing the ceremonial law, which thou knowest to be now abolished."
3. "Why compellest thou the gentiles - By withdrawing thyself and all the ministers from them; either to judaize, to keep the ceremonial law, or to be excluded from church communion?"
