# Galatians 2:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We, as Jews by birth, have come to understand that salvation is not attained through our works or by following the law. Instead, it is through faith in Jesus Christ that we find justification. We must recognize that, like the Gentiles, we are all sinners in need of God's grace and redemption. It is not our place to impose the law upon others, but to share with them the message of faith in Christ and the salvation that it brings. We are all in need of His saving grace, regardless of our background or heritage.

3. "By the works of the law shall no flesh find no justification."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "We (I and thou, Peter) by nature (not by proselytism), Jews, and not sinners as (Jewish language termed the Gentiles) from among the Gentiles."
2. "YET (literally, 'BUT') knowing that . . . even we (resuming the 'we' of Galatians 2:16- :, 'we also,' as well as the Gentile sinners; casting away trust in the law), have believed," &c.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We who are Jews by nature."
2. "They knew, or they might know, that men could not be saved by their own works."
3. "They were not idolaters, and wholly ignorant of the Law of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "We are, I grant, Jews. There is an implied emphasis on the special prerogatives and privileges of the Jews as such." 
2. "Sinners, in the conventional Jewish sense; born heathen, and as such sinners; not implying that Jews are not sinners."
3. "Possibly Paul here cites the very words by which Peter sought to justify his separation from the Gentile Christians, and takes up these words in order to draw from them an opposite conclusion."

### John Calvin:
1. "We, who appear to excel others, â€” we, who, by means of the covenant, have always enjoyed the privilege of being nigh to God, have found no method of obtaining salvation, but by believing in Christ: why, then, should we prescribe another method to the Gentiles?"
2. "For, if the law were necessary or advantageous for salvation to those who observed its enactments, it must have been most of all advantageous to us to whom it was given; but if we relinquished it, and betook ourselves to Christ, much less ought compliance with it to be urged upon the Gentiles."
3. "Since the Jews themselves, with all their advantages, were forced to betake themselves to the faith of Christ, how much more necessary was it that the Gentiles should look for salvation through faith?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We Jews by birth, and not sinners, i.e., gross sinners without law and without God, like the heathen."

1. "The Jews regarded all Gentiles as 'sinners' in contrast with themselves."
2. "It is not clear whether verses Galatians 2:15-21 were spoken by Paul to Peter or whether Paul is now simply addressing the Galatians in the light of the controversy with Peter."
3. "Burton thinks that he is 'mentally addressing Peter, if not quoting from what he said to him.'"

### John Gill:
1. "Some are Jews by grace, in a spiritual sense, as all are that are Christ's, that are true believers in him, that are born again, and have internal principles of grace formed in their souls, of whatsoever nation they be."
2. "The reason of this description, both in the positive and negative branch of it, is to observe, that since they, the apostles, and others, who were born Jews, and so under the law of Moses, and, until Christ came, were under obligation to observe it, but had now relinquished it, and wholly and alone believed in Christ for righteousness and life."
3. "Not but that the Jews also were sinners both by nature and practice, were involved in the guilt of sin, under the power of it, and defiled with it, as the apostle elsewhere most fully proves."
