# Galatians 2:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, not even of the moral or ceremonial law, is crucial. This distinction is made clear when looking at the significance of using the terms Christ Jesus and Jesus Christ. The apostle emphasizes that faith in Jesus Christ is the means by which we receive justification, not through our own works. The futility of seeking justification through the law is evident, as no human, be it Jew or Gentile, can be justified by the works of the law.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The works of the law" are those which have the law for their object—which are wrought to fulfill the law.
2. "But only (in no other way save) through faith in Jesus Christ," as the mean and instrument of justification.
3. He rests his argument on this as an axiom in theology, referring to :-, "Moses and Jesus Christ; The law and the promise; Doing and believing; Works and faith; Wages and the gift; The curse and the blessing—are represented as diametrically opposed."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "But it means that the persons here referred to, those who had been born Jews, and who had been converted to Christianity, had had an opportunity to learn and understand this, which the Gentiles had not."
2. "It is the declared purpose of God to regard and treat those sinners who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ as if they had not sinned, on the ground of the merits of the Saviour."
3. "It is an act by which God determines to treat him hereafter as a righteous man, or as if he had not sinned. The ground or reason of this is, the merit of the Lord Jesus Christ; merit such that we can plead it as if it were our own."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The meaning to declare or pronounce righteous cannot be consistently carried through Paul's writings in the interest of a theological fiction of imputed righteousness." 
2. "The use of ejan mh is to be thus explained: A man is not justified by the works of the law: (he is not justified) except by faith in Jesus Christ."
3. "Flesh. For no flesh."

### John Calvin:
1. "Not by works, but by the Gift of Christ alone."
2. "Let it therefore remain settled, that the proposition is so framed as to admit of no exception, 'that we are justified in no other way than by faith,' or, 'that we are not justified but by faith,' or, which amounts to the same thing, 'that we are justified by faith alone.'"
3. "By the works of the law shall no flesh be justified."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Here the term ‘justify’ is first introduced in this Epistle. It means acquittal from the guilt and punishment of sin in the tribunal of the just and holy God, on the ground of Christ’s atoning death and through the medium of faith by which we apprehend Christ’s merits and make his righteousness our own."
2. "‘By works of law,’ the whole law, moral as well as ceremonial."
3. "Shall no flesh be justified, lit., ‘shall all flesh not be justified,’ or ‘find no justification.’ An expressive Hebraism. The negation attaches to the verb, and not to the noun. But the genius of the English language requires such a transposition. ‘Flesh’ in Hebrew is often used for man, living being. The future tense expresses moral impossibility: such a thing can never happen."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The two ways of getting right with God are here set forth: by faith in Christ Jesus, by the works of the law."
2. "The terms faith, righteousness, law, works occur more frequently in Galatians and Romans because Paul is dealing directly with the problem in opposition to the Judaizers who contended that Gentiles had to become Jews to be saved."
3. "Paul uses δικαιοσυνη in two senses: Justification, on the basis of what Christ has done and obtained by faith; Sanctification, actual goodness as the result of living with and for Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "Men are not justified by faith, either as an habit, or an act; not by it as an habit or principle, this would be to confound justification and sanctification; nor as an act, for as such it is a man's own, and then justification would be by a man's works, contrary to the Scripture."
2. "These Jews did not believe in Christ, in order by their believing to procure their justification before God, and acceptance with him, but that they might receive, by faith, this blessing from the Lord in their own conscience, and enjoy the comfort of it, and all that spiritual peace which results from it, and which they could not find in the works of the law."
3. "By the works of the law shall no flesh be justified."

### John Wesley:
1. "Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law — Not even of the moral, much less the ceremonial, law."
2. "And they are not always placed promiscuously; but generally in a more solemn way of speaking, the Apostle says, Christ Jesus; in a more familiar, Jesus Christ."
3. "Because — Considering the demands of the law, and the fate of human nature, it is evident, that by the works of the law - By such an obedience as it requires. Shall no flesh living — No human creature, Jew or Gentile, be justified."
