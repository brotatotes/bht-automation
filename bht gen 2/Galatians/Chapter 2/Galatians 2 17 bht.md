# Galatians 2:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When we seek to be justified by Christ, acknowledging our own sinfulness, it may raise questions about whether Christ promotes sin. However, seeking justification by faith does not imply that Christ endorses sin. Rather, it recognizes our need for salvation and righteousness found only in Him. Christ reveals our sinfulness, offering redemption. He is not the minister of sin but the bringer of grace and righteousness. Through faith in Him, we find salvation that surpasses the limitations of the law. Christ's purpose is to lead us away from sin, not to encourage it.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But if, seeking...to be justified in Christ...we ourselves also were found to be sinners...is therefore Christ the minister of sin?"
2. "Whether we read ·ºÑœÅŒ± or ·ºÜœÅŒ± matters little...The clause must be interrogative."
3. "Can we believe, are we to hold henceforth, such a consequence?"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But if, seeking to be justified in Christ...we ourselves also were found sinners." 
2. "The whole sin lies, not with Christ, but with him who would necessitate such a blasphemous inference."
3. "Though 'seeking' from Christ, we have not 'found' salvation."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To me it seems probable that Paul here has reference to an objection which has in all ages been brought against the doctrine of justification by faith, and which seems to have existed in his time, that the doctrine leads to licentiousness."
2. "The objections are that it does not teach the necessity of the observance of the Law in order to acceptance with God. That it pronounces a man justified and accepted who is a violator of the Law. That his acceptance does not depend on moral character."
3. "Is therefore Christ the minister of sin? - Is it to be traced to him? Is it a fair and legitimate conclusion that this is the tendency of the gospel? God forbid - It is not so."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "To seek to be justified by Christ is an admission that there is no justification by works; that the seeker is unjustified, and therefore a sinner."
2. "The effort to attain justification by faith in Christ develops the consciousness of sin. It compels the seeker, whether Jew or Gentile, to put himself upon the common plane of sinners."
3. "Peter, by his Christian profession, had asserted that justification was by faith alone; and by his eating with Gentiles had declared that the Mosaic law was no longer binding upon him. He had thus, figuratively, destroyed or pulled down the Jewish law as a standard of Christian faith and conduct."

### John Calvin:
1. "If, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we are not yet perfectly righteous, but still unholy, and if, consequently, Christ is not sufficient for our righteousness, it follows that Christ is the minister of the doctrine which leaves men in sin." 
2. "If, in consequence of the righteousness of faith, we, who are Jews and were 'sanctified from the womb,' are reckoned guilty and polluted, shall we say that Christ makes sin to be powerful in his own people, and that he is therefore the author of sin?" 
3. "Christ did not bring sin, but unveiled it; he did not take away righteousness, but stripped the Jews of a false disguise."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Sinners in the Jewish sense, i.e., lawless heathen, as in Galatians 2:15."
2. "Let it never be! or ‚ÄòFar be it;‚Äô ‚ÄòBy no means;‚Äô ‚ÄòAway with the thought;‚Äô ‚ÄòNay, verily.‚Äô This phrase occurs fourteen times in St. Paul, thrice in Galatians (Galatians 2:17; Galatians 2:21; Galatians 3:21), ten times in Romans (Romans 3:4; Romans 3:6; Romans 3:31; Romans 6:2; Romans 6:15; Romans 7:7; Romans 7:13; Romans 9:14; Romans 11:1; Romans 11:11), and once in 1 Corinthians 6:15."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Like the Gentiles, Jews who thought they were not sinners, when brought close to Christ, found that they were."
2. "Christ simply revealed to us our sin."
3. "God forbid, May it not happen."

### John Gill:
1. "We ourselves also are found sinners; that is, either we should be so, were we not to rest here, but seek to join our own works with Christ's righteousness for our justification, and so make Christ the minister of sin, of an imperfect righteousness, which cannot justify..."
2. "...or we are reckoned sinners by you, judaizing Christians, for leaving the law, and going to Christ for righteousness; and if so, Christ must be the minister of sin, for he has directed and taught us so to do; but God forbid that any such thing should be said of him..."
3. "...or if we are still sinners, and unjustified persons, notwithstanding we seek to Christ to be justified by him, but need the law, and the works of it to justify us, then Christ, instead of being a minister of righteousness, is a minister of the law..."

### John Wesley:
1. "If while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves are still found sinners."
2. "If we continue in sin, will it therefore follow, that Christ is the minister or countenancer of sin?"
