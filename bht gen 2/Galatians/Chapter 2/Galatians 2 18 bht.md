# Galatians 2:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By continuing in sin, I am the one who proves myself to be a transgressor, not Christ. The blame for this lies solely on me. The objection raised against the gospel would be valid if it promised justification to those who persist in sin. However, that is not the case. Therefore, it is clear that anyone who professes the gospel but does not live according to it is indeed a sinner, and not justified by the gospel.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For (substantiates the μὴ γένοιτο, and otherwise deduces the ὑρέθημεν ἁμαρτωλοί) if the things which I pulled down, those very things (and no others) I again build up..." 
2. "The first person is chosen clementiæ causa; the second would have placed Peter, where the first means that he should place himself. I am proving myself a transgressor."
3. "The force of the verse is, ‘You, by now reasserting the obligation of the law, are proving (quoad te) that your former step of setting aside the law was in fact a transgression of it:’ viz. in that you neglected and set it aside, not, as Chrys., Thl., and Meyer (from Gal 2:19), because the law itself was leading you on to faith in Christ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Instead of commending yourself as you sought to do, you merely commend yourself as a transgressor."
2. "You, Peter, by now asserting the law to be obligatory, are proving yourself a "sinner," or "transgressor."
3. "Thus you are debarred by transgression from justification by the law, and you debar yourself from justification by Christ, since in your theory He becomes a minister of sin."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The sense is, that if a man, having removed or destroyed that which was evil, again introduces it or establishes it, he does wrong, and is a transgressor of the Law of God."
2. "Their conduct, therefore, was that of building up again that which had once been destroyed, destroyed by the ministry, and toils, and death of the Lord Jesus, and by the fair influence of his gospel."
3. "To rebuild that again; to re-establish those customs, was wrong, and now involved the guilt of a transgression of the Law of God."

### John Calvin:
1. "He had preached the faith of Christ in such a manner as to connect with it the ruin and destruction of sin."
2. "For, as we are taught by John, that Christ came not to build up the kingdom of sin, but 'that he might destroy the works of the devil,' (1 John 3:8)"
3. "It was, therefore, in the highest degree improbable, that the same person who destroyed sin should renew its power; and, by stating the absurdity, he repels the calumny."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The sin is the other way, in going back from Christ to Moses, from the gospel of freedom to the law of bondage."
2. "Peter in this case proved himself an architect of ruin."
3. "I prove myself to be a transgressor of the law itself, by rebuilding it on the ruins of the gospel contrary to its own spirit and intent to prepare the way for the gospel as its fulfillment."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Peter, by his shifts had contradicted himself helplessly as Paul shows by this condition."
2. "When he lived like a Gentile, he tore down the ceremonial law."
3. "When he lived like a Jew, he tore down salvation by grace."

### John Gill:
1. "He showed himself a faithful minister of Christ."
2. "By his practice and example, built up and established those very things he had before destroyed."
3. "Should he, or any other, take encouragement to sin from the doctrine of free justification by the righteousness of Christ, as if he was the author and minister of sin, and allowed persons in it; this would be to establish sin."

### John Wesley:
1. "By my sinful practice...I only make myself - Or show myself, not Christ, to be a transgressor; the whole blame lies on me..." 
2. "The objection were just, if the gospel promised justification to men continuing in sin. But it does not."
3. "Therefore if any who profess the gospel do not live according to it, they are sinners, it is certain, but not justified, and so the gospel is clear."
