# Galatians 2:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul declares that he died to the law, meaning that he no longer sought life and righteousness through it. Through the law, he realized that righteousness and forgiveness could only come from Christ and not through his own works. Thus, he became dead to the law, no longer relying on it for justification. The purpose of being dead to the law was so that he could live unto God, not to continue in sin but to be freed from it and live a life dedicated to God.
