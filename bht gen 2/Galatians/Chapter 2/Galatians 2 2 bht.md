# Galatians 2:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When faced with challenges and opposition, seeking guidance and confirmation from God becomes crucial. In this instance, the apostle Paul was not commanded by the Jerusalem church but received a direct revelation to go to Jerusalem. He went there privately to present his gospel message, highlighting the full remission of sin, to the leaders of the church. By doing so, he ensured that respected spiritual individuals would understand the purpose and approach of his ministry. Paul was determined not to run in vain, striving to maintain unity and solidify divine approval for his work.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "That some such occurred, he here assures us, and it was important for him to assert it, as showing his dependence only on divine leading, and independence of any behests from the Jerusalem church."
2. "The present subjunctive œÑœÅŒ≠œáœâ implies continuance in the course; the 2 aorist indicative ·ºîŒ¥œÅŒ±ŒºŒøŒΩ, the course already run."
3. "When we consider the very strong prejudices of the Jerusalem church, this feeling of anxiety, leading him to take measures to prevent his work from being tumultuously disowned by them, is surely but natural."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
2. "by revelation‚Äînot from being absolutely dependent on the apostles at Jerusalem, but by independent divine 'revelation.'"
3. "It was necessary that the Jerusalem apostles should know beforehand that the Gospel Paul preached to the Gentiles was the same as theirs, and had received divine confirmation in the results it wrought on the Gentile converts."
5. "lest, c.‚Äî'lest I should be running, or have run, in vain' that is, that they might see that I am not running, and have not run, in vain."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He went up by the express command of God."
2. "He made a private explanation of his motives and views."
3. "It is better to seek an opportunity of private explanation than to submit it to a general multitude or to public debate."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "By revelation [Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ± Œ±œÄŒøŒ∫Œ±ŒªœÖœàŒπŒΩ]. It was specially and divinely revealed to me that I should go." 
2. "The repetition of the phrase (Leviticus 6:9) may point to a favorite expression of his opponents in commending these leaders to Paul as models for his preaching." 
3. "Run [œÑœÅŒµœáŒµŒπŒΩ] is a favorite metaphor with Paul. See Romans 9:16; 1 Corinthians 9:24, 1 Corinthians 9:26; Galatians 5:7; Philippians 2:16; Philippians 3:13, Philippians 3:14."

### John Calvin:
1. "This ought to have been more than enough to overcome the obstinacy of those who blamed Paul by holding up the names of the apostles. For although, up to this time, there had been some room for debate, the communication of the mind of God put an end to all discussion."
2. "Thus, he was not made an apostle by them, but acknowledged to be an apostle."
3. "The agreement of all who teach in the Church is a powerful aid for the confirmation of faith. Since, therefore, Satan was laboring so insidiously to hinder the progress of the gospel, Paul resolved to meet him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This appointment may have been either prompted or confirmed by the inner revelation."
2. "Paul confines himself to an account of the private and personal agreement with the leading Apostles, because the decision and pastoral letter of the council had already been communicated by him to his churches."
3. "The blame is, of course, not intended for the Apostles themselves, whose testimony in his favor it is his purpose here to relate, and whom he always treated with fraternal esteem and love, but for the Judaizers who unduly exalted them above Paul."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I laid before them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles," precisely as Luke has recorded.
2. "The decision reached by this group would shape the decision of the public conference in the adjourned meeting."
3. "The Judaizers were assuming that the twelve apostles and James the Lord's brother would side with them against Paul and Barnabas."

### John Gill:
1. "By divine revelation...a confirmation...according to the mind of God." 
2. "He communicated the self-same Gospel...free and full remission of sin." 
3. "Privately to them which were of reputation...spiritual men...proper persons...to lay the scheme of his ministry before."

### John Wesley:
1. "I went up ‚Äî Not by any command from them, but by an express revelation from God."
2. "And laid before them ‚Äî The chief of the church in Jerusalem."
3. "Lest I should run, or should have run, in vain ‚Äî Lest I should lose the fruit either of my present or past labours."
