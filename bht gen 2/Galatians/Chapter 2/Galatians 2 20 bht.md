# Galatians 2:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through our union with Christ, we are crucified with Him, our old sinful nature is destroyed, and we are made alive in a new spiritual life. In this new life, we are dead to sin and alive to God. Christ, who loved us and gave Himself for us, now lives within us, empowering us to live according to His will and transforming us from the inside out. This life of faith centers on a personal relationship with Christ, where we find encouragement and motivation to trust in Him and walk in His ways.

### Albert Barnes:
(1) "In respect to one thing he was dead; to all that was truly great and noble he was alive."
(2) "Paul says that he became insensible to the Law as a means of justification; to the world; to ambition and the love of money; to the pride and pomp of life, and to the dominion of evil and hateful passions." 
(3) "The object of all such expressions as this is, to show that it was no design of the gospel to make people inactive, or to annihilate their energies."


### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The statement explains how a believer dies to the law by means of the law itself."
2. "Ethically, a believer is crucified with Christ, and thus the demand of the law is fulfilled in him likewise."

2. "Christ lives in us in two ways. The one life consists in governing us by his Spirit, and directing all our actions; the other, in making us partakers of his righteousness."

1. "Paul means the past act which took place in his conversion. It is an explanation of the word ‘died,’...the believer is crucified with Christ as to his old, sinful nature, but only in order to live a new spiritual life with the risen Saviour."
2. "The believer lives and moves also, as a self-conscious personality, in Christ... Faith is the bond which so unites the soul to Christ, that it puts on Christ... and derives all its spiritual nourishment from Him."

Even his natural mortal life continues in these world, but as the earthen vessel containing the heavenly treasure of the imperishable life of Christ who dwells in him and transforms even the body into a temple of the Holy Spirit."
