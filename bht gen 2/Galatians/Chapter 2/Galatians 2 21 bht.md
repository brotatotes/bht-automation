# Galatians 2:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By not seeking justification through my own works, I am not nullifying the grace of God that was freely given through Christ. However, those who seek righteousness through the law are actually rendering Christ's death unnecessary. If righteousness could be attained through obedience to the law, then there would have been no need for Christ to die. Therefore, it is clear that salvation and justification are solely through the righteousness of Christ and not by our own efforts under the law.
