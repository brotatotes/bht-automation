# Galatians 2:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul and his companions stood firm against the demand for circumcision, even in the case of Titus, who was a Greek. The apostles in Jerusalem were in agreement that Gentile converts should not be burdened with Jewish customs and rituals. It was recognized that such practices were not necessary for salvation and should not be imposed on believers. The refusal to compel Titus to be circumcised was a clear demonstration that the apostles did not insist on this requirement for Gentiles.
