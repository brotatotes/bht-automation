# Galatians 2:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul faced opposition from false brethren who wanted to impose circumcision on Titus, using it as an opportunity to distort Paul's teachings. These false brethren went to great lengths to spy on the freedom that believers had in Christ from the bondage of the ceremonial law. They insinuated themselves into the Christian brotherhood under false pretenses, aiming to bring the Gentile converts back into the bondage of the Mosaic rites. Paul, however, stood firm in his refusal to yield to their demands, knowing that their intentions were contrary to the truth of the Gospel.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "What I did concerning Titus (namely, by not permitting him to be circumcised) was not from contempt of circumcision, but 'on account of the false brethren' who, had I yielded to the demand for his being circumcised, would have perverted the case into a proof that I deemed circumcision necessary."
2. "They [the false brethren] came in an underhand manner, stealthily, to spy out as foes in the guise of friends, wishing to destroy and rob us of our liberty - from the yoke of the ceremonial law."
3. "If they had found that we circumcised Titus through fear of the apostles, they would have made that a ground for insisting on imposing the legal yoke on the Gentiles."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is clear, however, that they opposed the apostle Paul; that they regarded him as teaching dangerous doctrines; that they perverted and misstated his views; and that they claimed to have clearer views of the nature of the true religion than he had."
2. "The word rendered 'unawares' (παρεισάκτους pareisaktous) is derived from a verb meaning to lead in by the side of others, to introduce along with others; and then to lead or bring in by stealth, to smuggle in."
3. "Their object in spying out the liberty which Paul and others had, was, undoubtedly, to be witnesses of the fact that they did not observe the special rites of the Mosaic system; to make report of it; to insist upon their complying with those customs, and thus to secure the imposition of those rites on the Gentile converts."
