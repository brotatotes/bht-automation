The apostle and his companions firmly stood their ground, refusing to yield to the false brethren who sought to distort the truth of the gospel. They did not give in to any form of subjection that compromised the purity of the doctrine they preached. It was vital for them to maintain the genuine gospel, untainted by false teachings, for the sake of the Galatians and all Gentile believers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "We would willingly have yielded for love, but not in the way of subjection, where 'the truth of the Gospel' was at stake."
2. "Truth precise, unaccommodating, abandons nothing that belongs to itself, admits nothing that is inconsistent with it."
3. "We defended for your sakes your true faith and liberties, which you are now renouncing."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We did not yield even for the shortest time."
2. "He did not yield a moment. He felt that a great principle was involved."
3. "That the great principle of the Christian religion which had been taught you might continue, and that you might enjoy the full benefit of the pure gospel, without its being intermingled with any false views."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "The noun only in Paul and the Pastorals, and always in the sense of self-subjection."
3. "Comp. 2 Corinthians 9:13; 1 Timothy 2:11; 1 Timothy 3:4."

### John Calvin:
1. "This steadiness was the seal of Paul's doctrine. For when false brethren, who wished nothing more than a ground of accusation against him, exerted themselves to the utmost, and he stood firm, there could no longer be any room for doubt."
2. "The truth of the gospel denotes its genuine purity, or, which means the same thing, its pure and entire doctrine. For the false apostles did not altogether set aside the gospel, but mixed up with it their own notions, so as to give it a false and disguised aspect, which it always has when we make the smallest departure 'from the simplicity that is in Christ.'"
3. "Let us remember that it is not enough to retain the name of the gospel, and some kind of summary of its doctrines, if its solid purity do not remain untouched."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Paul and his companions could, therefore, not yield to them for a moment by the submission (required by the false brethren) to the law of circumcision, so as to circumcise Titus according to their demand."
2. "He could here not become a Jew to the Jews in order to gain them, as in such cases where the truth was not jeopardized, and where subjection was simply a matter of charity and expediency."
3. "Submission in the case of Titus would have been treason to the truth that Christ is the only and sufficient source of salvation."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Pointed denial that he and Barnabas yielded at all 'in the way of subjection'"
2. "The whole problem of Gentile Christianity was involved in the case of Titus, whether Christianity was to be merely a modified brand of legalistic Judaism or a spiritual religion"
3. "The case of Timothy later was utterly different, for he had a Jewish mother and a Greek father. Titus was pure Greek."

### John Gill:
1. "Knowing what advantages and improvements would be made of it, should they allow of the use of these things as necessary for any short time, though it should be agreed then to drop them."
2. "The reason why the apostle, and others with him, were so resolute and pertinacious in this matter was that the truth of the Gospel might continue with you with the Galatians in particular, and with all the Gentiles in general."
3. "The apostle's desire was that the Gospel might be continued with them genuine, sincere, and unmixed, in opposition to the shadows of the law, and the false doctrines of men."

### John Wesley:
1. "With such wonderful prudence did the apostle use his Christian liberty!"
2. "That the truth of the gospel — That is, the true genuine gospel."
