# Galatians 2:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Although some may have considered these apostles to be great and influential figures, their reputation and status did not hold importance to Paul. Regardless of their esteemed positions, God does not show favoritism based on external factors. Paul acknowledges that his own past as a persecutor of Christians is irrelevant in light of God's grace. He asserts that his encounter with Christ and direct commission from Him make him equal to these esteemed apostles. Therefore, the opinions and accolades attributed to these men by others hold no weight when it comes to Paul's apostolic authority.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Apostle begins with ἀπὸ δὲ ῶν δοκούντων εἶναί τι, having it in his mind to add οὐδὲν προσελαβόμην or the like: but then, going off into the parenthesis ὁποῖοί ποτε ἦσαν &c., he entirely loses sight of the original construction"
2. "The emphasis is on μοι, and is again taken up by the ἐμοὶ γάρ below."
3. "προσανέθεντο] as in ch. Galatians 1:16, imparted. As I, at my first conversion, did not impart it to flesh and blood, so they now imparted nothing to me: we were independent the one of the other."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "they . . . added nothing to me."
2. "accepteth—so as to show any partiality; 'respecteth no man's person'"
3. "seemed to be somewhat—that is, not that they seemed to be what they were not, but 'were reputed as persons of some consequence'; not insinuating a doubt but that they were justly so reputed."
4. "in conference added—or 'imparted'"
5. "As I did not by conference impart to them aught at my conversion, so they now did not impart aught additional to me, above what I already knew."
6. "This proves to the Galatians his independence as an apostle."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The object of referring to them here is, to show that he had the concurrence and approbation of the most eminent of the apostles to the course which he had pursued."
2. "What they were, or what they might be thought to be, was immaterial to his claims as an apostle, and immaterial to the authority of his own views as an apostle."
3. "God is not influenced in His judgment by a regard to the rank, or wealth, or external condition of anyone... Paul therefore claimed that all the apostles were in fact on a level in regard to their authority."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "To be something from (at the hands of) those who were of repute, whatever they were, matters nothing to me (God accepteth not man's person), for those who were of repute imparted nothing to me."
2. "Paul does not say, as A. V. and Rev., that the standing and repute of the apostles were matters of indifference to him, but that he was indifferent about receiving his commission from them as recognized dignitaries of the church."
3. "They imposed on me no new [προς αδδιτιοναλ] requirements; no conditions or limitations of my missionary work."

### John Calvin:
1. "If this be not enough to silence those dogs, their barking is sufficiently answered."
2. "Paul simply means, that the honorable rank which the apostles had attained did not prevent him from being called by God."
3. "When the apostles had heard Paul’s gospel, they did not on the other side bring forward their own, but were satisfied with his explanation, and simply and unhesitatingly embraced his doctrine."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "From those reputed to be something... the ‘pillar’ apostles... the older Apostles, James, Peter, and John, who were justly regarded as the pillars of the Church." 
2. "He does not... depreciate his colleagues, but disapproves the extravagant overestimate put upon them by the Judaizers in behalf of their own narrow and exclusive system and in opposition to Paul."
3. "God accepteth not man’s person... God never exercises partiality."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul won his point, when he persuaded Peter, James, and John to agree with him and Barnabas in their contention for freedom for the Gentile Christians from the bondage of the Mosaic ceremonial law."
2. "He means no disrespect, but he asserts his independence sharply in a tangled sentence with two parentheses."
3. "The compromisers tried to win them, but they finally came over to my view."

### John Gill:
1. "Not that they were looked upon to be more than human, as Simon Magus gave out that he was 'some great one', and his followers thought him to be 'the great power of God'; for such an extravagant conceit of these men was never entertained..."
2. "...as for himself, it is true, he had been an injurious person to the saints; and he was ready to own it, for his own humiliation, and to illustrate the grace of God in his conversion; and as these excellent men, what they were before their conversion, it was no concern of his..."
3. "...whatever privileges of this kind they had enjoyed, as could not be denied but they were considerable, yet this mattered not, nor did it make any great difference between him and them; he had seen Christ too, though as one born out of due time; had received an immediate commission from him to preach his Gospel, and was appointed an apostle by him as they were..."
