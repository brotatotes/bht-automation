# Galatians 2:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God worked powerfully in Peter, enabling him to carry out his ministry among the circumcised. Just as the Spirit of God filled Peter with extraordinary gifts and enabled him to preach the Gospel to the Jews, the same Spirit also worked powerfully in Paul for his ministry among the Gentiles. Through this divine empowerment, both Peter and Paul were able to establish and strengthen churches among their respective audiences.
