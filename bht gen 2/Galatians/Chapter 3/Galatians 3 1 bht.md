# Galatians 3:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Apostle, indignant at the Galatians' folly, rebukes them for allowing themselves to be bewitched and led astray from their initial understanding of the work and person of Christ. Their deviation from the truth of Christ's redemption and freedom from legal obligations is a denial of the necessity and efficacy of His sacrificial death. The preaching of the crucified Christ should have been enough to counteract any fascination or enchantment that led them astray, appealing to their reason and piercing their consciences.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "O foolish Galatians - That is, foolish for having yielded to the influence of the false teachers, and for having embraced doctrines that tended to subvert the gospel of the Redeemer."
2. "Who hath bewitched you - The idea here is, that they had not been led by reason and by sober judgment, but that there must have been some charm or fascination to have taken them away in this manner from what they had embraced as true."
3. "Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth - By the preaching of the gospel. He has been so fully and plainly preached that you may be said to have seen him. The effect of his being preached in the manner in which it has been done, ought to have been as great as if you had seen him crucified before your eyes."

2. "Paul first compares it to a picture, which exhibited to them, in a lively manner, the image of Christ.

3. "Let those who would discharge aright the ministry of the gospel learn, not merely to speak and declaim, but to penetrate into the consciences of men, to make them see Christ crucified, and feel the shedding of his blood."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "O senseless Galatians, to think that righteousness comes through the law, and thus virtually to deny the necessity and efficacy of Christ‚Äôs death."
2. "The relapse from the freedom of the gospel to the slavery of the law is so absurd that it seems only explicable on the assumption of magical agency."
3. "You, before whose very eyes was held up the picture of Jesus Christ on the cross... Faithful preaching is the best painting."
