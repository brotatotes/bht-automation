# Galatians 3:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who rely on the works of the law cannot share in the blessing, as they are under a curse. The curse represents a state of separation from God caused by the violation of His law, resulting in penalties in this life or the next. The law holds everyone under its curse, making it futile to expect blessings from it. The curse only takes effect when the law is broken, and since no one can perfectly obey the law, all are cursed. The law requires not just head knowledge but practical obedience, which no one can fully accomplish.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "They cannot be sharers in the blessing, for they are accursed."
2. "The citation is freely from the LXX."
3. "On τοῦ ποιῆσαι, not a Hebraism, but a construction common in later Greek, see Ellic.’s note."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "They who depend on the works of the law cannot share the blessing, for they are under the curse 'written,'." 
2. "PERFECT obedience is required by the words, 'in all things.' CONTINUAL obedience by the word, 'continueth.' No man renders this obedience."
3. "It is observable, Paul quotes Scripture to the Jews who were conversant with it, as in Epistle to the Hebrews, as said or spoken; but to the Gentiles, as written."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is impossible to be justified by the works of the Law, since, under all circumstances of obedience which we can render, we are still left with its heavy curse resting on us."
2. "All who attempt to secure salvation by the works of the Law, must be exposed to its penalty. It denounces a curse on all who do not yield entire obedience; and no partial compliance with its demands can save from the penalty."
3. "A man who does not yield compliance to a whole law is subject to its penalty, or to a curse. All law is sustained on this principle."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The specific character of the curse is not stated. It is not merely the wrath of God as it issues in final destruction, but it represents a condition of alienation from God, caused by violation of his law, with all the penalty which accrues from it, either in this life or the next." 
2. "The expression is figurative, the book of the law being conceived as a prescribed district or domain, in which one remains or out of which he goes."
3. "Comp. continue in the faith, Acts 14:22; in the covenant, Hebrews 13:9; in the things which thou hast learned, 2 Timothy 3:14."

### John Calvin:
1. "The argument is drawn from the contradictory nature of the two schemes; for the same fountain does not yield both hot and cold."
2. "The law holds all living men under its curse; and from the law, therefore, it is in vain to expect a blessing."
3. "Paul concludes boldly that all are cursed, because all have been commanded to keep the law perfectly; which implies that in the present corruption of our nature the power of keeping it perfectly is wanting."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Picture of the curse hanging over them like a Damocles' blade."
2. "The curse becomes effective only when the law is violated."
3. "The emphasis is on 'continueth' and 'all'."

### John Gill:
1. "As many as seek for justification by the works of the law, and trust in their own righteousness for acceptance with God, these are so far from being blessed or justified hereby, that they are under the curse, that is, of the law..."
2. "By trusting in their works, they are trusting in the flesh, and so bring down upon themselves the curse threatened to the man that trusts in man, and makes flesh his arm..."
3. "The law requires doing; it is not content with mere theory without practice; it is not enough to know it, or hear it, it must be done."

2. "Cursed is every one who continueth not in all the things which are written in the law."
