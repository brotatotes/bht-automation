# Galatians 3:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By the law, no man can be justified before God. The law operates on the basis of doing and works, while faith operates on the basis of trust and belief. The fact that the just shall live by faith implies that life is promised and can only be obtained through faith. It is not a matter of a righteous person living, but rather that life is found exclusively in connection with faith. The law cannot provide justification, but faith in God's appointed way can.
