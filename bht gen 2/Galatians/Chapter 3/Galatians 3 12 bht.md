# Galatians 3:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The law does not require faith, but rather obedience. It does not offer justification through belief, but through obedience. The law's demand is for actions, not just faith. It is not a matter of what we believe, but of what we do.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 12. doeth—Many depended on the
	law although they did not keep it; but without doing, saith Paul, it
	is of no use to them (Romans 2:13;
	Romans 2:17; Romans 2:23;
	Romans 10:5).

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Law is not a matter of faith; it does not relate to faith; it does not require faith; it deals in other matters, and it pertains to another system than to faith."
2. "This is the language of the Law, and this is what the Law teaches. It does not make provision for faith, but it requires unwavering and perpetual obedience, if man would obtain life by it."


### John Calvin:
1. "The contradiction between the law and faith lies in the matter of justification."
2. "The law is not of faith; that is, it has a method of justifying a man which is wholly at variance with faith."
3. "There are none righteous by the works of the law, because there are none who do those works."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  The law is not of faith  (ο νομος ουκ εστιν εκ πιστεως). Law demands complete obedience and rests not on mercy, faith, grace. 

### John Gill:
1. "The law does not consist of faith in Christ, nor does it require it, and that a man should live by it upon his righteousness."
2. "The law does not take any notice of a man's faith; nor has it anything to do with a man as a believer, but as a doer, in the point of justification."
3. "Since eternal life is a promise made before the world began, is provided for in an everlasting covenant, is revealed in the Gospel, and is the pure gift of God's grace through Christ, it seems that it never was the will of God that it should be obtained by the works of the law."

### John Wesley:
1. And the law is not of faith — But quite opposite to it: it does not say, Believe; but, Do. Leviticus 18:5
