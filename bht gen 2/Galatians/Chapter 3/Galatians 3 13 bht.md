# Galatians 3:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Only Christ, through his sacrificial death and redemption, has freed us from the curse of the law. With great love and at a high price, he ransomed both Jews and Gentiles alike. By becoming a curse on our behalf, willingly bearing the weight of our sins and the penalty of the law, he delivered us from its condemnation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But this curse has been removed by the redemption of Christ."
2. "They only were under the curse of Galatians 3:10, and they being by Christ redeemed from that curse, the blessing of Abraham (justification by faith), which was always destined by God to flow through the Jews to the Gentiles, was set at liberty thus to flow out to the Gentiles."
3. "The Law (personified) held us (Jews) under its curse; (out of this) Christ bought us, BECOMING a curse for us, on our behalf."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The curse of its non-fulfilment affects the Gentiles through the Jews; for the law represents that righteousness which God requires of all, and which, since the Jews failed to fulfil, the Gentiles are equally unable to fulfil."
2. "The curse had to be removed from off the heathen, too, as well as the Jews, in order that the blessing, through Abraham, might flow to them."
3. "Christ's bearing the particular curse of hanging on the tree, is a sample of the 'general' curse which He representatively bore."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Christ hath redeemed us...from the curse of the Law, by his being made a curse for us." 
2. "The sense of the passage before us is...that Jesus was subjected to what was regarded as an accursed death...Jesus’ death was the same that it would have been if he had been the vilest of malefactors, and that death was regarded by the Law as accursed."
3. "The force of the argument here...is, that if to be suspended on a gibbet after having been put to death was regarded as a curse, it should not be regarded as a curse in a less degree to be suspended Alive on a cross, and to be put to death in this manner."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Paul, as Lightfoot justly says, instinctively omits these words, since Christ was in no sense accursed by God in his crucifixion."
2. "The statement does not refer to Christ's enduring the curse in our stead, but solely to the attitude in which the law placed Christ by subjecting him to the death of a malefactor."
3. "That is, the cross is regarded as a tree, and Christians as its fruit."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ hath redeemed us. The apostle had made all who are under the law subject to the curse; from which arose this great difficulty, that the Jews could not free themselves from the curse of the law."
2. "If we are saved, because we have been freed from the curse of the law, then righteousness is not by the law."
3. "He could not cease to be the object of his Father’s love, and yet he endured his wrath. For how could he reconcile the Father to us if he had incurred his hatred and displeasure?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Christ, out of infinite love and in full agreement with the Father’s eternal plan of redemption, voluntarily assumed, bore and abolished, by His death on the cross, the whole curse of the outraged law in the stead and in behalf of sinners."
2. "Christ was the voluntary bearer of the entire guilt of the whole race, yet without any personal guilt. The curse is transferred from the guilty sinner to the innocent victim."
3. "For Christ was not Himself accursed of God, but only in a vicarious sense, that is, by the voluntary self-assumption of the curse of others, and in full harmony with the Father’s wish and will."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Christ purchased us from the curse of the law."
2. "He bought us out and we are free from the curse which he took on himself."
3. "Quotation from Deuteronomy 21:23 with the omission of 'by God'."

### John Gill:
1. "The Redeemer is Christ, the Son of God; who was appointed and called to this work by his Father, and which he himself agreed to."
2. "He purchases them with the price of his own blood, and so delivers them 'from the curse of the law'; its sentence of condemnation and death, and the execution of it."
3. "He was made under the law, stood in their legal place and stead and having the sins of them all imputed to him, and answerable for them, the law finding them on him, charges him with them, and curses him for them."

### John Wesley:
1. "Christ — Christ alone. The abruptness of the sentence shows an holy indignation at those who reject so great a blessing."
2. "Hath redeemed us — Whether Jews or Gentiles, at a high price."
3. "Being made a curse for us — Taking the curse upon himself, that we might be delivered from it, willingly submitting to that death which the law pronounces peculiarly accursed."
