# Galatians 3:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through faith, the blessing of justification by the righteousness of Christ extends to the Gentiles, allowing them to experience the same blessing that Abraham enjoyed. This counters the false belief that blessings are only for the Jewish people. In Christ, both Gentiles and Jews can receive the promised Holy Spirit, which is obtained through faith and looks to the fulfillment of God's promise.
