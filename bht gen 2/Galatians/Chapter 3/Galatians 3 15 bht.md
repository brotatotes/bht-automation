# Galatians 3:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In illustrating this point, I use a common example from our human experience. Just as a legally confirmed covenant or testament between people cannot be invalidated or altered by anyone other than the parties involved, so it is with the covenant made by God. No one can change or add new conditions to it.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But (see 1Co 15:32) the expression refers not only to the character of the example chosen, but to the temporary standing-point of him who speaks: I put myself for the time on a level with ordinary men in the world."
2. "A (mere) man's covenant (not 'testament,' as Olsh., after Aug., al.; for there is here no introduction of that idea: the promise spoken to Abraham was strictly a covenant..."
3. "No one notwithstanding (that it is merely a human covenant) sets aside or supplements (with new conditions..."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "None does so who acts in common equity. Much less would the righteous God do so."
2. "The promise is everlasting, and more peculiarly belongs to God. The law is regarded as something extraneous, afterwards introduced, exceptional and temporary."
3. "So legal Judaism could make no alteration in the fundamental relation between God and man, already established by the promises to Abraham; it could not add as a new condition the observance of the law, in which the fulfilment of the promise would be attached to a condition impossible for man to perform."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The main design of the argument and the illustration here is to show that the promise made to Abraham was by no means made void by the giving of the Law."
2. "The argument here is, that such a covenant or agreement must be much less important than a promise made by God. But even that could not be annulled."
3. "No one can change it. No new conditions can be annexed; nor can there be any drawing back from its terms. It binds the parties to a faithful fulfillment of all the conditions."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "According to human analogy; reasoning as men would reason in ordinary affairs."
2. "The phrase is peculiar to Paul."
3. "The doctrine of the Judaisers, while virtually annulling the promise, was apparently only the imposing of new conditions."

### John Calvin:
1. "By this expression he intended to put them to the blush. It is highly disgraceful and base that the testimony of God should have less weight with us than that of a mortal man."
2. "In demanding that the sacred covenant of God shall receive not less deference than is commonly yielded to ordinary human transactions, he does not place God on a level with men. The immense distance between God and men is still left for their consideration."
3. "If human bargains be so firm that they can receive no addition, how much more must this covenant remain inviolable?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There is a touch of tenderness in the appeal here, as if to make amends for the severity of the foregoing rebuke."
2. "If even changeable men keep legal contracts sacred, how much more the unchangeable God."
3. "The translation 'will,' 'testament' (in the margin of the E. V.), is unsuited to the connection, and the translation 'promise' is ungrammatical."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "After the custom and practice of men, an illustration from life."
2. "Perfect passive participle here, state of completion, authoritative confirmation."
3. "Both parties can by agreement cancel a contract, but not otherwise."

### John Gill:
1. "I speak after the manner of men; agreeably to a Talmudic form of speech in use among the Jews, 'the law speaks according to the language of the children of men', or 'after the manner of men', when they argue from any Scripture, in which a word is repeated, and the latter word seems to point out something peculiar."
2. "Though it be but a man's covenant, or testament, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth or addeth thereto."
3. "If a covenant made between men, or a man's will and testament, be confirmed, signed, sealed, and witnessed, in a proper manner, no other man can make them void, or take anything from them, or add anything to them, only the parties concerned by their own will and consent."

### John Wesley:
1. "I speak after the manner of men — I illustrate this by a familiar instance, taken from the practice of men."
2. "Though it be but a man's covenant, yet, if it be once legally confirmed, none - No, not the covenanter himself, unless something unforeseen occur."
3. "Disannulleth, or addeth thereto — Any new conditions."
