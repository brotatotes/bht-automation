# Galatians 3:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The covenant made with Abraham and his seed refers to the promises of the covenant of grace. These promises include being God's people, the promise of a Savior and Redeemer, the gift of the Holy Spirit, justification and forgiveness, adoption into God's family, perseverance in grace, and the hope of eternal inheritance. The seed mentioned in the promises is not limited to a specific lineage but encompasses all believers, both Jews and Gentiles, who are united in Christ. The blessings promised to Abraham are fulfilled through faith in Jesus Christ, and all who believe in Him can partake in the richness of God's covenant promises.

2. "Such is Paul‚Äôs interpretation; such is evidently the sentiment which he intends to convey, and the argument which he intends to urge. He designs evidently to be understood as affirming that in the use of the singular number œÉœÄŒµÃÅœÅŒºŒ± sperma (seed), instead of the plural œÉ

### Marvin Vincent:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The promised inheritance refers...to the kingdom of Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "But the promise to Abraham uses œÉœÄŒµœÅŒºŒ± as a collective substantive and applies to all believers (both Jews and Gentiles) as Paul has shown in verses Galatians 3:7-14."

3. "Christ mystical, the church, which is the body of Christ, of which he is the head, and is called by his name, ... designs all Abraham's spiritual seed, both Jews and Gentiles; who are all one in Christ, and so Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise."

2. "The promise was not made to several kinds of seed, but to one kind of seed, one posterity, one kind of sons."
