# Galatians 3:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The covenant, previously confirmed by God and concerning the blessing of all nations, is not nullified by the law given four hundred and thirty years later. Through Christ, the law does not invalidate the promise, but rather supports it. Even if the law introduced another way of obtaining the blessing, it would not supersede the covenant of grace and redemption established in Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "the covenant (better than a covenant, as most Commentators; even Meyer and De W.: the emphatic substantive is often anarthrous: cf. the different arrangement in Gal 3:15) which was previously ratified by God... the Law, which took place (was constituted) four hundred and thirty years after, does not abrogate, so as to do away the promise." 
2. "But in the LXX (and Samaritan Pentateuch) we read, Exodus 12:40, ἡ δὲ κατοίκησις (παροίκ., A.) τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ... ἔτη τετρακόσια τριάκοντα: and this reckoning St. Paul has followed."
3. "Thus it will appear that the LXX, Samaritan Pent., and St. Paul, have the right chronology, and as stated above, the difficulty lies in Gen 15:13 and Acts 7:6, and in the Hebrew text of Exodus 12:40."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The dispensation of 'the promise' began with the call of Abraham from Ur into Canaan, and ended on the last night of his grandson Jacob's sojourn in Canaan, the land of promise."
2. "It is from the end, not from the beginning of the dispensation of promise, that the interval of four hundred thirty years between it and the law is to be counted."
3. "The promise would become so, if the power of conferring the inheritance be transferred from it to the law."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The covenant which was confirmed before of God - By God, in his promise to Abraham. It was confirmed before the giving of the Law. The confirmation was the solemn promise which God made to him."
2. "In Christ - With respect to the Messiah; a covenant relating to him, and which promised that he should descend from Abraham."
3. "His argument was the same, whether the Law was given four hundred and thirty years after the promise, or only two hundred years. The argument is, that a law given after the solemn promise which had been made and confirmed, could not make that promise void."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Now I mean this. Not strictly the conclusion... It is rather the application, for which the way was prepared in verse 16, of the analogy of verse 15 to the inviolable stability of God's covenant."
2. "The greatness of the interval increases the authority of the promise."
3. "To make of none effect."
- Commentary on Galatians 3:17

### John Calvin:
1. "The ceremonies themselves are not so much considered by him as something higher, — the effect of justification which was attributed to them by false apostles, and the obligation on the conscience."
2. "If the point in dispute had no connection with obtaining righteousness, with the merit of works, or with ensnaring the conscience, ceremonies would be quite consistent with the promise."
3. "Paul took into account what was certainly true, that, except by a covenant with God, no reward is due to works. Admitting, then, that the law justifies, yet before the law men could not merit salvation by works, because there was no covenant."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is impossible that the law should cancel the promise which was given repeatedly at least four hundred and thirty years earlier to the patriarchs, and which looked from the beginning to Christ as the proper end, so that the law is only an intervening link between the promise and its fulfilment."
2. "The law which came (so long a time as) four hundred and thirty years after (the promise)."
3. "Paul means to say, the older an agreement the stronger is its authority. The Hebrew text would strengthen the argument."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Now I mean this. He comes back to his main point and is not carried afield by the special application of σπερμα to Christ."
2. "The point is in προ and υπο του θεου (by God) and in μετα (after) as Burton shows."
3. "It is immaterial to Paul's argument which chronology is adopted except that 'the longer the covenant had been in force the more impressive is his statement' (Burton)."

### John Gill:
1. "the covenant that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul"
2. "a covenant confirmed of God in Christ"; a covenant in which Christ is concerned; a covenant made with him, of which he is the sum and substance, the Mediator, surety, and messenger; and such is what the Scriptures call the covenant of life and peace, and what we commonly style the covenant of grace and redemption; because the articles of redemption and reconciliation, of eternal life and salvation, by the free grace of God, are the principal things in it.
3. "the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after this covenant; nor the covenant of circumcision given to Abraham, for that was not so long by some years, before the giving of the law, as the date here fixed"

### John Wesley:
1. "The covenant which was before confirmed of God...concerning the blessing all nations." 
2. "Through Christ, the law...Doth not disannul, so as to make the promise of no effect." 
3. "Yea, with regard to them also, if it was by works, so as to supersede it, and introduce another way of obtaining the blessing."
