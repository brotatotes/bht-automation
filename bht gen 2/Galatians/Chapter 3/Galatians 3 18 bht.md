# Galatians 3:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The inheritance, referring to eternal life and happiness in heaven, is not obtained through the works of the law, but rather through the free grace of God and faith in the righteousness of Christ. It is by promise that men become heirs and receive the hope of eternal life, and not by the law, for they are contradictory to each other. So, if the eternal inheritance were to be gained through the law, it would no longer be in accordance with the promise. Instead, it is the promise that holds true.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Judaisers insisted on addition; since, while they preached faith in the promise and in its fulfillment in Christ, they made the inheritance of the promise dependent upon the fulfilling of the law."
2. "Paul, on the other hand, holds that the Judaistic addition involves invalidation. Salvation must rest either upon the promise or upon the law."
3. "For God gave the inheritance to Abraham by promise. It has been shown that the law did not abrogate the promise. Hence, if the inheritance be of the law it is no more of the promise."

### John Calvin:
1. "To deprive them of every kind of subterfuge, he comes forward with the assertion, that salvation by the law, and salvation by the promise of God, are wholly inconsistent with each other."
