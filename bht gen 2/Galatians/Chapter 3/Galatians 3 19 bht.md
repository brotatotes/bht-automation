# Galatians 3:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The law and the promise have distinct purposes. The law was added to reveal and restrain transgressions, while the promise was made for salvation. The law shows what sin is and stimulates the corrupt heart to disobey it. It served as a preparatory dispensation for the Jewish nation, leading up to the fulfillment of the promise in Christ. The law was part of a greater whole, not standing alone but pointing to the Messiah. It was given to Israel through the ministry of angels and acted as a temporary mediator until the advent of the great Mediator, Jesus Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The law, though misunderstood by the Judaizers as doing so, was really added for a different purpose, namely, 'because of (or as the Greek, 'for the sake of') the transgressions,' that is, to bring out into clearer view the transgressions of it."
2. "The law rather stimulates the corrupt heart to disobey it."
3. "The law was a preparatory dispensation for the Jewish nation, intervening between the promise and its fulfillment in Christ."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Law was not useless, but ... given by God for great and important purposes, and especially for purposes closely connected with the fulfillment of the promise made to Abraham and the work of the Mediator."
2. "The Law was given to show the true nature of transgressions, or to show what was sin."
3. "The whole arrangement of the Mosaic economy, including all his laws, was with reference to the Messiah. It was a part of a great and glorious whole. It was not an independent thing. It did not stand by itself. It was incomplete and in many respects unintelligible until he came."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "What is its meaning and object? A natural question of an objector, since, according to Paul's reasoning, salvation is of promise and not of law."
2. "Its office was, in revealing sin as positive transgression, to emphasize the objective, actual, contrary fact of righteousness according to the divine ideal, and to throw sin into contrast with that grand ideal."
3. "Paul, in the section 3 6 - 9, 7, aims to show that the law does not, as the Judaisers assume, stand in a relation to the divine plan of salvation as direct and positive as does the promise, and that it has not, like the promise and its fulfillment, an eternal significance."

### John Calvin:
1. "The law was published in order to make known transgressions, and in this way to compel men to acknowledge their guilt."
2. "The law was given in order to rouse men to the expectation of Christ."
3. "Since the beginning of the world, God has held no intercourse with men, but through the agency of his eternal Wisdom or Son."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The law was superadded because of the transgressions. It was not the original scheme, but a subsequent addition to the promise for an interimistic educational purpose to prepare the way for the fulfilment of the promise in Christ by the development of the disease of sin which is necessary to its cure."
2. "The law acting as a stimulant on the sinful desire, and calling it out into open exercise."
3. "Being ordained (or enacted) by angels (by the ministry of angels). According to Josephus and the Jewish tradition, the angels acted as the ministers and organs of God in the promulgation of the Mosaic law."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It may be causal (Luke 7:47; 1 John 3:12) or telic (Titus 1:5; Titus 1:11; Judges 1:16). It is probably also telic here, not in order to create transgressions, but rather 'to make transgressions palpable' (Ellicott), 'thereby pronouncing them to be from that time forward transgressions of the law' (Rendall)."
2. "Christ he means by œÑŒø œÉœÄŒµœÅŒºŒ± as in verse Galatians 3:16."
3. "About angels and the giving of the law see on Deuteronomy 33:2 (LXX); Acts 7:38; Acts 7:52; Hebrews 2:2; Josephus (Ant. XV. 5. 3)."

### John Gill:
1. "the law was given, to lay a restraint on men, by forbidding such and such things, on pain of death; and also for the detecting, discovering, and making known transgressions, what they are, their nature and consequences"
2. "the law was given for the punishing of transgressions, for which it curses, and threatens with death, and inflicts it on Christless sinners"
3. "the law was to continue in the form in which, and the use for which it was added, and then to cease as the ministration of Moses; for through the coming of Christ it received its full accomplishment, and came to an end"

### John Wesley:
1. "The moral law was added to the promise to discover and restrain transgressions, to convince men of their guilt, and need of the promise, and give some check to sin."
2. "And this law passeth not away; but the ceremonial law was only introduced till Christ, the seed to or through whom the promise was made, should come."
3. "And it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator - It was not given to Israel, like the promise to Abraham, immediately from God himself; but was conveyed by the ministry of angels to Moses, and delivered into his hand as a mediator between God and them, to remind them of the great Mediator."
