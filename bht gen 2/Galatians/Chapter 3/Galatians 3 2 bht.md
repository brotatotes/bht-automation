# Galatians 3:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul challenges the Galatians to consider how they received the Holy Spirit. He poses the question, did they receive the Spirit by observing the works of the law or by hearing and receiving faith? By asking this, Paul reminds them of their own experience when they first believed the gospel. It is through faith, not works, that they received the blessings of the Spirit. This question serves as a powerful argument against their current position and highlights the importance of faith in the Christian life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "not to mention all the other grounds on which I might rest my argument, ‘this only,’ &c." 
2. "Did ye from (as its ground, see ch. Gal 2:16) the works of the Law receive the Spirit or from the hearing of faith?"
3. "meaning either, ‘that preaching which proclaimed faith,’ or ‘that hearing, which received (the) faith.’ The first is preferable, because (1) where their first receiving the Gospel is in question, the preaching of it would probably be hinted at, as it is indeed taken up by the οὖν below, Galatians 3:5; (2) where the question is concerning the power of faith as contrasted with the works of the law, faith would most likely be subjective."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Was it by the works of the law that ye received the Spirit...or by the hearing of faith?" 
2. The "only" implies, "I desire, omitting other arguments, to rest the question on this alone".
3. Faith consists not in working, but in receiving.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Holy Spirit had been conferred on them at their conversion and this was to them proof of the favor of God, and of their being accepted by him."
2. "The doctrine taught in this verse is, that the benefits resulting to Christians from the gift of the Holy Spirit are enough to prove that the gospel is from God, and therefore true."
3. "Every Christian has had ample proof, from the influences of the Spirit on his heart and around him, that the system which is attended with such benefits is from heaven."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Do you owe the gifts of the Spirit to the works of the law, or to the message of faith?"
2. "You cannot deny that you received the gifts of the Spirit by the message of faith."
3. "For hearing, render message."

### John Calvin:
1. "He reminds them in what manner the gospel was introduced among themselves. When they heard the gospel, they received the Spirit."
2. "There was therefore manifest ingratitude in not submitting to the doctrine, by means of which they had received the Holy Spirit."
3. "Faith is here put, by a figure of speech, for the gospel, which exhibits to us the free grace of God in Christ, without any merit of works."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Paul appeals to their own experience at their conversion, which alone should be sufficient to convince them of the error of their present position."
2. "Was it by works of the law that ye received the Spirit, the Holy Spirit, the greatest of gifts. He is communicated to believers through the gospel, regenerates and sanctifies and makes them children of God and heirs of eternal life."
3. "From the preaching of faith...faith is mostly used in the subjective sense of the act and exercise of faith, not in the objective sense of doctrine of faith or creed. Faith is the organ by which we receive the Holy Spirit through the preaching of the gospel."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul strikes at the heart of the problem."
2. "He will show their error by the point that the gifts of the Spirit came by the hearing of faith, not by works of the law."

### John Gill:
1. "Though there were many things he could have put to them, yet he would only ask this one question, which, if rightly attended to, and honestly answered, must expose their folly, and put an end to the controversy upon this head."
2. "Now the apostle asks, whether they received this Spirit 'by the works of the law'; meaning, either whether they could imagine, that they by their obedience to the law had merited and procured the Spirit of God; or whether they thought that the Spirit came to them, and into their hearts, through the doctrine or preaching of the law."
3. "Now in this way the Spirit of God is received; while the Gospel is preaching he falls on them that hear it, conveys himself into their hearts, and begets them again by the word of truth."

### John Wesley:
1. "This only would I learn of you — That is, this one argument might convince you."
2. "Did ye receive the witness and the fruit of the Spirit by performing the works of the law, or by hearing of and receiving faith?"
