# Galatians 3:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, the concept of a mediator is explored. The idea is that a mediator is necessary when there are two parties in need of reconciliation or communication. However, it is emphasized that God is one and does not require a mediator. The distinction is made between the law, which involves a contractual agreement and the need for a mediator like Moses, and the promise made to Abraham, which is a direct undertaking by God. This highlights the uniqueness of God's role as the One who is able to fulfill His promises without the need for an intermediary.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Clearly, ·ΩÅ ŒºŒµœÉŒØœÑŒ∑œÇ and ·ΩÅ Œ∏ŒµœåœÇ are opposed. As clearly, ·ºëŒΩ·Ω∏œÇ Œø·ΩêŒ∫ ·ºîœÉœÑŒπŒΩ and Œµ·º∑œÇ ·ºêœÉœÑŒπŒΩ are opposed."
2. "·ΩÅ ŒºŒµœÉŒØœÑŒ∑œÇ belongs not to one, but ·ΩÅ Œ∏ŒµœåœÇ is one."
3. "The proposition ·ΩÅ Œ∏Œµ·Ω∏œÇ Œµ·º∑œÇ ·ºêœÉœÑŒπŒΩ would carry to the mind of every reader much more than the mere numerical unity of God viz. His Unity as an essential attribute, extending through the whole divine Character."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "God is one" (not two: owing to His essential unity not admitting of an intervening party between Him and those to be blessed).
2. "The law, with its inseparable appendage of a mediator, cannot be the normal way of dealing of God... God would bring man into immediate communion with Him, and not have man separated from Him by a mediator that keeps back from access."
3. "Even His mediatorial office is to cease when its purpose of reconciling all things to God shall have been accomplished... and God's ONENESS, as 'all in all,' shall be fully manifested."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The very idea of a mediator supposes that there are two parties or persons between whom the mediator comes either to reconcile them or to bear some message from the one to the other."
2. "All that I can claim for it is, that it may possibly be the meaning. According to the view which I shall submit, the words here are to be regarded as used in their usual signification; and the simplest interpretation possible is to be given to the propositions in the verse."
3. "A mediator always supposes two parties. In all the transactions, therefore, where a mediator is employed, there is supposed to be two parties. When, therefore, the promise was made to Abraham with reference to the Messiah, the great Mediator; and when the Law was given in the hand of the Mediator, and under his control, there is always supposed to be two parties."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The very idea of mediation supposes two parties."
2. "The law is of the nature of a contract between God and the Jewish people."
3. "His promise depends on his own individual decree."

### John Calvin:
1. "There may, perhaps, be an Anticipation (œÄœÅ·ΩπŒªŒ∑œàŒπœÇ) of some wicked thought that might arise about a change of the divine purpose."
2. "Christ is not the Mediator of one, because, in respect of outward character, there is a diversity of condition among those with whom, through his mediation, God enters into covenant."
3. "God is one, because he always continues to be like himself, and, with unvarying regularity, holds fixed and unalterable the purpose which he has once made."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Now a mediator (every mediator, including Moses) is not of one, but God is one."
2. "The law is a covenant between two parties and is conditioned by the obedience of the people; but the promise is the free gift of God alone."
3. "The promise could not be made void by the law, in this sense: ‚ÄòThe God who gave both the promise and the law is one and the same, consistent in all his dealings, and cannot contradict himself, therefore the law cannot set aside the promise.‚Äô"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The law is in the nature of a contract between God and the Jewish people with Moses as the mediator or middleman."
2. "There was no middleman between God and Abraham. He made the promise directly to Abraham."
3. "Over 400 interpretations of this verse have been made!"

### John Gill:
1. "A mediator supposes two parties he stands between, and these at a distance from, or disagreeing with each other."
2. "Christ is the Mediator between God and men, the daysman, Job 9:33, that lays his hands upon them both."
3. "God is one; not in person, for there are three persons in the Godhead, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and these three are one, in nature and essence."

### John Wesley:
1. "There must be two parties, or there can be no mediator between them."
2. "The law, wherein he was concerned, was a transaction of quite another nature."
