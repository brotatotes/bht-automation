# Galatians 3:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The law and promises are not in conflict or contradiction. The law has its purpose, but it cannot give life or righteousness as the promise does. The law demands obedience but does not provide the ability to fulfill it. If the law could grant life, then there would be righteousness through it, but it cannot. Therefore, righteousness and salvation come through the promise and its fulfillment in the Gospel of grace.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The promises which rest immediately on God, and were attested by no mediator."
2. "If that which should have power to give life had been given in the form of law."
3. "In very truth, and not only in the fancy of some, by the law would have been righteousness."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The law, as an externally prescribed rule, can never internally impart spiritual life to men naturally dead in sin, and change the disposition."
2. "If the law had been a law capable of giving life, 'verily... righteousness would have been by the law (for where life is, there righteousness, its condition, must also be).'"
3. "But the law does not pretend to give life, and therefore not righteousness; so there is no opposition between the law and the promise. Righteousness can only come through the promise to Abraham, and through its fulfilment in the Gospel of grace."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The object of the apostle in asking this question is, evidently, to take an opportunity to deny in the most positive manner that there can be any such clashing or contradiction."
2. "It is as reasonable, and equal, and pure. Its demands are as just, and its terms as favorable as could be any of the terms of mere law."
3. "The fact, therefore, that no one can be justified by the pure law revealed on Mount Sinai, forever settles the question about the possibility of being justified by law."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Does it follow from the difference between the law and the promises that they are in antagonism? Paul supposes this objection on the part of a Jewish Christian." 
2. "If the law is against the promises, and makes them invalid, it follows that life must come through the law, and therefore righteousness, without which there is no life, would verily, just as the Judaisers claim, be through the law."
3. "The meaning is substantially the same with either reading: in the one case proceeding from, in the other residing in the law."

### John Calvin:
1. "Who will now dare to imagine a disagreement between the law and the promises?"
2. "But Paul refuses to the law such a power; so that the contradiction is removed."
3. "I would admit, says he, that righteousness is obtained by the law, if salvation were found in it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If the law had the power to break sin and to impart righteousness and life, it would indeed be a rival of the promise and enter into conflict with it."
2. "On the contrary, it is intended merely to bring sin to its proper crisis and thereby to prepare the fulfillment of the promise."
3. "Paul maintains, in opposition to the vain conceit of the self-righteous Jews and Judaizing Christians, that the law condemns all alike."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Far from it (μη γενοιτο)."
2. "Which could make alive (ο δυναμενος ζωοποιησα)."
3. "Verily (οντως). 'Really' (cf. Mark 11:32; Luke 24:34)."

### John Gill:
1. "The law has its use, and so have the promises; the promises do not set aside the law as useless on all accounts, nor does the law disannul the promises, but is subservient to them."
2. "The law requires as much of a dead sinner, as it did of Adam in innocence, but gives him no life, activity, and strength to perform; could it quicken him, and enable him to do all its demands perfectly, then there would be righteousness, and so justification by it, as by the promise."
3. "The reason why there is no righteousness is, because it [the law] cannot give life, spiritual life and strength; and if so, then not eternal life; which is the free gift of God, and not the merit of men's works."

### John Wesley:
1. "Will it follow from hence that the law is against, opposite to, the promises of God? By no means. They are well consistent."
2. "But yet the law cannot give life, as the promise doth."
3. "If there had been a law which could have given life — which could have entitled a sinner to life, God would have spared his own Son, and righteousness, or justification, with all the blessings consequent upon it, would have been by that law."
