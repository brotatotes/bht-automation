# Galatians 3:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Scripture, which includes the law and represents God, has clearly shown that all people, regardless of their background or actions, are under the power and guilt of sin. It's like being trapped in a prison with no way to escape through our own efforts. However, this was done to make it clear that no one can be justified by the law but rather by faith in Jesus Christ. The promise of righteousness and life is freely given to those who believe, not to those who try to earn it through works.
