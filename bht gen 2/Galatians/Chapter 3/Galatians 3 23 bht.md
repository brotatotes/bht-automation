# Galatians 3:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We were held prisoner, confined and restricted by the law, awaiting the arrival of faith in Jesus Christ. The law acted as a jailer, keeping us in ward until the time when faith would be revealed. This faith, the Christian religion, was not yet fully known, but it was the hope that would set us free from the confinement of the law. Through the coming of Jesus Christ, faith would be made complete, bringing liberation and salvation to all who believe.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The office of the law as a jailer was designed to be only temporary, until the time when faith should come."
2. "We were kept in ward, continuing the figure in shut up, under the law. We were shut up with the law as a warder, not for protection, but to guard against escape."
3. "The law is conceived, not as the prison, but as the warder, the Lord or despot, the power of sin, by whom those who belong to sin are kept under lock and key - under moral captivity, without possibility of liberation except through faith."

### John Calvin:

2. "We were shut up and kept in ward under the law for the faith about to be revealed, i.e., in order to be prepared for the free state of the Christian faith."
3. "The word 'faith' usually means the subjective state of the heart, the exercise of trust; but in Galatians 3:22-23 it seems to pass over into the objective sense, i.e., the dispensation of faith, the gospel, hence the verbs came and to be revealed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Before the coming (second aorist active infinitive of ερχομα, definite event) as to the Faith" (note article, meaning the faith in verse Galatians 3:22 made possible by the historic coming of Christ the Redeemer), the faith in Christ as Saviour (verse Galatians 3:22).
2. We were kept in ward under the law (υπερ νομον εφρουρουμεθα). Imperfect passive of φρουρεω, to guard (from φρουρος, a guard). It was a long progressive imprisonment.

### John Gill:
1. "It is best to interpret it of Christ, the object of faith, who was to come, and is come in the flesh, to fulfil the law; and, by so doing, has put an end to it; and to redeem his people from under it, and to save them with an everlasting salvation."
2. "The law kept them close to the discharge of their duty, and held them fast as prisoners."
3. "The law considered and used them as sinners, as criminals convicted and condemned; it did itself accuse, convict, and pronounce them guilty, and condemned them to punishment; and detained them as prisoners in its dark dungeon, where they had little light and comfort; and were as in a pit, wherein is no water."

### John Wesley:
1. "Before faith came, we were kept as in close custody under the law."
