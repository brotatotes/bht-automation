# Galatians 3:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The law acted as our tutor, guiding and instructing us until the coming of Christ. It played a crucial role in teaching us about righteousness, sin, and the need for a Savior. The law's commands revealed our inability to fulfill it perfectly, while its ceremonies pointed us towards the ultimate redemption found in Christ. By fulfilling its purpose, the law prepared us to embrace the promises and salvation offered through Jesus.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "the Law has become (has turned out to be) our tutor (pedagogue, see below) unto (ethically; for) Christ"
2. "now that the faith (see above) has come, we are no longer under a tutor (pedagogue)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "So that the law hath been (that is, hath turned out to be) our schoolmaster (or "tutor," literally, "pedagogue": this term, among the Greeks, meant a faithful servant entrusted with the care of the boy from childhood to puberty, to keep him from evil, physical and moral, and accompany him to his amusements and studies) to guide us unto Christ."
2. "The moral law shows us what we ought to do, and so we learn our inability to do it."
3. "Thus the law at last leads us to Christ, with whom we find righteousness and peace."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The ways in which the Law does this may be the following: (1) It restrains us and rebukes us, and keeps us as the ancient pedagogue did his boys."
2. "The moral law - the Law of God - shows people their sin and danger, and thus leads them to the Saviour. It condemns them, and thus prepares them to welcome the offer of pardon through a Redeemer."
3. "The importance of preaching the Law still; and hence, it is needful that people should be made to feel that they are sinners, in order that they may be prepared to embrace the offers of mercy."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Theological consequence of the previous statements."
2. "The way of the law was not, as the Jews supposed, a direct way to the fulfillment of the divine promise."
3. "The law is neither absolutely identical with the promise, nor absolutely opposed to it. It is not the negation of the promise, but is distinct from it and subordinate to it."

### John Calvin:
1. "The law, by displaying the justice of God, convinced them that in themselves they were unrighteous; for in the commandments of God, as in a mirror, they might see how far they were distant from true righteousness."
2. "The promises of the law served the same purpose, and might lead to such reflections as these: 'If you cannot obtain life by works but by fulfilling the law, some new and different method must be sought.'"
3. "The law, in short, was nothing else than an immense variety of exercises, in which the worshippers were led by the hand to Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This sentence expresses in a few words the true philosophy of the law in its relation to Christ." 
2. "The discipline of law and authority is still the school of moral freedom, and reaches its proper end in self-government which is true freedom."
3. "On the contrary the whole work of preparatory training belongs to the pædagogue, and Christ represents here the result of the educational process, i.e., the state of evangelical freedom and independent, self-governing manhood."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Christ is our Schoolmaster and the law as paedagogue kept watch over us till we came to Christ."
2. "That we might be justified by faith. This is the ultimate purpose of the law as paedagogue."
3. "The pedagogue is dismissed. We are in the school of the Master."

### John Gill:
1. "The law performed this office of a schoolmaster until the coming of Christ; which shows that till that time the church was in its minority, that the Jews were but children in knowledge and understanding."
2. "They were taught by the moral law, the letter, the writing on the two tables... what is righteousness and what is not, the nature of sin, its demerit and consequences; but these gave them no instructions about a Saviour, and life and righteousness by him."
3. "The law being called a schoolmaster, shows that the use of it was but temporary, and its duration but for a time; children are not always to be under, nor designed to be always under a schoolmaster, no longer than till they are come to a proper age for greater business and higher exercises of life."

### John Wesley:
1. "The law was our schoolmaster unto Christ."
2. "It was designed to train us up for Christ."
3. "And this it did both by its commands, which showed the need we had of his atonement; and its ceremonies, which all pointed us to him."
