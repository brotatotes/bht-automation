# Galatians 3:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the gospel dispensation, the law, represented by Moses, has fulfilled its purpose and is no longer necessary for those who have faith in Christ. The law has led us to Christ and now He is our teacher, priest, and king. We are no longer under the bondage and instruction of the law, but are free to live according to the teachings of the gospel.
