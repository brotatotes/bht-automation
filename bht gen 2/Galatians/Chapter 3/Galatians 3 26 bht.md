# Galatians 3:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The believers, whether Jews or Gentiles, are now considered as adult sons of God, mature in their faith and no longer in need of a tutor or guardian to instruct and guide them. The concept of being sons emphasizes their freedom and privilege in Christ, as they have been adopted into God's family by His grace through faith. They are no longer under the law but are led and taught by the Holy Spirit, enjoying the freedom that comes from being children of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For ye all (Jews and Gentiles alike) are SONS (no longer παῖδες, requiring a παιδαγωγός) of God by means of the (or, but not so well, your) faith in Christ Jesus."
2. "The omission of τῆς before ἐν will stagger no one: see Colossians 1:4, where the same expression occurs."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 26. children—Greek,
	"sons." 
	by—Greek,
	"through faith." "Ye all" (Jews and
	Gentiles alike) are no longer "children" requiring a tutor,
	but SONS emancipated and
	walking at liberty.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The idea here is, that they are no longer under tutors and governors; they are no longer subject to the direction and will of the 'paedagogus'; they are arrived at age, and are admitted to the privileges of sons."
2. "The language here is derived from the fact, that until the son arrived at age, he was in many respects not different from a servant. He was under laws and restraints; and subject to the will of another."
3. "Under the gospel, they are free, and admitted to the privileges of the sons of God."

### John Calvin:
1. "For ye are all the children of God." It would be unjust, and in the highest degree unreasonable, that the law should hold believers in perpetual slavery.
2. The fact of their being the children of God proves their freedom. How? By faith in Christ Jesus; for "as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name."(John 1:12.)
3. Since, then, by faith we have obtained adoption, by faith likewise we have obtained our freedom.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "‘Sons’ (not ‘children,’ E. V.), implies here the idea of age and freedom, as distinct from the state of childhood and pupilage under the training of the pædagogue."
2. "Paul uses the term ‘sons’ and ‘children’ of God mostly in opposition to slaves."
3. "By the faith, which is the act of a freeman, in Christ Jesus (the dative in Greek)  i.e., reposing in Christ, or (if we prefer connecting the words with ‘sons’  ) by virtue of your life-union with Christ, being grounded and rooted in Him."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "There is no other way to become 'sons of God' in the full ethical and spiritual sense that Paul means, not mere physical descendants of Abraham, but 'sons of Abraham,' 'those by faith'." 
2. "God is the Father of all men as Creator, but the spiritual Father only of those who by faith in Christ Jesus receive 'adoption' into his family." 
3. "Those led by the Spirit are sons of God."

### John Gill:
1. "Not by nature, as Christ is the Son of God, for he is the only begotten of the Father... but by divine adoption by an act of God's rich and sovereign grace."
2. "They were such not by the law, as none indeed are, but by faith in Christ Jesus; not that faith makes any the children of God, or puts them into such a relation; no, that is God's own act and deed; of his free rich grace and goodness."
3. "Since they are sons and not servants, and so free from the bondage of the law; they are sons grown up into the faith of Christ, and are led and taught by the Spirit of God, as they are that are the children of God by faith."

### John Wesley:
1. For ye — Christians. Are all adult sons of God - And so need a schoolmaster no longer.
