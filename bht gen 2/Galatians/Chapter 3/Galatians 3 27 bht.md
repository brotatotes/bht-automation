# Galatians 3:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In baptism, believers are united with Christ and receive his righteousness as their own, becoming sons of God through him. By being baptized into Christ, the Galatian churches testified their faith and publicly identified with him. This act of baptism goes beyond a mere outward sign, as it signifies a participation in the blessings of grace that come through Christ. Just as a garment covers and identifies a person, believers have put on Christ and his righteousness, becoming partakers in all that he is and represents.
