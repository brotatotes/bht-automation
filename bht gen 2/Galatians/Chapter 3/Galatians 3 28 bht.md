# Galatians 3:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the context of this passage, it is evident that all individuals are considered equal in the realm of faith. Regardless of their cultural or social background, everyone is saved by the merits of the same Savior and granted the same privileges as children of God. Christianity recognizes the inherent equality of all people, eradicating distinctions based on nationality or gender. This concept of unity in Christ breaks down the barriers that once separated individuals, allowing them to be seen as one cohesive entity. Therefore, in the context of Christian faith, differences in earthly extraction or position hold no significance.

1. "The meaning is, that there is no difference between them, the middle wall of partition being broken down, and that, in the business of justification and salvation, it signified nothing whether a man was a Jew or a Greek; he was never the better for being a circumcised Jew, nor never the worse for being an uncircumcised Gentile."
2. "There is neither bond nor free...the Gospel makes no such distinction of men in its doctrine, worship, and ordinances, which lie open to all ranks and orders of men."
3. "Under the Gospel dispensation there is no distinction made between male and female as to divine things; as they are alike called by the grace of God, they have the same right to Gospel ordinances, baptism and the Lord's supper, and to every spiritual privilege."
