# Galatians 3:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
All those who belong to Christ, who have put their faith in Him, are considered true children of Abraham and heirs according to the promise. It is not about physical lineage or outward appearances, but about the inward transformation and union with Christ. Through faith in Him, we are united with Christ, and it is in Him that we find our true identity and inheritance. Therefore, let us not boast in our earthly heritage, but rather in our spiritual union with Christ and the blessings that come with being part of His family.
