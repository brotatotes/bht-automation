# Galatians 3:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Are ye so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, can it be that you are now ending in the flesh? This ironic statement highlights the inconsistency in the Galatians' actions. They had initially embraced the spiritual aspect of their Christian life, relying on the Holy Spirit and the power of faith. However, they were now seeking to attain perfection through the mere observance of outward rituals and adherence to the law. This shift from the Spirit to the flesh is both foolish and contrary to the essence of the gospel, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a pure faith in Christ.

2. "Having begun your Christianity in the Spirit, that is, in the divine life that proceeds from faith, are ye seeking after something higher still (the perfecting of your Christianity) in the sensuous and the earthly, which cannot possibly elevate the inner life of the Spirit, namely, outward ceremonies?" 
3. "No doubt the Galatians thought that they were going more deeply into the Spirit; for the flesh may be easily mistaken for the Spirit, even by those who have made progress, unless they continue to maintain a pure faith."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Can it be that you are so unwise?... Paul hardly thought it credible that they could have pursued such a course."

3. "Many have been professedly converted by the Spirit, and have soon fallen into the observance of mere rites and ceremonies, and depended mainly on them for salvation."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "So foolish. Explained by what follows. Has your folly reached such a pitch as to reverse the true order of things?" 
2. "Having begun your Christian life. The verb is common in Class. in the sense of the beginning a sacrifice or other religious ceremony; but it is not likely that any such figurative suggestion is attached to it here." 
3. "Rend.: having begun in the spirit are ye coming to completion in the flesh? The last phrase has an ironical tinge, suggesting the absurdity of expecting perfection on the Jewish basis of legal righteousness."

### John Calvin:
1. "As if he had said, 'As the doctrine of the gospel brought to you the Holy Spirit, the commencement of your course was spiritual; but now ye have fallen into a worse condition, and may be said to have fallen from the Spirit into the flesh.'"
2. "The flesh denotes either outward and fading flyings, such as ceremonies are, particularly when they are separated from Christ; or it denotes dead and fading doctrine."
3. "There was a strange inconsistency between their splendid commencement and their future progress."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Having begun in the Spirit, are ye now ending (or finishing) in the flesh?" A fine irony.
2. The middle voice of the Greek verb (·ºêœÄŒπœÑŒµŒªŒµ·øëœÉŒ∏Œµ) is preferable to the passive on account of the correspondence with 'begun,' and on account of the parallel passages.
3. 'Spirit' and 'flesh' represent here the spiritual religion which makes man free, and the carnal religion which makes him a slave to outward forms and observances.

3. "There is a double contrast, between ŒµŒΩŒ±œÅŒæŒ±ŒºŒµŒΩŒø (having begun) and ŒµœÄŒπœÑŒµŒªŒµŒπœÉŒ∏Œµ (finishing) as in 2 Corinthians 8:6; Philippians 1:6, and also between 'Spirit' (œÄŒΩŒµœÖŒºŒ±œÑ) and flesh (œÉŒ±œÅŒ∫)."
4. "There is keen irony in this thrust."
