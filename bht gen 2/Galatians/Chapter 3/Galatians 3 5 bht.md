# Galatians 3:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle challenges the idea that the gifts of the Holy Spirit and the miracles among them are obtained through obedience to the works of the law. Instead, these blessings are received through the preaching of the gospel, either from God or Christ Himself. The contrast between the works of the law and the hearing of faith is evident, as the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit are not associated with following the law or the false apostles' teaching of justification by works. Rather, they are connected to the doctrine of faith and justification through faith in Christ's righteousness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It seems to me, that this question must be settled by first determining who is the agent here spoken of. Is it the Apostle? or is it not rather GOD, and is not this indicated by the reference to Abraham‚Äôs faith in the next verse, and the taking up the passive ·ºêŒªŒøŒ≥ŒØœÉŒ∏Œ∑ by Œ¥ŒπŒ∫Œ±ŒπŒø·øñ  ·ΩÅ Œ∏ŒµœåœÇ in Gal 3:8 ?" 
2. "The ·ºêœÄŒØ does not imply  addition , but as so often with prepositions of motion in composition, the  direction of the supply."
3. "The wonders wrought by divine Power  in you..."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He who supplied and supplies to you the Spirit still, to the present time."
2. "These miracles do not prove grace to be in the heart."
3. "This cannot be because the law was then unknown to you when you received those gifts of the Spirit."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The gift of the Holy Spirit to them was not imparted in consequence of the observance of the Law of Moses, but in connection with the preaching of the gospel."
2. "The obvious reference, it seems to me, is to God, who had furnished or imparted to them the remarkable influences of the Holy Spirit, and this had been done in connection with the preaching of the gospel, and not by the observance of the Law."
3. "If, however, it refers to Paul, it means that he had been made the agent or instrument in imparting to them those remarkable endowments, and that this had been done by one who had not enforced the necessity of obeying the Law of Moses, but who had preached to them the simple gospel."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The gift of the Spirit, and the bestowment of miraculous powers, is a purely divine operation in believers, which is not merited by legal works, but can be received and experienced only through the message of faith."
2. "He that ministereth is God."
3. "Miracles [Œ¥œÖŒΩŒ±ŒºŒµŒπœÇ] . See on Matthew 11:20. Either miracles, as Mark 6:2; 1 Corinthians 12:10, or miraculous powers, as 1 Corinthians 12:6; Philippians 2:13; Ephesians 2:2. The analogy of these latter passages favors the second meaning."

### John Calvin:
1. "He warns them that all the gifts of the Holy Spirit, in which they excelled, are the fruits of the gospel." 
2. "Their new teachers deprived them of those gifts when they left the gospel, and fled to another kind of doctrine."
3. "In proportion to the value which they attached to those gifts, to which the apostle here adds miracles, they ought the more carefully and resolutely to adhere to the gospel."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The present tense ministereth and worketh is used to indicate the continued communication and abundant supply of the spiritual gifts."
2. "Powers, miraculous powers, 1 Corinthians 12:10; 1 Corinthians 12:28-29."
3. "In you, i.e., in your heart and will; comp. Matthew 14:2. Paul probably means the moral miracles of regeneration and conversion. Others understand here physical miracles wrought ‚Äòamong you,‚Äô i.e., in the midst of you."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Supplieth (ŒµœÄŒπœáŒøœÅŒ∑Œ≥œâŒΩ). It is God." 
2. "Worketh miracles (ŒµŒΩŒµœÅŒ≥œâŒΩ Œ¥œÖŒΩŒ±ŒºŒµŒπœÇ). On the word ŒµŒΩŒµœÅŒ≥Œµœâ see 1 Thessalonians 2:13; 1 Corinthians 12:6. It is a great word for God's activities (Philippians 2:13)." 
3. "The principal verb for 'doeth he it' (œÄŒøŒπŒµ) is not expressed. Paul repeats the contrast in verse Galatians 3:2 about 'works of the law' and 'the hearing of faith.'"

### John Gill:
1. "He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit...either God or Christ who had ministered, and still continued to minister the grace of the Spirit through the preaching of the Gospel..."
2. "...the members of this church...had seen the Gospel confirmed by the extraordinary gifts, signs, and wonders of the Holy Ghost, and which were still among them..."
3. "...the apostle's meaning is, that these extraordinary gifts of the Spirit...did not attend the preaching of the law, or the doctrine of justification by works, taught by the false apostles, but the doctrine of faith, of justification by faith in the righteousness of Christ..."

### John Wesley:
1. "And, at the present time, Doth he that ministereth the gift of the Spirit to you, and worketh miracles among you, do it by the works of the law?"
2. "That is, in confirmation of his preaching justification by works, or of his preaching justification by faith?"
