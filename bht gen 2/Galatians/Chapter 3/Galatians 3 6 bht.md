# Galatians 3:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Abraham serves as a powerful example of justification by faith and not by works or circumcision. His faith in God's promise was accounted to him as righteousness. Both Paul and James reference Abraham's story to support different aspects of faith, but they both affirm the importance of faith in our relationship with God. This example challenges the notion that justification comes through the law or through human efforts, highlighting that it is by faith in God's grace that we are justified.
