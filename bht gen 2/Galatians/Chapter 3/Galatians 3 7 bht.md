# Galatians 3:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Know that only those who believe, who have faith like Abraham, are truly his descendants and inherit the blessings promised to him. This knowledge should be familiar to you, as it is a clear and indisputable truth. It is not those who rely on their own works or the law, but those who have faith in God's promises who are considered the true sons of Abraham.

3. "These, and these only, not οἱ ἐξ ἔργων."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Know ye. Imperative. It may also be rendered as indicative, ye know, but the imperative is livelier, and the statement in the verse is one of the points which the writer is trying to prove."
2. "They which are of faith. Ek pistewv from or out of faith, is found with the verb to justify: with other verbs, as live; eat: with the noun dikaiosunh righteousness: with other nouns, as promise, law. It denotes believers as sprung from, or receiving their spiritual condition from that which specially characterizes them."

2. "To be of faith, therefore, is to rest their righteousness and hope of salvation on the mercy of God."

2. "His spiritual seed, though they may not be his natural offspring."
