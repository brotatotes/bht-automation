# Galatians 3:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
All those who have faith, like Abraham, are the ones who are truly blessed. It is not about following the works of the law or relying on one's own merits, but it is faith alone that brings about this blessing. This blessing does not come to just anyone, but to those who believe and have faith in God, just as Abraham did. The true blessing lies in the faith that connects believers with Abraham and allows them to share in the same promises and inheritance of eternal life.
