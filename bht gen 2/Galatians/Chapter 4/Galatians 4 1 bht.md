# Galatians 4:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The analogy used in this passage helps us understand the distinction between the old and new covenants. Comparing an heir who is still a child to those under the law, we see that as long as the heir is young, he is no different from a servant, lacking control over his inheritance. This clarifies that the Jews, under the law, were also restricted and unable to fully access the privileges of being heirs. This highlights the vast difference between the limitations of the old covenant and the freedom and abundance of blessings found in the new covenant. (75 words)

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The fact is, the antitype breaks through the type, and disturbs it: as is the case, wherever the idea of inheritance is spiritualized."
2. "In the type, the reason might be absence, or decease, or even high office or intense occupation, of the father: in the antitype, it is the Father‚Äôs sovereign will: but the circumstances equally exist."
3. "Œ∫œçœÅŒπŒøœÇ œÄŒ¨ŒΩœÑœâŒΩ ·Ω§ŒΩ must be understood essentially, rather than prospectively. It is said of him in virtue of his rank, rather than of his actual estate: in posse, rather than in esse."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The fact of God's sending His Son to redeem us who were under the law, and sending the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, confirms the conclusion that we are 'heirs according to the promise.'"
2. "It is not, as in earthly inheritances, the death of the father, but our Father's sovereign will simply that makes us heirs."
3. "He is not at his own disposal. Lord of all‚Äîby title and virtual ownership."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "As long as he is a child - Until he arrives at the age... he has no more control of his property; he has it not at his command."
2. "He differs in his prospects of inheriting the property, and in the affections of the father... but in regard to property, he does not differ, and he is like a servant, under the control and direction of others."
3. "The condition of the Jews before the coming of the Messiah was inferior in many respects to what the condition of the friends of God would be under him - as inferior as the condition of an heir was before he was of age, to what it would be when he should enter on his inheritance."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The article is generic as in the mediator."
2. "A child. A minor." 
3. "The Jews called proselytes or novices babes."

### John Calvin:
1. "The elect, though they are the children of God from the womb, yet, until by faith they come to the possession of freedom, remain like slaves under the law; but, from the time that they have known Christ, they no longer require this kind of tutelage."
2. "The difference between us and the ancient fathers lies in accidents, not in substance. In all the leading characters of the Testament or Covenant we agree: the ceremonies and form of government, in which we differ, are mere additions."
3. "From this passage it appears that [ceremonies] are false disguises, by which the true beauty of the church is impaired."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To long as the heir is an infant (a minor), he differeth nothing from a slave, though he is lord of all, owner of the whole patrimony or inheritance by right and prospectively, but not in actual possession."
2. "In human relations the taking possession of the inheritance is conditioned by the death of the parent, or at all events by a corresponding loss; while God gives to his children at the appointed time all the blessings of salvation without losing anything, since He is the living fountain and preserver of all."
3. "But in both cases the majority of the heir is presupposed. The heir in his nonage represents the Jewish people and the state of the world before Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For how long a time" (ŒµœÜ' ŒøœÉŒøŒΩ œáœÅŒøŒΩŒøŒΩ).
2. "The heir" (Œø Œ∫ŒªŒ∑œÅŒøŒΩŒøŒºŒøœÇ). 
3. "A child" (ŒΩŒ∑œÄŒπŒøœÇ).

### John Gill:
1. "To illustrate what he had said of the law's being a schoolmaster to the Jews until the coming of Christ, and then ceasing as such, he proposes the case of an heir during his minority, till he come to the proper time of enjoying his estate."
2. "He is not his own man, nor at his own dispose; he cannot do as he pleases; he is under restraint; he is kept to school or to business, and is liable to correction and chastisement according as he behaves."
3. "Nor can he have the free use of his father's estate, though he be Lord of all; he is right heir to it, though as yet it is not in his hands, nor can he do with it as he will." (115 words)

### John Wesley:
1. "To illustrate by a plain similitude the preeminence of the Christian, over the legal, dispensation."
2. "The heir, as long as he is a child - As he is under age."
3. "Differeth nothing from a servant - Not being at liberty either to use or enjoy his estate."
