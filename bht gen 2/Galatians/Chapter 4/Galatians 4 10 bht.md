# Galatians 4:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle is addressing the observance of Jewish sabbaths, new moons, and specific feasts by these believers. He is cautioning against the danger of becoming entangled in the bondage of Jewish ceremonial law, as these observances no longer hold the same significance in light of Christ's fulfillment of the law. While there is no condemnation in observing civil or socially arranged dates, the apostle is emphasizing the freedom and deliverance found in the gospel, urging believers not to rely on external practices for salvation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "When παρά is ethical, i.e. when the verb is used in a bad sense, e.g. ἐνεδρεύειν κ . παρατηρεῖν, Polyb. xvii. 3. 2, the idea conveyed is that of hostile observation." Ellicott.
2. "Notice how utterly such a verse is at variance with any and every theory of a Christian sabbath, cutting at the root, as it does, of ALL obligatory observance of times as such." 
3. "To observe periods then, now in the fulness of time, is to deny the perfection of the Christian dispensation, the complete and finished nature of Christ’s work: to forsake Him as the great spiritual teacher of His brethren, and to return to carnal pædagogues: to throw aside sonship in all its fulness, and the spirit of adoption: and to return to childhood and the rule of tutors and governors." Bagge.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "To regard the observance of certain days as in itself meritorious as a work, is alien to the free spirit of Christianity."
2. "This is not incompatible with observing the Sabbath or the Christian Lord's day as obligatory, though not as a work, but as a holy mean appointed by the Lord for attaining the great end, holiness."
3. "The whole life alike belongs to the Lord in the Gospel view, just as the whole world, and not the Jews only, belong to Him."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is not a fair interpretation of this to suppose that the apostle refers to the Sabbath, properly so called, for this was a part of the Decalogue... It is a fair interpretation to apply it to all those days which are not commanded to be kept holy in the Scriptures." 
2. "There is as real servitude in the observance of the numerous festivals and fasts in the papal communion and in some Protestant churches, as there was in the observance of the days in the Jewish ecclesiastical calendar."
3. "We should observe as seasons of holy time what it can be proved God has commanded us, and no more."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word denotes careful, scrupulous observance, an intent watching lest any of the prescribed seasons should be overlooked."
2. "A merely legal or ritual religion always develops such scrupulousness."
3. "Tisri, being the seventh or sabbatical month, was peculiarly sacred, and the fourth, fifth, and tenth were distinguished by special fasts."

### John Calvin:
1. "No condemnation is here given to the observance of dates in the arrangements of civil society."
2. "The civil observation of days contributes not only to agriculture and to matters of politics, and ordinary life, but is even extended to the government of the church."
3. "The observance of days among us is a free service, and void of all superstition."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Apostle means a Judaistic, slavish, and superstitious observance which ascribes an intrinsic holiness to particular days and seasons...such observance virtually derives salvation in some sense from the elements of nature."
2. "There is also a free, evangelical, and spiritual observance of holy days and seasons, which is essential to proper order in social worship."
3. "The law of the Sabbath...is as old as the creation, it is founded in the moral and physical constitution of man, it was instituted in Paradise, incorporated in the Decalogue on Mount Sinai, put on a new foundation by the resurrection of Christ, and is an absolute necessity for public worship and the welfare of man."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The meticulous observance of the Pharisees Paul knew to a nicety."
2. "It hurt him to the quick after his own merciful deliverance to see these Gentile Christians drawn into this spider-web of Judaizing Christians, once set free, now enslaved again."
3. "Paul does not object to these observances for he kept them himself as a Jew. He objected to Gentiles taking to them as a means of salvation."

### John Gill:
1. "Lest the apostle should be thought to suggest, without foundation, the inclination of these people to be in bondage to the ceremonies of the law, he gives this as an instance of it."
2. "By 'days' are meant their seventh day sabbaths...being typical of Christ, the true rest of his people, and he being come, are now ceased."
3. "By 'months' are designed their new moons...and he, the substance, being come, these shadows disappeared."

### John Wesley:
1. "Ye observe days — Jewish sabbaths."
2. "And months — New moons."
3. "And times — As that of the passover, pentecost, and the feast of tabernacles."
