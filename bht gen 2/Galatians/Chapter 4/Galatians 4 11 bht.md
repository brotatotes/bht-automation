# Galatians 4:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle's concern for the Galatians is evident in his heartfelt appeal, as he humbles himself to them with great tenderness. He expresses fear for the danger they may be in as they veer away from Christianity towards Judaism. This departure not only jeopardizes their Christian principles, but also undermines the doctrine of grace by replacing it with legalistic practices. Love compels the apostle to show his deep care and worry for the Galatians, emphasizing the seriousness of their situation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There is no attraction in the construction (φοβ. ὑμᾶς, μή πως …), as Winer (comm. in loc.) holds: in that case ὑμεῖς must be the subject of the next clause (so in Diod. Sic. iv. 40 (Meyer), τὸν ἀδελφὸν εὐλαβεῖσθαι, μή ποτε … ἐπίθηται τῇ βασιλείᾳ): but φοβ. ὑμᾶς stands alone, and the following clause explains it."
2. "The indicative assumes the fact which μή πως deprecates."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### John Calvin:
1. "To bring back Christianity to Judaism, was in itself no light evil; but far more serious mischief was done, when, in opposition to the grace of Christ, they set up holidays as meritorious performances, and pretended that this mode of worship would propitiate the divine favor."
2. "When such doctrines were received, the worship of God was corrupted, the grace of Christ made void, and the freedom of conscience oppressed."
3. "The Papists must therefore be held equally censurable with the false apostles; and with this addition in aggravation, that, while the former proposed to keep those days which had been appointed by the law of God, the latter enjoin days, rashly stamped with their own seal, to be observed as most holy."

### Philip Schaff:
