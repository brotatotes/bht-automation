2. "The key to rightly understanding these words is, their apposition with ·ºêŒæŒøœÖŒ∏ŒµŒΩŒÆœÉŒ±œÑŒµ,... ·ºêŒæŒµœÄœÑœçœÉŒ±œÑŒµ... ·ºêŒ¥Œ≠ŒæŒ±œÉŒ∏Œµ below. To that period they refer: viz. to the time when he first preached the Gospel among them, and the first introduction of this period seems to be in the words, ·ΩÖœÑŒπ Œ∫·ºÄŒ≥·Ωº ·Ω°œÇ ·ΩëŒºŒµ·øñœÇ. Then I became as you: and at that time you did me no wrong, but on the contrary showed me all sympathy and reverence."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Paul asks the Galatians to imitate his example, that is, to cast off their Judaizing tendency and to become simple, decided, and consistent Christians, as he had done himself when he cast off his former Judaism, and when he placed himself on a level with them in their heathen state in order to win them to Christ."
2. "Brethren, I beseech you, belongs to the preceding admonition, adding to it the force of a painfully agitated, affectionate, and loving heart."
