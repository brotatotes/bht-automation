## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The whole tenor of the passage seeming to shew that the Apostle’s weakness was spoken of as a trial to the Galatians, μου appeared to have been altered to ὑμῶν, or to have been omitted by some who could not see its relevance, or its needfulness."
2. "ἐξεπτύσατε] 'expresses figuratively and in a climax the sense of ἐξουθ.'"
3. "Besides the freedom of angels from fleshly weakness, there is doubtless an allusion to their office as messengers and to His saying, who is above the angels, Luke 10:16."
