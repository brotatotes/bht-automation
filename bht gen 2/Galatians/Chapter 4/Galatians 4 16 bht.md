# Galatians 4:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Despite the perception that truth can breed hatred, Paul did not become their enemy. In fact, he still had genuine affection for them and their welfare. The truth he spoke was rooted in the Gospel, which sets Christ apart from the law. Paul boldly and faithfully proclaimed this truth, with unwavering love for their souls.

3. "‘Obsequium amicos, veritas odium parit,’ Ter. Andr. i. 1. 40: ὀργίζονται ἅπαντες τοῖς μετὰ παῤῥησίας τʼ ἀληθῆ λέγουσι, Lucian, Abdic. 7."
