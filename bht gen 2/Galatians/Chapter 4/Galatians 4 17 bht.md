# Galatians 4:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They zealously court you, seeking to win you over to their side. However, their intentions are not honorable. They want to exclude you, separating you from the apostle and the kingdom of God. Their zeal is misguided, lacking proper understanding and sincerity. They aim to alienate you from your pastors and teachers, attempting to manipulate you for their own gain. Be cautious of such false teachers and their deceitful motives. Instead, focus on seeking genuine love and respect for those who faithfully adhere to the truth of God's Word.
