# Galatians 4:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
My dear ones, I write to you with the same affection and concern that a father would have for his own children. Just as a mother experiences deep anguish and pain in the process of giving birth, so too do I feel great distress for your spiritual well-being. My earnest desire is to see Christ fully formed within you, so that you may live a life completely devoted to Him and reflect His character in all that you do.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "My little children (the diminutive occurs only here in St. Paul, but is manifestly purposely, and most suitably chosen for the propriety of the metaphor.)"
2. "Whom (the change of gender is common enough."
3. "I again (a second time; the former was ἐν τῷ παρεῖναί με, Gal 4:18) travail with (bear, as a mother, with pain and anxiety, till the time of birth) until Christ shall have been fully formed within you (for Christ dwelling in a man is the secret and principle of his new life)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "My relation to you is not merely that of one zealously courting you, but that of a father to his children."
2. "I travail in birth, like a mother in pain till the birth of her child."
3. "Christ be formed in you, that you may live nothing but Christ, and think nothing but Christ, and glory in nothing but Him, and His death, resurrection, and righteousness."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "My little children - The language of tender affection, such as a parent would use toward his own offspring."
2. "For whose welfare I am deeply anxious: and for whom I endure deep anguish."
3. "Until Christ reigns wholly in your hearts; until you wholly and entirely embrace his doctrines; and until you become wholly imbued with his spirit."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Paul means that he is for the second time laboring and distressed for the Galatian converts, with the same anguish which attended his first efforts for their conversion."
2. "The metaphor of begetting children in the gospel is found in 1 Corinthians 4:15; Philippians 1:10. It was a Jewish saying : 'If one teaches the son of his neighbor the law, the Scripture reckons this the same as though he had begotten him.'"
3. "The forming of Christ in them, their attainment of the complete inner life of Christians, is the object of the new birth. By their relapse they have retarded this result and renewed Paul's spiritual travail."

### John Calvin:
1. "The word children is still softer and more affectionate than brethren; and the diminutive, little children, is an expression, not of contempt, but of endearment, though, at the same time, it suggests the tender years of those who ought now to have arrived at full age."
2. "It denotes likewise his anxiety; for 'a woman, when she is in travail, hath sorrow, because her hour is come; but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.'"
3. "That Christ should be formed in us is the same thing with our being formed in Christ; for we are born so as to become new creatures in him; and he, on the other hand, is born in us, so that we live his life."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I am in travail (ωδινω). I am in birth pangs. Old word for this powerful picture of pain. In N.T. only here, verse Galatians 4:27; Revelation 12:2."
2. "Until Christ be formed in you (μεχρις ου μορφωθη Χριστος εν υμιν). Future temporal clause with μεχρις ου (until which time) and the first aorist passive subjunctive of μορφοω, late and rare verb, in Plutarch, not in LXX, not in papyri, only here in N.T. This figure is the embryo developing into the child."
3. "Paul boldly represents himself as again the mother with birth pangs over them. This is better than to suppose that the Galatians are pregnant mothers (Burton) by a reversal of the picture as in 1 Thessalonians 2:7."

### John Gill:
1. "My little children,.... A soft and tender way of speaking, used by Christ to his disciples, and frequently by that affectionate and beloved disciple, John. It is expressive of the apostle's strong love and affection for them..."
2. "he compares himself to a woman with child, as the church in bringing forth souls to Christ sometimes is; and all his pains and labours in the ministry of the word to the sorrows of a woman during the time of childbearing..."
3. "Until Christ be formed in you; which is the same as to be created in Christ, to be made new creatures, or new men in him; or, in other words, to have the principle of grace wrought in the soul..."

### John Wesley:
1. "He speaks as a parent, both with authority, and the most tender sympathy, toward weak and sickly children."
2. "Of whom I travail in birth again — As I did before, Galatians 4:13, in vehement pain, sorrow, desire, prayer."
3. "Till Christ be formed in you — Till there be in you all the mind that was in him."
