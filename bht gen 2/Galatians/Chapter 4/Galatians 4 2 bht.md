# Galatians 4:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage suggests that someone is under the guidance of guardians and stewards who control both their personal matters and possessions. These individuals are responsible for the care and direction of the person until a predetermined time established by the divine will. This idea of guardianship and stewardship is significant in the context of Christian teachings, where leaders are seen as stewards of the mysteries and grace of God, entrusted with the task of imparting divine wisdom to others. This analogy emphasizes the importance of guidance and oversight from those who play a role in nurturing one's spiritual journey.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Προθεσμία, the time (previously) appointed. The word is a common one: Wetst. gives many examples. The following clearly explain it: ὁρίσαι προθεσμίαν, ἐν ᾗ τὸ ἱερὸν συντελεσθήσεται, Polyæn. p. 597: εἰ δὲ ὁ τῆς ζωῆς τῶν ἀνθρώπων χρόνος εἰκοσαετὴς ἦν … τὴν δὲ τῶν κ . ἐτῶν προθεσμίαν ἐκπληρώσαντα, Plut. ad Apollon. p. 113 e."
2. "It is no objection to the view that the father is dead, that the time was fixed by law (Hebrew as well as Greek and Roman): nor on the other hand any proof of it, that προθεσμία will hardly apply to a living man’s arrangement."
3. "See on the whole, above."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
2. "guardians (of the person) and stewards (of the property)"


### Albert Barnes:
1. "But is under - Is subject to their control and direction."
2. "Such a one would have the control of them."
3. "The general meaning of the apostle is, that the heir was under government and restraint."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Christian teachers are called 'stewards of the mysteries of God' and 'of the grace of God,' as those who have received the counsels of God and impart them to men." 
2. "A bishop or overseer is also called 'a steward of God.'"
3. "Whether Paul's figure assumes that the father is dead or living is a point which does not affect his argument. It is not easy to decide. As Alford justly remarks: 'the antitype breaks through the type and disturbs it, as is the case wherever the idea of inheritance is spiritualised.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Under guardians and stewards, who control the person and the property of the minor till he becomes of age..."
2. "Until the day pre-appointed, or day fixed beforehand..."
3. "By the father...the divine will being the fountain of all law, and having foreordained from eternity the time of Christ's coming."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Under guardians (υπο επιτροπους). Old word from επιτρεπω, to commit, to intrust."
2. "Stewards (οικονομους). Old word for manager of a household whether freeborn or slave."
3. "Until the time appointed of the father (αχρ της προθεσμιας του πατρος). Supply ημερας (day), for προθεσμιος is an old adjective 'appointed beforehand'."

### John Gill:
1. "The word rendered 'tutors'... for such as are guardians of infants, fatherless children, and such as are under age."
2. "A fatherless child had two tutors."
3. "The power that guardians so appointed had, is at large described by Maimonides."

### John Wesley:
