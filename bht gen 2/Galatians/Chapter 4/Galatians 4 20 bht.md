# Galatians 4:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul expresses his desire to be physically present with his audience, as he wishes to address them directly and adjust his words to their specific circumstances. He longs for the opportunity to deliver his message in person, as he believes that face-to-face communication is more effective in conveying his genuine concern and properly understanding his audience's reactions. However, he is also perplexed and unsure about how to approach them, given their changed views and actions, and he feels a mix of shame, astonishment, and confusion regarding their spiritual state.
