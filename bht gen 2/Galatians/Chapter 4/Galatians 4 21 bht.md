# Galatians 4:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who desire to be under the law should listen and pay attention to what the law actually says. The law, in this case, refers to the legalistic system and the covenant of works. It is important to understand that surrendering to legalism brings about the curse of the law. The apostle, like Christ, directs them to the Scriptures and urges them to read, hear, and observe what is written in them, as they claim to hold the law in high regard.
