# Galatians 4:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For it is written that Abraham had two sons, Ishmael and Isaac. Ishmael was born to him through Hagar, a bondmaid, while Isaac was born to him through Sarah, a free woman. This distinction between the two sons represents the bondage and freedom that the Jews experienced under the Mosaic law, and the liberty that believers from all nations now have through the Gospel.
