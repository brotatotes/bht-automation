# Galatians 4:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The allegorical use of the story of Sarah and Hagar reveals the contrast between the Law and the Gospel. Just as there were two mothers and two types of children in Abraham's household, so too in the Church there are two covenants. One covenant leads to bondage, symbolized by Mount Sinai, while the other brings freedom. This figurative speech unlocks deeper spiritual truths and principles, illustrating the condition of those under the Jewish covenant and the freedom enjoyed by the children of the promise. The allegory provides valuable insights into the dynamics of faith and salvation.

"The only thing which really does create any difficulty in my mind, is, that Commentators with spiritual discernment, and appreciation of such a man as our Apostle, should content themselves with quietly casting aside his Scripture interpretation wherever, as here, it passes their comprehension."
3. "The difference between the children of the bond and the free, of the law and the promise, has been shewn out to the world before, by, and since the covenant of the law."

2. "Such a use is often made of history; and such a use, I suppose, the apostle Paul makes here of an important fact in the history of the Old Testament."
3. "The one from the Mount Sinai - Which gendereth to bondage - Which tends to produce bondage or servitude. That is, the laws are stern and severe; and the observance of them costly, and onerous like a state of bondage."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "An allegory [ŒµœÉœÑŒπŒΩ Œ±ŒªŒªŒ∑Œ≥ŒøœÅŒøœÖŒºŒµŒΩŒ±]. N. T. o. Lit. are allegorised. From allo another, ajgoreuein to speak."
2. "Hence, things which are so spoken as to give a different meaning from that which the words express."
3. "For parable, allegory, fable, and proverb, see on Matthew 13:3."

### John Calvin:
1. "The comparison is now formally introduced. As in the house of Abraham there were two mothers, so are there also in the Church of God. Doctrine is the mother of whom we are born, and is twofold, Legal and Evangelical."
2. "The two covenants, then, are the mothers, of whom children unlike one another are born; for the legal covenant makes slaves, and the evangelical covenant makes freemen."
3. "What, then, is the gendering to bondage, which forms the subject of the present dispute? It denotes those who make a wicked abuse of the law, by finding in it nothing but what tends to slavery."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The story of Hagar and Sarah has another (namely, a figurative, typical) meaning, besides (not, instead of) the literal or historical."
2. "Allegory' means a description of one thing under the figure of another, so that the real or intended meaning differs from the obvious sense of the words."
3. "The regular antithesis would be: 'the other from Mount Sion (which corresponds to the upper Jerusalem), bearing children unto freedom; and this is Sarah.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul does not deny the actual historical narrative, but he simply uses it in an allegorical sense to illustrate his point for the benefit of his readers who are tempted to go under the burden of the law."
2. "Allegory was also used by Philo and by Paul here for a secret meaning not obvious at first, one not in the mind of the writer, like our illustration which throws light on the point."
3. "Please observe that Paul says here that he is using allegory, not ordinary interpretation. It is not necessary to say that Paul intended his readers to believe that this allegory was designed by the narrative. He illustrates his point by it."

### John Gill:
1. "An allegory is a way of speaking in which one thing is expressed by another, and is a continued metaphor."
2. "The sense to be, that these things which were literally true of Hagar and Sarah, of Ishmael and Isaac, were types and figures of things to come."
3. "And because the whole Mosaic economy was given to Moses on Mount Sinai, it is said to be from thence: hence, in Jewish writings, we read, times without number, of ◊î◊ú◊õ◊î ◊ú◊û◊©◊î ◊û◊°◊ô◊†◊ô, a rite, custom, constitution, or appointment given to Moses 'from Mount Sinai'."
