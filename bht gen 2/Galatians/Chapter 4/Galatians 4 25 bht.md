# Galatians 4:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Sinai, the mountain in Arabia, is a representation of the law given on that mount. It serves as a type or figure, just as Hagar represents the bondage and fear that Jerusalem, both its physical and spiritual aspects, experiences. Like Hagar, Jerusalem is in bondage, enslaved to the law and the Romans. Thus, Sinai and Jerusalem are closely connected, sharing similar features and circumstances.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For the word Agar (when the neuter article precedes a noun of another gender, not the import of that noun, but the noun itself, is designated) is Mount Sina, in Arabia."
2. "For Sina is a mountain in Arabia."
3. "Corresponds with the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Sinai, with its rugged rocks, far removed from the promised land, was well suited to represent the law which inspires with terror, and the spirit of bondage."
2. "Jerusalem which now is, that is, the Jerusalem of the Jews, having only a present temporary existence, in contrast with the spiritual Jerusalem of the Gospel, which in germ, under the form of the promise, existed ages before, and shall be for ever in ages to come."
3. "As Hagar was in bondage to her mistress, so Jerusalem that now is, is in bondage to the law, and also to the Romans: her civil state thus being in accordance with her spiritual state."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Hagar well represents the Law given on Mount Sinai."
2. "Hagar was a fair representation of Mount Sinai, and of the Law given there."
3. "[Jerusalem] is subject to laws, and rites, and customs; bound by a state of servitude, and fear, and trembling, such as existed when the Law was given on Mount Sinai."

### John Calvin:
1. "Sinai is called Hagar, because it is a type or figure, as the Passover was Christ."
2. "Mount Sinai is said to correspond to that which is now Jerusalem, in the same sense as Aristotle says that Rhetoric is the counterpart to Logic."
3. "Though the two places may be widely distant from each other, they are perfectly alike in all their most important features."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Hagar means ‘Wanderer,’ ‘Fugitive,’ and is connected with the Arabic ‘Hegira’ (the famous ‘flight’ of Mohammed from Mecca to Medina, whence the beginning of the Mohammedan era); Sinai means ‘Pointed,’ or (according to Fürst) ‘Rocky.’"
2. "Calvin and others escape this difficulty by explaining: ‘Hagar is a type of (or, represents) Mount Sinai in Arabia.’ But against this is the Greek neuter article before Hagar."
3. "The law was given not on Mount Sion in the land of promise, but outside of it in Arabia, and this corresponds to Hagar who was an outsider, an Egyptian slave."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Arabians are descendants of Abraham and Hagar (her name meaning wanderer or fugitive)."
2. "Answereth to... in figurative sense as here. Lightfoot refers to the Pythagorean parallels of opposing principles (συνστοιχια) as shown here by Paul (Hagar and Sarah, Ishmael and Isaac, the old covenant and the new covenant, the earthly Jerusalem and the heavenly Jerusalem)."
3. "That is true, and there is a correlative correspondence as the line is carried on."

### John Gill:
1. "It is clear, that Sinai was in Arabia, out of the land of promise, where the law was given, and seems to be mentioned by the apostle with this view, that it might be observed, and teach us that the inheritance is not of the law."
2. "By Agar, I rather think the woman is meant: and that the sense is, that this same Agar signifies Mount Sinai, or is a figure of the law given on that mount."
3. "And answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children; that is, agrees with and resembles the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and of all the cities and towns in Judea; and she, being a bondwoman, represented that state of bondage the Jews were in, when the apostle wrote this."

### John Wesley:
1. For this is mount Sinai in Arabia — That is, the type of mount Sinai. And answereth to - Resembles Jerusalem that now is, and is in bondage - Like Agar, both to the law and to the Romans.
