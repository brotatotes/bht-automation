# Galatians 4:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The heavenly Jerusalem, the true church of God, is the mother of believers, who are free and no longer bound by the law. This spiritual city, the Messianic theocracy, is not a physical place, but a heavenly kingdom where Christians belong. Through the church, we are born again, nourished, and brought up to maturity in the faith. The church, as the mother of us all, plays a vital role in our spiritual growth and identity.

(Hebrews 12:22), "the
heavenly Jerusalem." "New Jerusalem, which cometh down out

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The other covenant, that which is represented by Sarah and her believing offspring, is the true or heavenly Jerusalem, that is not (as the rabbinical teachers imagined) an actual material city in heaven...but a spiritual city, the Messianic theocracy, the kingdom of heaven, to which all true Christians belong."
