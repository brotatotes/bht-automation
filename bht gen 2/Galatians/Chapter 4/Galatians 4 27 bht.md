# Galatians 4:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage being referred to speaks of the flourishing restoration of Judea after its desolation. This promise is used by the apostle to encourage the Gentile nations, who were like a barren woman without a seed to serve the Lord. The command to rejoice is given to these nations, for they will have a multitude of children compared to the Jewish church. This represents the transformation and growth of the Gentile church, which was previously desolate but will now bear many more spiritual children than the old Jewish church.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The portion of Isaiah from which this is taken, is directly Messianic: indicating in its foreground the reviviscence of Israel after calamity, but in language far surpassing that event."
2. "St. Paul here interprets the barren of Sara, who bore not according to the flesh (= the promise), and the fruitful of Agar (= the law)."
3. "'The husband' would mislead, by pointing at the one husband (Abraham) who was common to Sara and Agar, which might do in this passage, but would not in Isaiah: whereas ἐχ. τὸν ἄνδρα means, 'her (of the two) who has (the) husband,' the other having none: a fineness of meaning which we cannot give in English."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The spiritual Jerusalem is regarded as 'barren' while the law trammeled Israel, for she then had no spiritual children of the Gentiles." 
2. "Many are the children of the desolate, more than of her which hath an (Greek, 'THE') husband." 
3. "Numerous as were the children of the legal covenant, those of the Gospel covenant are more so."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The object of the apostle in introducing it here seems to be to prove that the Gentiles as well as the Jews would partake of the privileges connected with the heavenly Jerusalem."
2. "The sense is, that the accession from the Gentile world would be far more numerous than the Jewish people had ever been; a prophecy that has been already fulfilled."
3. "This represents probably the pagan world as having been apparently forsaken and abandoned, and with whom there had been none of the true children of God."

### John Calvin:
1. "The design of the apostle, let it be carefully remarked, is to deprive the Jews of all claim to that spiritual Jerusalem to which the prophecy relates."
2. "He next concludes that we become the sons of God by promise, after the example of Isaac, and that in no other way do we obtain this honor."
3. "To readers little skilled or practiced in the examination of Scripture, this reasoning may appear inconclusive; because they do not hold the most undoubted of all principles, that all the promises, being founded on the Messiah, are of free grace."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "An illustration of the allegory by a passage from Isaiah 54:1, which prophesies the deliverance of God’s afflicted nation from the foreign bondage of the Babylonian exile, and her restoration to freedom and prosperity, so that from a mourning widow, like Sarah, she shall become a rejoicing mother of many children."
2. "The prophet himself, in a previous chapter (Isaiah 51:2), refers to God’s dealings with Abraham and Sarah, as a type of his dealings with their descendants."
3. "In the application, the barren who becomes fruitful, is the type of the Christian church, more especially the Gentile Christian church, as opposed to the Jewish synagogue."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The mother of us Christians, apply the allegory of Hagar and Sarah to us."
2. "The Jerusalem above is the picture of the Kingdom of God."
3. "The prophet refers to Sarah's prolonged barrenness and Paul uses this fact as a figure for the progress and glory of Christianity (the new Jerusalem of freedom) in contrast with the old Jerusalem of bondage (the current Judaism)."

### John Gill:
1. "The heavenly Jerusalem, or Gospel church state, is the mother of us all, and has brought forth, and still will bring forth, many souls to Christ."
2. "The Gospel church in the first beginnings of it, in Christ's time, and especially about the time of his death, and before the pouring forth of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost, when the number of its members were few; for the names of the disciples together were but 120."
3. "A nation shall be born at once, and the fulness of the Gentiles shall be brought in."


### John Wesley:
1. "For it is written — Those words in the primary sense promise a flourishing state to Judea, after its desolation by the Chaldeans."
2. "Rejoice, thou barren, that bearest not — Ye heathen nations, who, like a barren woman, were destitute, for many ages, of a seed to serve the Lord."
3. "Break forth and cry aloud for joy, thou that, in former time, travailedst not: for the desolate hath many more children than she that hath an husband - For ye that were so long utterly desolate shall at length bear more children than the Jewish church, which was of old espoused to God."
