# Galatians 4:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christian believers, as descendants of Isaac, symbolize Abraham's spiritual seed. They are born through the divine promise, not through the natural course of events. This new birth is a result of God's mercy and grace, not human effort. As children of the promise, believers receive the entirety of God's promises, including those related to God's covenant, redemption through Christ, and the work of the Holy Spirit. These promises encompass both temporal and spiritual blessings, ultimately leading to eternal life.
