# Galatians 4:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage highlights the ongoing pattern of persecution, both historically and presently. Just as Ishmael persecuted Isaac, those born after the flesh continue to oppose those born after the Spirit. This conflict is characterized by a lack of faith, grace, and other virtues on one side, and true belief and spiritual birth on the other. Believers face opposition through both words and actions, with the doctrines of grace and righteousness being mocked and derided. This pattern of persecution has endured throughout history and will continue until the end of the world.
