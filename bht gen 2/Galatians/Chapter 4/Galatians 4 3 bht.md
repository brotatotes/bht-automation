# Galatians 4:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When we were under the law, we were like children, stubborn and often in need of discipline. The Jewish rituals and observances served as the rudimentary teachings of our faith, similar to the first lessons of a child learning grammar. These rituals, however, were earthly and physical in nature, not fully able to transcend the worldly realm. They held us in bondage, instilling a fear of death and keeping us confined to a limited understanding of God's kingdom.

2. "The religion of earthly, sensuous forms and rites generally (both Jewish and heathen), as distinct from spiritual religion and rational worship."
