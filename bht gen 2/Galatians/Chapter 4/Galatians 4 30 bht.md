# Galatians 4:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible passage warns about the consequences of seeking justification through the law. The story of Hagar and Ishmael being cast out is a symbol of how those who rely on their own efforts for righteousness will be rejected. Just like Ishmael mocked Isaac, those who persecute the children of God will also face separation from His presence. It is clear that relying on the law for salvation goes against the principles of faith established by God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Nevertheless, the Apostle is allegorizing the whole history, and thus every part of it assumes a significance in the allegory."
2. "The distinction drawn by Hermann between οὐ μή with future indicative and with aorist subjunctive is not applicable to the N. T. on account of various readings."
3. "The obvious prevalence of the use of the subjunctive over the future, both in the N. T. and 'fatiscens Græcitas:’ see Lobeck, Phryn. p. 722."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But what was there said literally, is here by inspiration expressed in its allegorical spiritual import, applying to the New Testament believer, who is antitypically 'the son of the free woman.'"
2. "Cast out—from the house and inheritance: literally, Ishmael; spiritually, the carnal and legalists."
3. "The Greek is stronger, 'must not be heir,' or 'inherit.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "What does the Scripture teach on the subject? What lesson does it convey in regard to the bondman?" 
2. "Everything like servitude in the gospel is to be rejected, as Hagar and Ishmael were driven away."
3. "They were to reject everything like servitude and bondage; they were to adhere only to that which was free."

### John Calvin:
1. "Let believers cheer themselves with this consolation, that the tyranny of the Ishmaelites will not last for ever... they will one day be declared to be the descendants of Hagar, the sons of a slave, and unworthy of the inheritance."
2. "Let us be instructed by this beautiful passage, 'not to fret ourselves because of evil-doers, neither be envious against the workers of iniquity,' when they hold a temporary habitation and rank in the Church, but patiently to look for the end which awaits them."
3. "The casting out of Ishmael was nothing else than the consequence and the accomplishment of that promise, 'In Isaac shall thy seed be called,' — not in Ishmael."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Apostles were no slavish literalists, but used the Bible freely in the very Spirit which gave it."
2. "Judaism and Christianity, bondage and freedom, cannot exist together: the one must exclude the other."
3. "The Apostle thus confidently sounds the death-knell of Judaism at a time when one half of Christendom clung to the Mosaic law with a jealous affection little short of frenzy."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

### John Gill:
1. "The casting of Hagar and Ishmael out of Abraham's family was a type and emblem of the rejection of the carnal and self-righteous Jews from the Gospel church state."
2. "The reason given why the one should not be heir with the other perfectly agrees with the Jewish canons; which was not because he was the son of a concubine, for the sons of concubines might inherit, if they were Israelites, and free, but because he was the son of a bondwoman."
3. "The reason assigned for non-inheritance in the text implies that the children of the free woman, the spiritual seed of Abraham, shall inherit the privileges of God's house, the blessings of grace, and eternal glory."

### John Wesley:
1. "Showing the consequence of this."
