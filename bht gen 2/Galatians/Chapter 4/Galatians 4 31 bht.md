# Galatians 4:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We, as believers, should understand that we are not the children of bondage and legalism, but rather we are the children of freedom and grace. Our identity is found in Christ, and by faith in Him, we are delivered from the enslaving power of sin and the law. Let us embrace the freedom that we have in Him and live as children of the freewoman, enjoying the liberty and blessings that come from being heirs to God's promises.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And if we are, we are not the children of the handmaid, of whom it was said οὐ μὴ κληρονομ ., but of the free-woman, of whose son the same words asserted that he should inherit."
2. "Observe in the first clause παιδίσκης is anarthrous: most likely because emphatically prefixed to its governing noun (cf. ἐθνῶν ἀπόστολος , Rom 11:13 ): but possibly, as indefinite, q. d. we are the children of no bondwoman, but of the freewoman."
3. "I prefer the former reason, as most consonant to N. T. diction."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "For we are not 'cast out' as Ishmael, but accepted as sons and heirs."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is the birthright of Christians to think, and feel, and act like freemen, and they should not allow themselves to become the slaves of customs, and rites, and ceremonies, but should feel that they are the adopted children of God."
2. "The narrative contains important principles, that may be used as illustrating truth, and is so used by the apostle Paul. There are parallel points between the history and the truths of religion, where the one may be illustrated by the other."
3. "The Bible is a book of sense; and all the doctrines essential to salvation are plainly revealed. It should be interpreted, not by mere conceit and by fancy, but by the sober laws according to which are interpreted other books."

### John Calvin:
1. "He now exhorts the Galatians to prefer the condition of the children of Sarah to that of the children of Hagar."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "Some eminent commentators begin with this verse a new section, as expressing the theoretical preamble of the practical exhortation in chap. 5, thus: 'Therefore, brethren, we are not children of a bondwoman (like the Jews), but of the freewoman; for (or, unto) freedom Christ hath made us free: 'stand fast, therefore,' etc."
3. "The pith of the typological illustration, Galatians 4:21 ff., and the final result of the whole discussion of the fourth chapter."
