# Galatians 4:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
At the appointed time, determined by God the Father, God sent forth his preexisting Son, who willingly came and took on human nature. This act of sending his Son was not only a demonstration of God's perfect timing, but also a reflection of his divine plan for redemption. When the Son came, he willingly subjected himself to the requirements of the law, both its precepts and its curse, in order to fulfill its demands and provide salvation for all who believe.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The manifestation of man’s guilt was complete: and the way of the Lord was prepared, by various courses of action which He had brought about by men as his instruments."
2. "The words cannot for an instant be adduced as inconsistent with such birth: they state generically, what all Christians are able, from the Gospel record, to fill up specifically."
3. "A Gentile could not (humanly speaking, as far as God has conditioned His own proceedings) have saved the world: for the Jews were the representative nation, to which the representative man must belong."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "God does nothing prematurely, but, foreseeing the end from the beginning, waits till all is ripe for the execution of His purpose."
2. "Man's inability to save himself by obedience to the law, whether that of Moses, or that of conscience, was completely manifested."
3. "(Jesus) was made to be under the law...to keep it all, ceremonial and moral, perfectly for us, as the Representative Man, and to suffer and exhaust the full penalty of our whole race's violation of it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The full time appointed by the Father; the completion (filling up, πλήρωμα plērōma,) of the designated period for the coming of the Messiah; see the Isaiah 49:7-8 notes; 2 Corinthians 6:2 note. The sense is, that the time which had been predicted, and when it was proper that he should come, was complete."
2. "It was proper that the world should be brought to see its need of a Saviour, and that a fair and satisfactory opportunity should be given to men to try all other schemes of salvation that they might be prepared to welcome this."
3. "It was a time when the world was at peace. The temple of Janus, closed only in times of peace, was then shut, though it had been but once closed before during the Roman history. What an appropriate time for the 'Prince of Peace' to come!"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Fullness of the time. The moment by which the whole pre-messianic period was completed."
2. "Sent forth. From himself: from his heavenly glory. This does not mean that God then, for the first time, embodied what had previously been a mere ideal, but that he sent forth a preexisting person."
3. "Made of a woman. Or born. Repeated, and expressing the fact that Christ became a man, as distinguished from his prehistoric form of being."

### John Calvin:
1. "That season is the most fit, and that mode of acting is the most proper, which the providence of God directs."
2. "The Son, who was sent, must have existed before he was sent; and this proves his eternal Godhead."
3. "Christ chose to become liable to keep the law, that exemption from it might be obtained for us; otherwise it would have been to no purpose that he should come under the yoke of the law, for it certainly was not on his own account that he did so."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The words ‘fulness of the time’ express, as in a nutshell, the whole philosophy of history before Christ, and the central position of the incarnation."
2. "The Saviour could not appear in any other country, nor at any other time, either sooner or later, nor in any other nation, according to the order of divine government and the preordained harmony of history."
3. "He was not only born of a woman, i.e., a true man, like all others, but a full member of a particular nation and the Jewish theocracy, and hence subject to all its religious ordinances and obligations, in order to redeem those who were under the legal covenant."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "God sent forth his preexisting Son (Philippians 2:6) when the time for his purpose had come like the προθεσμια of verse Galatians 4:2."
2. "Whatever view one holds about Paul's knowledge of the Virgin Birth of Christ one must admit that Paul believed in his actual personal preexistence with God (2 Corinthians 8:9; Philippians 2:5-11), not a mere existence in idea. The fact of the Virgin Birth agrees perfectly with the language here."
3. "The purpose (ινα) of God thus was plainly to redeem (εξαγοραση, as in Galatians 3:13) those under the law, and so under the curse. The further purpose (ινα) was that we (Jew and Gentile) might receive (απολαβωμεν, second aorist active subjunctive of απολαμβανω), not get back (Luke 15:27), but get from (απο) God the adoption (την υιοθεσιαν)."
