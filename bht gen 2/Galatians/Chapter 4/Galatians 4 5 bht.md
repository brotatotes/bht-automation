# Galatians 4:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ, born under the law, fulfilled it and endured its curse on the tree to redeem those under its dominion and curse. This redemption extends not only to the Jews but to all who were under the law. Through His death as an atoning sacrifice, sinners are liberated from the law's dominion and curse. This redemption enables us to receive the adoption of sons, becoming children of God. This adoption is not a recovery, but a new possession that surpasses the innocence lost by Adam. It is a gift of grace received by faith.
