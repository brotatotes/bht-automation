# Galatians 4:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Spirit of God's Son dwells in your hearts, confirming your adoption as children of God. By sending forth His Spirit, God enables you to cry out, Abba, Father. This cry is not just a simple exclamation but a deep expression of emotion and reverence. It is a testimony of your intimate relationship with God as His beloved children. The combination of the Hebrew and Greek words, Abba, Father, represents the unified cry of both Jews and Gentiles, as they are united in the same sonship through the Spirit.

2. "By faith ye are one with the Son, so that what is His is yours. His Sonship ensures your sonship; His Spirit ensures for you a share in the same."
3. "The believers' prayer is His prayer: hence arises its acceptability with God. 'Abba, Father'—The Hebrew says, 'Abba' (a Hebrew term), the Greek, 'Father' ('Pater,' a Greek term in the original), both united together in one Sonship and one cry of faith, 'Abba, Father.'"

### Albert Barnes:

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Spirit of his Son. The Holy Spirit which animated Jesus in his human life, and which, in the risen Christ, is the life - principle of believers."
2. "Crying [κραζον] . A strong word, expressing deep emotion. The verb originally represents the sound of a croak or harsh scream; thence, generally, an inarticulate cry; an exclamation of fear or pain."
3. "Abba, Father. Comp. Mark 14:36; Romans 8:15. O pathr the Father, is not added in order to explain the Aramaic Abba for Greek readers. Rather the whole phrase Abba oJ pathr had passed into the early Christian prayers, the Aramaic title by which Christ addressed his Father (Mark 14:36) being very early united with the Greek synonym."

### John Calvin:
1. "In venturing, he says, to call God your Father, you have the advice and direction of the Spirit of Christ; therefore it is certain that you are the sons of God."
2. "Paul’s language does not relate to idle boasting, or to the proud opinion of himself which any man may entertain, but to the testimony of a pious conscience which accompanies the new birth."
3. "We are the sons of God, because we have received the same Spirit as his only Son...Hence it is evident what sort of Christianity belongs to Popery since any man who says that he has the Spirit of God is charged by them with impious presumption."

1. "The gift of the Spirit seems here to succeed the act of adoption, while in Romans 8:14-16 it is made to precede it."
2. "The Holy Spirit so deeply sinks into the spirit of believers and so closely identifies himself with them that He prays in them and through them as their advocate."
3. "'Abba' is the Aramaic word for 'Father' (in Hebrew Aph), so childlike in its very sound, and sanctioned by the beginning of the Lord's Prayer, as originally uttered, also by His prayer in Gethsemane, Mark 14:36."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "We were 'sons' in God's elective purpose and love." 
2. "The Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and from the Son."
3. "It is possible that the repetition here and in Romans 8:15 may be 'a sort of affectionate fondness for the very term that Jesus himself used' (Burton) in the Garden of Gethsemane."

### John Gill:
1. "It is more to be a child of God, than to be redeemed, pardoned, and justified; it is great grace to redeem from slavery, to pardon criminals, and justify the ungodly; but it is another and an higher act of grace to make them sons." 
2. "The Spirit of God not only regenerates them, which is an evidence of their sonship, but as a spirit of adoption manifests it to them, works faith in them to receive it, and frequently witnesses to the truth of it; all which show how any come and are known to be the sons of God."
3. "The work he does there is various, and consists of divers parts; as convincing of sin, and righteousness, working faith, and acting the part of a comforter; but what is here referred to, is the discharge of his office as a spirit of adoption, 'crying Abba, Father'."
