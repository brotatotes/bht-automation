# Galatians 4:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As believers in Christ, we are no longer slaves but children of God, adopted into His family through the triune God Himself. We are entitled to all the privileges of being His sons and daughters. In Roman law, all children, regardless of gender, inherited equally, which serves as a truthful illustration of the privileges bestowed upon us as Christians. We are heirs of God through Christ, and the correct reading emphasizes that our sonship and inheritance come directly from God. We are no longer servants but always sons, heirs of all the promises and of the all-sufficient God Himself.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Œ¥Œπ·Ω∞ Œ∏ŒµŒø·ø¶ combines, on behalf of our race, the whole before-mentioned agency of the Blessed Trinity: the Father has sent the Son and the Spirit, the Son has freed us from the law, the Spirit has completed our sonship; and thus the redeemed are heirs through the tri-une God Himself, not through the law, nor through fleshly descent."


### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A child of God, adopted into his family."
2. "Entitled to all the privileges of a son."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Then an heir. The figure is based upon Roman, not upon Jewish, law. According to Roman law, all the children, sons and daughters, inherited alike. According to Jewish law, the inheritance of the sons was unequal, and the daughters were excluded, except where there were no male heirs. Thus the Roman law furnished a more truthful illustration of the privileges of Christians."
2. "Kai marks the logical sequence. Comp. Romans 8:17."
3. "Of God through Christ. The correct reading is dia qeou through God, omitting Christ."

3. "For the Father sends His only begotten Son, the Son delivers us from the slavery of the law and reconciles us to the Father, the Holy Spirit applies the sonship to our heart and bears witness to it."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "No longer a bondservant (Œø·ΩêŒ∫Œ≠œÑŒπ Œ¥Œø·ø¶ŒªŒøœÇ). Slave. He changes to the singular to drive the point home to each one."
2. "The spiritual experience (Galatians 3:2) has set each one free."

1. "They that are the sons of God may be corrected and chastised, as they often are, in a fatherly way; but these corrections are proofs for, and not against their sonship."
2. "They may indeed judge themselves unworthy to be called the sons of God, and may be in such frames of soul as to conclude, at least fear, they are not; but still the relation abides, and ever will."
