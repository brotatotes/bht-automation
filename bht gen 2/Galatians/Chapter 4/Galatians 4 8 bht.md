# Galatians 4:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Before knowing God, the Galatians were in a state of ignorance, serving false gods that had no true divinity. This idolatry was a form of bondage much worse than the legalistic practices of the Jews. But now, having come to know the true God through Christ, the Galatians must not turn back to the oppressive rites and rituals of their former religious practices. They are called to embrace their newfound freedom as children of God and not to return to a state of vassalage.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "τότε refers back for its time, not to Galatians 4:3, as Windischmann, but to οὐκέτι εἶ δοῦλος, Galatians 4:7." 
2. "In οὐκ εἰδότ . θ ., there is no inconsistency with Romans 1:21; there it is the knowledge which the Gentile world might have had: here, the matter of fact is alleged, that they had it not."
3. "τοῖς φύσει μὴ οὖσιν θ. ] to gods, which by nature exist not: see 1 Corinthians 8:4; 1Co 10:19-20 and note. The rec. would be, 'to those which are not by nature gods,' i.e. only made into gods by human fancy: but this is not the Apostle’s way of conceiving of the heathen deities."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Appeal to them not to turn back from their privileges as free sons, to legal bondage again."
2. "They might still have known Him, in a measure, from His works, but as a matter of fact they knew Him not, so far as His eternity, His power as the Creator, and His holiness, are concerned."
3. "Your 'service' was a different bondage from that of the Jews, which was a true service. Yet theirs, like yours, was a burdensome yoke; how then is it ye wish to resume the yoke after that God has transferred both Jews and Gentiles to a free service?"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "How absurd now to go back to a state of vassalage, and to become servants under the oppressive rites of the Jewish law!"
2. "The drift of the apostle is, to show that the Jews and Gentiles, before their conversion to Christianity, were in a state of vassalage or servitude, and that it was absurd in the highest degree to return to that condition again."
3. "Idolatry is always slavery; and the servitude of sinners to their passions and appetites, to lust and gold, and ambition, is not less galling and severe than was the servitude to the pagan gods or the Jewish rites."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Over against their filial freedom in Christ, Paul sets their lapse into subjection to the elements of the world."
2. "Ye did service...Better, were in bondage or were slaves."
3. "By nature...Not denying their existence but their deity."

### John Calvin:
1. "His object is to make their fall appear more criminal, by comparing it with past events."
2. "The main inference is, that the Galatians were less excusable for corrupting the gospel than they had formerly been for idolatry."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Formerly, when ye knew not God. A description of the heathen state, which, compared with the knowledge of the only true and living God through revelation, was dark ignorance."
