# Galatians 4:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Galatians, having experienced the transformative knowledge of God through faith in Christ, are warned against a perilous backslide into the weak and impoverished elements of the Jewish law. These elements lack the power to bring true forgiveness and confidence in God, making it foolish to desire to be in bondage again, albeit to a different form. It is senseless for those who have been liberated by the gospel to willingly subject themselves to any form of servitude. Instead, they should embrace the freedom and richness found in the knowledge of God through Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The distinction which Olsh. attempts to set up between Îµá¼°Î´ÏŒÏ„ÎµÏ‚ as the mere outward, and Î³Î½ÏŒÎ½Ï„ÎµÏ‚ as the inner knowledge, is mere arbitrary fiction."
2. "The Galatians did not so much acquire the knowledge of God, as they were taken into knowledge, recognized, by Him."
3. "Want of power to justify is that to which the word points here."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "They did not first know and love God, but God first, in His electing love, knew and loved them as His, and therefore attracted them to the saving knowledge of Him."
2. "God's great grace in this made their fall from it the more heinous."
3. "Ye desire again, beginning afresh, to be in bondage. Though the Galatians, as Gentiles, had never been under the Mosaic yoke, yet they had been under 'the elements of the world': the common designation for the Jewish and Gentile systems alike, in contrast to the Gospel. Both systems consisted in outward worship and cleaved to sensible forms."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Since they had been made free from their ignoble servitude in the worship of false gods, and had been admitted to the freedom found in the worship of the true God, it was absurd that they should return again to that which was truly slavery or bondage, the observance of the rites of the Jewish law."
2. "The sense is, 'Or, to speak more accurately or precisely, are known by God.' The object of this correction is to avoid the impression which might be derived from the former phrase that their acquaintance with God was owing to themselves."
3. "The main idea is, that it is absurd for people who have been made free by the gospel to go back again into any kind of servitude or bondage."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Saving knowledge is doubtless implied, but is not expressed in the word."
2. "If God knows a man, that fact implies an activity of God which passes over to the man, so that he, as the subject of God's knowledge, comes into the knowledge of God."
3. "The two adjectives express the utter impotence of these 'elements' to do and to bestow what was done and given by God in sending his Son into the world."

### John Calvin:
1. "No language can express the base ingratitude of departing from God, when he has once been known."
2. "The origin of our calling is the free election of God, which predestinates us to life before we are born."
3. "The false apostles, on the other hand, neglecting the promises, endeavored to oppose the ceremonies to Christ, as if Christ alone were not sufficient."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Formerly the Galatians were left to themselves and, as it were, ignored by God. Then their knowledge of God was not their own merit, but a free gift of God, who condescended to dwell in them and to enlighten their minds and hearts."
2. "The term â€˜elements,â€™ or â€˜rudimentsâ€™ embraces here both the heathen and the Jewish religion. Even Judaism is merely a poor elementary school and a system of slavery, as compared with the riches and freedom of the gospel."
3. "If we deprive Judaism of its Messianic features and divest the ritual law of its typical reference to Christ, it sinks virtually to the same level with the false religions. The relapse of the Galatians to such an unspiritual Judaism was therefore at the same time a relapse to their original heathenism."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Now that ye have come to know God...come to know by experience through faith in Christ." 
2. "Rather to be known of God...God's elective grace reaching them." 
3. "The weak and beggarly rudiments...still in their utter impotence from the Pharisaic legalism and the philosophical and religious quests of the heathen."

### John Gill:
1. "God having caused light to shine in their dark hearts; and having given them the light of the knowledge of himself in the face of Christ, and having sent down into their hearts the Spirit of his Son, crying 'Abba', Father."
2. "That knowledge which he has of them is particular, distinct, and complete; and is to be understood, not of his omniscience in general, so all men are known by him; but of his special knowledge, joined with affection, approbation, and care."
3. "The Galatians are said to turn again to these not that they were before in the observation of them, except the Jews, but because there was some likeness between these, and the ceremonies with which they carried on the service of their idols."

### John Wesley:
1. "How turn ye back to the weak and poor elements â€” Weak, utterly unable to purge your conscience from guilt, or to give that filial confidence in God."
2. "Poor â€” incapable of enriching the soul with such holiness and happiness as ye are heirs to."
3. "Ye desire to be again in bondage â€” Though of another kind; now to these elements, as before to those idols."
