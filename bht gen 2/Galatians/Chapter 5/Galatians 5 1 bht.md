# Galatians 5:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ has set us free with the liberty that comes from being released from sin's dominion, Satan's captivity, and the guilt of sin. This freedom allows us to live in the grace and righteousness of Christ, not bound by the burdensome requirements of the law. We should therefore stand firm in this freedom, avoiding any temptation to return to legalistic bondage.
