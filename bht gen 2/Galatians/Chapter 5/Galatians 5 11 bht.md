# Galatians 5:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If circumcision were preached as necessary for salvation, the offense of the cross, the crucifixion of Christ, would lose its power to scandalize the Jews. Paul's persecution by the Jews served as evidence that he did not preach the necessity of circumcision. His opposition was not driven by personal gain but by his unwavering commitment to the pure gospel. Paul's preaching of the cross contradicted the false belief that adherence to the Mosaic law was required for salvation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Then is brought to nought, is done away, the OFFENCE of the cross because, if circumcision, and not faith in Christ crucified, is the condition of salvation, then the Cross has lost its offensive character to the Jew." 
2. "For, if this is so, if I still preach circumcision, then is brought to nought, is done away, the OFFENCE of the cross."
3. "Œø·ΩêŒ¥·Ω≤ Œ≥·Ω∞œÅ Œø·ΩïœÑœâœÇ ·ΩÅ œÉœÑŒ±œÖœÅ·Ω∏œÇ ·º¶ŒΩ ·ΩÅ œÉŒ∫Œ±ŒΩŒ¥Œ±ŒªŒØŒ∂œâŒΩ œÑŒø·Ω∫œÇ ·º∏ŒøœÖŒ¥Œ±ŒØŒøœÖœÇ, ·Ω°œÇ œÑ·Ω∏ Œº·Ω¥ Œ¥Œµ·øñŒΩ œÄŒµŒØŒ∏ŒµœÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ œÑŒø·øñœÇ œÄŒ±œÑœÅ·ø¥ŒøŒπœÇ ŒΩœåŒºŒøŒπœÇ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "As regards myself, the fact that I am still persecuted by the Jews shows plainly that I do not preach circumcision; for it is just because I preach Christ crucified, and not the Mosaic law, as the sole ground of justification, that they persecute me." 
2. "Circumcision, or uncircumcision, are things indifferent in themselves: their lawfulness or unlawfulness depends on the animus of him who uses them." 
3. "If justification in any degree depended on legal ordinances, Christ's crucifixion in that degree was unnecessary, and could profit nothing."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "But his conduct and example had been greatly perverted. He had never enjoined circumcision as necessary to salvation; and had never complied with Jewish customs where there was danger that it would be understood that he regarded them as at all indispensable, or as furnishing a ground of acceptance with God." 
2. "The fact that he was persecuted by the Jews settled the question, and showed that he did not preach the necessity of circumcision in any such sense as to satisfy them, or in any such sense as was claimed by the false teachers in Galatia." 
3. "For if I should preach the necessity of circumcision, as is alleged, the offence of the cross of Christ would be removed. The necessity of depending on the merits of the sacrifice made on the cross would be taken away, since then people could be saved by conformity to the laws of Moses."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He that troubleth you by preaching circumcision shall bear his judgment; but I am not a disturber - not your enemy...for I do not preach circumcision."
2. "The proof of this is that I am persecuted. If I preached circumcision, there would be no offense, and therefore no disturbance; for the cross would cease to be an offense."
3. "If Paul had preached circumcision as necessary to salvation, the preaching of the cross would have ceased to be an offense, because, along with the cross, Paul would have preached what the Judaisers demanded, that the Mosaic law should still be binding on Christians."

### John Calvin:
1. "The earnestness with which I oppose them is not on my own account, nor for my own advantage."
2. "In short, Paul was at the farthest remove from ambition, covetousness, or regard to personal interest, since he despised favor and applause, and exposed himself to the persecutions and fury of the multitude rather than swerve a hair‚Äôs-breadth from the purity of the gospel."
3. "If the preaching of circumcision be admitted, the offense of the cross will no longer exist, he means that the gospel will meet with no annoyance from the Jews, but will be taught with their entire concurrence."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If circumcision is preached as a condition of salvation, then the cross, that is, the crucifixion, the doctrine of salvation by the atoning death of Christ, has lost its offensive character to the Jews, and there is no further reason for persecution by the Jews."
2. "The false teachers had probably spread the malicious report that Paul himself preached circumcision, because he practiced it in the case of Timothy who had a Jewish mother (Acts 16:1-3); but this was exceptional and a measure of expediency and charity, not a surrender of the principle."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Why am I still persecuted? (œÑ ŒµœÑ Œ¥ŒπœâŒ∫ŒøŒºŒ±Œπ?)"
2. "Some of the Judaizers even circulated the slander that Paul preached circumcision in order to ruin his influence."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle was traduced by the false teachers, as a preacher of circumcision himself in some places; and this they did partly to show him to be a variable and inconsistent man..."
2. "This calumny he refutes by putting the following question or questions;why do I yet suffer persecution? as is clear he did, for being against it, and preaching it down..."
3. "The last mentioned version reads it, 'the cross of Christ'; and so the Alexandrian copy; meaning not the cross of affliction, reproach, and persecution, which Christ has enjoined every follower of his to take up and bear for his sake, and is offensive to the carnal man; nor the cross on which he suffered, or the sufferings of the cross; but the doctrine of salvation by a crucified Christ, which was an offence and a stumblingblock to the Jews..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Why do I still suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased." 
2. "The grand reason why the Jews were so offended at his preaching Christ crucified, and so bitterly persecuted him for it, was, that it implied the abolition of the law."
3. "St. Paul did not condemn the conforming, out of condescension to the weakness of any one, even to the ceremonial law; but he did absolutely condemn those who taught it as necessary to justification."
