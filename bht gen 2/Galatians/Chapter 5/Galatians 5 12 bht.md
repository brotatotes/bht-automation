## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "(1) it cannot be passive, as E. V., ‘were even cut off.’ (2) It can hardly mean ‘would cut themselves off from your communion,’ as the καί is against so mild a wish, besides that this sense of the word is unexampled."
2. "There is certainly an allusion to ἐνέκοψεν in Galatians 5:7, so that in reading aloud the Greek, the stress would be, ὄφελ. κ. ἀποκόψονται οἱ ἀν. ὑμ."
3. "It seems to me that this sense must be adopted, in spite of the protests raised against it; e.g. that of Mr. Bagge recently, who thinks it 'involves a positive insult to St. Paul' (?). And so Chrys., and the great consensus of ancient and modern Commentators"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "they who are unsettling you."
2. "Would that they were even cut off from your communion, being worthless as a castaway foreskin."
3. "Galatians 5:9; Galatians 5:10 plainly point to excommunication as the judgment threatened against the troublers: and danger of the bad 'leaven' spreading, as the reason for it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I sincerely wish they were excluded from the church as unworthy a place among the children of God."
2. "The simple meaning is, I think, that Paul wished that the authors of these errors and disturbances were excluded from the church."
3. "Who pervert the true doctrines of salvation, and who thus introduce error into the church."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "I would that they would make thorough work of it in their own case, and, instead of merely amputating the foreskin, would castrate themselves, as heathen priests do."
2. "Unaccompanied by faith, love, and obedience, circumcision was no more than physical mutilation."
3. "Rather to upset or overthrow. The usual phrase in Class. is ajnastaton poiein to make an upset."

### John Calvin:
1. "They tear the church for the sake of circumcision: I wish they were entirely cut off."
2. "Believers earnestly desirous that the glory of God should be promoted, forget men, and forget the world, and would rather choose that the whole world should perish, than that the smallest portion of the glory of God should be withdrawn."
3. "With such zeal as this, every true pastor of the church will burn."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I wish that they who are unsettling you would even go on to abscission; that the circumcisers would not stop with the half measure of circumcision, but go beyond it even to abscission or mutilation..."
2. "Self-mutilation was a recognized form of heathen worship, especially in Pessinus in Galatia, and therefore quite familiar to the readers. Thus by glorying in the flesh the Galatians relapsed into their former heathenism."
3. "Paul had evidently the dangerous power of sarcasm, but he used it very sparingly, and only in a worthy cause."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Would that, used as conjunction in wishes."
2. "Late verb from αναστατος, driven from one's abode, and in papyri in this sense as well as in sense of upsetting or disturbing one's mind."

### John Gill:
1. "These words are a solemn wish of the apostle's with respect to the false teachers, or an imprecation of the judgment of God upon them; that they might be cut off out of the land of the living by the immediate hand of God, that they might do no more mischief to the churches of Christ."
2. "The word here used answers to the Hebrew word קפח, and which is often made use of by the Jews in solemn imprecations... may they die, may they be cut off by the hand of God."
3. "The apostle here might wish that the mouths of these false teachers were stopped, their notions refuted, that they might give them no more trouble... or that they would cut themselves off, by withdrawing from them, going out from among them, and leaving them as these men sometimes did."

### John Wesley:
1. I would they were even cut off — From your communion; cast out of your church, that thus trouble you.
