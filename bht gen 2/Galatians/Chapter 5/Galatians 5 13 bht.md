# Galatians 5:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As believers, we have been called to the freedom that comes from being liberated from sin and the law. However, we must be cautious not to misuse this liberty as an opportunity to indulge our sinful desires. Instead, let us demonstrate our freedom through loving service to one another, thereby exemplifying the work that Christ has accomplished in setting us free.
