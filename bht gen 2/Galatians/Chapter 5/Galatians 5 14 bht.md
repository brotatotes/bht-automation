# Galatians 5:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The command to love our neighbor as ourselves is not separate from the love of God; rather, it flows from it. This love encompasses all perfection and is the fulfilling of the entire law. It entails treating others with the same kind of love and care that we desire for ourselves. The act of loving our neighbor as ourselves is not just a part of the law but is the essence of its fulfillment.
