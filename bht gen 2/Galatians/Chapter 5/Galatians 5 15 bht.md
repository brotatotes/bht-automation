# Galatians 5:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Beware of falling into the trap of causing harm to one another through slander and divisive behavior, for this goes against the unity and love that should characterize the body of Christ. Let us not engage in bitter disputes and quarrels, for such contentious attitudes only result in mutual destruction. Instead, let us guard our hearts and seek to build up one another, preserving our peace and unity in Christ.
