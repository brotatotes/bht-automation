# Galatians 5:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To truly live a life that pleases God, we must walk by the Spirit, allowing the Holy Spirit to guide and direct us in all things. This means not fulfilling the desires and sinful tendencies of our flesh, but rather living in obedience to the Spirit. The flesh and the Spirit are diametrically opposed to each other, and to follow one means resisting the other. Our aim should be to deny the sinful cravings and desires of our fallen nature and instead yield ourselves to the direction and leading of the Holy Spirit.
