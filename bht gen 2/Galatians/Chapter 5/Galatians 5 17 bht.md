# Galatians 5:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The desires of our human nature, known as the flesh, are completely contrary to the desires of the Spirit of God. It is a constant battle between our sinful inclinations and the guidance of the Holy Spirit within us. We must recognize that the Holy Spirit opposes our sinful nature and that there can be no agreement or harmony between the two. We are called to live by the promptings of the Spirit, denying our fleshly desires and submitting ourselves fully to the leading of God's Spirit.
