# Galatians 5:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The works of the flesh are plain and undeniable, revealing the corrupt nature within. These works, referred to in the plural form, are distinct from and often inconsistent with each other. However, the fruit of the Spirit, mentioned in the singular form, is characterized by consistency and harmony. The term 'lasciviousness' encompasses any thoughts, attitudes, or behaviors that oppose chastity without necessarily involving actual uncleanness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "φανερά (emphatic), plain to all, not needing, like the more hidden fruits of the Spirit, to be educed and specified: and therefore more clearly amenable to law, which takes cognizance of τὰ φανερά." 
2. "ἅτινά ἐστιν, almost = 'for example:' 'qualia sunt:' see on ch. Galatians 4:24."
3. "ἀσέλγ ., ἑτοιμότης πρὸς πᾶσαν ἡδονήν, Etym. Mag. It does not seem to include necessarily the idea of lasciviousness: 'Demosthenes, making mention of the blow which Meidias had given him, characterizes it as in keeping with the well-known ἀσέλγεια of the man (Meid. 514). Elsewhere he joins δεσποτικῶς and ἀσελγῶς and προπετῶς.' Trench, New Test. Synonyms, p. 64. The best word for it seems to be wantonness, 'protervitas.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The hidden fleshly principle betrays itself palpably by its works, so that these are not hard to discover, and leave no doubt that they come not from the Spirit."
2. "The 'fruit of the Spirit' is singular, because, however manifold the results, they form one harmonious whole."
3. "This passage shows that 'the flesh' does not mean merely sensuality, as opposed to spirituality: for 'divisions' in the catalogue here do not flow from sensuality."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The world is full of illustrations of what corrupt human nature produces, and as to the existence and nature of those works, no one can be ignorant."
2. "If the word, therefore, is used to denote human nature, the passage furnishes a sad commentary on its tendency, and on the character of man."
3. "They [the works of the flesh] are not so rare as not to be well known, and the meaning of the words requires little exposition."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "You have a clearly defined standard by which to decide whether you are led by the Spirit or by the flesh."
2. "Adultery...to be dropped from the text."
3. "Uncleanness...see on 1 Thessalonians 2:3."
4. "Lasciviousness...see on Mark 7:22."

### John Calvin:
1. "To obey the spirit and to oppose the flesh, are two great objects which have been set before Christians, and for the attainment of which they have been urged to make the most strenuous exertions."
2. "If men knew themselves, they would not need this inspired declaration, for they are nothing but flesh; but such is the hypocrisy belonging to our natural state, we never perceive our depravity till the tree has been fully made known by its fruits."
3. "From those brought forward, the character of the remainder may be easily ascertained. Adultery and fornication are placed first, and next follows uncleanness, which extends to every species of unchastity."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "There are more than seven in this deadly list in verses Galatians 5:19-21." 
2. "There are four groups in Paul's list of manifest vices."
3. "Surely a lively list."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'flesh' is meant corrupt nature, as before, and by the works of it, not only external acts of sin, but inward lusts."
2. "These are said to be 'manifest' not that they are all, and always publicly done, and are open to the sight of men; for they are works of darkness, and often done in secret, though they are always manifest to God the searcher of hearts."
3. "Adultery; this is a defilement of the marriage bed, and is the sin of uncleanness committed by two persons, one of which at least is in a married state, is condemned by the law of God and light of nature."

### John Wesley:
1. "Now the works of the flesh — By which that inward principle is discovered.Are manifest — Plain and undeniable."
2. "Works are mentioned in the plural because they are distinct from, and often inconsistent with, each other. But 'the fruit of the Spirit' is mentioned in the singular, Galatians 5:22, as being all consistent and connected together."
3. "Lasciviousness — The Greek word means anything inward or outward that is contrary to chastity, and yet short of actual uncleanness."
