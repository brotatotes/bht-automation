# Galatians 5:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Circumcision becomes futile and powerless when it is used as a means of justification, for such an act rejects the Gospel of grace and renders Christ ineffective. Attempting to be justified by circumcision and relying on works negates the sufficiency of Christ and the Christian faith, and ultimately results in no benefit from Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἴδε, not ἰδέ, in later Greek: see Winer, § 6. 1. a: it draws attention to what follows, as a strong statement." 
2. "The present, ἐὰν περιτέμνησθε, implies the continuance of a habit, q.d. if you will go on being circumcised." 
3. "ὁ περιτεμνόμενος ὡς νόμον δεδοικὼς περιτέμνεται, ὁ δὲ δεδοικὼς ἀπιστεῖ τῇ δυνάμει τῆς χάριτος, ὁ δὲ ἀπιστῶν οὐδὲν κερδαίνει παρὰ τῆς ἀπιστουμένης."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If ye suffer yourselves to be circumcised... the symbol of Judaism and legalism in general. If this be necessary, then the Gospel of grace is at an end."
2. "Christ... profit... nothing... For righteousness of works and justification by faith cannot co-exist."
3. "He who is circumcised [for justification] is so as fearing the law, and he who fears, disbelieves the power of grace, and he who disbelieves can profit nothing by that grace which he disbelieves."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If you are circumcised with a view to being justified by that in whole or in part, it amounts to a rejection of the doctrine of justification by Christ, and an entire apostacy from him."
2. "He is to be 'a whole Saviour.' No one is to share with him in the honor of saving people; and no rite, no custom, no observance of law, is to divide the honor with his death."
3. "Rites and ceremonies in religion may be in themselves well enough, if they are held to be matters not essential; but the moment they are regarded as vital and essential, that moment they begin to infringe on the doctrine of justification by faith alone, and that moment they are to be rejected."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Behold [ιδε] . Imperative singular, appealing to each individual reader."
2. "Circumcision is the sign of subjection to the Jewish 'yoke' - the economy of the law."
3. "The choice of the law involved the relinquishment of Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul’s reasoning is directed not so properly against the outward rite or ceremony, as against the wicked doctrine of the false apostles."
2. "The apostle contends that Christ cannot be divided in this way, and that he 'profiteth nothing,' unless he is wholly embraced."
3. "Whoever wishes to have the half of Christ, loses the whole."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Your course is not only foolish, but dangerous, yea ruinous."
2. "A circumcised man may become a Christian, but a Christian who deliberately undergoes circumcision, becomes a Jew and virtually trusts to the law for salvation, and not to Christ."
3. "If St. Paul can venture to pass so terrible a judgment against the law and circumcision which God himself has given, what kind of judgment would he utter upon the chaff and the dross of men's ordinances?"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I Paul. Asserts all his personal and apostolic authority."
2. "If ye receive circumcision. Condition of third class and present passive subjunctive, a supposable case, but with terrible consequences, for they will make circumcision a condition of salvation."
3. "In that case Christ will help them not at all."

### John Gill:
1. "Circumcision submitted to on this consideration, and with this view rendered Christ unprofitable, made his death to be in vain, his sacrifice of no effect, and his righteousness useless."
2. "Christ is a whole Saviour, or none at all; to join anything with him and his righteousness, in the business of justification and salvation, is interpreted by him as a contempt and neglect of him, as laying him aside, and to such persons he is of no profit."
3. "Trusting to these renders Christ unprofitable to them."

### John Wesley:
1. "If ye be circumcised and seek to be justified thereby." 
2. "Christ, the Christian institution, will profit you nothing."
