# Galatians 5:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Idolatry refers to the worship of other gods or graven images and is closely connected to witchcraft, which specifically involves the worship of devil-gods. It is important to acknowledge the existence of witchcraft, as to deny its existence would be to disregard the authority of the Old and New Testament. Divisions, or factions, can occur in various contexts, including domestic, civil, and religious matters, with heresies specifically referring to divisions within religious communities. These negative tendencies, such as emulations or zealousness, can arise from selfish motivations and detract from the honor and happiness of others.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "εἰδωλ, in its proper meaning of idolatry: not, as Olsh., 'sins of lust,' because of the unclean orgies of idolatry."
2. "φαρμ., either 'poisonings,' or 'sorceries.' The latter is preferable, as more frequently its sense in the LXX and N. T., and because (Mey.) Asia was particularly addicted to sorceries."
3. "ἐριθεῖαι] not 'strife,' as E. V. and commonly, in error: see note on Romans 2:8, but cabals, unworthy compassings of selfish ends."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "witchcraft—sorcery; prevalent in Asia (Acts 19:19; compare Galatians 5:21)."
2. "strife...derived from a Greek root, meaning 'a worker for hire': hence, unworthy means for compassing ends, factious practices."
3. "heresies—as to sacred things. Self-constituted parties; from a Greek root, to choose. A schism is a more recent split in a congregation from a difference of opinion. Heresy is a schism become inveterate."

### Albert Barnes:
1. Seditions - See the note at Romans 16:17.Heresies - See the note at Acts 5:17; 1 Corinthians 11:19.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Witchcraft [φαρμακια] . Or sorcery. Elsewhere only Revelation 18:23. From farmakon a drug."
2. "Wrath [θυμοι] . Lit. wraths. See on John 3:36."
3. "Strife [εριθιαι] . More correctly, factions. From eriqov a hired servant."

### John Gill:
1. "Idolatry... means the worshipping of other gods, or of graven images." 
2. "Any real or pretended league and association with the devil... detracts from the glory of God, and rightly follows idolatry."
3. "Emulations or 'zeals'; not good, but bad: a boiling and rising up of the spirits and passions, at the honour and happiness of another."

### John Wesley:
1. "Idolatry, witchcraft — That this means witchcraft, strictly speaking, (not poisoning,) appears from its being joined with the worship of devil-gods, and not with murder."
2. "To deny therefore that there is, or ever was, any such thing, is, by plain consequence, to deny the authority both of the Old and New Testament."
3. "Divisions — In domestic or civil matters. Heresies are divisions in religious communities."
