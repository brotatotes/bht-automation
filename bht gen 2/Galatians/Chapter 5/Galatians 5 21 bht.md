# Galatians 5:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The works mentioned in this passage are not limited to physical actions but also encompass thoughts and attitudes of the mind. The term flesh is not referring solely to bodily desires, but rather to the corrupt nature that affects the entire being. The warning given here serves as a reminder of the consequences of indulging in these vices. It is a call to repentance and a recognition that salvation cannot be attained while persisting in such behavior.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The construction of ἅ is exactly as John 8:54, ὃν ὑμεῖς λέγετε ὅτι θεὸς ὑμῶν ἐστιν: it is governed, but only as a matter of reference, by προλέγω, not to be joined by attraction with πράσσοντες, as Olsh., al."
2. "I forewarn you (now), and did forewarn you (when I was with you): the προ - in both cases pointing on to the great day of retribution."
3. "The article generalizes τοιαῦτα, the things of this kind, i.e. all such things."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Albert Barnes:
(1) "It furnishes the most striking and unanswerable proof of human depravity."
(2) "This passage is full of fearful admonition to those who indulge in any or all of these vices. Paul, inspired of God, has solemnly declared, that such cannot be saved."
(3) "The human heart must be changed, or man cannot be saved."
(4) "We should rejoice that there is one world where these vices are unknown; one world, all whose ample plains may be traversed, and the note of blasphemy shall never fall on the ear; one world, where virtue shall be safe from the arts of the seducer; one world where we may forever dwell, and not one reeling and staggering drunkard shall ever be seen; where there shall be not one family in want and tears from the vice of its unfaithful head!"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Murders. Omit from the text."

### John Calvin:
1. "By this awful threatening he intended not only to alarm the Galatians, but likewise to glance indirectly at the false apostles, who had laid aside the far more valuable instruction." 
2. "What can be conceived more dreadful than that men should walk after the flesh, and shut themselves out from the kingdom of God?"
3. "The saints themselves often fall into grievous sins, but they return to the path of righteousness, 'that which they do they allow not,' and therefore they are not included in this catalogue."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "When I preached to you the gospel which is death to all forms of immorality, and demands conformity to the holy character of Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "Envyings.....Uneasy distressing tortures of the mind, grieving at the good of others, that any should be in an equal, or in a better condition than themselves." 
2. "Drunkenness; excess in drinking of wine or strong drink, whereby the stomach is overcharged, the mind is intoxicated, and the body enfeebled and unable to perform its office; this is often the source of many, or all of the works of the flesh before mentioned."
3. "And that they which do such things, shall not inherit the kingdom of God; by which is meant the heavenly glory, called a 'kingdom', because of the grandeur and magnificence of that state; and 'of God', because it is of his preparing and giving, what he calls his own to by his grace, and puts them into the possession of."

### John Wesley:
1. "Some of the works here mentioned are wrought principally, if not entirely, in the mind; and yet they are called 'works of the flesh.' Hence it is clear, the apostle does not by 'the flesh' mean the body, or sensual appetites and inclinations only, but the corruption of human nature, as it spreads through all the powers of the soul, as well as all the members of the body."
2. "Of which I tell you before — Before the event, I forewarn you."
