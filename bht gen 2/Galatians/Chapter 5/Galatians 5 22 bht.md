# Galatians 5:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The works of the flesh are a stark contrast to the fruits of the Spirit, which are described as the only real fruit that flow from the Holy Spirit's influence. Love, positioned as the leader among the graces, stands in opposition to works of the flesh. Gentleness is characterized as being conciliatory and considerate, while goodness is defined as having a kind and gentle disposition. These qualities of the Spirit highlight the importance of love, gentleness, and goodness in our interactions with others, emphasizing that they are not only acts but also a reflection of our inner nature.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The works of the flesh are no καρπός, see Romans 6:21. These are the only real fruit of men: see John 15:1-8; compare also John 3:20, note. They are, or are manifested in, ἔργα: but they are much more: whereas those others are nothing more, as to any abiding result for good."
2. "ἀγάπη at the head, as chief 1 Corinthians 13:0. See Romans 12:9."
3. "χαρά, better merely joy, than as Winer, al., ‘voluptas ex aliorum commodis percepta,’ as opposed to φθόνος. We must not seek for a detailed logical opposition in the two lists, which would be quite alien from the fervid style of St. Paul."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Love—the leader of the band of graces."
2. "Gentleness—conciliatory to others; whereas 'goodness' has not such suavity of manner."
3. "Faith—opposed to 'heresies'; faith in the widest sense, toward God and man."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is not without design, evidently, that the apostle uses the word 'Spirit' here, as denoting that these things do not flow from our own nature."
2. "The fruits of the Spirit are placed in contradistinction from those vices which lead to strifes among people."
3. "The word means goodness, kindness, benignity; and is opposed to a harsh, crabbed, crooked temper. It is a disposition to be pleased; it is mildness of temper, calmness of spirit, an unruffled disposition, and a disposition to treat all with urbanity and politeness."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Love [αγαπη] . Comp. love of the Spirit, Romans 14:30. In Class. filein is the most general designation of love, denoting an inner inclination to persons or things, and standing opposed to misein or ejcqairein to hate."
2. "Agapan is to love out of an intelligent estimate of the object of love. It answers to Lat. diligere, or Germ. schatzen to prize. It is not passionate and sensual as ejran. It is not, like filein, attachment to a person independently of his quality and created by close intercourse."
3. "Joy [χαρα] . Comp. joy of the Holy Ghost, 1 Thessalonians 1:6, and see Romans 5:2; Romans 14:17; Romans 14:13; 2 Corinthians 6:10; Philippians 1:25; Philippians 4:4; 1 Peter 1:8; 1 John 1:4."

### John Calvin:
1. "Nothing but what is evil comes from man; nothing good comes but from the Holy Spirit."
2. "Joy does not here, I think, denote that 'joy in the Holy Ghost' (Romans 14:17,) of which he speaks elsewhere, but that cheerful behavior towards our fellow-men which is the opposite of moroseness."
3. "Long-suffering is gentleness of mind, which disposes us to take everything in good part, and not to be easily offended."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul changes the figure from works in verse Galatians 5:19 to fruit as the normal out-cropping of the Holy Spirit in us."
2. "It is a beautiful tree of fruit that Paul pictures here with nine luscious fruits on it."
3. "Paul has a better list than the four cardinal virtues of the Stoics, though they are included with better notes struck. Temperance is alike, but kindness is better than justice, long-suffering than fortitude, love than prudence."

### John Gill:
1. "the graces of which are called 'fruit', and not 'works', as the actions of the flesh are; because they are owing to divine influence efficacy, and bounty"
2. "the object of [joy] is God, not as an absolute God, but as a covenant God and Father in Christ; as the God of salvation, as clothing with the robe of his Son's righteousness, and as pardoning iniquity, transgression, and sin"
3. "peace with God in a man's own conscience, produced there by the Spirit of God, in consequence of peace being made by the blood of Christ"

### John Wesley:
1. "Love - The root of all the rest."
2. "Gentleness - Toward all men; ignorant and wicked men in particular."
3. "Goodness - The Greek word means all that is benign, soft, winning, tender, either in temper or behaviour."
