# Galatians 5:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers in Jesus have completely crucified their sinful nature; they have put it to death and renounced its power. They have been united with Christ through baptism, sharing in his death and resurrection, and have been set free from the power of sin. This crucifixion of the flesh is not merely physical, but represents the complete separation from sin and the world. Through the work of the Spirit, believers are empowered to overcome the desires and passions of their sinful nature and live a transformed life in accordance with the will of God.
