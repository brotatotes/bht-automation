# Galatians 5:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Christians, our life is dependent on the Holy Spirit. He generates and upholds our inner life, which is hidden with Christ in God. Therefore, our conduct should correspond with this higher life, walking in the Spirit. The Holy Spirit is not just an occasional influence but an abiding presence in our lives. We are called to yield ourselves to his influences and be controlled by him. Let our actions reflect that we are continually alive in the Spirit, following his guidance in all aspects of our lives.
