# Galatians 5:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let us not be tempted by the pursuit of worldly honor, but instead remain humble and focused on what truly matters. It is easy for us to become prideful and seek the glory and recognition of others, but this only leads to division and strife. When we envy and provoke one another, we lose sight of the love and unity that should define us as Christians. Let us remember that our true worth lies not in worldly achievements, but in our relationship with God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Let us not become... a mild, and at the same time a solemn method of warning."
2. "κενόδοξοι would include... all worldly honour, as not an object for the Christian to seek."
3. "The strong vauntingly challenged their weaker brethren they could only reply with envy."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Let us not BECOME." While not asserting that the Galatians are "vainglorious" now, he says they are liable to become so. 
2. "Provoking one another" - an effect of "vaingloriousness" on the stronger: as "envying" is its effect on the weaker. A danger common both to the orthodox and Judaizing Galatians.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Let us not be desirous of vainglory... on great and most vital respects people are on a level."
2. "When people regard themselves as equal in their great and vital interests... then the consequences here referred to will be avoided."
3. "The true way to cure envy is to make people feel that in their great and important interests they are on a level."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "This compound means having a vain conceit of possessing a rightful claim to honor."
2. "The modes in which vainglory may show itself are pointed out in the two following participles, provoking and envying."
3. "Provoking [προκαλουμενοι] . N. T. o. LXX, only 2 Macc. 8 11. Lit. calling forth, challenging, and so stirring up strife."

### John Calvin:
1. "The vain-glory of which he speaks is nothing else than ambition, or the desire of honor, by which every one desires to excel all others."
2. "Among Christians, whoever is desirous of glory departs from true glory, and therefore is justly charged with idle and foolish ambition."
3. "Mutual provocations and envyings are the daughters of ambition."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Let us not become vainglorious... This is the opposite of humility." 
2. "Love of vainglory is a common vice all the world over in all conditions."
3. "It is not lawful for us to glory but in God alone. Every other kind of glorying is pure vanity."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Let us cease becoming vainglorious"
2. "Provoking one another"
3. "Envying"

### John Gill:
1. "Let us not be desirous of vain glory...this may well be called vain glory, since it is only in outward things, as wisdom, riches, strength, and honour."
2. "Provoking one another; not to good works, which would be right, but to anger and wrath, which is contrary to Christian charity, or true love."
3. "Envying one another; their gifts and abilities, natural and spiritual; their rank and station in the world, or in the church."

### John Wesley:
1. "Be not desirous of vain glory - Of the praise or esteem of men."

3. "The natural effects of [vain glory] are, provoking to envy them that are beneath us, and envying them that are above us."
