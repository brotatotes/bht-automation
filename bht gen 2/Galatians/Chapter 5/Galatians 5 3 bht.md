# Galatians 5:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Every gentile who chooses to be circumcised obligates themselves and becomes a debtor to keep the whole law. However, it is impossible for anyone to fulfill the entire law. By attempting to gain righteousness and life through the law, they reject Christ and nullify his obedience, sufferings, and death.

3. "To show more fully the agreement between the doctrine of the Papists and that which Paul opposes, it must be observed, that the sacraments, when we partake of them in a sincere manner, are not the works of men, but of God... But what are the views of the Papists? They contrive the opus operatum, by which men merit the grace of God; and what is this, but to extinguish utterly the truth of the sacrament?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Circumcision is an initiatory rite by which the person circumcised becomes a Jew, and assumes the solemn obligation to keep the whole law of Moses, moral and ritual; just as the baptismal vow is a pledge of obedience to the gospel of Christ."
2. "The sacramental rite implies all the responsibilities and duties as well as privileges of membership."
3. "‘Again’ refers to ‘I say’ in Galatians 5:2. ‘To every man,’ without exception, stronger than the preceding general ‘ye.’"
