# Galatians 5:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
You have severed your connection with Christ and the righteousness He offers by seeking justification through your own works. In doing so, you disregard the grace that comes from Him. Your reliance on the law for righteousness shows a rejection of the plan of salvation through Christ. By pursuing justification based on works, you have distanced yourself from the grace and benefits of His gracious dispensation.
