# Galatians 5:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We, as Christians, do not seek righteousness through the works of the law, but through faith in Christ and the righteousness granted to us by God. Our hope lies in the future fulfillment of this righteousness, which we eagerly await through the guidance and testimony of the Holy Spirit. Our focus is not on earthly rituals or external observances, but on the spiritual worship of God. Therefore, we confidently wait for the coming reward that God has promised to those who put their faith in Him.
