# Galatians 5:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Faith alone, that is, faith which is active and fruitful through love, is what truly matters. It is not circumcision or uncircumcision, not adherence to the law or heathen morality, that have any significance when it comes to our justification or salvation. What truly counts is our faith in Christ Jesus and our commitment to the Christian covenant.
