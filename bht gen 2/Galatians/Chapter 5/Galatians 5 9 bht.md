# Galatians 5:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The importance of being mindful of the influence of false teachings is emphasized in this passage. Just as a small amount of leaven can permeate and corrupt the entire lump of dough, a minor error in doctrine can have far-reaching consequences. Therefore, it is crucial to be cautious and discerning, ensuring that the purity of the gospel message is preserved and not compromised by the introduction of false teachings.
