# Galatians 6:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If a person is caught in sin unexpectedly, it is important for those who are spiritual, who live and walk by the Spirit, to gently restore them through reproof, instruction, or exhortation. This restoration should be done with a spirit of meekness, demonstrating tenderness and compassion. It is crucial for each individual to consider their own vulnerability to temptation, as it can easily pass from one person to another. Therefore, it is essential to approach the process of restoring others while maintaining one's own meekness.
