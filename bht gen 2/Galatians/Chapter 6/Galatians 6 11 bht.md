## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "See in how large letters (in what great and apparently unsightly characters)"
2. "I do not see how it is possible to avoid the inference that these words apply to the whole Epistle."
3. "I should rather believe, that on account of the peculiar character of this Epistle, St. Paul wrote it all with his own hand, as he did the pastoral Epistles."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "See in how large letters I have written." - The mention of these is as a token by which they would know that he wrote the whole Epistle with his own hand.
2. "He usually dictated his Epistles to an amanuensis, excepting the concluding salutation, which he wrote himself." - This letter, he tells the Galatians, he writes with his own hand, no doubt in order that they may see what a regard he had for them.
3. "If English Version be retained, the words, 'how large a letter (literally, 'in how large letters'),' will not refer to the length of the Epistle absolutely, but that it was a large one for him to have written with his own hand."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The object of the apostle is, to direct their attention to the special proof of his love, which he had manifested in writing such a letter."
2. "It was proof of special interest in them, and regard for them, that he had written to them a whole letter with his own hand."
3. "He might not, says Doddridge, have been well versed in the Greek characters; or 'this inaccuracy of his writings might have been owing to the infirmity or weakness of his nerves, which he had hinted at before.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "How large a letter...with how large letters. Grammata may mean an epistle, as Lat. literae, or epistles; but Paul habitually uses ejpistolh for an epistle. Grammasin means with characters, and phlikoiv refers to their size."
2. "The aorist may refer to the whole of the preceding letter, or to the concluding verses which follow. In either case it is probably an instance of the epistolary aorist, by which the writer puts himself at the time when his correspondent is reading his letter."
3. "The concluding verses emphasize the main issue of the letter, that the Judaising intruders are trying to win the Galatians over to the economy of circumcision which is opposed to the economy of the cross. It is therefore quite probable that Paul may have wished to call special attention to these verses."

### John Calvin:
1. "To convince the Galatians more fully of his anxiety about them, and at the same time to ensure their careful perusal..."
2. "The greater the toil to which he had submitted on their account, the stronger were their inducements to read it..."
3. "...not in a superficial manner, but with the closest attention."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It refers to the handwriting, not to the contents."
2. "The Greek refers to large size only, and may indicate the emphasis laid on these concluding sentences."
3. "Paul employed usually an amanuensis or copyist, but added with his own hand a closing benediction, or some sentences as a special mark of affection, or as a precaution against forgers of letters in his name."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "But what does he mean by 'with how large letters'? Certainly not 'how large a letter.' It has been suggested that he employed large letters because of defective eyesight or because he could only write ill-formed letters because of his poor handwriting (like the print letters of children) or because he wished to call particular attention to this closing paragraph by placarding it in big letters (Ramsay). This latter is the most likely reason."
2. "Deissmann, (St. Paul, p. 51) argues that artisans write clumsy letters, yes, and scholars also."
3. "Milligan (Documents, p. 24; Vocabulary, etc.) suggests the contrast seen in papyri often between the neat hand of the scribe and the big sprawling hand of the signature."

### John Gill:
1. "Ye see how large a letter, or with what letters... the apostle intends the length of the epistle, the prolixity of his writing; and which he mentions, as an instance and expression of his love to them, care of them, and concern for them."
2. "Inasmuch as he took so much pains to write so long a letter to them, in order to set things right in their view, and recover them from error."
3. "It was the greater proof of his affection for them; that amidst so much work, and such labours as he was employed in, he should sit down and write so long an epistle to them with his own hand, in order to expose the errors of the false teachers, and reclaim them."

### John Wesley:
1. "Ye see how large a letter -- St. Paul had not yet wrote a larger to any church."
2. "I have written with my own hand -- He generally wrote by an amanuensis."
