# Galatians 6:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage speaks about individuals who seek to show their zeal outwardly, desiring to make a fair appearance in the flesh. These people are driven by a desire for self-glory and popularity rather than true spiritual growth and edification. They are compelled to impose their religious practices on others, trying to force them to conform to their customs, all in an attempt to avoid the offense and persecution that comes with the message of the cross. Such individuals, in their pursuit of a superficial righteousness, fail to understand that true salvation lies in faith in the crucified Savior alone.
