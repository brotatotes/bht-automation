# Galatians 6:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The ones who push for circumcision do not actually keep the entire law, as they selectively choose it for their own benefit. They insist on circumcising you not out of genuine devotion to the law, but rather to boast about your conversion to their cause. They seek to display their religious zeal through your outward compliance with circumcision. However, true faith in God requires more than mere ritualistic observance; it necessitates a sincere commitment to righteousness, mercy, and faith.
