# Galatians 6:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For me, the cross of Christ is not a reason for boasting, except that it reveals the power of God's redemption. The world is a system that has been crucified to me, and I in turn have been crucified to the ways of the world. This is a profound truth that highlights the transformation brought about by our union with Christ.
