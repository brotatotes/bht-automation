# Galatians 6:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By walking according to the rule of faith, which includes glorying only in the cross of Christ, being crucified to the world, and being created anew, believers experience peace with God. This peace is not based on outward things, but on the atoning sacrifice of Jesus, resulting in a deep sense of justification, pardon, and atonement. The Israel of God encompasses all chosen believers, both Jew and Gentile, who have renounced confidence in the flesh and live as new creatures in Christ.
