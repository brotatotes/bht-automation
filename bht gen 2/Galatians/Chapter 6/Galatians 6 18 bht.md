# Galatians 6:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In his farewell salutation, the apostle expresses his love and affection for the Galatians, even in the midst of the rebukes and warnings he has given them. He prays for the abundance of God's grace to be poured out upon them, that they may experience the fullness of Christ's love and the blessings that come through faith. This prayer is not for the works of the law, but for the transforming power of Christ's grace to be a reality in their lives.
