# Galatians 6:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By bearing one another's burdens, we are called to sympathize with and assist each other in our weaknesses, grievances, and trials. This act of love and support fulfills the law of Christ, which is centered on the commandment to love one another. As followers of Christ, it is through our willingness to bear the weights that others carry that we demonstrate the selfless love and compassion that Christ exemplified during his time on earth.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "If you will bear burdens, bear ONE ANOTHER’S burdens, and thus fulfill the law of Christ, a far higher and better law, whose only burden is love."
2. "The position of ἀλλήλων I conceive fixes this meaning, by throwing τὰ βάρη into the shade, as a term common to the two laws."
3. "The more general the meaning we give to βάρη, the better it will accord with the sense of the command."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Bear one another's burdens, literally, 'weights.' Distinguished by BENGEL from 'burden,' Galatians 6:4 (a different Greek word, 'load'): 'weights' exceed the strength of those under them; 'burden' is proportioned to the strength."
2. "So fulfil—or as other old manuscripts read, 'so ye will fulfil,' Greek, 'fill up,' 'thoroughly fulfil.'"
3. "The law of Christ—namely, 'love' (Galatians 5:14). Since ye desire 'the law,' then fulfil the law of Christ, which is not made up of various minute observances, but whose sole 'burden' is 'love' (John 13:34; John 15:12); John 15:12 gives Christ as the example in the particular duty here."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Bear with each other; help each other in the divine life."
2. "The law of Christ would not allow us to reproach the offender, or to taunt him, or to rejoice in his fall."
3. "Christians, conscious of their infirmities, have a right to the sympathy and the prayers of their brethren."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The emphasis is on one another's, in contrast with the selfishness which leaves others to take care of themselves."
2. "The primary reference in burdens is to moral infirmities and errors, and the sorrow and shame and remorse which they awaken in the offender."
3. "The verb denotes, not the filling up of a perfect vacancy, as the simple plhroun, but the supplying of what is lacking to fulness; the filling up of a partial void."

### John Calvin:
1. "Bear ye one another’s burdens. The weaknesses or sins, under which we groan, are called burdens. This phrase is singularly appropriate in an exhortation to kind behavior, for nature dictates to us that those who bend under a burden ought to be relieved."
2. "We must not indulge or overlook the sins by which our brethren are pressed down, but relieve them, — which can only be done by mild and friendly correction."
3. "He tells us, that, when every one compassionately assists his neighbor, the law of Christ is fulfilled; by which he intimates that every thing which does not proceed from love is superfluous."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Bear ye one another’s burdens, all sorts of troubles, cares, errors, and infirmities."
2. "Sin and error should be resisted and rebuked in a spirit of charity and meekness; but with all our faults we ought to esteem and love one another as brethren in Christ."
3. "And thus ye shall (completely) fulfil the law of Christ, namely, the law of love."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Bear ye one another's burdens (αλληλων τα βαρη βασταζετε). Keep on bearing (present active imperative of βασταζω, old word, used of Jesus bearing his Cross in John 19:17. Βαρος means weight as in Matthew 20:12; 2 Corinthians 4:17. It is when one's load (φορτιον, verse Galatians 6:5) is about to press one down. Then give help in carrying it."
2. "Fulfil (αναπληρωσατε). First aorist active imperative of αναπληροω, to fill up, old word, and see on Matthew 23:32; 1 Thessalonians 2:16; 1 Corinthians 14:16. Some MSS. have future indicative (αναπληρωσετε)."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ is only able to bear these burdens, so as to remove them and take them away, which he has done by his blood, sacrifice, and satisfaction."
2. "saints bear one another's...by gently reproving them, by comforting them when overpressed with guilt, by sympathizing with them in their sorrow, by praying to God for to manifest his pardoning grace to them, and by forgiving them themselves."
3. "This is a law or doctrine which Christ has clearly taught, and recovered from the false glosses of the Pharisees...by his Spirit, inscribes upon their hearts."

### John Wesley:
1. "Bear ye one another's burdens — Sympathize with, and assist, each other, in all your weaknesses, grievances, trials."
2. "And so fulfil the law of Christ — The law of Christ (an uncommon expression) is the law of love: this our Lord peculiarly recommends; this he makes the distinguishing mark of his disciples."
