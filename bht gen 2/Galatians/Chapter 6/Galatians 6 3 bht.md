# Galatians 6:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Understanding our own insignificance is crucial in showing compassion to others and carrying their burdens. Pride and self-conceit can blind us to the truth that we are all equally dependent on God's grace. When we think we are something great, we deceive ourselves. It is only when we humbly recognize our own emptiness that we can truly extend love and understanding to others.
