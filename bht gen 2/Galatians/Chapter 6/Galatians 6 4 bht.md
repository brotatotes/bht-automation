# Galatians 6:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let every person carefully evaluate their own actions and conduct, using the standard of God's word as their measure. In doing so, they should not compare themselves to others or take pride in the shortcomings of others, but rather find joy in their own righteous deeds. This joy comes not from their own power, but from the grace of God working in them. By focusing on themselves and their own actions, they can rejoice in the testimony of a clear conscience, without the need for comparison to others.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The test applied: emphasis on τὸ ἔργον, which (as Mey.) is the complex, the whole practical result of his life."
2. "δοκ.: put to the trial."
3. "And then (after he has done this) he will have his matter of boasting (the article makes it subjective: the καὐχημα, that whereof to boast, not without a slight irony, whatever matter of boasting he finds, after such testing, will be) in reference to himself alone."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Have his (matter for) glorying in regard to himself alone, and not in regard to another (namely, not in regard to his neighbor, by comparing himself with whom, he has fancied he has matter for boasting as that neighbor's superior)."
2. "Not that really a man by looking to 'himself alone' is likely to find cause for glorying in himself. Nay, in :-, he speaks of a 'burden' or load, not of matter for glorying, as what really belongs to each man. But he refers to the idea those whom he censures had of themselves: they thought they had cause for 'glorying' in themselves, but it all arose from unjust self-conceited comparison of themselves with others, instead of looking at home."
3. "The only true glorying, if glorying it is to be called, is in the testimony of a good conscience, glorying in the cross of Christ."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Let him compare himself with the word of God, and the infallible rule which he has given, and by which we are to be judged in the last great day..."
2. "The man who examines himself, and who forms no extravagant expectation in regard to what is due to himself, will be appropriately rewarded, and will be made happy."

2. "To accept that which is approved, 1 Corinthians 16:3; 2 Corinthians 8:22; 1 Thessalonians 2:4."
3. "Not, he will keep his glorying to himself or abstain from boasting. He means that if, on examination, one finds in himself anything to boast of, his cause of boasting will lie simply and absolutely in that, and not in his merit as compared, to his own advantage, with that of another."

### John Calvin:
1. "Let no man, he says, measure himself by the standard of another, or please himself with the thought, that others appear to him less worthy of approbation. Let him lay aside all regard to other men, examine his own conscience, and inquire what is his own work."
2. "It is not what we gain by detracting from others, but what we have without any comparison, that can be regarded as true praise."
