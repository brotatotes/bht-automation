# Galatians 6:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Each person will have to carry the weight of their own actions and face the consequences before God. This means that we cannot rely on comparing ourselves to others or deflecting blame onto someone else. Ultimately, we are accountable for our own choices and will be responsible for the burdens we bear.

2. "It is thus that we are deceived; for, if a man who has but one eye is placed among the blind, he considers his vision to be perfect; and a tawny person among negroes thinks himself white."
