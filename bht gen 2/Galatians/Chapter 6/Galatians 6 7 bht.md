# Galatians 6:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God is not deceived or fooled by the vain attempts of humans who try to pretend they can sow one thing and then reap something entirely different. He sees through all the excuses and false appearances and knows the true motives of our hearts. We cannot escape the consequences of our actions, for as the saying goes, whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. These words serve as a reminder that we cannot deceive God, and the outcome of our lives will be a direct result of the choices we make.

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Gill:

2. "Withholding from his ministers that which is due unto them is seen as mocking of God, and which he will not suffer with impunity."
3. "Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap; if he sows wheat he reaps wheat, if he sows barley he reaps barley; no man can expect to reap another sort than what he sows."
