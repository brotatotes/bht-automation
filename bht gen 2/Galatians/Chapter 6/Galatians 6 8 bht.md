# Galatians 6:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who choose to indulge in worldly desires and pursue their own selfish ambitions are sowing seeds that will lead to destruction. They are focused on their current desires without considering the consequences for their eternal life. On the other hand, those who prioritize the guidance and cultivation of the Holy Spirit in their lives will reap the reward of everlasting life. Their actions are driven by spiritual wisdom and their pursuit of the kingdom of God. The choice is clear - sowing to the flesh leads to corruption, while sowing to the Spirit leads to eternal life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He that (now) soweth, is now sowing."
2. "Drops his seed into, 'tanquam in agrum,' Bengel: this in the N. T. is given by ἐν (Matthew 13:24 ; Matthew 13:27 . Mar 4:15 ), or ἐπί (Matthew 13:20 ; Matthew 13:23 .Mark 4:16; Mark 4:16 ; Mark 4:20 ; Mar 4:31 ): εἰς τὰς ἀκάνθας (Matthew 13:22 . Mar 4:18 ) rather being 'among the thorns' (see Ellic.)."
3. "Corruption because the flesh is a prey to corruption, and with it all fleshly desires and practices come to nothing (De W.): see 1 Corinthians 6:13 ; 1 Corinthians 15:50 : or perhaps in the stronger sense of φθορά (see 1 Corinthians 3:17 ; 2Pe 2:12), destruction (Meyer)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He that sows unto his own flesh...The flesh is devoted to selfishness."

2. "But he that soweth unto the Spirit shall from the Spirit reap life eternal." 
3. "The soil of the flesh, that is of corrupt human nature, yields blighted and rotten fruit; the soil of the Holy Spirit yields sweet and healthy fruit, even eternal happiness and peace."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The precise meaning turns on the context, here plainly the physical and moral decay or rottenness that follows sins of the flesh as all men know."
2. "Nature writes in one's body the penalty of sin as every doctor knows."
3. "It comes as nearly meaning 'eternal' as the Greek can express that idea."
