# Hebrews 1:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The revelation of God in the past was incomplete, given in fragments and varying methods through different prophets. However, in contrast to this, the final and perfect revelation is given through Jesus Christ. The Old Testament revelations, though divine, were partial, while the revelation in Christ is complete. The very multitude of prophets attests to the fact that their prophecies were only partial. The proof of the complete revelation in Christ is seen in his title as the Son, his inheritance of all things, his role in creation, and his exalted position at God's right hand.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This revelation in portions, by fragments, in and by various persons, was necessarily an imperfect revelation, to which the one final manifestation in and by One Person is properly and logically opposed."
2. "At the end of these days would mean, ‘at the end of this age,’ in the technical sense of these words as signifying the whole world-period, the ‘terminus ad quem’ of which is the general Resurrection."
3. "The Writer frequently speak of Him: e.g. ch. Hebrews 7:28, ὁ νόμος γὰρ ἀνθρώπους καθίστησιν κ . τ . λ .… ὁ λόγος δὲ τῆς ὁρκωμοσίας τῆς μετὰ τὸν νόμον, υἱὸν εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τετελειωμένον."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "All was not revealed to each one prophet; but one received one portion of revelation, and another another." 
2. "The Old Testament revelations were fragmentary in substance, and manifold in form; the very multitude of prophets shows that they prophesied only in part. In Christ, the revelation of God is full."
3. "The Son is the last and highest manifestation of God; not merely a measure, as in the prophets, but the fulness of the Spirit of God dwelling in Him bodily."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He was not an infidel. He was not disposed to call in question the divine origin of the books which were regarded as given by inspiration. He fully admitted all that had been held by the Hebrews on that heart, and yet showed that the new revelation had more important claims to their attention."
2. "The contrast here is between the numerous separate parts of the revelation given by the prophets, and the oneness of that given by his Son."
3. "In regards to the various methods which God employed to communicate his will, see Introduction to Isaiah, section 7."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In the first stage of his revelation, God spake, not at once, giving a complete revelation of his being and will; but in many separate revelations, each of which set forth only a portion of the truth."
2. "The revelation differed according to the faithfulness or unfaithfulness of the covenant - people."
3. "The prophet is an interpreter, echoing from within the sayings of God."

### John Calvin:
1. "God formerly, etc. This beginning is for the purpose of commending the doctrine taught by Christ; for it shows that we ought not only reverently to receive it, but also to be satisfied with it alone." 
2. "That we may understand this more clearly, we must observe the contrast between each of the clauses. First, the Son of God is set in opposition to the prophets; then we to the fathers; and, thirdly, the various and manifold modes of speaking which God had adopted as to the fathers, to the last revelation brought to us by Christ." 
3. "But in this diversity he still sets before us but one God, that no one might think that the Law militates against the Gospel, or that the author of one is not the author of the other."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Son as 'the exact counterpart of God'" (Moffatt). [Hebrews 1:2]
