# Hebrews 1:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passing away of the heavens and the earth does not mean their annihilation, but rather important changes in their form. God, in His eternal existence, remains unaffected and unchanged. The language and imagery used in this passage draw from the book of Isaiah. It is essential to emphasize the everlasting existence of God's Son as the Creator and Preserver of the universe. Though the heavens and earth may be temporal, He remains unchanging in His divine and human natures, fulfilling His role as Mediator. The comparison to garments that age signifies the continuity of their substance.
