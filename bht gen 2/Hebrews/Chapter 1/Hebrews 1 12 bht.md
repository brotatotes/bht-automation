# Hebrews 1:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As the heavens and earth are folded up like old clothes and changed for something new, God remains unchanging. In his nature and perfections, in his person and offices, in the virtue of his blood, righteousness, and sacrifice, Christ is stable and unwavering. This truth should shift our focus away from temporary things and onto Christ, strengthening our faith and giving us confidence in the ongoing provision of grace and the promise of eternal glory.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "thou art the same—
 (Isaiah 46:4; Malachi 3:6).
 The same in nature, therefore in covenant faithfulness to Thy people."
 
2. "shall not fail—Hebrew,
 "shall not end." Israel, in the Babylonian captivity, in
 the hundred second Psalm, casts her hopes of deliverance on Messiah,
 the unchanging covenant God of Israel."
3. "changed—as one lays
 aside a garment to put on another."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Shalt thou fold them up." That is, the heavens. [...] they shall give place to the new heavens and the new earth. The present form of the heavens and the earth is not to be permanent. 
2. "Thou art the same." Thou wilt not change. [...] he of whom this is spoken is immutable. 
3. "And thy years shall not fail." Thou wilt exist forever unchanged. These attributes cannot be conferred on a creature; the Son of God was divine.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Vesture [περιβολαιον] . Only here and 1 Corinthians 11:5. From periballein to throw around: a wrapper, mantle." 
2. "Shalt thou fold them up [ελιξεις αυτους]. Rather, roll them up. A scribal error for ajllaxeiv shalt change."
3. "Shall not fail [ουκ εκλειψουσιν]. Shall not be ended. With this exception the verb only in Luke's Gospel. See Luke 16:9; Luke 22:32; Luke 23:45. Very frequent in LXX."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The heavens and the earth are to be lolled up as done with, and they are to be changed for a new heaven and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A mantle (περιβολαιον). Old word for covering from παριβαλλω, to fling around, as a veil in 1 Corinthians 11:15, nowhere else in N.T."

### John Gill:
1. "As a vesture shalt thou fold them, just as clothes, when they are grown old, or out of fashion, are folded up, and laid aside from use at present." 
2. "But thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail; which is expressive of the immutability of Christ, in his nature and perfections, in his person, and offices, in the virtue of his blood, righteousness, and sacrifice."
3. "This may serve to take off the heart from the one, and set it upon the other; and to strengthen our faith in Christ, and encourage us to expect a continuance of blessings from him; all supplies of grace now, and eternal glory hereafter."

### John Wesley:
1. As a mantle — With all ease.They shall be changed — Into new heavens and a new earth. But thou art eternally the same.
