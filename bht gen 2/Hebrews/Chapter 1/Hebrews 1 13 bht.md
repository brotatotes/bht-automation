# Hebrews 1:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The exaltation and authority bestowed upon the Son of God in Psalm 110:1 surpasses that of any other being, including the angels. The mention of sitting at the right hand of God signifies a position of honor and authority, indicating a new kingdom and priesthood that belongs to Christ alone. This Messianic Psalm, acknowledged by both Jews and affirmed by Christ and his apostles, underscores the everlasting reign of the Messiah and the ultimate defeat of his enemies.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Where there is an instance in which God had addressed any one of the angels, and asked him to sit at his right hand until he should subdue his enemies under him? Yet that high honor had been conferred on the Son of God; and he was therefore far exalted above them." 
2. " 'Sit on my right hand;' see notes on Hebrews 1:3. This passage is taken from Psalms 110:1, a Psalm that is repeatedly quoted in this Epistle as referring to the Messiah."
3. "There can be no doubt, therefore, of its applicability to the Messiah. 'Until I make thine enemies thy footstool.' Until I reduce them to entire subjection. A footstool is what is placed under the feet when we sit on a chair, and the phrase here means that an enemy is entirely subdued."

### John Calvin:
1. "The passage is taken from Psalms 110:1, and it cannot be explained of any but of Christ...it follows, that a new kingdom as well as a new priesthood is here introduced, since the same person is made a king and a priest."
2. "This form of expression, as I have already said, means the same, as though it was said, that the second place was given him by the Father...No one of the angels bears so honorable an office; hence Christ far excels all."
3. "But the promise, that Christ shall never be thrust from his seat, takes away from us every fear; for ho will lay prostrate all his enemies...that on this account all who will not submit to his authority shall be laid prostrate and trodden under his feet."

### Philip Schaff:
