# Hebrews 1:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage emphasizes the role of angels as ministering spirits who serve God and His people. They are lesser beings compared to the Son of God and are appointed by Christ to care for and protect His followers. Their service is not limited to the elect but extends to all those who will inherit salvation. As believers, we should appreciate and respect the important role that angels play in God's plan, even though they are not to be worshipped. By patiently enduring and continuing in good deeds, we can look forward to inheriting everlasting salvation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The word λειτουργικός, not found in the classics, is used in the LXX (reff.) of any thing pertaining to the λειτουργοί or their service; the instruments, vessels, garments, or offerings for the ministry: here, of those devoted to or belonging to the ministry of God." 
2. "The διακονία is not a waiting upon men, but a fulfillment of their office as διάκονοι of God. Angeli proprie ministrant Deo et Christo, sed tamen in piorum usum et commodum." 
3. "And if it be said, that the ministration of angels has often been used for other immediate purposes than the behoof of the elect, we may answer, that all those things may well come under the διακονία  διὰ τοὺς μέλλ . κληρον . σωτηρίαν: for all things are theirs; and for them, in and as united to Christ, all events are ordered."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "They are incorporeal spirits, as God is, but ministering to Him as inferiors."
2. "Angels are sent forth on ministrations to God and Christ, not primarily to men, though for the good of 'those who are about to inherit salvation'."
3. "So the superiority of the Son of God to angels is shown. They 'all,' however various their ranks, 'minister'; He is ministered to. They 'stand' before God, or are 'sent forth' to execute the divine commands on behalf of them whom He pleases to save; He 'sits on the right hand of the Majesty on high'. He rules; they serve."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The main point here is, that the angels are employed in a much more humble capacity than the Son of God; and, therefore, that he sustains a far more elevated rank."
2. "Thus, may it not be equally probable that the nature - the essence of God would be unknown were it not manifested by the Son of God; and I am certain that all moral and spiritual life would die were it not for the quickening and vivifying influences of the Holy Spirit on the human soul."
3. "He who made the worlds; who is to be worshipped by the angels; who is addressed as God; who is said to have laid the foundation of the earth, and to have made the heavens, and to be unchanged when all these things shall pass away, must be divine."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Christ's is the highest dignity. He is co-ruler with God."
2. "The angels are servants appointed for service to God for the sake of the heirs of redemption."
3. "The opening words of this chapter illustrate the writer's habit of introducing his practical exhortations into the body of his argument."

### John Calvin:
1. "The very fact that they [angels] serve, shows that they are far inferior to Christ, who is the Lord of all."
2. "The faithful receive no small consolation; for they hear that celestial hosts are assigned to them as ministers, in order to secure their salvation."
3. "Well then has God provided for our infirmities by giving us such assistants to oppose Satan, and to put forth their power in every way to defend us!"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The worship and the work of angels is carried on in the great temple of nature and grace." 
2. "Their service originates in the needs and claims of those who are soon to possess complete salvation."
3. "It is none the less real now that it is unseen."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

3. "We do not have here the doctrine of special guardian angels for each of us, but simply the fact that angels are used for our good."

### John Gill:
1. "Are they not all ministering spirits,.... Servants to God, to Christ, and to his people, and therefore must be inferior to the Son of God."
2. "And this shows the care of Christ over his people, and his kindness to them, and the great honour he puts upon them, to appoint such to minister to them."
3. "And since they are of so much use and service, they ought to be respected and esteemed, though not worshipped."

### John Wesley:
