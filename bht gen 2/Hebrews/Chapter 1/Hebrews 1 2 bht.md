# Hebrews 1:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage speaks of the glorious position of the Son as the appointed heir of all things, existing before all creation. This highlights the preeminence of the Son, whose glory extends from eternity to eternity. The Son's role as heir emphasizes that apart from Him, we are destitute and in need of His abundant provision. It is through Him that we find true fulfillment and blessings, as He is the source of all goodness and treasures.
