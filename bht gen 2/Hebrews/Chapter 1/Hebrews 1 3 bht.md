# Hebrews 1:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Son of God, as the incarnate Word, perfectly reveals the divine nature and character. He is the exact imprint of the Father, bearing the glory and majesty of the divine Being. In his exalted state, he continues to uphold and sustain all things by the word of his power. Through his sacrificial work, he has accomplished eternal salvation for us, and now sits at the right hand of God, having completed his perfect sacrifice. In him we see the unchangeable perpetuity of divine life and power, as he continues to intercede for us as the great high priest.

1. "When he is called the brightness of his glory and the impress of his substance, his divinity is referred to; the other things appertain in a measure to his human nature. The whole, however, is stated in order to set forth the dignity of Christ."

3. "And he added this in order to show that it was not a temporary salvation he has obtained for us; for we should otherwise be too apt to measure his power by what now appears to us.

"And upholding all things by the word of his power...the Son himself, who upholds all creatures he has made; bears up the pillars of the universe; preserves every creature in its being, and supports it, and supplies it with the necessaries of life; rules and governs all, and providentially orders and disposes of all things in the world, and that by his all powerful will..."
