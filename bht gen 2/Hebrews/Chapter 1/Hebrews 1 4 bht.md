# Hebrews 1:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In his exaltation, Christ transcends the angels in every aspect, surpassing them as the Creator over the creature, as an independent being rather than a dependent one, as the one who blesses and is worshipped, not merely the one who receives blessings or worships. This elevation highlights his superiority to the angels, revealing the Gospel's supremacy over the law, which was delivered through the ministry of angels rather than the divine Son. As the one who inherits the name Son, his inheritance predates all creation, just as his inheritance of all things extends throughout eternity.
