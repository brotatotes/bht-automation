# Hebrews 1:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The true nature of Christ's unique Sonship is highlighted in this passage. He is not a created or adopted Son, but the genuine and eternal Son of God. This Sonship stems from His divine person rather than His nature or role as Mediator. God affirms His Fatherhood towards Christ and demonstrates special affection and love towards Him as His Son. This includes the eternal, inconceivable generation of Christ as the Son of God and the Father's recognition and treatment of Him as His Son in His incarnation.

### Henry Alford:
1. "Those who entirely or partially deny this latter [the Messianic import of the theocracy] seem to me to be without adequate means of discussing the question."
2. "It has not therefore been without reason that the Fathers, and so many modern divines, have found in this word Î³ÎµÎ³Î­Î½Î½Î·ÎºÎ± the doctrine of the generation of the Son of God."
3. "The former verses represent to us the Son of God as standing in this relation to the Father before the worlds: and Hebrews 1:6, which plainly forms a contrast to this Heb 1:5 as to time, treats distinctly of the period of the Incarnation."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Christ has a fourfold right to the title 'Son of God'; (1) By generation, as begotten of God; (2) By commission, as sent by God; (3) By resurrection, as 'the first-begotten of the dead'; (4) By actual possession, as heir of all." 
2. "The triumph of David over Hadadezer and neighboring kings is a type of God's ultimately subduing all enemies under His Son, whom He sets, on His 'holy hill of Zion,' as King of the Jews and of the whole earth."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He is more than human. He is more than angelic. He has been addressed and treated as a Son - which none of the angels have. They are regarded simply as ministering spirits. He, on the contrary, is the brightness of the divine glory. He is treated and addressed as a Son."
2. "The promise, therefore, which is here made is, that God would be to him, in a special sense, a Father, and he should be a Son."
3. "The sense is, 'he is more than human.' He is more than angelic. He has been addressed and treated as a Son - which none of the angels have. They are regarded simply as ministering spirits. He, on the contrary, is the brightness of the divine glory. He is treated and addressed as a Son."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "For that he by subduing many enemies around him, enlarged the borders of his kingdom, it was some foreshadowing of the promise, 'I will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance.' But how little was this in comparison with the amplitude of Christâ€™s kingdom, which extends from the east to the west?"
2. "Otherwise it would have been an improper and absurd expression, if he was by way of excellence called the son of God, and yet had nothing more than others; for he is thus separated from all other beings."
3. "Solomon is here referred to, and though he was inferior to the angels, yet when God promised to be his Father, he was separated from the common rank of all others; for he was not to be to him a Father as to one of the princes, but as to one who was more eminent than all the rest."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "My Son. Again by position the emphasis is on this name, and on the relation it describes: My Son art thou, today have I begotten thee."
