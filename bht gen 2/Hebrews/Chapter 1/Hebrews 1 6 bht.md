## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The two passages of Philo adduced by Bleek (after Carpzov) for the transposition of πάλιν, do not touch the present construction." 
2. "It is the ‘verbum solenne’ for the ‘introducing’ the children of Israel into the land of promise, the putting them into possession of their promised inheritance."
3. "All angels, all men, are but the younger sons of God, compared to HIM, THE FIRSTBORN."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "A more decisive proof is Psalms 97:7, which shows that not only at His resurrection, but also in prospect of His being brought into the world as man, in His incarnation... angels were designed by God to be subject to Him."
2. "The fullest realization of His Lordship shall be at His second coming."
3. "The type David, in the Colossians 1:18 (quoted in Hebrews 1:5), is called 'God's first-born, higher than the kings of the earth'; so the antitypical first-begotten, the son of David, is to be worshipped by all inferior lords, such as angels."

### Albert Barnes:
1. “The name Son is not only given to him as above, but also in another place, or on another occasion when he brings in the first-begotten into the world.”
2. “Christ is called the ‘first-begotten,’ with reference to his resurrection from the dead...the Lord Jesus Christ sustains a similar rank in the universe of which God is the Head and Father.”
3. “The fair interpretation of the passage then would be, to refer it to ‘angelic beings’ - and the command in Psalms 97:1-12 is for them to do homage to the Being there referred to. The only question then is, whether the Psalm can be regarded properly as having any reference to the Messiah?”

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Referring to the second coming of Christ."
2. "The author's conception of the inspiration of Scripture leads him to regard all utterances of Scripture, without regard to their connection, as distinct utterances of God, or the Holy Spirit, or the Son of God."

### John Calvin:
1. "He now proves by another argument that Christ is above the angels, and that is because the angels are bidden to worship him."
2. "Were we to answer that Christ is the eternal God, and therefore what belongs to God may justly be applied to him, it would not perhaps be satisfactory to all."
3. "The reason for this joy is given, because the Lord would reign. Further, if you read the whole Psalm, you will find nothing else but the kingdom of Christ, which began when the Gospel was published."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Let all the angels of God worship him." Here are several difficulties. The quotation from Psalms 97:7 is not exact, as most of the quotations in this Epistle are.
2. "The Psalm belongs to the Messianic Psalms, and the exact words of Deuteronomy describe the welcome given to the Messianic King."
3. "The divine in man,' 'The divine disciples sat.' Divine though they be, the Son is exalted above them all in His nature, and in the reverence paid Him."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "If παλιν is taken with εισαγαγη, the reference is to the Second Coming as in Hebrews 9:28."
2. "The first-born (τον πρωτοτοκον). See Psalms 89:28. For this compound adjective applied to Christ in relation to the universe see Colossians 1:15, to other men, Romans 8:29; Colossians 1:18, to the other children of Mary, Luke 2:7; here it is used absolutely."
3. "Let worship (προσκυνησατωσαν). Imperative first aorist active third plural of προσκυνεω, here in the full sense of worship, not mere reverence or courtesy."

### John Wesley:
1. "His first-begotten - This appellation includes that of Son, together with the rights of primogeniture, which the first-begotten Son of God enjoys, in a manner not communicable to any creature."
2. "So much higher was he, when in his lowest estate, than the highest angel."
