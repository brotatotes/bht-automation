# Hebrews 1:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God employs angels as winds and flames of fire, using them as His messengers and servants to carry out His purposes. These angels are spirits created by God, distinct from Him and different from humans. They are incorporeal, immortal, and existing in their own spiritual nature. As ministers to Christ, angels have served Him throughout various significant events such as His incarnation, resurrection, and ascension. Sometimes, angels even appear in fiery forms. However, it is crucial to note that despite the greatness of angels, they are still creatures and are infinitely below the majesty of the eternal Son.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He makes his messengers winds, i.e. He causes his messengers to act in or by means of the winds; his servants flames of fire, i.e. commissions them to assume the agency or form of flames for His purposes."
2. "To suppose the words a parenthetical exclamation to God, or the meaning 'Thy God-like Throne,' or 'Thy throne of God,' seems forcing them from their ordinary construction."
3. "The allusion to the custom of anointing guests at feasts: so that, as the King in the Psalm is anointed with the oil of rejoicing above his fellows, because of his having loved righteousness and hated iniquity, so Christ, in the jubilant celebration of His finished course at his exaltation in heaven, is anointed with the festive oil παρὰ τοὺς μετόχους αὐτοῦ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Who employeth His angels as the winds, His ministers as the lightnings."
2. "The wind-like velocity and subtle nature of the cherubim, so 'flame of fire' expresses the burning devotion and intense all-consuming zeal of the adoring seraphim."
3. "In the Psalms 104:3; Psalms 104:4, the subject in each clause comes first, and the attribute predicated of it second."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They are mere ministers, and have not ascribed to them the name of “Son.” They have a name which implies a more humble rank and office - the name “spirit,” and the appellation of a “flame of fire.”
2. "The one serves him passively, as being wholly under his control; the other acts as a Sovereign, as Lord over all, and is addressed and regarded as the equal with God."
3. "The attending retinue of God, when he manifests himself with great power and glory, is like the winds and the lightning. His angels are like them. They are prompt to do his will - rapid, quick, obedient in his service; they are in all respects subordinate to him, and occupy, as the winds and the lightnings do, the place of servants."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The thought is according to the rabbinical idea of the variableness of the angelic nature. Angels were supposed to live only as they ministered."
2. "The emphasis, therefore, is not on the fact that the angels are merely servants, but that their being is such that they are only what God makes them according to the needs of their service, and are, therefore, changeable, in contrast with the Son, who is ruler and unchangeable."
3. "The Rabbis conceived the angels as perishable. One of them is cited as saying, 'Day by day the angels of service are created out of the fire stream, and sing a song, and disappear, as is said in Lamentations 3:23, 'they are new every morning.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "But it seems preferable to me to consider this testimony is brought forward for this purpose, that it might by a similitude be applied to angels, and in this way David compares winds to angels, because they perform offices in this world similar to what the angels do in heaven; for the winds are, as it were, visible spirits."
2. "And, doubtless, as Moses, describing the creation of the world, mentioned only those things which are subject to our senses, and yet intended that higher things should be understood; so David in describing the world and nature, represented to us on a tablet what ought to be understood respecting the celestial orders."
3. "Hence I think that the argument is one of likeness or similarity, when the Apostle transfers to angels what properly applies to the winds."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They are spirits, not sons; and His servants or ministers, a ‘flame of fire.’"
2. "They do His will, as do the tempest and the lightning."
3. "The angels are expressly called ‘ministering spirits’ a name that recalls both the names given in Hebrews 1:7, spirits and ministers."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The meaning [of 'winds'] apparently is one that can reduce angels to the elemental forces of wind and fire."
2. "Lunemann holds that the Hebrew here is wrongly rendered and means that God makes the wind his messengers (not angels) and flaming fire his servants."
3. "Preachers also are sometimes like a wind-storm or a fire."

### John Gill:
1. "They are 'spirits', created ones, and so differ from God the Creator: they are incorporeal ones, and so differ from men; they are immaterial, and so die not; they are spiritual substances subsisting in themselves."
2. "And they are ministers to Christ; they attended at his incarnation: were solicitous for his preservation, ministered to him in distress, assisted at his resurrection, and accompanied him in his ascension, and will be with him at his second coming."
3. "Angels sometimes appear in fiery forms; the chariots and horses of fire, by which Elijah was carried up to heaven, were no other than angels, in such forms."

### John Wesley:
1. "Who maketh his angels — This implies, they are only creatures, whereas the Son is eternal."
2. "Spirits and a flame of fire — Which intimates not only their office, but also their nature; which is excellent indeed."
3. "The metaphor being taken from the most swift, subtle, and efficacious things on earth; but nevertheless infinitely below the majesty of the Son."
