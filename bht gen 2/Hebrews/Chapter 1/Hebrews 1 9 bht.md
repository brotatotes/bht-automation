# Hebrews 1:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The psalmist addresses the Messiah as God, recognizing his love for righteousness and his aversion to iniquity. This highlights the infinite purity and holiness of Christ. Moreover, the anointing with the oil of gladness signifies the joy and exultation that accompanies the Messiah's completion of his redemptive work. While Christ is chosen above all to be the king of the kingdom of the Lord, he also shares in the fellowship with his fellow kings. However, his superior excellencies place him in a position of higher honor and authority.
