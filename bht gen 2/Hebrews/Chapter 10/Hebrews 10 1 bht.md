# Hebrews 10:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The law, a mere shadow of the gospel, dimly portrayed the good things to come. It was like a rough outline, lacking the solid image of the heavenly realities. Unable to perfect, the repeated offerings of the law testified to their own inadequacy. The sacrifices, continually offered, could never truly atone for sin or make those who draw near to God perfect. Therefore, it is incorrect to measure gospel holiness by the attainments of the Old Testament, as the gospel brings forth a fullness of blessings beyond what the law could offer.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The law, having a shadow of the good things to come, not the very image of the things."
2. "The law had no such εἰκών constructed out of the heavenly realities themselves."
3. "The law, year by year, by the repetition of the same offerings, testified its inability to perfect."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The 'image' here means the archetype (compare 1:3), the original, solid image...realizing to us those heavenly verities, of which the law furnished but a shadowy outline before."
2. "The law was a continual process of acted prophecy, proving the divine design that its counterparts should come; and proving the truth of those counterparts when they came."
3. "In relation to the temporal good things of the law, the spiritual and eternal good things of the Gospel are 'good things to come.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The whole of the Mosaic economy was a shadow... an imperfect representation; a dim outline of the blessings which the gospel would impart to people."
2. "Such a rude outline... could no more answer the purpose of saving the soul than the rough sketch which an architect makes would answer the purpose of a house."
3. "The sacrifices... showed that there must be some deficiency about them, or they would have ceased to be offered."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The legal system was a shadow. Skia is a rude outline, an adumbration, contrasted with eijkwn, the archetypal or ideal pattern."
2. "For eijkwn image, see on Revelation 13:14; Philippians 2:7. Pragmatwn things expresses a little more distinctly than mellontwn the idea of facts and realities."
3. "It is better to read dunatai in the singular, with Tischendorf, Westcott and Hort, and Weiss."

3. "He expressly denies that the sacrifice which is repeatedly offered, though the same, is efficacious or capable of making an atonement."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "Not the very image, the very form of the things, i.e the heavenly realities themselves."
3. "They can never, at any time or anyhow, with the same sacrifices year by year which they offer continually, make perfect those who are ever drawing nigh to God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The law gives only a dim outline of the good things to come."
2. "Children are fond of shadow pictures."
3. "The contrast here between σκια (shadow) and εικων (image or picture) is striking."

### John Gill:
1. "The ceremonial law is intended; this was a 'shadow,' a figure, a representation of something true, real, and substantial; was dark and obscure, yet had in it, and gave, some glimmering light; and was like a shadow, fleeting and transitory."
2. "And not the very image of the things; as it had not neither the things themselves, nor Christ, the substance of them, so it did not give a clear revelation of them, as is made in the Gospel, nor exhibit a distinct delineation of them, such as an image expresses."
3. "Legal sacrifices could not make perfect expiation of sin; there is no proportion between them and sin: nor did they extend to all sin, and at most only typically expiated; nor could they justify and cleanse from sin."

### John Wesley:
1. "The law, the Mosaic dispensation, being a bare, unsubstantial shadow of good things to come, of the gospel blessings."
2. "Not the substantial, solid image of them, can never with the same kind of sacrifices, though continually repeated, make the comers thereunto perfect."
3. "How is it possible, that any who consider this should suppose the attainments of David, or any who were under that dispensation, to be the proper measure of gospel holiness; and that Christian experience is to rise no higher than Jewish?"
