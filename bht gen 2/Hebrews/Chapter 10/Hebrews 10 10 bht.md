# Hebrews 10:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through the will of God fulfilled in Christ, we are sanctified and cleansed from guilt, consecrated to God for His purposes. The sacrifice of Christ, well-pleasing to God, expiates our sins and justifies us completely. This once-for-all offering purifies our consciences and restores our perfect relationship with God. It surpasses the temporary and insufficient sacrifices of the Levitical system, dispelling the notions of Christ's continual offering and refuting the error of the Popish mass. In Christ's sacrifice, we find our ultimate sanctification and eternal redemption.
