# Hebrews 10:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Under the old Jewish system, the priests would stand daily to offer sacrifices, representing the ongoing need for atonement. These repeated sacrifices, however, were unable to remove sins completely. In contrast, Christ, as the High Priest, offered himself as the ultimate sacrifice once for all. His one offering surpassed the imperfections of the former system, providing full forgiveness and sanctification for believers. Through faith in Christ, we can find rest and victory, no longer relying on the futile repetition of sacrifices. The ancient priesthood has ceased, and all who are sanctified are now consecrated in the perfect sacrifice of Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The High-priesthood of our Lord is to be compared with that of the Jewish legal high priests...This ἀρχιερεύς is the representative of the whole priesthood."
2. "No priest nor other person might sit in the inner court of the temple, except the king."
3. "The sacrifice might bring sense of partial forgiveness: but it could never denude the offerer of sinfulness strip off and take away his guilt."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Though he did not in person stand 'daily' offering sacrifices, he did so by the subordinate priests of whom, as well as of all Israel, he was the representative head."
2. "The attitude of one ministering; in contrast to 'sat down on the right hand of God,' said of Christ; the posture of one being ministered to as a king."
3. "Legal sacrifices might, in part, produce the sense of forgiveness, yet scarcely even that; but entirely to strip off one's guilt they never could."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Every priest standeth daily ministering - That is, this is done every day. It does not mean literally that every priest was daily concerned in offering sacrifices, but that this was done each day..."
2. "The object of the apostle is to prove that under the Jewish economy sacrifices were repeated constantly, showing their imperfection, but that under the Christian economy the great sacrifice had been offered once, which was sufficient for all."
3. "And offering oftentimes the same sacrifices - The same sacrifices were offered morning and evening every day. Which can never take away sins."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Every priest suggesting many priests."
2. "The wearisome round of daily offerings, always the same, contrasted with the one offering, once for all."
3. "The verb [take away] literally means to strip off all round."

### John Calvin:
1. "The conclusion then is, that the ancient priesthood, which is inconsistent with this, has ceased; for all the saints find a full consecration in the one offering of Christ."
2. "By saying, them who are sanctified, he includes all the children of God; and he reminds us that the grace of sanctification is sought elsewhere in vain."
3. "If then our faith seeks Christ sitting on God’s right hand, and recumbs quietly on him as there sitting, we shall at length enjoy the fruit of his victory."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Standeth (εστηκεν). Perfect active indicative of ιστημ (intransitive), vivid picture."
2. "Ministering and offering (λειτουργων κα προσφερων). Present active participles graphically describing the priest."
3. "Take away (περιελειν). Second aorist active infinitive of περιαιρεω, old verb to take from around, to remove utterly as in Acts 27:20."

### John Gill:
1. "When he says 'every priest', it supposes there were more than one, as indeed there were many, not only in succession to one another, but together, having different parts of service to perform; and everyone of them 'standeth' at the altar, showing that his work was not done."
2. "And offering oftentimes the same sacrifices; as a lamb in the morning, and another at evening; and if it was a burnt offering, or a sin offering, or an offering for the purification of a woman, or for the cleansing of the leper, they were always the same."
3. "This frequent offering, and the offering of the same things, show that they were such which can never take away sins; for notwithstanding these many and repeated offerings, even the sins of Old Testament saints remained to be atoned for by Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. Every priest standeth — As a servant in an humble posture.
