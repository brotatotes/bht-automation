# Hebrews 10:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The one sacrifice offered by Jesus Christ, the Son of God, outshines and surpasses all the sacrifices made by the earthly priests. While they offered their sacrifices repeatedly and stood to minister, Jesus offered his sacrifice once for sins for all time, and then sat down at God's right hand, signifying the completion and perfection of his work. His sacrifice is effective, complete, and enduring, leaving no need for any other sacrifice. Thus, through his one sacrifice, Jesus has accomplished what no one else could, securing eternal redemption for all who believe in him.
