# Hebrews 10:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage highlights Christ's anticipation for the fulfillment of God's promise, as His adversaries become His footstool. The absence of contradiction between this passage and 1 Corinthians 15:23-26 is emphasized. Christ's return is portrayed as a continuation of His waiting, bringing the ultimate subjection of His enemies. Even His own chosen ones were once among those enemies and are not completely subject until He submits Himself to the Father, revealing the unity of God. The imagery of a conquered footstool represents Christ's complete and absolute victory.
