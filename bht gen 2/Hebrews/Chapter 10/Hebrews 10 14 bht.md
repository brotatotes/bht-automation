# Hebrews 10:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By offering himself as a sacrifice, Jesus has achieved what the old sacrifices failed to do. His sacrifice has perfected and obtained complete redemption for all who are sanctified. This means that he has accomplished everything necessary for their full reconciliation with God, granting them the full pardon of all their sins. Through His one sacrifice, Christ has done what the law and its sacrifices could not do.
