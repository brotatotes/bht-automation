# Hebrews 10:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The preface to the following citation not only confirms the divine original and authority of the books of the Old Testament but also reveals that the penmen of these books were inspired by the Holy Ghost. As the author repeats a quotation from Jeremiah, he further establishes the complete ratification of the new covenant and the secure blessings that come from the one offering of Christ. Through this, it becomes evident that any repetition of sacrifices and the need for other expiatory offerings are rendered utterly unnecessary.
