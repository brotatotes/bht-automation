# Hebrews 10:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Here, the writer brings to attention the promise of God's non-remembrance of sin, which signifies the forgiveness of sin. This promise stands in contrast to the continual remembrance of sin through the legal sacrifices. Moreover, the writer highlights the significance of the new covenant by suggesting the need to abolish the outdated system of these sacrifices. The interruption in the quotation further supports the notion that the main clause begins at a later point, emphasizing the idea of the non-remembrance of sin under the new covenant and rendering the practice of legal sacrifices unnecessary.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The reason for this, alleged by the later Commentators, is, the harshness of understanding ·ΩïœÉœÑŒµœÅŒøŒΩ ŒªŒ≠Œ≥ŒµŒπ, or the like, inserted in some unimportant mss. at the beginning of Hebrews 10:17, as inconsistent with the concinnity of our Writer‚Äôs style."
2. "But still more cogent reasons for making the apodosis begin at Heb 10:17 are, 1. that there the Œµ·º∞œÅŒ∑ŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒøŒΩ ends, not at ŒªŒ≠Œ≥ŒµŒπ Œ∫œçœÅŒπŒøœÇ: there a hiatus in the citation occurs, and the Writer first passes on to that which is said after: 2. that Heb 10:17 itself carries the whole burden of the citation with it."
3. "So that both construction and sense are troubled by the modern idea of breaking at ŒªŒ≠Œ≥ŒµŒπ Œ∫œçœÅŒπŒøœÇ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Here again the writer adds "their iniquities" (œÑœâŒΩ Œ±ŒΩŒøŒºŒπœâŒΩ) to "sins" of Hebrews 8:12." 
2. "It is uncertain also whether the writer means verse Hebrews 10:17 to be the principal clause with Hebrews 10:15; Hebrews 10:16 as subordinate."
3. "At any rate verse Hebrews 10:17 in the quotation does not follow immediately after verse Hebrews 10:16 as one can see in Hebrews 8:10-12."

### John Gill:
1. "The principal thing for which they are cited here, is to observe God's promise of non-remembrance of sin; which is no other than remission of sin..."
2. "...which is not consistent with legal sacrifices, in which there is a remembrance of sin every year."
3. "...since this new covenant has taken place, legal sacrifices must be abolished..."
