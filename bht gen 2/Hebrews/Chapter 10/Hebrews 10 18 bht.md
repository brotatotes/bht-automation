# Hebrews 10:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Where there is forgiveness of sins, there is no longer a need for offerings concerning sin. This is evident from the promise of the covenant, God's proclamation, the shedding of Christ's blood, his exaltation to offer forgiveness, the Gospel declaration, and the numerous instances of individuals receiving this remission. While other offerings like praise and thanksgiving may still be made, none are required for atonement. Christ's sacrifice is sufficient, rendering any repetition unnecessary and invalidating the continuation of old legal sacrifices.
