# Hebrews 10:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If the sacrifices of the law had truly perfected the worshippers in their cleansing from sin, then there would have been no need for them to be repeatedly offered. It is clear that these sacrifices were not sufficient, as they did not bring about a complete purification. If they had, then the worshippers would have been freed from the guilt and power of their sins, and their consciences would not be burdened by them. However, it is through the sacrifice of Christ that true purification and freedom from sin is obtained, bringing peace and joy to those who believe.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For (if it were so, if the law were able to perfect the worshippers) would they not have ceased being offered, on account of the worshippers having no longer any conscience of sins."
2. "The taking our verse interrogatively is as old as Œc.: ἐπεὶ οὐκ ἂν ἐπαύσαντο κατ ʼ ἐρώτησιν ἀνάγνωθι."
3. "The rec. not reading οὐκ, might indeed be well thus rendered, 'for in that case they would have ceased to be offered.' But then ἀλλά comes in awkwardly, which, when as here without any emphasis, more naturally follows a negative sentence."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 2. For—if the law could, by
	its sacrifices, have perfected the worshippers. 
	they—the sacrifices. 
	once purged—IF
	they were once for all cleansed ( :-). 
	conscience—"consciousness
	of sin" (Hebrews 9:9).

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The very fact that they were repeated showed that there was some deficiency in them as to the matter of cleansing the soul from sin."
2. "If what is given to a patient heals him, there is no need of repeating it; but if it is repeated often it shows that there was some deficiency in it, and if taken periodically through a man’s life, and the disease should still remain, it would show that it was not sufficient to effect his cure."
3. "When a man has full evidence that an atonement has been made which will meet all the demands of the Law, and which secures the remission of sin, he feels that it is enough. It is all that the case demands, and his conscience may have peace."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. To be offered [προσφερομεναι] . The present participle brings out more forcibly the continuous repetition : "Ceased being offered."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Else would they these same sacrifices not have ceased to be offered..."
2. "The worshippers both priests and people would have had no longer any conscience any consciousness of the guilt of sin being once for all completely purified?"
3. "The whole clause is best treated as a question, as is clear from the next verse."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "To be offered (προσφερομενα). Regular idiom, participle (present passive) with παυομα (Acts 5:42)."
2. "Because (δια το). Δια with the accusative of the articular infinitive, "because of the having" (εχειν) as to the worshippers (τους λατρευοντας, accusative of general reference of the articular participle), not 'would have had.'"
3. "Having been once cleansed (απαξ κεκαθαρισμενους). Perfect passive participle of καθαριζω, 'if they had once for all been cleansed.'"

### John Gill:
1. "If the former ones had made perfect, there would have been no need of others, or of the repetition of the same."
2. "If they had been really purged from sin by legal sacrifices, and purifications, would have had no more conscience of sins, and so have had no need to have repeated them."
3. "But that they are discharged from the guilt of sin, and are not liable to condemnation for it; and through the application of the blood of Christ to them, have peace with God, and joy in the Holy Ghost."

### John Wesley:
1. They who had been once perfectly purged, would have been no longer conscious either of the guilt or power of their sins.
