# Hebrews 10:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ has opened a new and living way for us through his incarnation, death, and resurrection. This way is always new and alive, never growing old or being replaced by another. It is a way of faith, where we find true life. Christ consecrated this way for us, preparing and dedicating it. Through the veil of his flesh, the weak human nature he took on, we are able to access God and experience his holiness, righteousness, and enduring love.

2. "Nor can any one find God except he to whom the man Christ becomes the door and the way."

3. "The human nature of Christ, through which the way to heaven is opened, renewed, and consecrated, is compared to the vail of the tabernacle...which may denote the holiness of Christ's human nature; the strength, courage, and steadfastness of it, under all its sorrows and sufferings; and the purity and duration of his righteousness."
