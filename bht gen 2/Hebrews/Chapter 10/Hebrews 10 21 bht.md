# Hebrews 10:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ is referred to as a great priest who rules over the house of God. He holds the superior position of both a priest and a king, exemplifying the uniqueness of His role. As the Son of God, Christ has authority over the church, which includes believers from both heavenly and earthly realms. This elevated status establishes Him as the ultimate high priest, surpassing Aaron and his descendants. The greatness of Christ's priesthood is not to be underestimated, as it sets Him apart from any other priest in history.
