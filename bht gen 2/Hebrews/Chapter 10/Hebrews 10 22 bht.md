## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "let us approach with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water." 
2. "This distinction makes it impossible, with Calvin, Limborch, Owen, Bengel, Ebrard, and the old Socinians, Schlichting, al., to spiritualize away the meaning into 'Christi spiritus et doctrina, seu spiritualis illa aqua, qua suos perfundit Christus, ipsius etiam sanguine non excluso'."
3. "Still in maintaining the externality of the words, as referring, and referring solely, to Baptism, we must remember, that Baptism itself is not a mere external rite, but at every mention of it carries the thought further, viz. to that spiritual washing of which it is itself symbolical and sacramental."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "with a true heart—without hypocrisy; 'in truth, and with a perfect heart'; a heart thoroughly imbued with 'the truth'" (Hebrews 7:19).
2. "full assurance— with no doubt as to our acceptance when coming to God by the blood of Christ" (Hebrews 7:19).
3. "The perfects 'having . . . hearts sprinkled . . . body (the Greek is singular) washed,' imply a continuing state produced by a once-for-all accomplished act, namely, our justification by faith through Christ's blood, and consecration to God, sealed sacramentally by the baptism of our body" (Hebrews 9:13; Hebrews 9:21).

### Albert Barnes:

2. "The 'full assurance of faith' means unwavering confidence; a fulness of faith in God which leaves no room for doubt."
3. "We are made free from [an evil] conscience through the atonement of Jesus, not because we become convinced that we have not committed sin, and not because we are led to suppose that our sins are less than we had otherwise supposed - for the reverse of both these is true - but because our sins are forgiven, and since they are freely pardoned they no longer produce remorse and the fear of future wrath."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A true heart is required to enter the true sanctuary. The phrase means more than in sincerity. Sincerity is included, but with it all that enters into a right attitude toward God as revealed in our Great High Priest."
2. "Full conviction engendered by faith. Faith is the basis of all right relation to God."
3. "Your own hearts must experience the effects of the great sacrifice of Christ, - pardon, moral renewal, deliverance from a legal spirit."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Jews formerly cleansed themselves by various washings to prepare themselves for the service of God. It is no wonder that the rites for cleansing were carnal, since the worship of God itself, involved in shadows, as yet partook in a manner of what was carnal."
2. "Away then with all the external washings of the flesh, and cease let the whole apparatus of ceremonies; for the Apostle sets a true heart, and the certainty of faith, and a cleansing from all vices, in opposition to these external rites."
3. "The meaning is, that we are made partakers of Christ, if we come to him, sanctified in body and soul; and yet that this sanctification is not what consists in a visible parade of ceremonies, but that it is from faith, pure conscience, and that cleanness of soul and body which flows from, and is effected by, the Spirit of God."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "In fulness of faith (εν πληροφορια πιστεως)."
