## BHT:
Let us remember to consider one another not just as fellow believers, but as individuals with our own weaknesses and struggles. In doing so, we can show grace and understanding towards one another. This consideration should go beyond mere acknowledgement, but should lead to action - provoking one another to love and good works. We should strive to remind each other of the love and grace that we have received, stirring up a fervent flame of brotherly love within the Christian community.
