# Hebrews 10:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The command is clear: we are not to forsake the gathering of ourselves together for worship, whether in public or private. Instead, we are to exhort one another to faith, love, and good works. This is especially important as we see the day of Christ's coming, whether the immediate reference is to the destruction of Jerusalem or the Second Coming, drawing nearer. We must be diligent in assembling together, encouraging one another as we look forward to that great day.
