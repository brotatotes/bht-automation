# Hebrews 10:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If we sin wilfully and turn away from God, it signifies a total abandonment and apostasy, going against the truth we once embraced. After receiving the experiential knowledge of the gospel, there is no other sacrifice for sins remaining except the one we stubbornly reject. In doing so, we lock ourselves out of salvation and shut off the only way to redemption.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The sin meant by ἁμαρτάνειν is sufficiently defined by the connexion ( γάρ ) with the preceding exhortations, and by the description of one who has so sinned." 
2. "It is most important here to keep this cardinal point distinctly in mind: that the ἑκουσίως ἁμαρτάνοντες are not mere professors of religion, but real converts."
3. "If a man, having availed himself of that One [sacrifice], then deliberately casts it behind him, there is no second left for him. He has in fact, as Del. observes, shut the door of repentance behind him, by the very fact of his being in an abiding state of willing sin."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "A violation not only of the law, but of the whole economy of the New Testament."
2. "To fall away and apostatize to Judaism or infidelity, is not a sin of ignorance, or error of infirmity, but a deliberate sinning against the Spirit."
3. "There is but ONE Sacrifice that can atone for sin; they, after having fully known that sacrifice, deliberately reject it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If after we are converted and become true Christians we should apostatize, it would be impossible to be recovered again, for there would be no other sacrifice for sin; no way by which we could be saved."
2. "The sentiment would not be correct if it referred to any but real Christians. It would not be true that one who had been somewhat enlightened, and who then sinned 'wilfully,' must look on fearfully to the judgment without a possibility of being saved."
3. "Should a man do this, there is no sacrifice for sins which could save him. He would have rejected deliberately the only atonement made for sin, and there will be no other made. It is as if a man should reject the only medicine that could heal him, or push away the only boat that could save him when shipwrecked."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The willful sin is the abandonment of Christianity for Judaism."
2. "The truth is the revelation through Christ."
3. "For the Levitical sacrifices are abolished. It is Christ's sacrifice or none."

### John Calvin:
1. "He shows how severe a vengeance of God awaits all those who fall away from the grace of Christ; for being without that one true salvation, they are now as it were given up to an inevitable destruction."
2. "Those who sin, mentioned by the Apostle, are not such as offend in any way, but such as forsake the Church, and wholly alienate themselves from Christ."
3. "He denies that any sacrifice remains for them who renounce the death of Christ, which is not done by any offense except by a total renunciation of the faith."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The expression seems taken from Numbers 15:30-31, where sinning wilfully is described as doing something presumptuously, with a high hand, and by one who despises the Word of the Lord"
2. "Moreover, it is the state of one who has received the knowledge of the truth, and who knows it to be truth"
3. "They rejected that one sacrifice which completed and ended the sacrifices of the ancient Law, against their better knowledge, and resolved to return to their former sinful life; and for them there is no longer remaining any sacrifice for sin."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "If we sin wilfully...circumstantial participle here in a conditional sense." 
2. "Knowledge... 'Full knowledge,' as in Hebrews 6:4."
3. "There remaineth no more...one has renounced the one and only sacrifice for sin that does or can remove sin."

### John Gill:
1. "For if we sin wilfully...it intends a total apostasy from the truth, against light and evidence, joined with obstinacy." 
2. "After men have embraced and professed the truths of the Gospel, and particularly this great truth of it, that Jesus Christ is the only Savior of men by his blood and sacrifice; and yet after this, against all evidence, all the light and convictions of their own consciences, they wilfully deny this truth, and obstinately persist in the denial of it; seeing there is no more, no other sacrifice for sin, no other Savior, nor any salvation in any other way, the case of these men must be desperate."
3. "They shut up against themselves, in principle and practice, the way of salvation."

### John Wesley:
1. "Sin wilfully - By total apostasy from God, termed 'drawing back'..."
2. "After having received the experimental knowledge of the gospel truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins - None but that which we obstinately reject."
