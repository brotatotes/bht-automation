# Hebrews 10:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Despising the law of Moses meant violating it heinously and entirely. The punishment for such offenses was death, without any mercy or respite. In cases where two or three witnesses appeared to testify against the transgressor, the judgment was final and immediate. This severe punishment serves as a stark illustration of the heavier consequences that await those who reject the gospel, a sin that involves even more impieties. Thus, the rejection of the gospel deserves even greater punishment, given its surpassing dignity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "If Moses’ law could attach to violations of it the inexorable doom of death..."
2. "...such compassion, be it what it might, could not affect his doom..."
3. "...his death is an event contingent on, added to, the fact of two or three witnesses appearing."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Despised - 'set at naught': utterly and heinously violated, not merely some minor detail, but the whole law and covenant."
2. "Died - the normal punishment of such transgression, then still in force."
3. "Without mercy - removal out of the pale of mitigation, or a respite of his doom."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It does not mean that in all cases the offender against the Law of Moses died without mercy, but only where offences were punishable with death."
2. "The subject of apostasy from the Christian religion is particularly under discussion here, and it was natural to illustrate this by a reference to a similar case under the Law of Moses."
3. "The 'principle' in the Law was, that it was to be presumed that two or three persons would be much less likely to conspire to render a false testimony than one would be, and that two or three would not be likely to be deceived in regard to a fact which they had observed."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The phrase N. T. o. For the noun see on 2 Corinthians 1:3."
2. "Under two or three witnesses [επι δυσιν η τρισιν μαρτυσιν] . As in LXX, Deuteronomy 17:6."
3. "Comp. also Deuteronomy 19:15."

### John Calvin:
1. "This is an argument from the less to the greater; for if it was a capital offense to violate the law of Moses, how much heavier punishment does the rejection of the gospel deserve, a sin which involves so many and so heinous impieties!"
2. "They ought then to have acknowledged that vengeance just, however severe, by which God now sanctions the majesty of his Gospel."
3. "Now, though the Law proceeded from God, and Moses was not its author, but its minister, yet the Apostle calls it the law of Moses, because it had been given through him: this was said in order to amplify the more the dignity of the Gospel, which has been delivered to us by the Son of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This awful destiny which awaits wilful apostates, judgment without mercy, is now illustrated and enforced from the law."
2. "Moses’ Law attached to certain violations of it the doom of death." 
3. "Apostasy from Christ answers to the wilful, deliberate idolatry of the Law, and is the sin condemned here with a condemnation proportioned to the fuller light and the greater privileges of the Gospel."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Hath set at naught (αθετησας). First aorist active participle of αθετεω, late compound, very common in LXX, from alpha privative and τιθημ, to render null and void, to set aside, only here in Hebrews (see Mark 7:9), but note αθετησις (Hebrews 7:18; Hebrews 9:26)."
2. "Without mercy (χωρις οικτιρμων). See 2 Corinthians 1:3. This was the law (Deuteronomy 17:6) for apostates."
3. "On the word of two or three (επ δυσιν η τρισιν). 'On the basis of two or three.' For this use of επ with the locative see Hebrews 9:17."

### John Gill:
1. "He that despised Moses' law,.... By breaking it wilfully, and presumptuously, for which there was no sacrifice..."
2. "One that transgressed that law, either in whole, or in part, by denying it entirely, or by breaking any particular precept of it presumptuously, died without mercy..."
3. "Under two or three witnesses; who 'stood by', or were present, as the Arabic version renders it, when the transgression was committed..."

### John Wesley:
1. He that, in capital cases, despised (presumptuously transgressed) the law of Moses died without mercy - Without any delay or mitigation of his punishment.
