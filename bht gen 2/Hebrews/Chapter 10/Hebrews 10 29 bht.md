# Hebrews 10:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He who turns away from the Christian faith deserves a much harsher punishment than one who renounces the Jewish religion. Such apostasy tramples underfoot the Son of God, treating his sacrifice as profane. Rejecting the gifts of the new covenant and despising the work of the Spirit is a grievous insult. This sin of sins, committed by those who persist in their old ways, has no forgiveness. It is a sobering reminder to consider the consequences of turning away from Christ.
