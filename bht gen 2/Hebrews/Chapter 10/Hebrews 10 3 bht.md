# Hebrews 10:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The sacrifices made annually serve as a recollection, reminding the worshipers of their sins committed in the past year, as well as sins from previous years. This highlights the insufficiency and imperfection of these sacrifices. In fact, instead of bringing about oblivion of sins, these sacrifices themselves served as acknowledgments of guilt. They were constant reminders that sins remained and required a more perfect sacrifice.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "in them (the sacrifices: not in the fact of their being offered, but in the course of their being offered on the day of atonement, see below) there is a recollection."
2. "Where sins are continually called to mind, there clearly the conscience is not clear from them."
3. "Several passages occur in Philo closely resembling this: e.g. De Plant. Noë, 25, vol. i. p. 345, βωμοῖς γὰρ ἀπύροις περὶ οὓς ἀρεταὶ χορεύουσι γέγηθεν ὁ θεός, ἀλλʼ οὐ πολλῷ πυρὶ φλέγουσιν, ὅπερ αἱ τῶν ἀνιέρων ἄθυτοι θυσίαι συνανέφλεξαν, ὑπομιμνήσκουσαι τὰς ἑκάστων ἀγνοίας τε καὶ διαμαρτίας."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "A recalling to mind by the high priest's confession, on the day of atonement, of the sins both of each past year and of all former years, proving that the expiatory sacrifices of former years were not felt by men's consciences to have fully atoned for former sins in fact, the expiation and remission were only legal and typical."
2. "The Gospel remission, on the contrary, is so complete, that sins are 'remembered no more' by God."
3. "The believer, once for all bathed, needs only to 'wash' his hands and 'feet' of soils, according as he daily contracts them, in Christ's blood."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "As often as a sacrifice was offered, it was an acknowledgment of guilt on the part of those for whom it was made."
2. "All the efficacy which could be pretended to belong those sacrifices, was that they made expiation for the past year."
3. "These sacrifices, therefore, could not make the atonement which man needed. They could not make the conscience easy; they could not be regarded as a sufficient expiation for the time to come."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A remembrance of sins...Each successive sacrifice was a fresh reminder of sins to be atoned for; so far were the sacrifices from satisfying the conscience of the worshipper."
2. "jAnamnhsiv, lit. a calling to mind."
3. "Comp. ver. 17, and see LXX, Numbers 5:15."

### John Calvin:
1. "Though the Gospel is a message of reconciliation with God, yet it is necessary that we should daily remember our sins."
2. "It is not, then, any kind of remembrance that is here meant, but that which might lead to such a confession of guilt before God, as rendered a sacrifice necessary for its removal."
3. "With whatever masks, then, they may cover their mass, they can never escape the charge of an atrocious blasphemy against Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "There is a remembrance of sins made again every year; of all the sins that were committed the year past, and even of those that were expiated typically by the daily sacrifice, and others that had been offered; which proves the imperfection and insufficiency of such sacrifices."
2. "Legal sacrifices were so far from inducing an oblivion of sins, that they themselves brought them to remembrance, and were so many acknowledgments of them."

1. There is a public commemoration of the sins both of the last and of all the preceding years; a clear proof that the guilt thereof is not perfectly purged away.
