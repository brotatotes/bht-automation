# Hebrews 10:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God, as the God of justice, is patient, but he will not overlook sin indefinitely. The punishment for sin belongs to God alone, who is the ultimate judge. The Lord shall judge his people, and this judgment will be more severe if they rebel against him. It is a solemn truth that falling into the hands of the living God is a fearful thing, and he will discipline and execute justice upon those who deserve it.

### Henry Alford:
1. "To me belongs vengeance, I will repay, says the Lord." 
2. "The Lord will judge His people."
3. "The office of Judge, generally asserted by 'he will judge,' involves all that belongs to a judge."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Vengeance belongeth unto meâ€”Greek, 'To Me belongeth vengeance': exactly according with Paul's quotation..."
2. "Lord shall judge his peopleâ€”in grace, or else anger, according as each deserves: here, 'judge,' so as to punish the reprobate apostate; there, 'judge,' so as to interpose in behalf of, and save His people..."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Vengeance belongeth unto me ... - This is found in Deuteronomy 32:35; see it explained in the notes on Romans 12:19. It is there quoted to show that we should not avenge ourselves; it is here quoted to show that God will certainly inflict punishment on those who deserve it."
2. "The Lord shall judge his people - This is quoted from Deuteronomy 32:36. That is, he will judge them when they deserve it, and punish them if they ought to be punished. The mere fact that they are his people will not save them from punishment if they deserve it, any more than the fact that one is a beloved child will save him from correction when he does wrong."
3. "The same great principle would be applied should any sincere Christian apostatize from his religion. He would have before him the certainty of the most fearful and severe of all punishments."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The retribution is certain, because assured by the word of God in Scripture."
2. "It is the full meting out of justice to all parties."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is the peculiar office of God to take vengeance on the ungodly."
2. "God cannot govern the Church without purifying it, and without restoring to order the confusion that may be in it."
3. "It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This punishment is certain, and is fulfilled and executed by God Himself."
2. "God is Judge, is the first truth; and His judgment will be executed, is the second."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "God is the God of justice. He is patient, but he will punish."
2. "We know him that said...(God lives and is true to his word)."
3. "He quotes Deuteronomy 32:35 (cf. Romans 12:19)."


### John Gill:
1. "Vengeance belongs to God, not as to the affection, as if there was any such passion in him; but as to the effect, there being that produced by him, which answers to the effect of such a passion among men, namely punishment."
2. "Punishment for sin belongs to God, against whom it is committed; and not to Heathen deities, one of which goes by the name of Vengeance, nor to Satan, and his spiteful angels; nor to men, to exercise it in a private and personal way."
3. "The Lord shall judge his people; such as are truly so, his chosen and covenant people, his redeemed and called ones; these he judges by chastising them in a fatherly way, that they may not be condemned with the world; and by governing and protecting them; and by vindicating and pleading their cause, and avenging them on their enemies."

### John Wesley:
1. The Lord will judge his people â€” Yea, far more rigorously than the heathens, if they rebel against him. Deuteronomy 32:35, etc.
