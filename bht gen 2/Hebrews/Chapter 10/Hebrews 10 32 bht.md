### Henry Alford:
1. "But call ever to mind the former days, in which when first enlightened, ye underwent much contest of sufferings."
2. "The genitive may be either subjective, implying that your contest consisted of sufferings; or objective, that it was waged with sufferings, as the foe to be contended against."
3. "The verb may be indicative, but is from the whole cast of the sentence, much more likely imperative."

3. "The fight is that which consists of afflictions."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The object of the apostle now is to remind them that they were sustained under those trials, and he would encourage them now to similar patience by the recollection of the grace then conferred on them."
2. "What was the nature of their former trials, or of what they were then experiencing, is not certainly known. It would seem probable, however, that the reference in both instances is to some form of persecution by their own countrymen."
3. "The meaning is, 'that when we have been enabled to pass through trials once, we are to make the remembrance of the grace then bestowed on us a means of supporting and encouraging us in future trials.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "It is a shameful thing to begin well, and to faint in the middle of our course, and still more shameful to retrograde after having made great progress."
2. "The remembrance then of past warfare, if it had been carried on faithfully and diligently under the banner of Christ, is at length useful to us, not as a pretext for sloth, as though we had already served our time, but to render us more active in finishing the remaining part of our course."
3. "Whenever then those things which we have done or suffered for Christ come to our minds, let them be to us so many goads to stir us on to higher attainments."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Call to remembrance (rather, call up and keep in remembrance) those former days in which, when first enlightened (as in chap. Hebrews 6:4), ye endured, without losing heart or hope (so the word implies), a great fight (a manifest struggle) of suffering."
2. "I.e consisting in suffering, not with suffering as your foe (Hebrews 10:34, where it is said that they suffered with those that were bound)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Call to remembrance (αναμιμνησκεσθε). Present middle imperative of αναμιμνησκω, as in 2 Corinthians 7:15 'remind yourselves.'"
2. "After ye were enlightened (φωτισθεντες). First aorist passive participle of φωτιζω in the same sense as in Hebrews 6:4 (regeneration) and like 'the full knowledge of the truth' in Hebrews 10:26."
3. "Conflict (αθλησιν). Late word from αθλεω, to engage in a public contest in the games (2 Timothy 2:5), only here in the N.T. It occurs in the inscriptions. Cf. Hebrews 2:10 for the benefit of 'sufferings' in training."

### John Gill:
