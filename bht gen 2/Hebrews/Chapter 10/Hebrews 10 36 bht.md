# Hebrews 10:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are called to patiently endure in order to receive the promise of perfect love and eternal life. This promise is not separate from the patient endurance, but rather is received and enjoyed through it. Just as Jesus persevered and completed the will of God, we are called to do the same, knowing that the reward is worth the trials and challenges we may face. By remaining steadfast and relying on the grace of God, we can continue in well-doing and ultimately receive the promised blessings.
