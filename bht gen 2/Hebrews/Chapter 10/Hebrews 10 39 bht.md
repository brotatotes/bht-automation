# Hebrews 10:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
True believers do not draw back or retreat from their faith, but instead hold fast to their belief in God's promises. This faith is not mere intellectual or superficial belief, but a deep and abiding trust in God's power and faithfulness. Through this faith, believers are saved from the destruction that comes from turning away from God. It is through faith that the soul is preserved and saved, as faith connects us to God and enables us to receive his salvation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But we are not of backsliding... unto destruction, but of faith unto the preservation of the soul."
2. "The soul is the subject of life and salvation. Faith saves the soul, by linking it to God, the living One."
3. "The unbelieving man loses his soul: for not being God's, neither is he his own: all that his personality has in itself and round itself, is fallen under wrath and the powers of wrath."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Saving of the soul—literally, 'acquisition (or obtaining) of the soul.' The kindred Greek verb is applied to Christ's acquiring the Church as the purchase of His blood."
2. "If we acquire or obtain our soul's salvation, it is through Him who has obtained it for us by His bloodshedding."
3. "Faith saves the soul by linking it to God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We who are true Christians do not belong to such a class...This should be a means of keeping them in the path to life."
2. "Like that Great Redeemer, let us do the will of God...He came to illustrate the nature of perfect conformity to the will of God."
3. "The Christian has exalted advantages...There is not a Christian so obscure, so poor, so ignorant that he may not come and speak to God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "We are not of shrinking back... We do not partake of drawing back, which is characteristic of recreants." 
2. "Drawing back makes for and terminates in destruction." 
3. "The nature of faith and its fruits as called out by God's revelation from the earliest time."

### John Calvin:
1. "He... teaches them that they had been called for this end, that they might not draw back."
2. "He again sets faith and drawing back in opposition the one to the other, and also the preservation of the soul to its perdition."
3. "We... ought to acknowledge that we have been called in order that we may advance more and more in our obedience to God, and strive constantly to draw nearer to him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We are not of them that draw back unto perdition, but of them that believe."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In contrast to renegades who do flicker and turn back from Christ." 
2. "Predicate genitive of υποστολη, as in Hebrews 12:11, from υποστελλω with same sense here, stealthy retreat in Plutarch, dissimulation in Josephus."
3. "Old word from περιποιεω, to reserve, to preserve (Luke 17:33) to purchase (Acts 20:28)."

### John Gill:
1. "True believers do not, and cannot draw back in this sense; because they are held fast in the arms, and with the cords of everlasting love."
2. "But of them that believe to the saving of the soul; or 'of faith, to the salvation of the soul'; not of faith of miracles, nor of an historical faith; but of that faith, which is the faith of God's elect, is the gift of God, and the operation of his Spirit."
3. "By which a soul sees Christ, goes to him, lays holds on him, commits all to him, and expects all from him: this stands opposed to drawing back; for by faith a man lives, walks, and stands; and with this is connected the salvation of the soul, as opposed to perdition."

### John Wesley:
1. We are not of them who draw back to perdition — Like him mentioned Hebrews 10:38.But of them that believe — To the end, so as to attain eternal life.
