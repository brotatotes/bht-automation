# Hebrews 10:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The blood of animals, such as bulls and goats, could not in itself remove sin. These sacrifices were symbolic and served to remind the faithful Israelites of their need for a true atonement, which would be fulfilled by Christ. The shedding of animal blood was not the instrument of complete vicarious propitiation; rather, it exhibited the necessity of such propitiation. The blood of animals simply could not cleanse the conscience or save sinners from the wrath they deserved. Only through the blood of the true sacrifice, Jesus Christ, can sins be completely taken away and souls be purified.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is impossible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sin."
2. "The Writer by no means denies the typical virtue of the O. T. sacrifices, but asserts that which the schoolmen explained by saying that they wrought remission of sin not ‘propria virtute,’ but ‘per accidens,’ viz. by means of the grace of the true Propitiation which was to come, and of faith directed to it."
3. "And thus only is it said, Leviticus 17:11, that the blood upon the altar makes an atonement for the soul: it was shed, as Ebrard well observes, not as the instrument of complete vicarious propitiation, but as an exhibition of the postulate of vicarious propitiation."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The blood of bulls," &c., sacrificed, had power but it was only in virtue of the power of the one real antitypical sacrifice of Christ; they had no power in themselves; they were not the instrument of perfect vicarious atonement, but an exhibition of the need of it, suggesting to the faithful Israelite the sure hope of coming redemption, according to God's promise."
2. "The blood of beasts could not take away the sin of man. A MAN must do that."
3. "The Greek, "apotíthēmi," is stronger, explaining the weaker word here, 'take away utterly.' The blood of beasts could not take away the sin of man."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was not possible that the blood of these animals should make a complete expiation so as to purify the conscience, and so as to save the sinner from deserved wrath."
2. "But the meaning here is, that there was no efficacy in the blood of a mere animal to wash away a 'moral' offence."
3. "The mere shedding of the blood of an animal never could make the soul pure."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Jews...had in this a symbol and a pledge of the real cleansing."
2. "The blood of the calf represented the blood of Christ."
3. "The power of Christ's blood...is not then right to measure the offering which he has made by the former sacrifices."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The fact is, that the blood of the bullock or of the goat (the sin offering on the Day of Atonement) could not weigh against the guilt of a nation, or even of a single worshipper."
2. "It cancelled ceremonial guilt, not spiritual sin, and gave legal outward purity, not spiritual regeneration."
3. "The annual sacrifice was only a shadow and prophecy of another sacrifice, in which the Divine will was to be perfectly accomplished."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Should take away  (αφαιρειν). Present active infinitive of αφαιρεω. Old verb and common in N.T., only here and Romans 11:27 with "sins". Cf. Hebrews 9:9. 

### John Gill:
1. "It is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins..."
2. "Sin is committed against God, and has an objective infiniteness in it, and therefore can never be atoned for by the blood of such creatures."
3. "What the blood of these creatures could not do, the blood of Christ has done, and does: that takes away sin from the sight of justice, and from the consciences of the saints."

### John Wesley:
1. It is impossible the blood of goats should take away sins — Either the guilt or the power of them.
