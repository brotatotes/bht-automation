# Hebrews 10:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The entrance of Christ into the world signified the incarnation, a special act of love and grace. It was necessary because the animal sacrifices of the Old Testament could not take away sins or fulfill God's will for redemption. Instead, Christ's voluntary self-offering became the perfect sacrifice that fulfilled God's will and atoned for sins. The sentiment that obedience is better than sacrifice is reflected in the understanding that Christ's sacrifice is the final offering desired by God. His sacrifice fulfilled prophecies and brought deliverance from sin for all.
