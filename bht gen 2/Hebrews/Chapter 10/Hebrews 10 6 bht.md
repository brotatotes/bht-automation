# Hebrews 10:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In regards to burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin, God expressed no pleasure in them. These offerings did not take precedence over moral duties and were not accepted by God based on the offerers themselves. The offerings were insufficient to satisfy God's justice, pacify his anger, or atone for sin. Instead, they served as symbols and pointed towards the ultimate sacrifice of God's Son.
