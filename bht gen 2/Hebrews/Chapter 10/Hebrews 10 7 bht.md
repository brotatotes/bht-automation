# Hebrews 10:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ came to fulfill the law and the prophecies written about him in the Scriptures. The volume of the book refers to the entirety of the Old Testament, where it is recorded that he would come to accomplish God's will. This will involved offering himself as a sacrifice, taking the place of the insufficient sacrifices and offerings of the law. Christ's purpose was to bring life and righteousness to humanity through his obedience and sacrifice. His coming was the culmination of God's plan, as evident in the writings of the Old Testament, to redeem and save mankind.
