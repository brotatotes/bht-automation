# Hebrews 10:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the writer repeats the phrase saying above, he is referring to the words of Christ mentioned earlier. By citing the rejection of sacrifices and the acceptance of Christ's self-sacrifice, the writer highlights the insufficiency of all sacrifices offered by humans. This emphasizes the importance of Christ's sacrifice as the ultimate means of atonement. It is evident that these sacrifices, which were part of the specific ordinance of Moses, were inadequate to fully cleanse from sin. However, the writer assures us that through Christ's sacrifice, we can offer spiritual sacrifices that are pleasing to God.
