# Hebrews 11:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Abraham's unwavering faith had its gaze fixed not on the temporary earthly dwelling of tents, but on something greater - a city with deep foundations. This city, built and formed by God Himself, is a symbol of the unshakable promises and love of God. From the beginning of time, God has been preparing and planning this heavenly abode for His people, where the greatness of His glory will be revealed. In contrast to the fleeting nature of earthly things, Abraham looked beyond them with disdain, directing his faith, affection, and deep longing towards the heavenly realm.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The expectation of the literal fulfillment of a promise is one thing: the hopes and prospects and surmises built upon the character of that promise, another. The one is mere belief: the other is faith." 
2. "Of which the architect and master-builder is God." 
3. "As having these foundations, it forms a contrast to the tent, placed on the ground, and easily transported."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The godly patriarchs waited for their city hereafter."
2. "The foundations...which the tents had not, nor even men's present cities have."
3. "The city is worthy of its Framer and Builder."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Phrases like that of 'the city of God,' 'a city with foundations,' 'the new Jerusalem,' and 'the heavenly Jerusalem' in the time of the apostle, appear to have acquired a kind of technical signification. They referred to 'heaven' - of which Jerusalem, the seat of the worship of God, seems to have been regarded as the emblem."
2. "This passage seems to me to prove that Abraham had an expectation of future happiness after death. There is not the slightest evidence that he supposed there would be a magnificent and glorious capital where the Messiah would personally reign, and where the righteous dead, raised from their graves, would dwell in the second advent of the Redeemer."
3. "The language here applied to God as the 'architect' or framer of the universe, is often used in the classic writers. The apostle here commends the faith of Abraham as eminently strong."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Passing over the immediate subject of God's promise to Abraham - his inheritance of the land in which he sojourns - the writer fastens the patriarch's faith upon the heavenly fulfillment of the promise - the perfected community of God, which, he assumes, was contained in the original promise." 
2. "The Rabbins regarded it as an actual city. For the foundations comp. Revelation 21:14."
3. "In ascribing to the patriarchs an assured faith in heaven as the end and reward of their wanderings, the writer oversteps the limits of history; but evidently imports into the patriarchal faith the contents of a later and more developed faith - that of himself and his readers."

### John Calvin:
1. "It was no doubt a great thing to cherish in their hearts the assurance given them by God respecting the possession of the land until it was after some ages realized; yet as they did not confine their thoughts, no, not to that land, but penetrated even into heaven, it was still a clearer evidence of their faith." 
2. "He calls heaven a city that has foundations, because of its perpetuity; for in the world there is nothing but what is transitory and fading." 
3. "Moreover, the Apostle teaches us that all weariness is relieved by expectation, so that we ought never to be weary in following God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For (the reason of his being a sojourner only) he looked, or waited, for a city which hath foundations, whose Builder and Maker is God." 
2. "Abraham’s faith looked forward to a home for himself and his descendants in Canaan, in the earthly Jerusalem, with its foundations in the holy mountains; and then, beyond Canaan and his mortal life, to the heavenly reality, of which Jerusalem was the type a double Jerusalem, the one below and the other above."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He looked for (εξεδεχετο). Imperfect middle of εκδεχομαι (see on Hebrews 10:13) picturesque progressive imperfect, his steady and patient waiting in spite of disappointment."
2. "The foundations (τους θεμελιους). Not just 'tents' (σκηναις, verse Hebrews 11:9). Ahraham set his steady gaze on heaven as his real home, being a mere pilgrim (παροικος) on earth."
3. "Builder (τεχνιτης). Old word from τεχνη (craft) or trade (Acts 17:29; Acts 18:3), craftsman, artificer, in N.T. only here and Acts 19:24; Acts 19:38."

### John Gill:
1. "the 'foundations' of which are the everlasting love of God, eternal election, the covenant of grace, the promise and preparation of it by God, from the foundation of the world, and the Lord Jesus Christ, his blood and righteousness; which show the immovableness of it"
2. "he looked with disdain upon [earthly things], and to heaven with faith, affection, and earnest desire"
3. "God the Father has prepared this glory from the foundation of the world, and has promised before the world began, and has chosen his people to it"

### John Wesley:
1. He looked for a city which hath foundations — Whereas a tent has none.Whose builder and former is God — Of which God is the sole contriver, former, and finisher.
