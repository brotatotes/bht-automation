# Hebrews 11:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
From one, the emphasis being on the singularity of Abraham, sprang there a multitude, even though he and Sarah were as good as dead, being both very old and unable to have children. This multitude was so vast that it was compared to the stars in the sky and the sand on the seashore, just as God had promised to Abraham. This promise has already been fulfilled, and there is still more to come. Despite the seemingly impossible circumstances, Abraham's faith in God's promise was unwavering, and he became the father of many nations through his faith.
