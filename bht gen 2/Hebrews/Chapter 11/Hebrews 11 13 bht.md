# Hebrews 11:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The faithful individuals mentioned in the Bible died in full assurance of faith, even though they did not receive the promised blessings during their lifetime. In death, their faith remained steadfast, as it was the sphere and standard of their characters. They embraced the promises from afar, believing that they would be fulfilled. These believers admitted that they were strangers and sojourners in the world, not being attached to the things of this earthly life. Their faith was strong until the end, embracing the promises of salvation with warmth and cordiality.
