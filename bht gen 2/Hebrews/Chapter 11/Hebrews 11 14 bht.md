# Hebrews 11:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For they express themselves in such a way that it is evident they are not content with their present circumstances; they are in search of a permanent dwelling, a place they can truly call home. Their words reveal their deep longing for a country of their own, a heavenly land where righteousness, rest, and abundant blessings abound. It is a far-off land, yet their firm belief in its reality fuels their hope and continual pursuit.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "they who say such things make manifest...that they seek after a home."
2. "The word in this sense is pure classical Greek: cf. Plato, Soph. p. 244, ὑμεῖς αὐτὰ ἡμῖν ἐμφανίζετε ἱκανῶς, τί ποτε βούλεσθε σημαίνειν, ὁπόταν ὂν φθέγγησθε."
3. "our English word ‘country,’ without some possessive pronoun, does not give the idea strongly enough. Even Bleek, who might have given it, dass sie ein Baterland suchen, has rendered, dass sie nach der Heimath suchen."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For—proof that 'faith' was their actuating principle."
2. "In confessing themselves strangers here, they evidently imply that they regard not this as their home or fatherland, but seek after another and a better."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "They became the purchasers of no land except to bury their dead."
3. "They lived and acted just as if they had not yet found a permanent habitation, but were traveling in search of one."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  A country of their own  (πατριδα). Land of the fathers (πατηρ), one's native land (John 4:44). Cf. our patriotic, patriotism. 

### John Gill:
1. "For they that say such things, declare plainly that they seek a country; heaven, so called, for the largeness of it; it is a good land, a land of uprightness; a pleasant land, a land of rest, though a land afar off."
2. "The act of seeking it supposes some things, with respect to the place where they were, as that they were in a strange land, had no settlement there, nor satisfaction in it, and that they sat loose to the world, and the things of it."
3. "The right way to this country is not mere civility and morality, nor legal righteousness, nor birth privileges, nor submission to outward ordinances, nor a mere profession of religion, but the Lord Jesus Christ; he is the true way to eternal life."

### John Wesley:
1. They who speak thus show plainly that they seek their own country — That they keep in view, and long for, their native home.
