# Hebrews 11:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If the individuals who had left their homeland, such as Abraham leaving Ur of the Chaldeans, had continued to dwell upon their former country and longed for it, they would have had an opportunity to return. However, their decision to become strangers and pilgrims in a land unknown to them was a deliberate choice. As believers, they set their focus on a spiritual realm beyond this world, relinquishing their attachment to the ways of the world. While the possibility of returning may exist, they remain unwavering, pursuing a heavenly country that is far superior to anything the world could offer.

### Henry Alford:
1. "And if indeed they were mindful of that (home) from which they went out, they would continually be having opportunity to return."
2. "The two imperfects in this sentence present some little difficulty. The general rendering of dependent imperfects is as in John 5:46, 'If ye believed Moses, ye would believe me.' So also in Latin: 'If my slaves feared me.... I should think.'"
3. "It would therefore seem that the imperfects are here used not so much in their logical temporal places, as on account of the habitual sense which both members of the sentence are meant to convey."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "As Abraham, had he desired to leave his pilgrim life in Canaan, and resume his former fixed habitation in Ur, among the carnal and worldly..."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "To have returned [Œ±ŒΩŒ±Œ∫Œ±ŒºœàŒ±Œπ] . Rend. 'to return.' Lit. bend their way back again [Œ±ŒΩŒ±]."
