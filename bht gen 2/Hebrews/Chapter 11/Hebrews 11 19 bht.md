# Hebrews 11:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Abraham’s faith enabled him to trust in God's power, despite the seeming impossibility, as he believed that God's promises would be fulfilled. His obedience to offer Isaac demonstrated his unwavering belief in God's command, even though it could be perceived as a terrible act. Abraham's faith was so strong that he believed God would raise his son from the dead. Ultimately, Abraham received Isaac back as if he had been resurrected, symbolizing the likeness to Christ in his death and resurrection.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Abraham’s faith was able, in anticipation, to clear the suspicion of God’s faithfulness by the suggestion of His power."
2. "This clause has been very variously interpreted...of a likeness or figure."
3. "The true identification of the παραβολή is I am persuaded to be found in the figure under which Isaac was sacrificed, viz. the ram...Under the figure of that ram, Isaac was slain, being received back by his father in his proper person, risen from that death which he had undergone ἐν παραβολῇ, in, under, the figure of the ram."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Faith answered the objections which reason brought against God's command to Abraham to offer Isaac, by suggesting that what God had promised He both could and would perform, however impossible the performance might seem."
2. "The quickening of Sarah's dead womb suggested the thought of God's power to raise even the dead, though no instance of it had as yet occurred."
3. "Understanding the figure to be the representation which the whole scene gave to Abraham of Christ in His death (typified by Isaac's offering in intention, and the ram's actual substitution answering to Christ's vicarious death), and in His resurrection (typified by Abraham's receiving him back alive from the jaws of death)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To fulfil these promises, therefore, there was no other way possible but for him to be raised up from the dead, and Abraham fully believed that it would be done."
2. "The strength of his faith was seen in the fact, that, in obedience to the command of God, he resolved to do what in the eyes of the world would be regarded as a most awful crime."
3. "The strength of the faith of Abraham was seen in his belief that God would raise his son from the dead. Of that he had no doubt."

### John Calvin:
1. "Nor did hope disappoint Abraham, for it was a sort of resurrection, when his son was so suddenly delivered from the midst of death." 
2. "The word figure, which is here used, is variously explained. I take it simply as meaning likeness; for though Isaac did not really rise from the dead, yet he seemed to have in a manner risen when he was suddenly and wonderfully rescued through the unexpected favor of God."
3. "Abraham did not receive his Son otherwise than if he had been restored from death to new life."

### John Gill:
1. "Abraham did not go about this affair without thought; and yet he did not consult with flesh and blood; his reasoning was the reasoning of faith." 
2. "He knew that he had received him at first, as it were, from the dead; he sprung from his own dead body, and out of Sarah's dead womb; and though his faith did not prescribe to God, yet as he believed the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead, he might believe that God would raise his son from the dead."
3. "Moreover, Abraham received his son in the similitude of a resurrection; it was as life from the dead; it was like the return of the prodigal."

### John Wesley:
1. "Accounting that God was able even to raise him from the dead — Though there had not been any instance of this in the world."

3. "He did receive him — Afterwards, snatched from the jaws of death."
