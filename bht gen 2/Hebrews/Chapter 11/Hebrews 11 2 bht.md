# Hebrews 11:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This chapter summarizes the experiences and trials of the ancients in the Old Testament. It is noteworthy that these elders endured long periods of patient waiting, while others faced intense but brief trials. They all received a good testimony, not only from God, but also from God. Their faith in God's testimony enabled them to embrace the promises and live in the reality of what was unseen. The apostle urges the Hebrews to look to these ancient examples and emulate their faith, rather than holding on to traditional elders who gained their reputation through human traditions rather than faith.
