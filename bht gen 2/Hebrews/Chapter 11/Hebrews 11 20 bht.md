## BHT:
Isaac, by faith, blessed Jacob and Esau, speaking prophetically about future blessings. Although Esau was the elder, Isaac gave preference to Jacob, foreseeing the specific blessings that each would receive. Isaac's act of faith was not limited to the present circumstances but extended to the future, understanding the significance of the blessings he pronounced. This reminds us that faith has the power to speak and believe in things that are yet to come.
