# Hebrews 11:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Joseph, even in his death, expressed his faith and belief in the promises of God. He knew that Egypt was not his true home and that his descendants would one day be delivered from their bondage and brought into the land of Canaan. In accordance with this belief, Joseph commanded that his bones be carried out of Egypt and buried in the land of promise. This act not only demonstrated his conviction in the future fulfillment of God's promises, but also served as a reminder and encouragement to his people to continue to hope and trust in the Lord.
