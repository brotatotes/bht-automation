# Hebrews 11:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parents of Moses were guided by their unwavering faith in God to hide him for three months, defying the command of the king. Their actions were driven by their belief that Moses was destined for a significant purpose, despite the circumstances and the king's orders. Their faith was rewarded, showing us the power of even weak faith, and the importance of trusting in God's promises. The child's beauty itself may have been a sign of divine approval and a confirmation of their faith.

1. "By faith Moses when born was hidden three months by his parents." 
2. "Their faith was loving trust in God who had given them so fair a child, which led them to perform as far as in them lay, the duties of parents to it, and not the cruel part which the tyrant prescribed."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The statement of the apostle here is, that his parents were led to preserve his life by their confidence in God."
2. "They believed that he was destined to some great purpose, and that he would be spared, notwithstanding all the probabilities against it, and all the difficulties in the case."
3. "The strength of the faith of the parents of Moses, appears... Because the command of Pharaoh to destroy all the male children was positive, but they had so much confidence in God as to disregard it."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "The parents of Moses were induced to save him... even for this, — that as God had promised to them, under their oppression, that there would come some time a deliverer, they relied confidently on that promise, and preferred the safety of the infant to their own."
2. "There was some mark, as it were, of future excellency imprinted on the child, which gave promise of something extraordinary... they considered that the child was destined for the performance of great things."
3. "Their faith in a short time not only wavered, but wholly failed; at least they neglected their duty when they cast forth the infant on the bank of the river. But it behaves us to be more encouraged when we hear that their faith, though weak, was yet so approved by God as to secure that life to Moses, on which depended the deliverance of the Church."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Thus far the writer has been dealing with examples of faith in Genesis alone."
2. "The examples are few compared with all recorded in that book, but they are very striking and noble."
3. "From the first he was a child of faith. His parents hid him three months, noting his comeliness (Acts 7:20), and hoping apparently that God might use him as He had used Joseph, to be the deliverer of their people."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The child was goodly" (αστειον το παιδιον). Old adjective from αστυ (city), "of the city" ("citified"), of polished manners, genteel. In N.T. only here and Acts 7:20, about Moses both times.
2. "Quoted from Exodus 2:2  The king's commandment" (το διαταγμα του βασιλεως). Late compound for injunction from διατασσω, only here in the N.T.

### John Gill:
1. "Parents ought to take care of their children; and persons may lawfully hide themselves, or others, from the cruelty of tyrants, and that as long as they can, for their safety; and this was so far from being wrong in the parents of Moses, that it is commended, as an instance of faith."
2. "They believed the promise in general, that God would deliver the people of Israel; they believed this to be about the time of their deliverance, and had some intimation, that this child in particular would be the deliverer."
3. "There is a great deal of courage and boldness in faith; and though faith may be weakened, it cannot be lost; and a weak faith is taken notice of, as here."

### John Wesley:
1. They saw — Doubtless with a divine presage of things to come.
