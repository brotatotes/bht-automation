# Hebrews 11:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He chose to identify with his own people instead of enjoying the privileges and luxuries of being associated with Pharaoh's household. This decision demonstrated his great faith in God and his willingness to prioritize the well-being of the Israelites over his own worldly honor and interests. Moses believed in God's promises and valued the afflictions and reproaches that came with being an Israelite more than the sinful pleasures and earthly riches offered by the court.
