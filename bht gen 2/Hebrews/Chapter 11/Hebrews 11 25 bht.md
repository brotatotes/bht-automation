# Hebrews 11:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Choosing to suffer affliction with the people of God is a deliberate decision that reflects the presence of God among them and the plentiful provisions of grace within their community. Moses intentionally chose to share in the afflictions of his people and to empathize with them. This choice is motivated by the nature of afflictions themselves, which have been ordained by God for the sake of his name and the ultimate good and glory of his people.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to possess a temporary enjoyment of sin."
2. "The possession of affliction (with God’s people), to the possession of the enjoyment of sin."
3. "Thus we have αἱ τῶν ἀφροδισίων ἀπολαύσεις, Xen. Hier. i. 26: σίτων καὶ ποτῶν ἀπόλαυσις, id. Mem. ii. i. 33 al. And I do not see how the other view accords with the anarthrous ἀπόλαυσιν."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He balanced the best of the world with the worst of religion, and decidedly chose the latter."
2. "Choosing implies a deliberate resolution, not a hasty impulse."
3. "If religion bring with it 'affliction,' it too is but for a season; whereas its 'pleasures are for evermore.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Moses saw that if he cast in his lot with them, he must expect trials... yet he 'chose' this. He on the whole preferred it... because he deliberately preferred to share the trials and sorrows of the friends of God."
2. "Every one who becomes a friend of God and casts in his lot with his people... prefers this to all the pleasures of a life of gaiety and sin, and to the most brilliant prospects of wealth and fame which this world can offer."
3. "In view of all the 'pleasures' which sin can furnish, and in view of the most brilliant prospects which this world can hold out, religion enables man to pursue a different path... Religion, with all its privations and sacrifices, is preferred, nor is there ever occasion to regret the choice."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "To suffer affliction with... "to be evil entreated."
2. "Than to have temporary enjoyment of sin."
3. "The emphasis is first on temporary and then on sin."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Choosing rather (μαλλον ελομενος). 'Rather having chosen' (second aorist middle of αιρεω, to take for oneself a position)."
2. "To be entreated with (συνκακουχεισθα). Present passive infinitive of the double compound συνκακουχεω (from συν, κακοσ, εχω), to treat ill with (associative instrumental case), only known example save one in the papyri (second century A.D.), though κακουχεω in Hebrews 11:37; Hebrews 13:3."
3. "To enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season (προσκαιρον εχειν αμαρτιας απολαυσιν). Literally, 'to have temporary pleasure of sin.' Απολαυσις is old word from απολαυω, to enjoy, in N.T. only here and 1 Timothy 6:17. Προσκαιρος (from προσ, καιρος) is a common Koine word as the antithesis to αιωνιος (eternal) as in Matthew 13:21; Mark 4:17; 2 Corinthians 4:18 (only N.T. examples)."

### John Gill:
1. "Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God... because God is with them; his word and ordinances are with them; there are large provisions of grace in the midst of them; so that it is profitable, delightful, and honourable, to be among them, and is attended with comfort, peace, and satisfaction..."
2. "Moses chose to suffer these with them, to suffer the same afflictions they did, and to sympathize with them..."
3. "...the reasons which might induce Moses, and so every good man, to such a choice, may be taken partly from the nature of afflictions themselves, which are such that God has chosen for them, and appointed them unto, and which he gives them to suffer for his name, and which are an honour to them, and issue in their good, and in the glory of God..."
