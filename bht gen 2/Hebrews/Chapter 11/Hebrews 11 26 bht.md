# Hebrews 11:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Moses, as one of the Old Testament saints, experienced reproach for his belief in the Messiah and his faithful actions. This reproach, which he bore willingly and cheerfully, is directly linked to the reproach that Christ himself endured. Moses recognized the fleeting nature of earthly treasures and hardships and instead focused his gaze on the ultimate reward, a future state of heavenly happiness. Through his unwavering faith and willingness to endure reproach, Moses valued the riches found in his relationship with Christ above any earthly possessions.
