# Hebrews 11:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He did not fear the wrath of the king when he left Egypt with the Israelites. This demonstrates his faith in God's protection and guidance. This act of courage and trust in God's command was not something new for Moses, as he had already faced the wrath of the king years prior. In times of uncertainty and opposition, Moses relied on his faith in God's promises and power.

3. "We hence learn, that the true character of faith is to set God always before our eyes; secondly, that faith beholds higher and more hidden things in God than what our senses can perceive; and thirdly, that a view of God alone is sufficient to strengthen our weakness, so that we may become firmer than rocks to withstand all the assaults of Satan."
