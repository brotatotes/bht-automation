# Hebrews 11:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By faith, Moses instituted and celebrated the Passover, trusting in God's promise that the destroying angel would spare the blood-sprinkled houses. His faith extended beyond mere observance, as he believed in the unseen benefit of the Passover. His act of faith was notable, given the challenging circumstances surrounding his mission to deliver the Hebrew people. Through his unwavering trust in God, Moses found hope amidst the difficulties and uncertainties. The pouring and sprinkling of the blood in the Passover ritual prefigured the cleansing and purification that believers would experience through the blood of Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "By faith he hath celebrated the Passover and the affusion of the blood, that he who destroyed the firstborn might not touch them."
2. "The verb ὀλεθρεύειν is Alexandrine, and with its compound ἐξ ολ - frequently found in the LXX."
3. "The common construction of θιγγάνω is with the partitive genitive: it is (reff.) of rare use in the Greek Scriptures."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "His
faith here was his belief in the invisible God's promise that
the destroying angel should pass over, and not touch
the inmates of the blood-sprinkled houses."
2. "He acquiesced in the bare word of God where the
thing itself was not apparent."
3. "the first-born—Greek
neuter; both of man and beast."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He made the passover, which means more, it seems to me, than that he merely kept or celebrated it. It implies that he instituted this rite, and made the arrangements for its observance."
2. "The strength of his faith may be seen by a reference to some of the circumstances which characterized it... Moses, in the maturity of life, and with everything around him that is usually regarded by people as objects of ambition, was ready to forego it all."
3. "If there ever was any undertaking commenced opposed to every human probability of success, it was that of delivering the Hebrew people and conducting them to the promised land. In all the difficulties and discouragements of the undertaking of Moses, therefore, his only hope of success must have arisen from his confidence in God."

### John Calvin:
1. "But, he says, that it was kept by faith, not because the Paschal lamb was a type of Christ, but because its benefit did not appear, when he sprinkled the doorposts with blood: when therefore the effect was yet hid, it was necessarily looked for by faith."
2. "Hence the Apostle justly commends his faith in this respect."
3. "Therefore out of place here are philosophical refinements."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He kept (πεποιηκεν). Perfect active indicative of ποιεω, to make, 'he has made,' emphasizing the permanent nature of the feast."
2. "The sprinkling of the blood (την προσχυσιν του αιματος). Rather, 'the pouring of the blood' (προσχυσις from προσχεω, to pour upon), only here in the N.T."
3. "That the destroyer of the first-born should not touch them (ινα μη ο ολοθρευων τα πρωτοτοκα θιγη αυτων). Negative final clause with ινα μη and the second aorist active subjunctive of θιγγανω, old verb to touch with genitive, in the N.T. only here, Hebrews 12:20; Colossians 2:21."

### John Gill:
1. "Through faith he kept the passover...in the faith of the Messiah, of whom the passover was a type." 
2. "The sprinkling of blood...was done with a bunch of hyssop dipped into it:lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them."
3. "This was typical of the blood of Christ being sprinkled upon the hearts and consciences of his people; whereby they are purified through faith."

### John Wesley:
1. The pouring out of the blood — Of the paschal lamb, which was sprinkled on the door-posts, lest the destroying angel should touch the Israelites. Exodus 12:12-18.
