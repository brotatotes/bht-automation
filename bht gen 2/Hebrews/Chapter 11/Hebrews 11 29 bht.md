# Hebrews 11:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By faith, Moses, Aaron, and the Israelites crossed the Red Sea as if it were dry land, trusting in God's promise to deliver them. The Egyptians, however, attempted to do the same but were drowned. The Red Sea, which they crossed, is symbolically tied to Edom, meaning red. These examples from Genesis, Exodus, and the Prophets illustrate the importance of faith in God's promises and the consequences of presumptuous actions.
