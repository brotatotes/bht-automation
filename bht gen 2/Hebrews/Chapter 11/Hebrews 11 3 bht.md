# Hebrews 11:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By faith, we comprehend the profound truth that the universe, both visible and invisible, was skillfully fashioned and completed by God. This understanding aligns with the belief of the Jews, who attribute the creation of all things to the powerful Word of God. The worlds were not formed from pre-existent matter but emerged from nothingness, transforming the disorderly chaos described in Genesis 1:2. This faith in the creation serves as the fundamental and representative paradigm for all faith, demonstrating our trust in the unseen foundations of God's marvelous work.
