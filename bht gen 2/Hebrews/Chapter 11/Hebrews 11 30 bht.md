# Hebrews 11:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By the faith of Joshua, the walls of Jericho fell down. This remarkable event was not the result of any natural cause, but a supernatural act that can only be attributed to the power of God. It serves as a powerful emblem of the fall of the walls of unregenerate hearts, representing their unbelief, hardness, enmity, and false confidence. Just as the walls of Jericho crumbled at the command of God, so too can strongholds of sin and darkness be broken when we put our faith in Him.
