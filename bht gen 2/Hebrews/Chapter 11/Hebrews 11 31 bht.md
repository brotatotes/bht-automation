## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "By faith Rahab the harlot did not perish with them who were disobedient, having received the spies with peace." 
2. "The last example is one connected with the taking of Jericho, just mentioned." 
3. "Rahab the harlot did not perish with them who were disobedient, having received the spies with peace."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Rahab showed her 'faith' in her confession, Joshua 2:9; Joshua 2:11, 'I know that Jehovah hath given you the land; Jehovah your God, is God in heaven above, and in earth beneath.'"
2. "Her former life adds to the marvel of her repentance, faith, and preservation (Matthew 21:31; Matthew 21:32)."
3. "Thus Paul, quoting the same examples (Hebrews 11:17; Hebrews 11:31) for the power of faith, as James (James 2:21; James 2:25) does for justification by works evidentially, shows that in maintaining justification by faith alone, he means not a dead faith, but 'faith which worketh by love'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "By faith the harlot Rahab...saved them by concealment from the enemies...For this act of hospitality and kindness, they assured her of safety when the city should be destroyed." 
2. "The main difficulty has been that a woman of this character should be enumerated among those who were eminent for piety...The usual and the fair meaning of the word is what is given in our translation, and there is no good reason why that signification should not be retained here."
3. "This case - supposing that she had been a woman of bad character, but now was truly converted - does not stand alone...This record, therefore, is one of encouragement for the most abandoned sinners...we should never despair of saving the most abandoned of our race."

### John Calvin:
1. "He now teaches us that an alien woman, not only of a humble condition among her own people, but also a harlot, had been adopted into the body of the Church through faith."
2. "It hence follows that those who are most exalted are of no account before God, unless they have faith; and that, on the other hand, those who are hardly allowed a place among the profane and the reprobate are by faith introduced into the company of angels."
3. "The evidence of her faith was that she received the spies at the peril of her life: then, by means of faith, she escaped safe from the ruin of her own city."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Nor does previous personal character hinder its power, or previous separation from the covenant people."
2. "Her faith showed its reality in her receiving and protecting the spies, and found its reward in her preservation, and finally in her becoming an ancestress of our Lord."
3. "A careful attention to the tenses, and to the absence of the article whereby this clause is closely connected with the preceding, would be sufficient of itself to reconcile the teaching of Paul and James."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Having received the spies with peace." (Œ¥ŒµŒæŒ±ŒºŒµŒΩŒ∑ œÑŒøœÖœÇ Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±œÉŒ∫ŒøœÄŒøœÖœÇ ŒºŒµœÑ' ŒµŒπœÅŒ∑ŒΩŒ∑œÇ)

### John Gill:
1. "This woman was a wonderful and singular instance of the free, sovereign, distinguishing, powerful, and efficacious grace of God."
2. "Her receiving the spies was an emblem of a soul's receiving the Gospel, and the ministers of it; the scarlet thread, that was hung out, was an emblem of the blood of Christ, by which sins, though as scarlet, are made white as wool."
3. "The saving of her whole family is an emblem of the complete salvation of all the elect, soul and body, by Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. Rahab ‚Äî Though formerly one not of the fairest character.
