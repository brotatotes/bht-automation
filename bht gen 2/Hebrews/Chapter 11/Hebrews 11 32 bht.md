# Hebrews 11:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The author, in awe of the countless examples of faith, struggles to find the words to fully describe them. From the time between Joshua and David, where judges led the people, to the prophets, faith is found in imperfect individuals who showed remarkable confidence in God. Even in the midst of their flaws, their reliance on God's strength was evident. Samuel, a prophet and judge, is mentioned last to connect him with the other prophets. This list of heroes of faith is just a glimpse into the rich tapestry of believers throughout history.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "What am I saying, going to say, more," is tantamount to "what shall I say more."
2. "The time will fail me, narrating concerning Gideon and Barak and Samson and Jephthah and David and Samuel and the prophets."
3. "Barak was not so strong in faith as he might have been, though he did believe, and go to the fight, and triumph."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He accumulates collectively some out of many examples of faith."
2. "Gideon—put before Barak, not chronologically, but as being more celebrated."
3. "The mention of Jephthæ as an example of 'faith,' makes it unlikely he sacrificed the life of his daughter for a rash vow."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "All that he commands is his faith, and though he was a very imperfect man, and there were many things in his life which neither sound morality nor religion can approve, yet it was still true that he evinced, on some occasions, remarkable confidence in God, by relying on the strength which he gave him."
2. "He commends only one thing - their faith; and in these instances he particularly alludes, doubtless, to their remarkable valor and success in delivering their country from their foes and from the foes of God."
3. "The single reason why the piety of Jephtha has ever been called in question has been the fact that he sacrificed his own daughter. If he did not do that, no one will doubt his claims to an honored rank among those who have evinced faith in God."

### John Calvin:
1. "He first refers to the time that intervened between Joshua and David, when the Lord raised up judges to govern the people." 
2. "Thus, in all the saints, something reprehensible is ever to be found; yet faith, though halting and imperfect, is still approved by God." 
3. "Since all these things were done by faith, we must feel convinced, that in no other way than by faith is God’s goodness and bounty to be communicated to us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The groups named in this verse are really two; and though there are various readings as to the connecting particles, they necessitate no change."
2. "Samuel is probably put last to connect his name with the prophets, to which class he belongs (see Acts 3:23)."
3. "Gideon and Samson are probably put before Barak and Jephthah respectively, because they are of greater celebrity as men of faith."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

3. "He mentions six names... and then summarizes the rest under 'the prophets' of whom Samuel was the leader."

### John Gill:
1. "And what shall I more say,.... Intimating he had said enough to prove the definition of faith he had given; and that the elders, by it, had obtained a good report; and yet he had not said all he could; and that he had so much to say, that he could not say all..."
2. "...the number of believers, under the Old Testament, was very large..."
3. "...David also; a man after God's own heart, raised up to fulfill his will; whose faith appeared in his dependence on God, when he fought with Goliath; in encouraging himself in the Lord his God, when in exile and distress; and in believing his interest in the covenant of grace, when his house and family were in a disagreeable situation, and he just going out of the world..."
