## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "These words διὰ πίστεως, apply to the whole sentence as far as ἀλλοτρίων Hebrews 11:34. διὰ πίστεως instead of πίστει for the first time in the chapter, suits perhaps better the miscellaneous verbs of predication which follow, e. g. ἔσβεσαν δύναμιν πυρός."
   
2. "The acts referred to may be Gideon’s victory over the Midianites (Judges 7:0), Barak’s over the Canaanites (Judges 9:0), Samson’s over the Philistines (Judges 14 ff.), Jephthah’s over the Ammonites (Judges 9:0.), David’s over the Philistines (2 Samuel 5:17-25; 2Sa 8:1; 2 Samuel 21:15 ff.), Moabites, Syrians, Edomites (ib. 2 Samuel 8:2 ff.), Ammonites (2 Samuel 10:12, ff.))."
