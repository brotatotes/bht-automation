# Hebrews 11:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who quenched the violence of fire, like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, demonstrated the triumph over the flames, a testimony of their faith. They escaped the edge of the sword, just as numerous biblical figures, including Lot, Abraham, Moses, and David, experienced divine protection. These individuals were not destroyed by the sword, a sign of God's intervention. Moreover, out of weakness, believers were made strong, enabling them to conquer challenges and grow in faith and grace.
