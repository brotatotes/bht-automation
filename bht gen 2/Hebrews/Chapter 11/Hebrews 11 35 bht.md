# Hebrews 11:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By faith, women experienced the miraculous restoration of their loved ones who had died. We see this in the accounts of Elijah and Elisha, who, in response to the trust and confidence these women displayed, brought their dead children back to life. Meanwhile, there were others who were subjected to intense torture, yet they refused to accept deliverance on sinful terms. Their unwavering faith enabled them to endure suffering, as they longed for a superior, eternal resurrection and a greater reward. Their stories serve as a powerful testament to the hope and strength that faith brings.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Women received their dead by resurrection."
2. "Others were broken on the wheel, not accepting the deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection."
3. "Those sons were raised by a kind of resurrection to a life which should again end in death: but these expected a glorious resurrection to endless life."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Christ, in  :-, makes especial mention of the fact that Elijah was sent to an alien from Israel, a woman of Sarepta. Thus Paul may quote this as an instance of Elijah's faith, that at God's command he went to a Gentile city of Sidonia (contrary to Jewish prejudices), and there, as the fruit of faith, not only raised her dead son, but received her as a convert into the family of God."
2. "tortured—"broken on the wheel." Eleazar (2 Maccabees 6:18, end; 2 Maccabees 19:20,30). The sufferer was stretched on an instrument like a drumhead and scourged to death."
3. "a better resurrection—than that of the women's children 'raised to life again'; or, than the resurrection which their foes could give them by delivering them from death."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Women received their dead raised to life again - As in the case of the woman of Zarephath, whose child was restored to life by Elijah... and of the son of the Shunamite woman whose child was restored to life by Elisha" 
2. "The punishment here referred to seems to have consisted of two things - the stretching upon the instrument, and the scourging"
3. "To have accepted deliverance then, would have been a kind of restoration to life, or a species of resurrection. But they refused this, and looked forward to a more honorable and glorious restoration to life; a resurrection, therefore, which would be better than this."

### John Calvin:
1. "The victory of faith appears more splendid in the contempt of death than if life were extended to the fifth generation."
2. "The sum of the whole is, that the fortitude of the saints, which has shone forth in all ages, was the work of faith; for our weakness is such that we are not capable of overcoming evils, except faith sustains us."
3. "If, then, we imitate their faith, we shall never basely break down through sloth or listlessness."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "By a resurrection (εξ αναστασεως)." 
2. "Were tortured (ετυμπανισθησαν). First aorist passive indicative of τυμπανιζω, late verb from τυμπανον (kettledrum, drumstick), to beat the drum, to beat to death (cf. II Macc. 7 about Eleazar and the Mother and the seven sons), once in LXX (1 Samuel 21:13)." 
3. "That they might obtain a better resurrection (ινα κρειττονος αναστασεως τυχωσιν). Purpose clause with ινα and the second aorist active subjunctive of τυγχανω to obtain with the genitive case. A 'better resurrection' than the temporary ones alluded to in this verse by the women."

### John Gill:
1. "Women received their dead raised to life again... Their sons were really dead, and they received them alive again, from the hands of the prophets, Elijah and Elisha, in the way of a resurrection, and by faith."
2. "Others were tortured... referring to the sufferings of seven brethren, and their mother, in the times of Antiochus, recorded in 2 Maccabees 7 as appears from the kind of torment endured by them; from the offer of deliverance rejected by them; and from their hope of the resurrection."
3. "The resurrection of the saints, which is unto everlasting life, is a better resurrection than mere metaphorical, and figurative ones, as deliverances from great afflictions, which are called deaths; or real ones, which were only to a mortal state, and in order to die again, as those under the Old Testament, and under the New, before the resurrection of Christ; or than the resurrection of the wicked."

### John Wesley:
1. "From those who acted great things the apostle rises higher, to those who showed the power of faith by suffering."
2. "Not accepting deliverance - on sinful terms."
3. "That they might obtain a better resurrection - a higher reward, seeing the greater their sufferings the greater would be their glory."
