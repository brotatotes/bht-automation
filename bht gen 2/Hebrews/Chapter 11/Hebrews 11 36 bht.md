# Hebrews 11:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Other believers experienced mocking and scourgings as a result of their faith. This kind of suffering was a common form of punishment for those who stood firm in their beliefs. These trials served to test their faith and endurance, and yet they patiently endured them, allowing their character to be refined through the process. It is important for us to recognize and honor the experiences of these faithful individuals, as they provide us with powerful examples of steadfastness in the face of persecution.
