# Hebrews 11:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The faithful endured various forms of persecution. Some, like Zechariah and Isaiah, were stoned and sawn asunder, demonstrating the cruelty of their oppressors. Jerusalem itself was known for stoning the prophets sent to her. Others faced temptations to abandon their faith, whether from God, the devil, or cruel tyrants. They were subjected to threatenings, reproaches, tortures, and promises, but through their unwavering faith, they triumphed over all trials and remained steadfast until the end.
