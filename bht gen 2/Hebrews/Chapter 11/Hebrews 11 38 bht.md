# Hebrews 11:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The world, by persecuting the faithful, proves itself unworthy of their presence. It condemns itself by condemning them. Just as the geography of the Holy Land provided shelter for the persecuted, the godly find consolation in knowing that the prophets also faced rejection. They sought refuge in caves and holes, demonstrating their elevated character and the wickedness of the world. Even though cast out by the world, the servants of God bring with them His blessings like a sweet fragrance, enriching the lives of those they encounter.
