# Hebrews 11:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice than Cain because he offered it with faith, acknowledging his sin and seeking God's mercy. The witness to Abel's righteousness was not solely based on his offering, but on his unwavering trust in the righteousness of Christ. Even though Abel is no longer alive, his faith still speaks, reminding us that our own works cannot please God apart from His favor. We can learn from Abel's example to offer our sacrifices with genuine hearts and to rely on the righteousness of Christ in our pursuit of pleasing God.

2. "True piety is the occasion of transmitting a good report - or an honorable reputation, even down to the latest generation."
3. "The faith of Abel here commended, will be seen by a reference to a few circumstances: It was manifested shortly after the apostasy, and not long after the fearful sentence had been pronounced in view of the sin of man. There was then little truth revealed, and only the slightest intimation of mercy. Abel had an older brother, undoubtedly an infidel, a scoffer, a mocker of religion."

### John Gill:
1. "The superior excellency of Abel's sacrifice to Cain's, lay both in the matter, and in the manner of it; the one was offered heartily to the Lord, the other only in show; the one was offered in faith, the other not; Abel looked through his sacrifice to the sacrifice of Christ, not so Cain."
2. "By which he obtained witness that he was righteous; not righteous by his offering, nor by his faith, but by the righteousness of Christ, which his faith in his sacrifice looked unto."
3. "And by it, he being dead, yet speaketh; good men die, and some of them die a violent death, as did Abel, yet he speaks in the Scriptures, which have a voice in them...or rather by, or because of his faith, though he is dead, 'he is yet spoken of', as the word may be rendered."
