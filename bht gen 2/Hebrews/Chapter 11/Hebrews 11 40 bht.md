# Hebrews 11:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God, in His wisdom and love, has provided something better for us in the form of everlasting glory. This provision is not exclusive to us but also includes the Old Testament saints, as they were waiting for the fulfillment of God's promises just as we are. It is through the sacrifice and righteousness of Christ that both the Old Testament saints and us are perfected and brought into the fullness of God's glory.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Having provided, from far, concerning us, something better."
2. "The design of God in this provision of something better for us was, that they, the O.T. saints, should not be perfected without us, i.e. independently of the N.T. salvation of which we are partakers, cut off from Christ’s universal Church of which we are members."
3. "Their perfection was dependent on our perfection: their and our perfection was all brought in at the same time."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "They had not in this world, 'apart from us' (so the Greek is for 'without us,' that is, they had to wait for us for), the clear revelation of the promised salvation actually accomplished, as we now have it in Christ..." (Hebrews 11:40).
2. "The connection is, You, Hebrews, may far more easily exercise patience than Old Testament believers; for they had much longer to wait, and are still waiting until the elect are all gathered in; you, on the contrary, have not to wait for them" (Hebrews 11:39).
3. "Though the Old Testament worthies attained such eminence by faith, they are not above us in privileges, but the reverse. It is not we who are perfected with them, but rather they with us. They waited for His coming; we enjoy Him as having come" (Hebrews 11:40).

### Albert Barnes:
1. "God having provided, or determined on giving some better thing than any of them realized, and which we are now permitted to enjoy."
2. "The whole system of revelation was not complete at once, or in one generation. It required successive ages to make the system complete, so that it might be said that it was finished, or perfect."
3. "These invaluable records are adapted to sustain us in times of trial, temptation, and persecution; to show us what faith has done in days that are past, and what it may do still in similar circumstances."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "God having provided... Something better, the better promises." 
2. "This glorious and gracious purpose of God is not due to any special merit in us. It is simply the fulness of the time in God's dispensation of grace of which we are the beneficiaries." 
3. "But all the same and all the more, we should prove worthy of our heritage and of God's goodness to us and be loyal to Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "Jesus Christ was the same in the yesterday of the Old Testament, as he is in the present day of the Gospel dispensation; he was slain from the foundation of the world; and the saints then were saved as now, by his grace and righteousness."
2. "We have a better covenant, or a better administration of the covenant of grace; we have a better priesthood, and a better sacrifice; the Gospel is dispensed in a better manner, more dearly and fully."
3. "The Old Testament saints are perfectly justified, perfectly sanctified, and perfectly glorified; but their perfection was not by the law, which made nothing perfect, but by Christ, and through his sacrifice, blood, and righteousness."

### John Wesley:
1. God having provided some better thing for us — Namely, everlasting glory.That they might not be perfected without us — That is, that we might all be perfected together in heaven.
