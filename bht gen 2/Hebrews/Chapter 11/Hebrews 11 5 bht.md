# Hebrews 11:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By faith, Enoch was translated so that he should not see death. This means that he did not experience death or stay in the land of the living. His removal from earth, witnessed by his absence among men, is a powerful demonstration that the saints will exist in the afterlife. It proves the possibility of such a translation for every believer. While divine interposition is awe-inspiring, the regular operation of natural laws is preferable. Enoch's translation, therefore, serves as a testimony to the doctrine of eternal life and the faith that can please God.

### John Calvin:

3. "Let it suffice us to know, that their translation was a sort of extraordinary death; nor let us doubt but that they were divested of their mortal and corruptible flesh, in order that they might, with the other members of Christ, be renewed into a blessed immortality."

### John Gill:
1. "By faith Enoch was translated,.... Which is to be understood, not of a spiritual translation from the power of darkness, into the kingdom of Christ, as all converted, persons are translated...but of a translation from earth to heaven...which is a pledge of the resurrection of the dead, and a proof of the Old Testament saints knowing, expecting, and enjoying eternal life."
2. "And with this agrees the sense of some of the Jewish writers concerning this affair...'and Enoch worshipped in truth before the Lord; and behold he was not with the inhabitants of the earth, אתנגיד, 'he was translated', and ascended to the firmament (or heaven), by the Word before the Lord.'"
3. "...And it is the sense of several of the Jewish commentators, that he did die a common death, as Jarchi, Eben Ezra, and others; who by the phrase, 'God took him', understand death..." (146 words)

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Was translated... that he should not see death." 
2. "He was not found... was still not found." 
3. "He hath had witness borne him... he has been testified to."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That he should not see death - That is, that he should not experience death, or be made personally acquainted with it...And was not found - Genesis 5:24, 'And he was not.' That is, he was not in the land of the living."
2. "His removal is, in itself, a very important and instructive fact in history...It furnishes a demonstration of the doctrine that the saints will exist hereafter, which meets all the arguments of the skeptic and the infidel."
3. "The removal of Enoch shows that the same thing would be 'possible' in the case of every saint... it is better to have the laws of nature regularly operating, than to have them constantly set aside by divine interposition."
