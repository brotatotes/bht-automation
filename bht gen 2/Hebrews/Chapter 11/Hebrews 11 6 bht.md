# Hebrews 11:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is impossible to please God without faith, for it is through faith that we come to Him and believe in His existence. We must have confidence in His faithfulness, truth, and promises as we draw near to Him. Without this belief, we cannot truly experience His presence and the reward that comes from seeking Him diligently. Only through genuine faith can we find favor with Him and receive the blessings He has prepared for those who trust in Him.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "Works not rooted in God are splendid sins."
3. "The reward is God Himself diligently 'sought' and 'walked with' in partial communion here, and to be fully enjoyed hereafter."

2. "The Apostle denies that we can have access to God, except we have the truth, that God is deeply fixed in our hearts, so as not to be led here and there by various opinions."
3. "We are brought to know that God is, and in such a way that no corrupt superstition can seduce us, and also that we become assured of a certain salvation from him."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Impossible (αδυνατον). Strong word as in Hebrews 6:4; Hebrews 6:18. See Romans 8:8 for same idea with αρεσα (αρεσκω, Galatians 1:10)."
2. "Must believe (πιστευσα δε). Moral necessity to have faith (trust, πιστευω). This is true in business also (banks, for instance)."
3. "He is a rewarder (μισθαποδοτης γινετα). Rather, 'becomes a rewarder' (present middle indicative of γινομα, not of ειμ). Only N.T. example of μισθαποδοτης, late and rare double compound (one papyrus example, from μισθος (reward) and αποδιδωμ (to pay back) like μισθαποδοσια (Hebrews 10:35; Hebrews 11:26)."

### John Gill:
1. "But without faith it is impossible to please him,.... Or do things well pleasing in his sight; or any of the duties of religion, in an acceptable way."
2. "For this is not to be understood of the persons of God's elect, as considered in Christ; in whom they are well pleasing to him before faith."
3. "He must believe in the perfections of God; that he is omniscient, and knows his person and wants; is omnipotent, and can do for him, beyond his thoughts and petitions; is all sufficient, and that his grace is sufficient for him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Without faith...it is impossible to please him." 
2. "For he that cometh to God...must believe that he is."
