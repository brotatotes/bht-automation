## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "By faith, Noah, having been warned concerning the things not yet seen, took forethought, prepared the ark for the preservation of his house."  
2. "By which faith, he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Moved with fear—not mere slavish fear, but as in Hebrews 8:5- :; see on Hebrews 5:7; Greek, 'reverential fear': opposed to the world's sneering disbelief of the revelation, and self-deceiving security."
2. "Condemned the world—For since he believed and was saved, so might they have believed and been saved, so that their condemnation by God is by his case shown to be just."
3. "Paul here makes faith the principle and ground of his righteousness."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Everything which Noah did in reference to the threatened deluge, was done in virtue of simple faith or belief of what God said."
2. "The wickedness of the sinner is condemned not only by preaching, and by the admonitions and threatenings of the Law of God, but by the conduct of every good man."
3. "The same confidence in God which led Noah to believe what God said about the deluge would have led him to believe what he has said about the Redeemer."

### John Calvin:
1. "It was a wonderful example of magnanimity, that when the whole world were promising themselves impunity, and securely and unrestrainedly indulging themselves in sinful pleasures, Noah alone paid regard to Gods vengeance though deferred for a considerable time..."
2. "The Apostle ascribes to faith the praise of so remarkable a fortitude...in all ages men have neither been approved by God, nor performed anything worthy of praise otherwise than by faith."
3. "The work of building the ark was long and laborious...That he then bore their wanton insults with an unshaken spirit, is a proof that his resolution to obey was not of an ordinary kind."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Being warned of God... moved with godly fear. The rendering, taking forethought, separates the quality from the faith, and describes worldly caution rather than Christian grace. When things unseen and fearful are revealed, faith believes them, and fears accordingly."
2. "By which faith he condemned the world...He condemned the world, showing how the world ought to have regarded the warnings God gave, and how guilty they were in disregarding them."
3. "And became heir (possessor) of the righteousness which is according to faith - the righteousness which owes its quality, as it owes its origin, to faith."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Being warned of God."
2. "Moved with godly fear."
3. "An ark...shaped like a box."

### John Gill:
1. "This divine warning, or oracle, concerning things of such a nature, delivered to Noah, and received by him, shows that he was a favourite of God; that his faith rested in the word of God; and that it agreed with the apostle's definition of faith" (source).
2. "Moved with fear...with an awful sense of the judgments of God upon the wicked; and with reverence of God, from whom he received the oracle; and with a religious fear, with which he worshipped God, and which he discovered by a regard to his word and ordinances" (source).
3. "Though God can save without means, yet, generally speaking, it is his will to save by them; and that as God saved Noah and his family in the waters, so he can, and does, save his people in afflictions; and also, that true faith is attended with obedience" (source).

### John Wesley:
1. "Noah being warned of things not seen as yet - Of the future deluge."
2. "Moved with fear, prepared an ark, by which open testimony he condemned the world - Who neither believed nor feared."
