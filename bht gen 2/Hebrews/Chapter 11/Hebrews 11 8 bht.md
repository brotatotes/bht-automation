# Hebrews 11:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Abraham's faith is manifested in his obedience to God's call, leaving behind his own country and family. This act of leaving is symbolic of God's call for His people to come out from the world and separate themselves. The grace of God is evident in calling Abraham, not based on his own merit, but out of God's own kindness and mercy. Sometimes, God leads His people in ways that are unfamiliar to them, but He always knows the way. It is the nature of faith to follow God even when the path is not clear.
