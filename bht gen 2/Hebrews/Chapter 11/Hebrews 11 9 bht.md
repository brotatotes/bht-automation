# Hebrews 11:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By faith, Abraham lived as a stranger and pilgrim in the land of promise, not claiming any special rights or possessions. Alongside Isaac and Jacob, he dwelt in temporary dwellings, trusting in the fulfillment of God's promise. Their nomadic lifestyle reflected their belief in the future inheritance that awaited them. They patiently endured their unsettled life, knowing that their true home was yet to come. As joint heirs of the same promise, they remained steadfast, even though they had not yet witnessed its complete fulfillment.
