# Hebrews 12:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let us run our appointed race with patience, surrounded by a cloud of witnesses. As we compete in the Christian course, we must remove all obstacles that hinder our progress and weigh us down. This includes worldly cares and sins that easily beset us. In this race, swiftness, agility, and patience are necessary. Let us be encouraged by the great multitude cheering us on from above and the prize that awaits us at the end.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And now the propriety of the other words used at once appears.  νέφος , not only an immense multitude, and that number as it were pressing us all around as the spectators did the combatants in the circus, but also fitly compared to a cloud from the fact of its being above us, they looking on from that heavenly bliss which they entered at Christ’s triumph."
2. "laying aside all superfluous weight and sin which is ever besetting us."
3. "let us through endurance run the race set before us."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The 'witnesses' answer to the spectators pressing round to see the competitors in their contest for the prize." 
2. "They become in their turn 'witnesses' in a twofold way: attesting by their own case the faithfulness of God to His people and witnessing our struggle of faith."
3. "Carnal and worldly lusts, and all that would impede the heavenly runner, are the spiritual weight to be laid aside."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There is allusion here, doubtless, to the ancient games. A great multitude of spectators usually occupied the circular seats in the amphitheater, from which they could easily behold the combatants... the apostle represents Christians as encompassed with the multitude of worthies.... It means that we ought to act as if they were in sight, and cheered us on."
2. "As applied to Christians it means that they should remove all which would obstruct their progress in the Christian course... this general direction may be applied to anything which prevents our making the highest possible attainment in the divine life."
3. "Sins to which we are particularly exposed... They are those to which we are particularly liable... the sins to which we are most exposed... Such sins are appropriately called 'easily besetting sins'."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Therefore let us also (as they did) run our appointed race with patience."
2. "The writer's picture is that of an arena in which the Christians whom he addresses are contending in a race, while the vast host of the heroes of faith...watches the contest from the encircling tiers of the arena, compassing and overhanging it like a cloud, filled with lively interest and sympathy, and lending heavenly aid."
3. "So the readers are exhorted to lay aside every worldly hindrance or embarrassment to their Christian career."

### John Calvin:
1. "He says that we are so surrounded by this dense throng, that wherever we turn our eyes many examples of faith immediately meet us."
2. "Whosoever, then, would run in the course prescribed by Christ, must first disentangle himself from all these impediments, for we are already of ourselves more tardy than we ought to be, so no other causes of delay should be added."
3. "And he says that we are entangled, in order that we may know, that no one is fit to run except he has stripped off all toils and snares."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "There should be no chapter division here, since Hebrews 12:1-3 really is the climax in the whole argument about the better promises (Hebrews 10:19-12) with a passionate appeal for loyalty to Christ." 
2. "The metaphor refers to the great amphitheatre with the arena for the runners and the tiers upon tiers of seats rising up like a cloud. The μαρτυρες here are not mere spectators (θεατα), but testifiers (witnesses) who testify from their own experience (Hebrews 11:2; Hebrews 11:4; Hebrews 11:5; Hebrews 11:33; Hebrews 11:39) to God's fulfilling his promises as shown in chapter Hebrews 12:11." 
3. "The runners ran in the stadium nearly naked.Every weight  (ογκον παντα). Old word (kin to ενεγκειν, φερω) like φορτοσ, βαρος. Here every encumbrance that handicaps like doubt, pride, sloth, anything. No trailing garment to hinder or trip one."

### John Gill:
1. "Let us lay aside every weight; or burden; every sin...not only indwelling sin, but every actual transgression, and therefore to be laid aside...also worldly cares, riches, and honors...a great hinderance in the work and service of God."
2. "Likewise the rites and ceremonies of Moses's law were a weight and burden, a yoke of bondage...a great hinderance in the performance of evangelical worship."
3. "And let us run with patience the race that is set before us...to it swiftness and agility are necessary; and when it is performed aright, it is with readiness, willingness, and cheerfulness...it should be done 'with patience'; which is very necessary, because of the many exercises in the way; and because of the length of the race; and on account of the prize to be enjoyed, which is very desirable."

### John Wesley:
1. "Being encompassed with a cloud - a great multitude, tending upward with a holy swiftness." 
2. "Let us lay aside every weight - as all who run a race take care to do. Let us throw off whatever weighs us down, or damps the vigour of our Soul." 
3. "And the sin which easily besetteth us - as doth the sin of our constitution, the sin of our education, the sin of our profession."
