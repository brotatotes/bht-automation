# Hebrews 12:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For only a brief period, our earthly parents chastised us based on their own limited judgment, but God's discipline is always for our ultimate benefit. His purpose is for us to share in his holiness and be transformed into his likeness. While our human parents may have made mistakes in their discipline, God's guidance is perfect. Through his refining work, he removes our impurities and reveals his own image in us. This process may involve temporary afflictions, but we can trust that they contribute to our spiritual growth and prepare us for the eternal glory that awaits us.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For they indeed (our earthly parents) chastised us after their own pleasure, but He in order to that which is profitable, in order to our partaking of His holiness."
2. "Surely the true antithesis is that pointed out by the order of the clauses themselves, and by their correspondence: 1. πρὸς ὀλίγας ἡμέρας and ἐπὶ τὸ συμφέρον: 2. κατὰ τὸ δοκοῦν αὐτοῖς and εἰς τὸ μεταλ. τ. ἁγ. αὐτοῦ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Their rule of chastening is what may seem fit to their own often erring judgment, temper, or caprice."
2. "The two defects of human education are: (1) the prevalence in it of a view to the interests of our short earthly term of days; (2) the absence in parents of the unerring wisdom of our heavenly Father."
3. "To become holy like God is tantamount to being educated for passing eternity with God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Yet, in order to secure the benefit to be derived for so short a period from fatherly correction, we submitted without complaining."
2. "Much more cheerfully ought we to submit to that discipline from the hand of our heavenly Father which is designed to extend its benefits through eternity."
3. "To be holy as God is holy; to be so holy that it may be said that we ‘are partakers of his holiness,’ is a richer blessing than health, and property, and friends, without it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Subjection to the Father of spirits, the source of all life, has an eternal significance. Subjection to his fatherly discipline means, not only the everlasting life of the future, but present life, eternal in quality, developed even while the discipline is in progress." 
2. "To read for a few days into the two latter clauses of the verse which describes the heavenly discipline, and to say that both the chastening of the earthly and of the heavenly father are of brief duration, is to introduce abruptly into a sharp contrast between the two disciplines a point of resemblance."
3. "The human parents were shortsighted, fallible, sometimes moved by passion rather than by sound judgment, and, therefore, often mistaken in their disciplinary methods. What seemed good to them was not always best for us. No such possibility of error attaches to the Father of spirits."

### John Calvin:
1. "God’s chastisements are appointed to subdue and mortify our flesh, so that we may be renewed for a celestial life."
2. "The fruit or benefit [of God's chastisements] is to be perpetual; but such a benefit cannot be expected from men, since their discipline refers to civil life, and therefore properly belongs to the present world."
3. "These chastisements bring far greater benefit, as the spiritual holiness conferred by God far exceeds the advantages which belong to the body."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For they (our earthly parents) for a few days chastened us according as it seemed good to them, but he for our profit, for the purpose that and to be continued until we share in his holiness." 
2. "The contrast here is perfect between seeming and reality between their pleasure and God’s noble purpose between the few days of our youth, whether it succeed or not, and the continuance which is unbroken till the result is achieved."
3. "He sits as a Refiner of silver, and He applies the heat and removes the refuse till He sees in it His own image."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "As seemed good to them (κατα το δοκουν αυτοις)."
2. "For our profit (επ το συμφερον)."
3. "That we may be partakers (εις το μεταλαβειν). Of his holiness (της αγιοτητος αυτου)."

### John Gill:
1. "Saints are no losers by afflictions; they lose nothing but their dross and tin; they do not lose the love of God; nor their interest in the covenant of grace; nor the presence of God; nor grace in their own hearts; nor spiritual peace and comfort."
2. "They are real gainers by them; their graces gain by them fresh lustre and glory; they obtain a greater degree of spiritual knowledge; and a larger stock of experience; and are hereby restored to their former state, duty, and zeal; and become more conformable to Christ; yea, their afflictions conduce to their future glory; many are the profits arising from them."
3. "God's end in chastening of his children is, that we might be partakers of his holiness; not the essential holiness of God, which is incommunicable; but a communicative holiness of his, which it is his determining will his people should have." (146 words)

### John Wesley:
1. "For they verily for a few days — How few are even all our day on earth!"
2. "Chastened us as they thought good - Though frequently they erred therein, by too much either of indulgence or severity."
3. "But he always, unquestionably, for our profit, that we may be partakers of his holiness - That is, of himself and his glorious image."
