# Hebrews 12:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Chastisement may not appear joyful in the present, but it is intended to produce heavenly fruit. It causes pain and grief, but ultimately yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness, which brings holiness and happiness. Those who are exercised by these trials, receiving them from God and learning from them, will find that they lead to a deeper understanding of His will and a closer walk with Him.
