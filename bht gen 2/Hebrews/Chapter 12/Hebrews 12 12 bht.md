# Hebrews 12:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Wherefore, in light of the challenging circumstances and weariness that may cause our hands to hang down, let us not only lift up our own hands but also those of our fellow believers who are unable to continue the spiritual battle. Let us also encourage and support those whose knees are feeble and tired, unable to continue running the race set before us. Just as Isaiah exhorts, it is important to renew our strength and courage in the Lord, seeking His help to overcome any obstacles or discouragements that may come our way.
