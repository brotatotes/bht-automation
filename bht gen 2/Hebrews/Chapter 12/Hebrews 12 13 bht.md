# Hebrews 12:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To walk in a manner worthy of our calling, we must remove all obstacles that hinder our progress and cause us to stumble. Our conduct and conversation should be guided by the word of God, ensuring that our paths are straight and aligned with His will. God not only watches over and cares for those who are weak and feeble but also expects us to show the same concern and support. Let us be diligent in our walk, not allowing ourselves to be swayed or turned away from the path of faith and holiness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Let your walk be so firm and so unanimous in the right direction, that a plain track and highway may be thereby established for those who accompany and follow you to perceive and walk in."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The meaning is, that they were to remove all obstacles out of the way, so that they need not stumble and fail."
2. "The idea is, that everything which would prevent those in the church who were in any danger of falling - the feeble, the unestablished, the weak - from walking in the path to heaven, or which might be an occasion to them of falling, should be removed."
3. "Whatever is defective we should endeavor to restore to soundness, rather than to suffer the defect to be increased. Whatever is feeble in our faith or hope; whatever evil tendency there is in our hearts, we should endeavor to strengthen and amend, lest it should become worse, and we should entirely fall."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Make straight paths for your feet...right, plain, by implication even or smooth." 
2. "Exert yourselves to make the course clear for yourselves and your fellow Christians, so that there be no stumbling and laming." 
3. "Make the paths smooth and even, so that the lame limb be not dislocated by stones or pitfalls. Do everything to avoid aggravating the weakness of a fellow - Christian. Rather try to heal it."

### John Calvin:
1. "We ought to walk prudently and to keep to a straight course; for indiscreet ardor is no less an evil than inactivity and softness."
2. "He prescribes to us this rule for our conduct, — that we are to guide our steps according to God’s will, so that neither fear nor the allurements of the world, nor any other things, may draw us away from it."
3. "Those who keep not a straight course, but gradually though carelessly turn here and there, become eventually wholly alienated from God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "Negative final clause with ινα μη and second aorist passive of εκτρεπω, old verb to turn out, to twist, to put out of joint."
3. "Vivid picture of concern for the lame (χωλον, as in Matthew 11:5). Graphic picture of concern for the weak, a good argument for prohibition also."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'feet' are meant the walk and conversation of the saints, both in the church, and in the world..."
2. "To make these paths 'straight', is to make the word of God the rule of walking..."
3. "God takes care of, and has a regard to such, and he would have others also..."
