# Hebrews 12:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Follow peace with all men is a call to eagerly pursue peace with everyone, making use of every possible means to attain it. However, it is important to note that peace should not be pursued at the expense of holiness. True holiness, in contrast to ceremonial holiness, is crucial because without it, no one can see the Lord. Failing to follow after all holiness will inevitably lead to falling into various sins.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is clearly the brethren who are here meant by πάντων: and this is further shewn by the collocation of the words, which on the other view would more naturally be εἰρήνην μετὰ πάντων διώκετε." 
2. "The sentiment thus is the same as in Romans 14:19, ἄρα οὖν τὰ τῆς εἰρήνης διώκωμεν, καὶ τὰ τῆς οἰκοδομῆς τῆς εἰς ἀλλήλους."
3. "Without (apart from) which none shall see the Lord."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Instead of yielding to contending passions and to a spirit of war; instead of seeking revenge on your persecutors and foes, make it rather your aim to be holy."
