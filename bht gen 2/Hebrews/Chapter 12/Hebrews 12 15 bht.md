# Hebrews 12:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By diligently keeping watch and remaining vigilant, we can prevent ourselves from falling short of the grace of God. It is crucial to pay attention to the propensities of our hearts, the temptations of the world, and the allurements to apostasy presented by the adversary. We must strive and be mindful, holding on to the grace of God and not allowing any root of bitterness to spring up and trouble us. This includes guarding against false doctrines and unholy living, as they have the potential to corrupt and defile many within the church.
