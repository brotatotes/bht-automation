# Hebrews 12:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Esau's sin of profanity stemmed from his disregard for the birthright and the accompanying blessing. He treated something sacred and significant as trivial and unworthy, thereby displaying a lack of reverence and appreciation. This serves as a warning for believers to value and uphold the privileges and blessings bestowed upon them by God, rather than taking them lightly or casting them aside.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The character of Esau, from Scripture as well as tradition, will very well bear the designation πόρνος: and the balance of the sentence is better preserved by applying both to him, than by leaving πόρνος insulated."
2. "A profane person, τουτέστι, γαστρίμαργος, κοσμικός, τὰ πνευματικὰ βεβηλῶν καὶ καταπατῶν, Thl.: a man of low views, who has no appreciation of any high or divine thing."
3. "Who for one meal sold his own birthright, 'rights of primogeniture.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Fornication is nearly akin to gluttony, Esau's sin. He profanely cast away his spiritual privilege for the gratification of his palate."
2. "The smallness of the inducement only aggravates the guilt of casting away eternity for such a trifle, so far is it from being a claim for mercy."
3. "One single act has often the greatest power either for good or for evil."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The sin here referred to is one of those which would spread corruption in the church, and against which they ought to be especially on their guard."
2. "The word 'profane' here refers to one who by word or conduct treats religion with contempt, or has no reverence for what is sacred."
3. "It is true that it is rather by inference, than by direct assertion, that it is known that he [Esau] sustained this character [of a profane person]."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Only the epithet profane is applied to Esau, not fornicator." 
2. "The word occurs in the narrative of Genesis 25:31, Genesis 25:33, LXX. In N.T. often of discharging an obligation; paying back."
3. "N.T. form only in the later Greek translations of the O.T. Prwtotokeion, a very few times, almost all in this narrative."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Lord calls us for this end, that he may make us holy unto obedience: this is done when we renounce the world; but any one who so delights in his own filth that he continually rolls in it, profanes himself."
2. "But as men become profane in various ways, the more earnest we ought to strive lest an opening be left for Satan to defile us with his corruptions."
3. "Most appropriate then is this example; for when the Lord designs to set forth the power of that love which he has for his people, he calls all those whom he has called to the hope of eternal life his firstborn."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for a single meal sold his own birthright."
2. "For want of faith men give up the Gospel; for want of faith roots of bitterness spring up in the Church and defile it; and faithless persons become so selfish and so low-minded, that the smallest worldly advantages tempt them successfully to abandon their principles."
3. "The course of even the least favoured of them may end in despair."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Profane (βεβηλος). Trodden under foot, unhallowed."
2. "For one mess of meat (αντ βρωσεως μιας). Idea of exchange, 'for one act of eating.'"
3. "Sold (απεδετο). Second aorist middle indicative from Genesis 25:31; Genesis 25:33, and with irregular form for απεδοτο (regular μ form). His own birthright (τα πρωτοτοκια εαυτου)."

### John Gill:
1. "The first of these is guilty of a sin against the second table of the law, as well as against his own body; and which is opposed to the holiness the apostle had before exhorted to..."
2. "It is common for them to say of him, that he was an ungodly man; and particularly, that he was a murderer, a robber, 'and an adulterer,' and that he has no part in the world to come."
3. "The birthright was reckoned sacred; it was typical of the primogeniture of Christ; of the adoption of saints, and of the heavenly inheritance belonging thereunto; all which were despised by Esau."

### John Wesley:
1. Esau was profane for so slighting the blessing which went along with the birth-right.
