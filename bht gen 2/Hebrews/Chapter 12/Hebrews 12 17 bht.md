# Hebrews 12:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Esau's story serves as a cautionary tale for believers, reminding us that our actions in this world have eternal consequences. Just as Esau was rejected by his father, we too may find ourselves rejected if we prioritize worldly desires over our relationship with God. It is important to note that tears alone are not enough to signify true repentance; we must genuinely turn away from our sin and seek forgiveness from God. Furthermore, Esau's inability to change his father's decision underscores the weightiness of our choices and the importance of making wise decisions in the present moment.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Ye know that when he afterward on his part wished to inherit the blessing, he was rejected; for he found not place of repentance." 
2. "It is obvious, that our passage, rightly understood, cannot by any means favour the exclusion of any sinner from repentance."
3. "Warning is given us that a path is not safe where even such a possibility may be encountered."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "As in the believer's case, so in the unbeliever's, there is an 'afterwards' coming, when the believer shall look on his past griefs, and the unbeliever on his past joys, in a very different light from that in which they were respectively viewed at the time." 
2. "He shed tears, not for his sin, but for his suffering the penalty of his sin. His were tears of vain regret and remorse, not of repentance."
3. "Tears are no proof of real repentance."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The 'blessing' here referred to was not that of the birth-right, but that pronounced by the father Isaac on him whom he regarded as his first-born son."
2. "Isaac firmly declared that he had 'pronounced' the blessing, and though it had been obtained by fraud, yet as it was of the nature of a divine prediction, it could not now be changed."
3. "This passage... should be used to keep us from disregarding our privileges, from turning away from the true religion, from slighting the favors of the gospel, and from neglecting religion until death comes; because when God has once pronounced a sentence excluding us from his favor, no tears, or pleading, or effort of our own can change him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He found no place of repentance...[meaning] an opportunity to repair by repenting... He found no way to reverse by repentance what he had done. The penalty could not be reversed in the nature of the case." 
2. "This does not mean that Esau was rendered incapable of repentance, which is clearly contradicted by what follows."
3. "He found no place of repentance...nor that he was not able to persuade Isaac to change his mind and to recall the blessing already bestowed on Jacob and give it to him. This is unnatural, forced, and highly improbable."

### John Calvin:
1. "Thus they who are led away by the allurements of this world alienate themselves from God, and sell their own salvation that they may feed on the morsels of this world, without thinking that they lose anything, nay, they flatter and applaud themselves, as though they were extremely happy."
2. "But as there is this danger, the Apostle justly warns all to beware."
3. "The Lord is ready to pardon him, nor is God’s mercy ever sought in vain, for to him who knocks it shall be opened."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The tears expressed sorrow for the loss he sustained, not for the low, sinful preference of which he had been guilty."
2. "He is regarded as a type of the hopeless apostate, who throws away his birthright through sensual indulgence or love of the world, and who, too late, finds the door of repentance closed to him, because repentance itself, in its true and deep sense, is impossible."
3. "In any case the lesson remains; sensual, worldly preferences may be so indulged as to become our masters; and we may wish to die the death of the righteous, and reap their rewards, and yet be rejected."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Ye know... He was rejected." 
2. "Place of repentance... He sought it with tears, but in vain." 
3. "Esau is a tragic example of one who does a wilful sin which allows no second chance."

### John Gill:
1. "This the apostle relates to the Hebrews, as a thing well known to them; they having read the books of Moses, and being conversant with them."
2. "Tears are not an infallible sign of repentance: men may be more concerned for the loss and mischief that come by sin, than for the evil that is in it; and such repentance is not sincere."
3. "He could not prevail upon him to change his mind; to revoke the blessing he had bestowed on Jacob, and confer it on him."

### John Wesley:
1. "He was rejected — He could not obtain it.For he found no place for repentance — There was no room for any such repentance as would regain what he had lost."
2. "Though he sought it — The blessing of the birth-right.Diligently with tears — He sought too late."
3. "Let us use the present time."
