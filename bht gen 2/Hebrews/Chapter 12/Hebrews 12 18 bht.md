# Hebrews 12:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The exhortation to adhere to the Gospel is based on its superiority to the law. The law was earthly, tangible, and carnal, while the Gospel is spiritual and everlasting. The majesty of God and the obscurity of the legal dispensation are represented by the darkness and clouds surrounding Mount Sinai. Our approach to Christ is not a physical one like the Hebrews had, but a spiritual one that draws us closer to salvation and judgment. We have not come to a mountain that can be touched, but to the eternal kingdom of Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Mount Sinai was a material mountain, which not only might be touched, but was being touched, would have been touched by the people had it not been forbidden."
2. "The perfect participle, in either case, is somewhat startling. The present would seem the more natural. But if in the case where it is taken with πυρί it is rendered 'kindled,' there can be no reason why it should not in the other be rendered 'lit up.' 'Consumed' would be κατακεκαυμένῳ."
3. "The Writer avoids the φωνή there used, having so soon to use φωνὴ ῥημάτων."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The fact that we are not under the law, but under a higher, and that the last dispensation, the Gospel, with its glorious privileges, is the reason why especially the Hebrew Christians should 'look diligently,'"
2. "The Hebrews drew near to the material Mount Sinai with material bodies; we, to the spiritual mount in the spirit."
3. "The 'darkness' was that formed by the clouds hanging round the mount; the 'tempest' accompanied the thunder."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Under the new dispensation there was much more to hind them to fidelity, and to make apostasy dangerous, than there was under the old."
2. "While there was as much that was sublime, there was much more that was adapted to win and hold the affections."
3. "The Christian system was far superior in every respect to the Jewish."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Following this allusion to Esau, and perhaps suggested by it, is a passage setting forth the privileges of the Christian birthright and of Christian citizenship in contrast with those under the old covenant."
2. "The A. V. which might be touched, although not literally correct, conveys the true sense."
3. "Gnofov and skotov appear together, Exodus 10:22; Exodus 14:20; Deuteronomy 4:11; Deuteronomy 5:22. Gnofov alone, Exodus 20:21. Zofov only in the later version of Symmachus."

### John Calvin:
1. "He proclaims the greatness of the grace made known by the Gospel, that we may reverently receive it."
2. "The higher the excellency of Christ’s kingdom than the dispensation of Moses, and the more glorious our calling than that of the ancient people, the more disgraceful and the less excusable is our ingratitude, unless we embrace in a becoming manner the great favor offered to us, and humbly adore the majesty of Christ which is here made evident."
3. "When considered in themselves they were magnificent and truly celestial; but when we come to the kingdom of Christ, the things which God exhibits to us are far above all the heavens."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "There is no word here in the Greek for 'a mount' like ορε..." 
2. "It is clearly understood since the dative participles agree with it unless they be taken as descriptive of 'a palpable and kindled fire ' when πυρ would be the dative case after προσεληλυθατε."
3. "Present passive participle (dative case) of ψηλαφαω, old verb to handle, to touch (Luke 24:39)."

### John Gill:
1. "The design of the apostle in the following words is, in general, to engage the Hebrews to adhere closely to the Gospel, from the consideration of the superior excellency of it to the law."
2. "and the meaning is, that it was an earthly mountain, that might be approached to, and be seen and felt, and not of a spiritual nature, as Sion, or the church of God; and so may be expressive of the carnality of the law, and also of the movableness of it."
3. "and which also may express the majesty of God, round about whom are clouds and darkness; and also the horror of the legal dispensation, and the obscurity of it; little being known by the Jews of the spirituality of the law, of the strict justice of God, and of the righteousness which the law requires, and of the end and use of it."

### John Wesley:
1. "A strong reason this why they ought the more to regard the whole exhortation drawn from the priesthood of Christ: because both salvation and vengeance are now nearer at hand."
2. "Ye are not come to the mountain that could be touched - That was of an earthy, material nature."
