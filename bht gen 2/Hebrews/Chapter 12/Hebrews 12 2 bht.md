# Hebrews 12:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, we fix our eyes on the one who began and perfected our faith. Like the Israelites who looked up to the lifted up serpent as a remedy, we are to look up to our crucified Lord who took our guilt upon Himself. He endured the cross, despising its shame, in anticipation of the joy that awaited Him. By looking to Jesus, we find the strength needed to endure trials and are encouraged in our journey of faith.
