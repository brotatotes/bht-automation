# Hebrews 12:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people, overwhelmed by the fear that gripped them when they heard the commandments proclaimed, could not bear the weight of the yoke of bondage that these laws represented. These commandments were not meant to be endured lightly, but rather carried a sense of accusation, cursing, and condemnation. The gravity of the punishment, death by stoning or being shot, underscored the seriousness of even unintentionally desecrating the sacred. The people appealed to Moses and the leaders shared in their terror, recognizing the immense significance and consequence of their actions.
