# Hebrews 12:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Moses, who conversed with God as a friend, was still deeply impacted by the sight of God's glory in the smoke, fire, and lightning. It was not the burning bush, but the giving of the law that filled Moses with fear, causing him to tremble. As a mediator between God and the people, Moses experienced moments of awe and reverence. However, when the ten commandments were being spoken, he stood among the hearers, reminding us that even the most righteous individuals cannot stand before a holy God without trembling in reverence.
