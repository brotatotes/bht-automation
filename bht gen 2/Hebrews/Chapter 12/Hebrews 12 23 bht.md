# Hebrews 12:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Christian is united with the excellent of all times and earth as members of the heavenly citizenship, an honor that should not be forsaken. God has all the elect enrolled in His book, making it imperative that believers remain loyal, patient, and faithful. Even after death, pious souls live with God and are joined with believers on earth. The church of the firstborn encompasses all the redeemed, and as citizens of heaven, believers are already enrolled, even in their earthly existence. This should motivate Christians to live in anticipation of being reunited with their loved ones in heaven.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "According to II. (Elzev., Beza, Jo. Gregor., Matthæi: also Calov., Kypke, Carpzov, Cramer, Baumgarten, Storr, De Wette), a new clause begins with πανηγύρει καὶ ἐκκλησίᾳ: for which arrangement Lünemann and Hofmann have decided..."
2. "Thus, according to Delitzsch’s note, which in the main I have here followed, the connexion between the clauses is established, and the arrangement justified..."
3. "We may also remark that thus the analogy with the firstborn of Israel is completely fulfilled. They were dedicated to God specially as his priests and royal succession was in the firstborn: so that in πρωτότοκοι we have that which St. John says: ἐποίησεν ἡμᾶς βασιλείαν, ἱερεῖς τῷ θεῷ καὶ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Though still fighting the good fight on earth, still, in respect to your destiny, and present life of faith which substantiates things hoped for, ye are already members of the heavenly citizenship."
2. "The first-born of Israel were 'written' in a roll."
3. "The spirits of just men made perfect—at the resurrection, when the 'JUDGE' shall appear, and believers' bliss shall be consummated by the union of the glorified body with the spirit."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Christian is united in feeling, in honor, and in destiny, with the excellent of all the earth, and of all times. He should feel it, therefore, an honor to be a Christian; he should yield to no temptation which would induce him to part from so goodly a fellowship."
2. "The thought that seems to have struck his mind in regard to God was, that he would do right to all. They had, therefore, everything to fear if they revolted from him; they had everything to hope if they bore their trials with patience, and persevered to the end."
3. "Most Christians have among the redeemed already not a few of their most tenderly beloved friends. A father may be there; a mother, a sister, a smiling babe. It should be a powerful motive with us so to live as to be prepared to be reunited with them in heaven."

### John Calvin:
1. "He adds, which are written in heaven, because God is said to have all the elect enrolled in his book or secret catalogue."
2. "He adds this to intimate that we are joined to holy souls, which have put off their bodies, and left behind them all the filth of this world."
3. "And hence we may with certainty conclude, that pious souls, separated from their bodies, still live with God, for we could not possibly be otherwise joined to them as companions."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Church of the firstborn (εκκλησια πρωτοτοκων). Probably an additional item besides the angelic host as the people of Israel are called firstborn (Exodus 4:22)."
2. "The word εκκλησια here has the general sense of all the redeemed, as in Matthew 16:18; Colossians 1:18; Ephesians 5:24-32, and equivalent to the kingdom of God."
3. "Enrolled as citizens of heaven even while on earth (Luke 10:20; Philippians 1:27; Philippians 3:20; Philippians 4:3; Revelation 13:8, etc.)."

### John Gill:
1. "To the general assembly...for the church of God, consisting of all his elect, both Jews and Gentiles...more so than the assembly of the Jews, at any of their solemn feasts."

### John Wesley:
1. "To the general assembly...the whole body of true believers, whether on earth or in paradise."
