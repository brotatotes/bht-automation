# Hebrews 12:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Coming to Jesus is the result of God's grace, a response to recognizing our need and His sufficiency. It is a privilege for believers to have free access to God and find safety, settlement, and peace in Him. The efficacy of Christ's blood in procuring pardon, peace, and reconciliation demonstrates His superiority to Abel and speaks of His role as the mediator. The blood of sprinkling, the foundation of Jesus' ministry, represents the culmination of this progression.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "To Christ, all that is predicated of our Lord belonged officially: but when it is predicated of Jesus, it becomes personal fact, realized in one whom we know and who loves us." 
2. "By that Blood we live, wherever it is: but as here it is mentioned separately from the Lord Himself, as an item in the glories of the heavenly city, and as 'yet speaking,' it seems to require some such view to account for the words used." 
3. "The blood of Christ is called αἷμα  ῥαντισμοῦ, inasmuch as, like that sacrificial blood of old materially, it is spiritually sprinkled on the conscience of those who come unto God by Him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The blood of sprinkling—here enumerated as distinct from 'Jesus.' His blood was entirely 'poured out' of His body by the various ways in which it was shed... It was incorruptible. No Scripture states it was again put into the Lord's body."
2. "The blood itself, therefore, continues still in heaven before God, the perpetual ransom price of 'the eternal covenant.' Once for all Christ sprinkled the blood peculiarly for us at His ascension."
3. "Christ's sacrifice and the new covenant compared to Abel's sacrifice is to show the superiority of Christ's sacrifice and the new covenant to the Old Testament sacrifices... The word 'better' implies superiority to something that is good: but Abel's own blood was not at all good for the purpose for which Christ's blood was efficacious; nay, it cried for vengeance."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The highest consideration which can be urged to induce anyone to persevere in a life of piety is the fact that the Son of God has come into the world and died to save sinners."
2. "The blood of Jesus speaks better things than Abel did; that is, that the blood of Jesus is the 'reality' of which the offering of Abel was a 'type.'"
3. "In the former, the Jewish, all was imperfect, terrible, and alarming. In the latter, everything was comparatively mild, winning, alluring, animating."

### John Calvin:
1. "He adds this in the last place, because it is he alone through whom the Father is reconciled to us, and who renders his face serene and lovely to us, so that we may come to him without fear."
2. "He shows how Christ becomes our Mediator, even through his own blood, which after the Hebrew mode of speaking he calls the blood of sprinkling, which means sprinkled blood."
3. "The blood of Christ is said to speak better things, because it avails to obtain pardon for our sins. The blood of Abel did not properly cry out; for it was his murder that called for vengeance before God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He is there as Lord and Saviour and still 'Jesus.'" 
2. "The mediator of a new covenant."
3. "Abel's blood still speaks, but it is as nothing compared to that of Jesus."

### John Gill:
1. "Coming to Christ is by faith; it is a coming to him under a sense of want, and upon a sight of fulness; and is the produce of God's efficacious grace."
2. "It is free to all sensible sinners to come to him, and is the great privilege of saints: such are safe, settled, and at peace, who are come to Jesus; they can want no good thing, for all are theirs; they have free access to God through him."
3. "The efficacy of Christ's blood for the procuring pardon, peace, reconciliation, and the redemption and purchase of his church and people, shows him to be greater than Abel; it speaks better things than he did, or does."

### John Wesley:
1. "To Jesus, the mediator — Through whom they had been perfected."
2. "And to the blood of sprinkling — To all the virtue of his precious blood shed for you, whereby ye are sprinkled from an evil conscience."
3. "This blood of sprinkling was the foundation of our Lord's mediatorial office. Here the gradation is at the highest point."
