# Hebrews 12:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do not turn away from the one who speaks to you, for His words carry great weight. Just as God spoke to His people in the past, He continues to speak to us today through His Son. We must not disregard His message, for the consequences of rejecting the Gospel are severe. The guilt of refusing the Word of God is even greater now, as Jesus, the Mediator of the new covenant, speaks on behalf of the elect. Let us not neglect His voice, for His words are a prelude to the final judgment.
