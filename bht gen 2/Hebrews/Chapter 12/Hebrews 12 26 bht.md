# Hebrews 12:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The voice of Christ, heard through thunder and the trumpet, shook not only the earth but also the heavens, fulfilling biblical prophecies. The shaking of the earth symbolizes the agitation caused by the announcement of Christ's coming and the overthrow of opposing kingdoms. The introduction of the gospel caused great changes and signified the imminent overthrow of God-opposed kingdoms by the coming Messiah. The doctrine of the Gospel surpasses that of the Law and must be distinctly heard by all creation. Christ's promises continue to hold as his voice resonates, shaking the earth and heaven.
