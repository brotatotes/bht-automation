# Hebrews 12:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the writer speaks of the things which are shaken, he is referring to the temporary and changeable nature of the current order of things, including the heaven and earth. These things are subject to change because they were made. However, there are things which are unshakeable and will remain, such as the new heavens and the new earth that are promised in Revelation. These unshakeable things reflect the eternal and enduring nature of God's kingdom.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The great final shaking which is to introduce the accomplished kingdom of God is at all events that after which there shall be no other. At this the words ἔτι ἅπαξ point."
2. "The transitory and baseless may pass away when its work is fulfilled, and give place to that which shall never pass away."
3. "Creation was made but to subserve Redemption: the things removeable, to give place to the things unremoveable."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In saying 'once more,' the Spirit implies that something has already passed, and something else shall be which is to remain, and is no more to be changed to something else; for the once is exclusive, that is, not many times." 
2. "As the shaking is to be total, so shall the removal be, making way for the better things that are unremovable. Compare the Jewish economy (the type of the whole present order of things) giving way to the new and abiding covenant: the forerunner of the everlasting state of bliss."
3. "The things made in the former sense do not remain; the things of the new heaven and earth, like the uncreated God, 'shall REMAIN before God'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The effect of the gospel would be to overturn everything which was of a temporary character in the previous system, and everything in morals which was not founded on a solid basis, and to set up in the place of it principles which no revolution and no time could change."
2. "The Christian religion gives permanence and stability to the one [correct views of religion] and causes the other [false views] to disappear."
3. "The result of all will be that he [Christ] will preside over a permanent kingdom, and that his people will inherit 'a kingdom which cannot be moved.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "He only infers from the shaking of the heaven and the earth that the state of the world was to be changed at the coming of Christ; for things created are subject to decay, but Christ's kingdom is eternal; then all creatures must needs be brought into a better state."
2. "In embracing the Gospel, we have the gift of the Spirit of Christ, that we may reverently and devoutly worship God."
3. "There is no service approved by him except it be united with humility and due reverence. Thus he condemns froward confidence of the flesh, as well as the sloth which also proceeds from it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The shaking of the 'heavenly things' has created some difficulty. But, in fact, the new covenant affected both earth and heaven."
2. "The Word made flesh, the complete forgiveness of sin, eternal life through the blood of Christ, the introduction of sinners of all nations into the Church of God, the changing of the Church itself from an earthly into a spiritual fellowship, Christ exalted as Priest and King: these are changes that affect both worlds, but cannot themselves be changed."
3. "The shaking, therefore, here spoken of is not now future, as some suppose. It began at the incarnation (and so the 'I will shake' of the prophecy is here changed into 'I am shaking'), and it is only the complete realization of it that is still to come."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He uses the article to point out "ετ απαξ" which he explains (δηλο, signifies, present active indicative of δηλοω)." 
2. "There is a divine purpose in the cosmic catastrophe."
3. "The Kingdom of God is not shaken, fearful as some saints are about it."

### John Gill:
1. "And this word yet once more,.... Or as it is in Haggai 2:6 'yet once it is a little while'; which suggests, that as something had been done already, so in a very little time, and at once, something very marvellous and surprising would be effected..."
2. "...this is to be understood of Christ's coming to the destruction of Jerusalem; when there was an entire removal of the Jewish state, both political and ecclesiastical; and of the whole Mosaic economy..."
3. "...the kingdom and priesthood of Christ, which are everlasting; and the good things which come by him, as remission of sins, justification, adoption, sanctification, and the heavenly inheritance; as also the Gospel, and the doctrines and ordinances of it..."

### John Wesley:
1. The things which are shaken — Namely, heaven and earth.As being made — And consequently liable to change.That the things which are not shaken may remain — Even "the new heavens and the new earth," Revelation 21:1.
