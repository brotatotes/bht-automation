# Hebrews 12:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Therefore, as Christians, let us rejoice and eagerly embrace the unshakable kingdom of glory that we have received as partakers in Christ. Let us cultivate a heart of gratitude, holding fast to the grace we have received, which empowers us to serve God wholeheartedly in every aspect of our lives. As we serve Him, let us do so with reverent submission and godly fear, recognizing His Holiness and our own unworthiness. May our service be marked by a deep awareness of His gracious majesty, and a tender, loving fear of offending our loving God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "receiving as we do a kingdom which cannot be shaken... being partakers of, coming into possession of, βας. or ἀρχὴν παραλαμβάνειν, 'regnum capessere.' The participle then will be descriptive of our Christian state of privilege and expectation: proleptically designating us as in possession of that, whose firstfruits and foretastes we do actually possess." 
2. "let us have thankfulness... μηδὲ δυσπετῶμεν, ἀλλ' εὐχαριστῶμεν τῷ τοιαῦτα καὶ ἤδη δόντι καὶ μελλοντι δώσειν" 
3. "by which (thankfulness) let us serve (the indicative readings, ἔχομεν and λατρεύομεν, are weakly supported, and do not suit the sense nor the inferential διό. And λατρεύωμεν cannot be taken, as in E.V., 'by which we may serve,' but must be hortatory like the other) God well-pleasingly with reverent submission and fear"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "receiving—as we do, in prospect and sure hope, also in the possession of the Spirit the first-fruits. This is our privilege as Christians." 
2. "let us have grace—"let us have thankfulness" [ALFORD after CHRYSOSTOM]. But (1) this translation is according to classical Greek, not Paul's phraseology for "to be thankful." (2) "To God" would have been in that case added. (3) "Whereby we may serve God," suits the English Version "grace" (that is Gospel grace, the work of the Spirit, producing faith exhibited in serving God), but does not suit "thankfulness.""
3. "reverence and godly fear—The oldest manuscripts read, "reverent caution and fear." Reverent caution (same Greek as in :-; see on Hebrews 5:7) lest we should offend God, who is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity. Fear lest we should bring destruction on ourselves."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The meaning is, that the kingdom of the Redeemer is never to pass away... It has now endured for eighteen hundred years, amidst all the revolutions on earth, and in spite of all the attempts which have been made to destroy it; and it is now as vigorous and stable as it ever was."
2. "The ‘argument’ which he presents is, that this kingdom is permanent. There is no danger of its being overthrown. It is to continue on earth to the end of time; it is to be established in heaven forever."
3. "If it were temporary, changeable, liable to be overthrown at any moment, there would be much less encouragement to perseverance. But in a kingdom like this there is every encouragement, for there is the assurance... That the reward is certain."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Wherefore, we receiving as we do a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful and thereby serve God acceptably with godly reverence and fear." 
2. "Thankfulness, not discontent, is the becoming feeling, and when blended with fear (‘awe’) will make our service reverent and joyous."
3. "The Greek phrase favours this rendering (see 2 Timothy 1:3, Gr.). ‘Let us have grace’ is, however, a possible meaning."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Ground for loyalty to Christ and for calm trust in God." 
2. "Let us keep on having grace." 
3. "Well pleasing with reverence and awe."

### John Gill:
1. "Not the kingdom of glory; eternal glory is a kingdom, and it is an immovable one...but the kingdom of grace, under the Gospel dispensation, is meant."
2. "Christ he is King, believers are his subjects, the Gospel is his sceptre, and the ordinances are his laws and appointments, and all are immovable."
3. "Without holding to the Gospel, there is no serving him in an evangelic manner; the true and right way of serving him is...acceptably, with reverence, and godly fear."

### John Wesley:
1. "Therefore let us, receiving — By willing and joyful faith.A kingdom — More glorious than the present heaven and earth." 
2. "Hold fast the grace, whereby we may serve God — In every thought, word, and work."
3. "With reverence — Literally, with shame. Arising from a deep consciousness of our own unworthiness.And godly fear — A tender, jealous fear of offending, arising from a sense of the gracious majesty of God."
