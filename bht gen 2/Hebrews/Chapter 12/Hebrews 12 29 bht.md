# Hebrews 12:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our God is a consuming fire, displaying his justice and holiness in all his actions. He alone is worthy of our worship, and it is his right to dictate the manner in which we worship him. This phrase also signifies the preservation of his people and the destruction of their enemies. It is important to remember that when we speak of God as a consuming fire, we are referring to our covenant God, our God in Christ, who does not display wrath and vengeance towards his saints.
