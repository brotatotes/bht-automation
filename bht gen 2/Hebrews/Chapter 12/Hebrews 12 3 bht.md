# Hebrews 12:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Consider the example of Christ, who endured the contradiction and opposition of sinners. Reflect on the comparison between the hardships he faced and the difficulties we encounter. By keeping our eyes on him, we find courage to persevere, avoiding weariness or fainting in our minds. Just as the Lord bore the burdens placed upon him, we should not shy away from our own challenges and trials.

2. "For this one thought alone ought to be sufficient to conquer all temptations, that is, when we know that we are companions or associates of the Son of God, and that he, who was so far above us, willingly came down to our condition, in order that he might animate us by his own example."
