# Hebrews 12:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To truly resist sin, one must be willing to endure not just reproach and afflictions, but even shed their own blood. By looking to the example of Jesus, who obediently gave his life, they can find the strength to persevere through their trials and not yield in their conflict against evil. Sin is an adversary that they must strive against, both within themselves and in the world around them. In this battle, they should find encouragement in knowing that God's grace towards them uses their sufferings to destroy sin and defend the gospel.
