## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The fact of their having thus forgotten the exhortation is surely assumed below, in Hebrews 12:7-11; and from this point forward the Writer takes up the tone of reproof, which comes to its height in Hebrews 12:16-17."
2. "And not only this. The interrogative form would surely be most unnatural, coupled closely as it would be with an assertion of fact, οὔπω.… ἀντικατέστητε."
3. "The which (that kind of exhortation, of which the following is a specimen: such seems to be the force of ἥτις instead of ἥ) discourses with you as with sons, My son, despise not the chastening of the Lord, nor faint, when corrected by Him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "His exhortation ought to have more effect on you than the cheers and exhortations of the spectators have on the competitors striving in the games."
2. "The Christian...is peculiarly the child of God. To him such adverse things occur only by the decree of God, and that designed in kindness, namely, to remove the defilements adhering to the believer, and to exercise his patience."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "...afflictions were designed on the part of God to produce some happy effects in the lives of his people, and that they ought, therefore, to bear them patiently."
2. "The language of the Scriptures... may be regarded as addressed to us."
3. "Afflictions have many objects, or produce many happy effects... they are means of reclaiming the wandering and erring children of God, and are proofs of his paternal care and love."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Ye have forgotten [εκλελησθε] ... to escape notice; to be unseen or unknown ... Some render interrogatively, 'have ye forgotten?'"
2. "Speaketh unto you [υμιν διαλεγεται] ... in the sense of mutual converse or discussion ... Rend. 'reasoneth with you.'"
3. "Despise not [μη ολιγωρει] ... to make little of [ολιγος] ... Chastening [παιδειας] ... mostly in Hebrews."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is useful and needful for us to be disciplined by the cross."
2. "If the scourges of God testify his love towards us, it is a shame that they should be regarded with dislike or hatred."
3. "Be not faint or despairing when reproved or chastised."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The quotation is from Proverbs 3:11-12; and as wisdom speaks there as a person, so here the exhortation she gives is spoken of as a person addressing tender, motherly appeals to all who suffer."
2. "Despondency and resentment imply the same unbelief of the loving purpose of the discipline, and they express themselves in the same outward form of complaint."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Ye have forgotten (εκλελησθε). Perfect middle indicative of εκλανθανω, to cause to forget, old verb, here only in the N.T. with genitive case as usual." 
2. "Regard not lightly (μη ολιγωρε). Prohibition with μη and the present active imperative of ολιγωρεω, old verb from ολιγωρος and this from ολιγος (little) and ωρα (hour), old verb, here only in N.T." 
3. "Chastening (παιδειας). Old word from παιδευω, to train a child (παις), instruction (2 Timothy 3:16), which naturally includes correction and punishment as here."

### John Gill:
1. "And ye have forgotten the exhortation...which speaketh unto you as unto children not as the children of Solomon, but as the children of God, or of Christ, the wisdom of God." 
2. "my son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord...but should be esteemed for the good ends, which are sometimes answered by it." 
3. "nor faint when thou art rebuked of him; God has various ways of rebuking, reproving, and convincing...and therefore saints should not faint at them."

### John Wesley:
1. "Do not slight or make little of it; do not impute any affliction to chance or second causes but see and revere the hand of God in it."
2. "But endure it patiently and fruitfully."
