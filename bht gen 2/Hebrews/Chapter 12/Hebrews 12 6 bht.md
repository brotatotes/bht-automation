# Hebrews 12:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's love for His children is evident through His chastisement. He sends trials to those whom He loves, showing His fatherly care and promoting their salvation. The Lord accepts His children and takes them to His heart as His own. Even in the midst of suffering, we can find solace in the understanding that God's disciplinary actions are rooted in love. We can see this in the way that God interposes during our punishments, providing a sure pledge of His love. Thus, we should not despise or grow weary under His chastisements but recognize them as expressions of His deep love for us.
