# Hebrews 12:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Parents have a responsibility to discipline their children when they go astray. Chastening is an essential part of the growth and development of a child. Just as a father corrects his son when he makes mistakes, so too does God discipline His children when they need it. This correction is a sign of love and shows that they are truly His children. Just as a loving father restores his child through discipline, so God lovingly guides and corrects His own.
