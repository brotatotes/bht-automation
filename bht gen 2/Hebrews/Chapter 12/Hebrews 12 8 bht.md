# Hebrews 12:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If believers go through life without experiencing any form of chastisement, they cannot claim to be true children of God, but rather illegitimate ones. It is important to note that not all believers undergo the same level or frequency of correction. However, the absence of chastisement altogether should be a cause for concern as it may indicate a false profession of faith. In fact, afflictions can serve to validate one's position as a genuine child of God. Therefore, we should not be disheartened by trials, but rather embrace them as evidence of our true sonship in Christ.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In every way he evinces toward them the character of a father."
2. "If it should be that they passed along through life without any occurrence that would indicate the paternal care and attention designed to correct their faults, it would show that they never had been his children, but were cast off and wholly disregarded."
3. "We should receive every affliction as full proof that we are not forgotten by the High and Holy One who condescends to sustain to us the character, and to evince toward us, in our wanderings, the watchful care of a Father."

2. "Then are ye bastards, and not sons; all are not sons that are under a profession of religion; all that are under a profession of religion are not chastised; but then those are not the children of God, but the children of the world, of Satan, and of the antichristian harlot."
3. "Hence we learn, that outward peace and prosperity is not a note of a true church; and that such have reason to distrust their state, who know not what it is to have the chastising rod of God upon them; and that afflictions are rather arguments for than against sonship."

### John Wesley:
1. Of which all sons are partakers - More or less.
