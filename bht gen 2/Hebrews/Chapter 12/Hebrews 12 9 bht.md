# Hebrews 12:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If we acknowledged the authority and discipline of our earthly fathers, should we not much rather submit to the Father of spirits, who corrects us out of love for our own well-being? Our earthly fathers corrected us for a short time and with limited understanding, but the Father of spirits, the Creator of our souls, corrects us for eternal purposes. Let us then humbly and reverently submit to His loving correction, that we may live with Him forever.
