# Hebrews 13:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Brotherly love is a crucial aspect of Christian life and community. It is not merely a feeling or sentiment, but a genuine love that believers have for one another as members of the same spiritual family. This love is rooted in their shared relationship with God as their Father and Jesus Christ as their Savior. It is a love that is demonstrated through acts of kindness, support, and encouragement. Without brotherly love, our profession of faith is in vain. It is through this love that the church finds unity, strength, and purpose in fulfilling God's work.

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "Hospitality was regarded as a religious duty. The stranger was held to be under the special protection of Zeus, who was called xeniov, the God of the stranger."

3. "It was therefore a good custom in the primitive Church for Christians to call one another brothers; but now the name as well as the thing itself is become almost obsolete, except that the monks have appropriated to themselves the use of it when neglected by others, while at the same time they show by their discords and intestine factions that they are the children of the evil one."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The first admonition is to 'brotherly love'... It is appropriately put first among earthly duties, as it is the first-fruit of faith and the beginning of all else."

Paul) has taught that they all become brethren one of another as soon as they are changed; that is, when they deny the Greek gods, and adore the crucified sophist.'"
3. "He also enlarges on their sympathy with those in bonds, and on their hospitality. The sentiment struck the observer even while he scorned it as new and impracticable."

3. "Some escaped notice when entertaining angels."
