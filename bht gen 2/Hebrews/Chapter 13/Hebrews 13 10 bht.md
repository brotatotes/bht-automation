# Hebrews 13:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The cross of Christ serves as our spiritual altar, representing both the sacrifices made and the priestly role fulfilled by Christ himself. The benefits derived from this altar are exclusively for those who believe in Christ and partake in the blessings that his sacrifice has procured. Adhering to the Mosaic law and serving the tabernacle does not grant the right to partake in these spiritual benefits. Instead, it is through genuine faith and wholehearted acceptance of Christ's sacrifice that we are able to receive and embrace the blessings that it brings into our lives.

### Henry Alford:
1. "Our true meat is not to be partaken of by those who adhere to those old distinctions: that Christianity and Judaism are necessarily and totally distinct."
2. "That altar is the CROSS, on which the Lord suffered. That is our altar: not to be emphasized, nor exalted into any comparison with the adorable Victim thereon offered; but still our altar, that wherein we glory, that for which, as 'pro aris,' we contend: of which our banners, our tokens, our adornments, our churches, are full: severed from which, we know not Christ; laid upon which, He is the power of God, and the wisdom of God."
3. "The only true reference of our words, as also that which has been all but universally acknowledged, is that to the Jewish priesthood, and in them to those who have part with them in serving the rites and ordinances of the ceremonial law."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Christianity and Judaism are so totally distinct, that 'they who serve the (Jewish) tabernacle,' have no right to eat our spiritual Gospel meat."
2. "Our meat, which we by faith spiritually eat, is the flesh of Christ, in contrast to the typical ceremonial meats."
3. "That not a literal eating of the sacrifice of Christ is meant in the Lord's Supper, but a spiritual is meant, appears from comparing Hebrews 13:9; Hebrews 13:10, 'with GRACE, NOT with MEATS.'"

### Albert Barnes:

2. "The 'altar' to which he here refers is evidently the cross on which the great sacrifice was made."
3. "The participation in the great Christian sacrifice appertained only to those who were the friends of the Redeemer, and however much they might value themselves on the privilege of partaking of the sacrifices offered under the Jewish Law, that of partaking of the great sacrifice made by the Son of God was much greater."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The statement is cast in the mould of the Jewish sacrificial ritual, and in the figure of eating a sacrificial meal."

3. "To 'eat' of it is to believe that Christ is come in the flesh, and is become an offering for sin, and for us that eat; it is to receive, embrace, and possess the blessings procured by it; which is done by faith, with spiritual joy and gladness, and with sincerity and singleness of heart."
