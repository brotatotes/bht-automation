# Hebrews 13:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The sin-offerings in the Old Testament were completely burned and not eaten by the people, as part of their own law. In this way, they foreshadowed Christ as the ultimate sin-offering, whose suffering and sacrifice extended to all parts of his body and soul. This means that those who still follow the Mosaic law cannot partake in the same way we do, receiving the nourishment and salvation found in Christ.

### Henry Alford:
1. "Our great Sacrifice is not one of those in which the servants of the tabernacle had any share, but answers to one which was wholly taken out and burnt."
2. "No sin-offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile withal in the holy place, shall be eaten: it shall be burnt in the fire."
3. "τὰ ἅγια here, as in ch. Hebrews 9:8 ; Hebrews 9:12 ; Hebrews 9:24-25 ; Hebrews 10:19 , probably means not the holy place commonly so called, but the holy of holies, into which the blood of the sin-offering was brought on the day of atonement, and which only typified heaven, whither Christ as High Priest is entered with His Blood."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Jesus also suffered without the gate" of ceremonial Judaism, of which His crucifixion outside the gate of Jerusalem is a type.
2. His sacrifice is not like one of those sacrifices in which they had a share but answers to one which was "wholly burned" outside (the Greek is "burnt completely," "consumed by burning"), and which consequently they could not eat of.
3. "No sin offering whereof any of the blood is brought into the tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile withal in the holy place, shall be eaten; it shall be burnt in the fire."

### Albert Barnes:
1.

2. "Whose blood is brought into the sanctuary."
3. "Whatever was not lawful to be done in the camp, afterward was not lawful to be done in the city."

2. "The victims for the Day of Atonement were a bullock and two young goats for sin - offerings, and two rams for burnt - offerings."
3. "Burning without the camp was also required in the case of victims offered at the consecration of the priests, Exodus 29:14; at the sin - offering for the priest, Leviticus 4:11, Leviticus 4:12; and at the sin - offering for the congregation, Leviticus 4:21."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The antecedent (ζωων) of ων is here incorporated and attracted into the case of the relative, 'the blood of which beasts' and then τουτων (genitive demonstrative) is added, 'of these.'"

### John Gill:
1. "These beasts were slain, their blood was shed, and was brought into the most holy place, by the high priest; and was sprinkled on the mercy seat, and the horns of the altar of incense; and, by it, atonement was made for the priest, his house, and all Israel; which was a type of the death of Christ; the shedding of his blood; the carrying of it into heaven; the sprinkling it upon the throne of grace and mercy; by which reconciliation is made for the sins of all God's people."
