# Hebrews 13:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus willingly suffered outside the city, arranged by divine providence. His death symbolizes the transformation from the old camp of Israel to the new. His purpose in suffering was to sanctify and make holy the people who believe in Him, bringing complete pardon and perfect righteousness. This sanctification extends beyond internal cleansing to the expiation of guilt. Jesus' sacrifice with His own blood surpasses the effectiveness of the old sacrificial system. His act of sanctification demonstrates His great love for His chosen people and the surpassing value of His redemptive work.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Jesus also, that He might sanctify the people through His own blood, suffered outside the gate."
2. "The offering of Christ consists of two parts: 1. His offering on earth, which was accomplished on the cross, and answered to the slaying of the legal victim and the destruction of its body by fire, the annihilation of the fleshly life; and, 2. His offering in the holy place above, which consisted in His entering heaven, the abode of God, through the veil, that is to say His flesh, and carrying His blood there as a standing atonement for the worldâ€™s sin."
3. "This, the sanctifying of the people through His own blood, was the ulterior end of that sacrifice on earth: and therefore whatever belonged to that sacrifice on earth is said to have been done in order to that other."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "His blood has been brought into the heavenly sanctuary, and 'sanctifies the people'." 
2. "The fiery ordeal of His suffering on the cross, answers to the burning of the victims; thereby His mere fleshly life was completely destroyed, as their bodies were."
3. "The second part of His offering was His carrying His blood into the heavenly holiest before God at His ascension, that it should be a perpetual atonement for the world's sin."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is implied here that it was voluntary on the part of Jesus that he suffered out of the city; that is, it was so ordered by Providence that it should be so."
2. "His death was effected with more deliberation, and in the usual form. Hence, he was conducted out of the city, because no criminal was executed within the walls of Jerusalem."
3. "The place where he was put to death was called Golgotha, the place of a skull, and hence, the Latin word which we commonly use in speaking of it, Calvary."


### Marvin Vincent:
1. "For Christ's work he claims the same efficacy which the Jew claimed for the special call of God to Israel, and for the operation of the Jewish sacrificial system."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'the people' are meant the people who are the objects of divine love and favour; a chosen and covenant people; a distinct and peculiar people." 
2. "The sanctification of them does not design the internal sanctification of them, though this is from Christ, and in consequence of his blood; nor does it so much regard the cleansing of the filth of sin, though Christ's blood sanctifies, in this sense; but rather the expiation of the guilt of sin, which Christ has fully took away; complete pardon being procured, and a perfect righteousness brought in." 
3. "His human nature, being in union with his divine person, as the Son of God, it had a virtue in it, to sanctify and cleanse from all sin, and to make full expiation of it; in shedding of which, and sanctifying with it, he has shown great love to his people."

2. "That he might sanctify... the people - Who believe in him."
3. "By his own blood... not those shadowy sacrifices, which are now of no farther use."
