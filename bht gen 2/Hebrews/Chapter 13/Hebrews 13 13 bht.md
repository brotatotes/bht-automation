# Hebrews 13:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are called to go outside the bounds of worldly conventions and religious systems, boldly embracing the reproach and shame associated with following Christ. This means detaching our affections from the allurements of the world and willingly forsaking all for the sake of Christ. Going forth to Him requires believing in Him, hoping in Him, loving Him, and openly professing our faith in Him despite the scorn and contempt we may face. Christ becomes our full reward, and we find encouragement to leave behind the trappings of the world and faithfully follow Him.
