# Hebrews 13:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For here we have no continuing city, as the earthly Jerusalem proved to be no abiding place. Its destruction marked the end of the Jewish system, a type of the perishable nature of the earthly order of things. Instead, believers are called to seek a city that is to come, a heavenly Jerusalem that will descend as a bride prepared for her husband. While the earthly Jerusalem held temporary significance, our true home and eternal inheritance lie in heaven.
