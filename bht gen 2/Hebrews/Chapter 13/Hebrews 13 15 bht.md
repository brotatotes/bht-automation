# Hebrews 13:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are called to offer a sacrifice of praise through Jesus, acknowledging His role as the Mediator and recognizing that this sacrifice no longer requires adherence to the rituals of the old Jewish law. This sacrifice of praise, the fruit of our lips, is a powerful way to express gratitude for God's redemption and acknowledge His goodness. By offering continuous praise, we honor and worship our Savior, glorifying Him through our acknowledgment of His unending salvation. May we remember that our true sacrifice and worship lie in our devotion to Jesus, the perfect and sufficient Priest and Sacrifice.
