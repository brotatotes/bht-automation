Do not forget to do good and share with others, especially with those in need. This goes beyond mere words of praise, and includes acts of beneficence or communicating to the poor. We should give alms and exercise benevolence to all those in need, not just our friends and family. When we do good in this way, motivated by love and directed towards God's glory, it is well pleasing to Him.
