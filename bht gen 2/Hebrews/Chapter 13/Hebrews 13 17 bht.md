# Hebrews 13:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they watch over and care for your souls. They assume the responsibility of guiding and guarding the flock, ensuring their welfare and spiritual growth. The obligation to obedience is limited to what is right and in accordance with conscience. Their watchful care requires them to give account to God for their faithfulness, which should be a cause for joy rather than grief. Therefore, it is beneficial to respect and submit to them, allowing them to fulfill their duty with gladness and not sorrow.
