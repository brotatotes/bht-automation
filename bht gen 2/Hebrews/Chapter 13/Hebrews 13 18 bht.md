# Hebrews 13:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Honestly, as believers, we are called to pray for one another's well-being. It is crucial that we intercede on behalf of those who are dedicated to living a life of integrity and have a good conscience, guided by the Holy Spirit. This includes leaders and fellow believers who faithfully proclaim the truth of God's Word, without being swayed by the opinions or actions of others. By supporting and praying for them, we affirm their commitment to living honestly and honorably in every aspect of their lives, as God's appointed stewards and ambassadors.
