# Hebrews 13:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ's ministers, like the writer of this letter, may face hindrances that prevent them from being physically present with their people. These hindrances can be the result of external factors, such as opposition from Satan or his followers, which can lead to imprisonment. However, believers are encouraged to pray earnestly for their ministers, that they may be restored to them promptly. It is through the prayers of the congregation that God can make a way for these ministers, ensuring that they are able to overcome any obstacles and rejoin their people.
