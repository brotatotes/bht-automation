# Hebrews 13:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Entertaining strangers should not be overlooked, for it may result in the unknowing hospitality of angels. The biblical narrative suggests that Abraham may have initially perceived the strangers as mere men, but their true nature as angels became evident later on. Today, the act of showing kindness to strangers can yield unexpected blessings, as they might bear God's spiritual message or bring about profound transformations in our lives. Therefore, let us not forget the significance of extending hospitality to those we encounter, as we may unknowingly entertain heavenly messengers in our midst. (75 words)

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Forget not hospitality to strangers... for thereby some unawares entertained angels." 
2. "Certainly it would appear at first sight from the former account, that Abraham regarded the 'three men' from the first as angels: but the contrary view has nothing against it in the narrative."
3. "[The motive of hospitality] is still a real one, inasmuch as angels were the messengers of God’s spiritual purposes, and such messengers may be found in Christian guests, even where least expected."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The motive here urged for doing it is, that by entertaining the stranger we may perhaps be honored with the presence of those whose society will be to us an honor and a blessing."
2. "The influence of such guests in a family is worth more than it costs to entertain them."
3. "Many a parent owes the conversion of a child to the influence of a pious stranger in his family; and the hope that this may occur, or that our own souls may be blessed, should make us ready, at all proper times, to welcome the feet of the stranger to our doors."

### John Calvin:
1. "This office of humanity has also nearly ceased to be properly observed among men."
2. "He rather commends the miserable and the needy to be entertained."
3. "God proved that hospitality was especially acceptable to him, when he rendered such a reward to Abraham and to Lot."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The God they worshipped loves strangers... He had welcomed them when strangers; and now He sometimes sends His messengers, His angels in the disguise of wayfarers, that He may know whether those who bear His name are like Him in their kindness, and that He may reward them as of old." 
2. "Debtors to all the brotherhood, and to others besides, there were some who had strong claims on their sympathy. There were prisoners who were their bonds for Christ's sake and the Gospel's; and in loving tenderness these they were to remember as bound with them."
3. "There were others in afflictions natural to men; these also they were to bear ever in mind as being themselves in the body, and subject to like trials. Loving and prayerful remembrance might bring deliverance, and would certainly comfort their hearts and deepen their thankfulness."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For sympathy with prisoners see Hebrews 10:34."
2. "And so subject to evil treatment. See Hebrews 11:37 for κακουχεω and Hebrews 11:25 for συνκακουχεω."

### John Gill:
1. "By whom are meant, not unconverted men, who are strangers to God and Christ, and the covenants of promise; nor saints, who are as pilgrims and strangers in this world; but such as are of another country, and are unknown..."
2. "...all strangers in distress are meant, and hospitality is to be exercised towards them; which lies negatively in doing nothing to distress them, and positively in providing food, raiment, lodging, c. for them, and in comforting, counselling, and directing them in all matters in which they may stand in need thereof..."
3. "...for thereby some have entertained angels unawares; as Abraham, Genesis 18:1, he knew them not to be angels at first; they appeared as men, and he treated them as such; but they were angels, yea, one of them was Jehovah himself; and hereby he received many favours..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Have entertained angels unawares — So may an unknown guest, even now, be of more worth than he appears, and may have angels attending him, though unseen."
2. "Genesis 18:2; Genesis 19:1."
