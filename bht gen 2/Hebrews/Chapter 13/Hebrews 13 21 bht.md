# Hebrews 13:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are called to be actively engaged in every good work, obeying God's commandments and acting in faith and love for His glory. It is through His grace that we are able to do good works and continue to do them without growing weary. The foundation of all good works is the work of grace in our hearts. Without the presence of God's grace, our efforts lose their true value and effectiveness. Therefore, as we seek to do what is pleasing to God, may we rely on His grace to empower us in every good work we undertake.
