# Hebrews 13:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Salute all your leaders, and all the saints. They from Italy salute you. The apostle's salutation extends to all, without exception, regardless of their status or position. He sends his greeting not only to those within their own community, but also to Italian Christians who may be either with him in Italy or who have traveled from Italy to meet him. It is important to note that Italy, particularly Rome, where the apostle likely was, is a well-known and influential country in Europe, with a significant Christian presence even before Paul's arrival.
