### Henry Alford:
1. "Grace, the grace, viz. of God." 
2. "Where ·º° œáŒ¨œÅŒπœÇ is not put thus barely, as in the similar places of St. Paul, it is always filled up by œÑŒø·ø¶ Œ∫œÖœÅŒØŒøœÖ ( ·º°Œº·ø∂ŒΩ ) ·º∏Œ∑œÉŒø·ø¶ ( œáœÅŒπœÉœÑŒø·ø¶ )." 
3. "·ΩëŒº·ø∂ŒΩ œÄŒ¨ŒΩœÑœâŒΩ would express more the totality of the church: œÄŒ¨ŒΩœÑœâŒΩ ·ΩëŒº·ø∂ŒΩ, every individual."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Paul's characteristic salutation in every one of his other thirteen Epistles, as he says himself... It is found in no Epistle written by any other apostle in Paul's lifetime."
2. "Being known to be his badge, it is not used by others in his lifetime."
3. "The Greek here is, 'The grace (namely, of our Lord Jesus Christ) be with you all.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There is no book of the New Testament more important than this, and of course none whose want would be more perceptible in the canon of the Scriptures."
2. "Every reader of the Old Testament needs such a guide as this Epistle, written by some one who had an intimate acquaintance from childhood with the Jewish system."
3. "This Epistle teaches us why it passed away, and why it can never he restored. It is the true key with which to unlock the Old Testament."

### John Gill:
1. "Grace be with you all, Amen. Which is the apostle's usual salutation in all his epistles..." 
2. "...he wishes renewed discoveries of the love and favour of God; fresh communications of grace from Christ; an abundant supply of the spirit of grace; an increase of internal grace and external gifts; and a continuance of the Gospel of the grace of God." 
3. "The subscription of this epistle is, written to the Hebrews from Italy by Timothy; in the Alexandrian copy it is, 'written to the Hebrews from Rome'; which is very probable, since the Italian brethren send their salutations in it; and the words, 'by Timothy', are left out; nor is it likely that it should, since it is clear, from Hebrews 13:23 that he was absent from the apostle; and if he had sent it by him, what need was there to inform them that he was set at liberty?"

### John Wesley:
1. - Grace be with you all ‚Äî St. Paul's usual benediction. God apply it to our hearts!
