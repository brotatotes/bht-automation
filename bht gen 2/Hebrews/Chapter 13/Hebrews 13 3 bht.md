# Hebrews 13:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We are called to remember those who are in bonds, not only in our prayers, but also by extending our help and support to them. As members of the body of Christ, we are bound together, and should therefore empathize and identify with those who are suffering. We should treat them as if we ourselves were in the same situation, showing compassion and understanding. For we are all connected in the body of Christ, and as such, we should have a fellow feeling and offer our support to those who are enduring similar hardships.
