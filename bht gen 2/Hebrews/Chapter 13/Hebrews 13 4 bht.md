# Hebrews 13:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Marriage is a sacred institution and should be treated with honor by all, whether clergy or laity. The marriage bed is to be kept pure and undefiled, contrary to the false teachings of some who condone immoral acts. Although some may escape human judgment, God will ultimately hold whoremongers and adulterers accountable for their actions.

2. "There are several debateable matters in this verse. First, is it a command or an assertion? The latter view is taken in Syr. 'Honourable is marriage among all, and their bed is undefiled.'"
3. "The imperative view has accordingly been taken by very many Commentators: as e. g. by Thl., and the great mass of moderns. Delitzsch holds that no supplement is wanted, the clause being an exclamation carrying with it a hortatory force. But surely this is equivalent to supplying ἔστω."
