The Lord is my helper, I will not be afraid: what shall man do unto me? In times of uncertainty and threat, we can confidently trust in God without hesitation or doubt.

Our character and disposition should be rooted in faith, contentment, and the assurance that God will never leave nor forsake us. Our help comes from the Lord alone, who is always ready to assist us in our time of need.
