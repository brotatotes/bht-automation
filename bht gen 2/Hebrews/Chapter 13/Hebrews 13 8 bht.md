2. "It was Christ whom these ἡγούμενοι preached, ἐλάλησαν τὸν λόγον τοῦ θεοῦ: Christ who supported them to the end, being the author and finisher of their faith; and He remains still with regard to you..."
3. "ἐχθές refers to the time past, when their ἡγούμενοι passed away from them;  σήμερον to the time present, when the Writer and the readers were living."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Jesus Christ, yesterday and to-day (is) the same, and (shall be the same) unto the ages (that is, unto all ages)." 
2. "The Jesus Christ who supported your spiritual rulers through life even unto their end 'yesterday'... remains still the same Jesus Christ 'to-day,' ready to help you also, if like them you walk by 'faith' in Him."
3. "He who yesterday suffered and died is to-day in glory... so the 'suffering' did not so interrupt the glory of Jesus Christ which was of yesterday, and that which is to-day, as not to continue to be the same."


### Albert Barnes:

2. "The evident design of this independent proposition here is, to encourage them to persevere by showing that their Saviour was always the same; that he who had sustained his people in former times, was the same still, and would be the same forever."
3. "If he were fickle, vacillating, changing in his character and plans; if today he aids his people, and tomorrow will forsake them; if at one time he loves the virtuous, and at another equally loves the vicious; if he formed a plan yesterday which he has abandoned today; or if he is ever to be a different being from what he is now, there would be no encouragement to effort."

### Philip Schaff:
