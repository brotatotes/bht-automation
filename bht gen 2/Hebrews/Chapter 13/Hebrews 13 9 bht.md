# Hebrews 13:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle's admonition to not be swayed by various and strange doctrines reminds us of the dangers of veering from the unchanging truth of Christ's messiahship and the supremacy of His redemptive work. Instead, our hearts should find stability and strength in the grace bestowed upon us through Christ, rather than relying on external rituals or observances that hold no power to truly establish and transform us. It is through the simplicity of the Gospel and the spiritual grace of God that our hearts can be firmly grounded and fortified in the truth.
