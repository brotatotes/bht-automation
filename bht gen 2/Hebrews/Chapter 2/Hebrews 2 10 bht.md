# Hebrews 2:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The sacrifice and suffering of Christ, though it may seem unsuitable or unworthy to some, was actually a fitting and perfect plan determined by God. His suffering was not only the way to His glory but also a necessary process to bring about our redemption. By experiencing suffering and death, Christ was made complete as our Savior. His work on the cross was finished, accomplishing the task of salvation and demonstrating God's love, justice, and wisdom.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The expression here glances at those who found in a suffering and crucified Messiah something unsuitable to the Godhead; and expresses not merely a negative, that it was not unsuitable, not unworthy of God, but at the same time the positive, that it was altogether correspondent to and worthy of His Being and His Wisdom and His Love, to take this course." 
2. "His sufferings were the appointed access to and the appointed elements of, His glory"
3. "His sufferings were the appointed access to and the appointed elements of, His glory"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The whole plan was (not only not derogatory to, but) highly becoming God...This scheme of redemption was altogether such a one as harmonizes with the love, justice, and wisdom of God."
2. "He uses for 'God,' the periphrasis, 'Him for whom...by whom are all things,' to mark the becomingness of Christ's suffering as the way to His being 'perfected' as 'Captain of our salvation,' seeing that His is the way that pleased Him whose will and whose glory are the end of all things."
3. "To make perfect...to bring to consummated glory through sufferings, as the appointed avenue to it...to make perfect as a completed sacrifice: legal and official, not moral, perfection is meant."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was fit, in the nature of the case, that he should be qualified to be 'a complete' or 'perfect Saviour' - a Saviour just adapted to the purpose undertaken, by sufferings."
2. "There was a propriety that he who should redeem the suffering and the lost should partake of their nature; identify himself with them; and share their woes, and the consequences of their sins."
3. "To render him 'complete' as a Saviour, it was necessary that he should suffer and die; and when he hung on the cross in the agonies of death, he could appropriately say, 'it is 'finished.' The work is complete."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The whole course of nature and grace must find its explanation in God; and not merely in an abstract divine arbitnum, but in that which befits the divine nature."
2. "For whom, that is, for whose sake all things exist. God is the final cause of all things."
3. "The "perfecting" of Jesus corresponds to his being "crowned with glory and honor," although it is not a mere synonym for that phrase; for the writer conceives the perfecting not as an act but as a process."

### John Calvin:
1. "We must therefore take heed, lest Christ should be less esteemed, because he willingly humbled himself for us; and this is what is here spoken of."
2. "It does not, however, appear as yet what he intends by saying, that it became Christ to be thus consecrated. But this depends on the ordinary way which God adopts in dealing with his own people; for his will is to exercise them with various trials, so that they may spend their whole life under the cross."
3. "This is the conforming of the head with the members, of which Paul speaks in Romans 8:29. It is indeed a singular consolation, calculated to mitigate the bitterness of the cross, when the faithful hear, that by sorrows and tribulations they are sanctified for glory as Christ himself was; and hence they see a sufficient reason why they should lovingly kiss the cross rather than dread it."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The voluntary humiliation or incarnation of Christ the Son a little lower than the angels was a seemly thing to God the Father."
2. "The universe comes out of God, by means of God, for God."
3. "By means of sufferings, God perfected his Son in his human life and death for his task as Redeemer and Saviour."

### John Gill:
1. "This is not a periphrasis of Christ, who died, but of God the Father, who delivered him to death; and who is the final cause of all things."
2. "the heavenly glory, which they are undeserving of; and which was long ago prepared for them; is at present hid; is weighty, solid, durable, yea, eternal."
3. "Christ is 'the Captain of salvation', and is so called, because he is the author of it; and he is the Prince and Commander of these sons, who are committed to his charge, and are under his care; and is their guide and leader."

### John Wesley:
1. "It became him - It was suitable to all his attributes, both to his justice, goodness, and wisdom."
2. "To perfect the captain - Prince, leader, and author of their salvation, by his atoning sufferings for them."
3. "But unless we were to be made the same sacrifice, and to atone for sin, what is said of him in this respect is as much out of our sphere as his ascension into heaven."
