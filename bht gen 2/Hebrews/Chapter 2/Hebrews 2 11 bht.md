# Hebrews 2:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ, the sanctifier, consecrates His people to God. Through His sufferings, He perfects Himself as their expiatory sacrifice. There is a oneness between Christ and His people, united by a common nature. They are brothers and sisters, sharing the same divine family. This bond brings confidence and assurance, as it is through this union that they find the holiness and sanctification they need. They are of the same nature, from the same parent, Adam, and through Christ, they are brought into the glory of sanctification. Christ, as the sanctifier, is the source of their sanctification and the path to glorification.
