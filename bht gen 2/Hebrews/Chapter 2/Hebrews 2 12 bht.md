# Hebrews 2:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Throughout the generations, Christ has revealed the name of the Father to believers, declaring His gracious and merciful nature. His role as the precentor of the choir is evident as he led the apostles in singing praise to God. This act of praise is not limited to a specific moment in time, but continues to happen through all generations. As believers, we too are called to openly express our gratitude to God and to testify to His goodness, encouraging and inspiring one another in our worship and praise.
