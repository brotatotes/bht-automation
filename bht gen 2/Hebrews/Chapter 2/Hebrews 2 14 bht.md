# Hebrews 2:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The incarnation of Christ demonstrates His infinite love towards humanity, as He voluntarily assumed our nature, making Himself capable of dying. By becoming man, He became our partner, sharing in our flesh and blood. Through His death, Christ destroyed the power of the devil over death, delivering us from the fear and tyranny of both sin and the evil one. His victory over death was not only a defeat for Satan but also a demonstration of His divine power and benevolence. Death, as a servant of the devil, no longer holds dominion over those who are saved by Christ.

2. "He has so delivered us from the tyranny of the devil, that we are rendered safe, and he has so redeemed us from death, that it is no longer to be dreaded." 
3. "He teaches us not only that the tyranny of Satan was abolished by Christ's death, but also that he himself was so laid prostrate, that no more account is to be made of him than as though he were not."
