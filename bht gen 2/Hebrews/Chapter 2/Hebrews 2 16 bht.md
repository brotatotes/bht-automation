# Hebrews 2:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, in His role as the Savior, came not to help angels but to help the descendants of Abraham. He assumed human nature, for it was necessary for Him to be human in order to undertake the work of human redemption. God's promise to Abraham that through his seed all nations would be blessed finds fulfillment in Christ, who takes on the nature of the seed of Abraham. While angels are not in need of deliverance, humanity requires a Savior, and in His mercy and grace, God has provided Jesus to reconcile us and abolish the fear of death.

1. "He did not appropriate the nature of angels. Angels did not need to be delivered from the fear of death."
2. "The entire statement in vers. 16, 17 is not a mere repetition of vers. 14, 15. It carries out the line of thought and adds to it, while at the same time it presents a parallel argument to that in vers. 14, 15."
3. "Jesus steps into the place of the high priest, and perfectly fulfills the priestly office. By his actual participation in the sorrows and temptations of humanity, he is fitted to be a true sympathizer with human infirmity and temptation, a merciful and faithful high priest, making reconciliation for sin, and thus abolishing the fear of death."
