# Hebrews 2:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In order for Jesus to be a merciful and faithful High Priest, he had to be made like us in all things. He took on our nature to sympathize with us and understand our miseries. Through his own experiences of suffering and temptation, he demonstrated his compassion and faithfulness. By becoming a complete and real likeness to humanity, he could fully relate to our struggles and offer us the help and mercy we need. This is why his incarnation and identification with us was necessary for his redemptive purpose.
