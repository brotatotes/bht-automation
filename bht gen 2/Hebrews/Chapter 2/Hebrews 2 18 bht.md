# Hebrews 2:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through His own experience of suffering and temptation, Christ has acquired the ability to provide succor and support to those who are currently facing similar trials. His suffering was not in vain; it gives Him a unique understanding of our struggles and enables Him to sympathize with us in a way that no one else can. When we encounter challenges and temptations, we can take comfort in knowing that Christ is not only aware of our difficulties but is also ready and willing to come to our aid, offering His strength and guidance to help us overcome.
