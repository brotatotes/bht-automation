# Hebrews 2:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Law, delivered by angels, was given authority that demanded strict obedience and left no room for transgression, with even the smallest violation met with punishment. The Gospel, proclaimed by the Son of God Himself, carried even greater honor and authority. The law's limitations and earthly nature were evident in the presence of angels. The Gospel's superiority is demonstrated by its spoken words from the Lord alone. Both the law and the Gospel emphasize the importance of obedience and serve as reminders that disobedience will be met with just consequences.
