# Hebrews 2:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During Christ's earthly ministry, he performed miraculous signs and wonders to testify to the truth of his message. These signs and wonders, along with the various miracles and diverse distributions of the Holy Spirit after his ascension, demonstrate the supernatural power of God at work. It is important to note that these gifts of the Holy Spirit were not according to the recipients' desires, but in accordance with God's will and purpose.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Signs and wonders—performed by Christ and His apostles. 'Signs' and miracles, or other facts regarded as proofs of a divine mission 'wonders' are miracles viewed as prodigies, causing astonishment."
2. "Divers miracles—Greek, 'varied (miraculous) powers,' granted to the apostles after the ascension."
3. "Gifts, c.—Greek, 'distributions.' The gift of the Holy Spirit was given to Christ without measure, but to us it is distributed in various measures and operations."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "No man can work a miracle by his own power. When the dead are raised, the deaf made to hear and the blind to see by a word, it is the power of God alone that does it."
2. "The various influences of the Holy Spirit enabling them to speak different languages, and to perform works beyond the power of man."
3. "The gospel has been promulgated to man in a solemn manner. It was first published by the Lord of glory himself. It was confirmed by the most impressive and solemn miracles. It is undoubtedly a revelation from heaven; was given in more solemn circumstances than the Law of Moses, and its threatenings are more to be dreaded than those of the Law. Beware, therefore, how you trifle with it, or disregard it. It cannot be neglected with safety; its neglect or rejection must be attended with condemnation."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "With signs and wonders, a very common combination in N. T."
2. "Powers signifies, not the miraculous manifestations, as signs and wonders, but the miraculous energies of God as displayed in his various forms of witness."
3. "Distributions of the one gift of the Holy Spirit in different measure and in different ways, according to his will."

### John Calvin:
1. "Then they who do not reverently receive the Gospel recommended by such testimonies, disregard not only the word of God, but also his works."
2. "He designates miracles, for the sake of amplifying their importance, by three names. They are called signs because they rouse men’s minds, that they may think of something higher that what appears; and wonders, because they present what is rare and unusual; and miracles, because the Lord shows in them a singular and an extraordinary evidence of his power."
3. "For almost all the miracles done in all ages were performed as we find for this end, that they might be the seals of Gods word."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "God also bearing them witness, i.e God bearing witness with them to the Gospel they preached, confirming their word by the signs that followed." 
2. "With signs, wonders, and miracles. This is the threefold division of the miraculous acts which prove the superhuman mission of those who work them."
