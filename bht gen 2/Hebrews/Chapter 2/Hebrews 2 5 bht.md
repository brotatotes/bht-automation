# Hebrews 2:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The world we live in today, under the dispensation of the Messiah, is not subjected to the authority of angels but to Christ, the Son of God. This new order, the salvation brought by Christ, is part of God's original purpose for creation. The world to come, the new dispensation under the Messiah, is not in the control of angels. Instead, Christ has been given the sovereignty over the whole world. Believers are called to look to Him and obey Him, as He has been exalted above angels and entrusted with the kingdom of God.
