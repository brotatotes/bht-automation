# Hebrews 2:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, the apostle brings forward a testimony to confirm his assertion that the Gospel is not subject to angels, but to the Messiah. These words of dominion have a partial application to Adam, but their full and highest meaning can only be attributed to the second Adam, Christ. It is believed that David composed the psalm during a serene night illuminated by the moon and stars, allowing him to reflect on the magnificent creation of the heavens. The act of visiting signifies the constant care and attention of God, even in His absence.

### Henry Alford:
1. "Whatever high and glorious things can be said of man, belong de proprio jure to Him only, propri√¢ person√¢ to Him only, but derivatively to us His brethren and members."
2. "To those who clearly apprehend and firmly hold this fundamental doctrine of Christianity, the interpretation of ancient prophecy, and the N. T. application of O. T. sayings to Christ, become a far simpler matter than they ever can be to others."
3. "The whole process of this second chapter stands without parallel for tender persuasiveness amidst the strictest logical coherence."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The usual way of quoting Scripture to readers familiar with it. :- praises Jehovah for exalting MAN, so as to subject all the works of God on earth to him: this dignity having been lost by the first Adam, is realized only in Christ the Son of man, the Representative Man and Head of our redeemed race."
2. "What, &c.‚ÄîHow insignificant in himself, yet how exalted by God's grace!"
3. "The Hebrew, 'Enosh' and 'Ben-Adam,' express 'man' and 'Son of man' in his weakness: 'Son of man' is here used of any and every child of man... and such as he actually is by title and shall hereafter more fully be in the person of, and in union with, Jesus, pre-eminently the Son of man."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The 'argument' of the apostle is this, that there stood in the sacred Scriptures a declaration that 'all things were placed under the control and jurisdiction of man,' but that that had not yet been accomplished."
2. "The argument of Paul seems to be this: Originally this control was given to man. It was absolute and entire. All things were subject to him, and all obeyed."
3. "The wonder is not yet solved; and we may well suppose that the angelic ranks look with amazement - but without envy - on the fact that 'man,' by his union with the Deity in the person of the Lord Jesus, has been raised above them in rank and in glory."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "What is man. The Hebrew interrogation, mah, what, what kind of, implies 'how small or insignificant' compared with the array of the heavenly bodies; not 'how great is man.'"
2. "The son of man. Hebrew son of Adam, with a reference to his earthly nature as formed out of the dust. Very often in Ezekiel as a form of address to the prophet."
3. "He who has been described as superior to the angels, was, for a short time, on the same plane with man, and identified with an economy which was under the administration of angels. This temporary subordination to angels was followed by permanent elevation over them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is human nature that is thus honoured human nature, not probably in its original state, but as subject to death because of sin, the chief quality in which angels excel men."
2. "A little lower may (in the Hebrew and Greek) mean a little in degree, or for a little [time]. If spoken of man as originally created, it means a little; if spoken of man as humbled, brought down through sin and the penalty due to it, and spoken of Christ as incarnate, it may mean for a little."
3. "Both senses are true of man as fallen and redeemed, and of Christ as incarnate and suffering."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "But one somewhere (Œ¥Œµ œÄŒøœÖ œÑŒπœÇ)... Hath testified (Œ¥ŒπŒµŒºŒ±œÅœÑœÖœÅŒ±œÑŒø)." 
2. "The insignificance of man is implied."
3. "Visited (ŒµœÄŒπœÉŒ∫ŒµœÄœÑŒ∑). Second person singular present indicative middle of ŒµœÄŒπœÉŒ∫ŒµœÄœÑŒøŒºŒ±, old verb to look upon, to look after, to go to see (Matthew 25:36), from which verb ŒµœÄŒπœÉœáŒøœÄŒøœÇ, overseer, bishop, comes."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle produces a passage, as a witness and testimony of the truth of what he had said, that the Gospel dispensation is not put in subjection to angels, but to the Messiah."
2. "This is not to be understood of mankind in general: not of man in a state of innocence; there were no babes nor sucklings in paradise, nor enemies to restrain; 'Enosh', the word for man, signifies a frail mortal man, which Adam then was not; nor could he be called the son of man."
3. "What is said of [Christ] suits with him, as that God was 'mindful of him';... of his unction of it, and of his great regard to it in its sufferings, by supporting it, and in raising it from the dead."

### John Wesley:
1. "This psalm seems to have been composed by David, in a clear, moonshiny, and starlight night, while he was contemplating the wonderful fabric of heaven."
2. "The words here cited concerning dominion were doubtless in some sense applicable to Adam; although in their complete and highest sense, they belong to none but the second Adam."
3. "The sense rises: we are mindful of him that is absent; but to visit, denotes the care of a present God."
