# Hebrews 2:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Man, in his original creation, was set next beneath the angels, almost reaching their rank in glory and honor. This elevated position shows that God greatly honored and exalted human nature. However, the writer of Hebrews applies these words to Jesus Christ, who, as the Son of God, was made a little lower than the angels through His incarnation. Through His sufferings and death, Jesus experienced a temporary state of abasement, but He was ultimately crowned with glory and honor. This alludes to His pre-existent glory as God and highlights His triumphant victory over sin and death.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Man, in his original creation, was set next beneath them."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The meaning is, that God had made man but little inferior to the angels in rank. He was inferior, but still God had exalted him almost to their rank."
2. "The wonder of the Psalmist is, that God had given to human nature so much honor - a wonder that is not at all diminished when we think of the honor done to man by his connection with the divine nature in the person of the Lord Jesus."
3. "Glory and honor here are nearly synonymous. The meaning is, that elevated honor had been conferred on human nature. A most exalted and extended dominion had been given to 'man,' which showed that God had greatly honored him."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Apostle seems now to turn the words from that meaning in which David understood them; for a little, Œ≤œÅŒ±œá·Ωª œÑŒπ seems to refer to time, as it means a little while, and designates the abasement of Christ's humiliation."
2. "The meaning of David is this, - 'O Lord, thou hast raised man to such a dignity, that it differs but little from divine or angelic honor; for he is set a ruler over the whole world.'"
3. "He only bids us to consider the abasement of Christ, which appeared for a short time, and then the glory with which he is perpetually crowned; and this he does more by alluding to expressions than by explaining what David understood."

3. "Thou crownest him with glory and honour; with that glory he had with the Father before the world was, and which followed upon his sufferings and death."

### John Wesley:
