# Hebrews 2:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The universal dominion bestowed upon man by God is evident in the fact that all things have been put under his control without exception. However, the complete manifestation of this dominion is not yet visible to us. It is important to note that this subjection encompasses everything, voluntary and involuntary, leaving nothing outside of Christ's authority. Although we may not witness this fulfillment at present, we can be confident that in due time, every aspect of creation will be subjected to man, as originally intended by God.
