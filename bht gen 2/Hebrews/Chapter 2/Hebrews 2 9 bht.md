# Hebrews 2:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, in his humanity, was made lower than the angels and suffered death. This fulfilled the words that spoke of mankind's dominion but was uniquely applicable to Jesus. Through his death, Jesus has conquered death and is now crowned with glory and honor. His exaltation is the perfect completion of his work for us, as his death now has the power to save every person. By the grace of God, he tasted death for every man, revealing the immeasurable love of God in sparing not even his own Son.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But rather, Him who was made a little lower than the angels, we behold (by faith) Jesus, on account of His suffering of death, crowned." 
2. "His exaltation after sufferings is the perfecting or consummation of His work for us: without it His death would have been ineffectual; with it, and from it, flows the result that His tasting of death is available for every man."
3. "He is crowned as the Head in heaven of our common humanity, presenting His blood as the all-prevailing plea for us."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We do not see that mankind has the extended dominion of which the Psalmist speaks elsewhere. But we see the fulfillment of it in Jesus, who was crowned with glory and honor, and who has received a dominion that is superior to that of the angels."
2. "The object of the apostle is, to show that he was 'exalted,' and in order to this he shows why it was - to wit, because he had suffered death to redeem man."
3. "We feel that it is an honor to human nature - that it has done much to elevate man - when we look on such a man as Howard or Washington. But how much more has that nature been honored in the person of the Lord Jesus!"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "To be subordinated to the angels is the same as being 'made under the law,' Galatians 4:4."
2. "The subjection to elemental spirits is only another form of subjection to the angels of the law, and our author uses this doctrine to show the mutable nature of angels in contrast with the immutable perfection of the Son."
3. "Christ's exaltation and preeminence over the angels was won through humiliation and death. For crowned, see on 2 Timothy 2:5. Exaltation was the logical result of Christ's humiliation, not simply its recompense."

### John Calvin:
1. "He presents to our meditation the glory after the resurrection, which David extends to all the gifts by which man is adorned by God’s bounty."
2. "By saying for every man, he means not only that he might be ample to others, as Chrysostom says, who brings the example of a physician tasting first a bitter draught, that the patient might not refuse to drink it; but he means that Christ died for us, and that by taking upon him what was due to us, he redeemed us from the curse of death."
3. "For the cause of redemption was the infinite love of God towards us, through which it was that he spared not even his own Son."

### John Gill:
1. "Jesus became lower than the angels, by, or through suffering death; in that respect he was lower than they, who die not; this proved him to be in a condition below them, and showed how pertinent the above words were to him, and how they were fulfilled in him."

### John Wesley:
1. "It is done only with regard to Jesus, God-Man, who is now crowned with glory and honour - As a reward for his having suffered death."
2. "He was made a little lower than the angels — Who cannot either suffer or die."
3. "That by the grace of God, he might taste death — An expression denoting both the reality of his death, and the shortness of its continuance."
