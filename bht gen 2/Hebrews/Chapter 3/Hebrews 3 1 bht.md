# Hebrews 3:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Apostle calls upon the holy brethren, the partakers of a heavenly calling, to contemplate and fully understand the character of Christ as both the Apostle and High Priest. They are urged to fix their eyes and minds on Him, for He is the true messenger from God, pleading our cause with Him. Christ's calling is heavenly, originating from and leading to heaven, and it is through His grace that we are called. As the Apostle and High Priest, Christ surpasses both Moses and Aaron in his role, combining their offices in a far more eminent way.
