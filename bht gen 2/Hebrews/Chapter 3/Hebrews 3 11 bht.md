# Hebrews 3:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's oath preceded the forty years, signifying a strong affirmation and determined purpose. The punishment of their madness was being deprived of the promised rest. Their expulsion from the land was a result of their continuous offenses and inability to be restored to a sound mind. Swearing by himself, God assured the certainty of the spoken thing. The threatened evil was inevitable, and the land of Canaan served as God's rest for the Israelites.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The oath of God preceded the forty years."
2. "The threat extended farther than the exclusion of the unbelieving from the literal land of rest."
3. "The rest promised to the believing in its full blessedness was, and is, yet future."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "God is often represented in the Scriptures as 'swearing' - and usually as swearing by himself, or by his own existence. Of course this is figurative, and denotes a strong affirmation, or a settled and determined purpose."
2. "The word 'if' has this negative meaning in Hebrew, and this meaning is transferred to the Greek word 'if.' It is called 'my rest' here, meaning that it was such rest as God had provided, or such as he enjoyed."

### John Calvin:

### Philip Schaff:
1. Hebrews 3:11. So; rather ‘as,’ though without much difference in meaning: the acts corresponded to the punishment is the meaning of ‘as;’ the punishment corresponded to the acts is the meaning of so. The former is the common meaning of the Greek.
