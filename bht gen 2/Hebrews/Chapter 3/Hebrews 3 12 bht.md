# Hebrews 3:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Take heed of the danger of unbelief, for it is an evil heart that does not believe. The Israelites' rebellion serves as a solemn warning to us. Unbelief, the first sin of man, defiles the conscience, hardens the heart, and renders the word unprofitable. So let us not depart from the living God, for to apostatize from Christ is to apostatize from God Himself, the source of all our life and blessings.

### Henry Alford:
1. "This logical account of the construction is plainer when a past tense is concerned: as in Thuc. iii. 53, φοβούμεθα μὴ ἀμφοτέρων ἅμα ἡμαρτήκαμεν, 'We fear lest (that, in English idiom) we have missed both at once.'"
2. "This is plain, from the consideration that ἀπιστία is, throughout, the leading idea, cf. Hebrews 3:19, and ch. Hebrews 4:3, and not the καρδία πονηρά."
3. "By using this solemn title of God, he not only warns them from Whom, and at what risk, they would depart, but also identifies the God whom they would leave, with Him who had so often called Himself by this name as the distinctive God of Israel."
