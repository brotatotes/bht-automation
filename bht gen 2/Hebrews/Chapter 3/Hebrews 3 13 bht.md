# Hebrews 3:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The day of grace is limited, and we must not delay in carrying out our Christian duties. We should exhort and encourage one another in the faith to guard against Satan's temptations. The time is near for the coming of the Lord, so we must remain steadfast and avoid being led astray. The deceitfulness of sin can deceive us and harden our hearts, so we must be vigilant. Let us diligently pursue holiness and encourage one another in love and truth, for the day of grace will soon come to an end. (97 words)

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Let there not be...one another,...but exhort yourselves." 
2. "In the Church one should exhort another: yet not excluding the implication, that each one should himself be exhorted by his exhortation of the Church." 
3. "That period would be here, the day of grace; the short time before the coming of the Lord."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "let each exhort himself and his neighbor."
2. "To-morrow is Satan's to-day; he cares not what good resolutions you form, if only you fix them for to-morrow."
3. "deceitfulness‚Äîcausing you to err in your heart."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "While this is the special duty of the ministers of the gospel...it is also the duty of all the members of the churches, and a most important, but much-neglected duty."
2. "There is a vast amount of ‚Äúspiritual capital‚Äù of this kind in the church that is unemployed, and that might be made eminently useful in helping others to heaven."
3. "The fact of church membership should inspire such confidence as to make it proper for one member to exhort another whom he sees going astray. Belonging to the same family; having the same interest in religion; and all suffering when one suffers, why should they not be allowed tenderly and kindly to exhort one another to a holy life?"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "It is the day of grace, while salvation through Christ is still attainable."
2. "The warning is against being hardened by a trick which their sin may play them."
3. "The particular deceit in this case would be the illusion of faithfulness to the past."

### John Calvin:
1. "He would have us then to stimulate one another by mutual exhortations, so that Satan may not creep into our hearts."
2. "We must then meet this danger in due time, and it is one that is nigh us all, for nothing is more possible than to be deceived; and from this deception comes at length hardness of heart."
3. "The particle while, then, or as long as, intimates that, The seasonable time will not continue always, if we be too slothful to follow when the Lord calls us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "mutual exhortation is implied; but the Greek is literally ‚Äòexhort yourselves,‚Äô and part of the idea is that the exhorter should have himself also as a hearer, even when he has no other."
2. "While as long as ‚Äòthe today‚Äô is called sounded in your hearing, so long as the warning lasts, and the need for it, let there be circumspection and wariness."
3. "The deceitfulness of sin. All sin has this quality...and especially the sin of unbelief, which is the sin of this context."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "So long as it is called today" - The only instance in the N.T. of this conjunction (Œ±œáœÅ or Œ±œáœÅŒπœÇ or Œ±œáœÅŒπœÇ ŒøœÖ, etc.) with the present indicative in the sense of "so long as" or "while" like ŒµœâœÇ.
2. "Lest any one of you be hardened" - Negative purpose clause with ŒπŒΩŒ± ŒºŒ∑ (that not) and the first aorist passive subjunctive of œÉŒ∫ŒªŒ∑œÅœÖŒΩœâ, the vivid verb from verse Hebrews 3:8.
3. "By the deceitfulness of sin" - Instrumental case Œ±œÄŒ±œÑŒ∑ (trick, fraud) as is always the case with sin (Romans 7:11; 2 Thessalonians 2:10). Apostasy (Hebrews 12:4) is their peril and it is a trick of sin.

### John Gill:
1. "The saints may...comfort one another by discoursing together about divine things; by praying together; by instructing one another in the doctrines of the Gospel; by putting one another in mind of the covenant of grace, and its promises." 
2. "It ought not to be neglected by private believers; who ought...to a believing view and consideration of Christ, the apostle and high priest of it; and to a due concern for his truth and interest."
3. "This should be done in love, with good and consolatory words, and in things, in which the saints are concerned, and do themselves regard; and it is an affair which requires prudence and faithfulness."

### John Wesley:
1. "The day of life will end soon, and perhaps the day of grace yet sooner."
