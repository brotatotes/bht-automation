# Hebrews 3:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For we have received Christ and have become united with him, sharing in his blessings. However, this union is conditional, contingent on our faith remaining steadfast until the end. This is emphasized as a necessary requirement for true Christianity. As believers, we should not be deceived, thinking that we have already attained all that there is to gain in Christ. Instead, we must continue to grow and progress in our faith, striving for perfection until the very end.
