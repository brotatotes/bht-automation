# Hebrews 3:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Israelites who were delivered from Egypt by Moses, the elect people of God, are a cautionary example. Although they witnessed great miracles and were chosen by God, their unbelief and disobedience caused them to be excluded from the Promised Land. This serves as a warning to Christians that even after experiencing God's deliverance, they must be cautious and avoid falling into the traps of unbelief and disobedience. We must take heed, lest we too provoke God and perish in our sins.

2. "Howbeit not all. Wrong. The interrogation should be continued. Who were they? But why do I ask? Were they not all who came out of Egypt by Moses? They were so numerous that they practically constituted the whole generation of the exodus."

2. "Nay, did not all (αλλ' ου παντες). 'A favourite device of the diatribe style' (Moffatt), answering one rhetorical question with another (Luke 17:8) as in verses Hebrews 3:17; Hebrews 3:18."
