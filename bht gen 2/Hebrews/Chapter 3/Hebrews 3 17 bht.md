# Hebrews 3:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Israelites' sins angered God, just as our own sins can anger Him. Their fall serves as a cautionary tale, highlighting the danger of unbelief. Their rebellion prevented them from experiencing God's kindness and led them to sin. Each sin is an act of disobedience and contempt towards God. The punishment they received was a result of their collective transgressions, reminding us that sin, in any form, grievously affects our relationship with God.
