# Hebrews 3:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Their failure to enter the promised land was attributed to their disobedience, a practical unbelief. The danger lies not only in inconsistency or lack of obedience, but in the rejection of the Gospel itself. Unbelief is as much disobedience as the breaking of any other Divine law. It is a source of sin and a cause for judgment, greatly provoking God.
