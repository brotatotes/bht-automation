# Hebrews 3:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Israelites' inability to enter the promised land serves as a striking testimony to the destructive power of unbelief. Their distrust in God's power and providence ultimately resulted in their downfall and prevented them from experiencing the rest that God had prepared for them. The Apostle uses this example to emphasize the detrimental nature of unbelief and the sobering consequences it can bring. It serves as a stern reminder for us to place our complete trust in God and live a life marked by faith.
