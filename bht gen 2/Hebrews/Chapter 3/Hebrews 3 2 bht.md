# Hebrews 3:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus is commended for His faithfulness in fulfilling His apostleship and teaching role assigned to Him by the Father. His faithfulness is important for the well-being of the Church, just as Moses' faithfulness was crucial for the people of Israel. However, Jesus is portrayed as superior to Moses, faithfully carrying out His role as the Son over the house of God. This emphasizes the unique trust placed in Jesus by God and His faithful stewardship over the Church.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Jesus, whose character it is, that He is πιστός . For the strict present would, to say nothing of other objections, not apply to the ἀπόστολον portion of the Lord’s office, but only to the ἀρχιερέα." 
2. "That regarded more the sacerdotal, this regards the apostolic office of Christ) to him that made him."

### John Calvin:
1. "This is a commendation of the apostleship of Christ, in order that the faithful may securely acquiesce in him; and he commends it on two grounds, because the Father has set him to be over us as our teacher, and because Christ himself has faithfully performed the office committed to him."
2. "To the calling of God is added the faithful and upright performance of duty on the part of Christ; and this is required in true ministers, in order that they may obtain credence in the Church."
3. "The words, in all his house, may be applied to Moses; but I prefer to apply them to Christ, as he may be said to be faithful to his Father in ruling his whole house. It hence follows, that none belong to the Church of God except those who acknowledge Christ."
