# Hebrews 3:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ, being the builder of the house, deserves more glory than the house itself or any individual within it. He is worthy of this honor given to him by God, angels, and men. He surpasses Moses in both his role as a Savior and as a prophet, offering not just temporal but eternal salvation and declaring the mind and will of God in a way that Moses never did.
