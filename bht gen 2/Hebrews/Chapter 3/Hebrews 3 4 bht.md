## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The last verse brings before us Christ as the κατασκευαστής of the house of God. And this He is, in whatever sense οἶκος be taken: whether on the narrower sense which best suits this present comparison, or in the wider sense implied by the faithful centurion in Matthew 8:9, in which all natural powers are His οἰκέται."
2. "But He is this not by independent will or agency. διʼ οὗ καὶ ἐποίησεν τοὺς αἰῶνας, is our Writer’s own language of the creation by Christ: and it is in accord with that of St. John, where he says πάντα διʼ αὐτοῦ ἐγένετο."
3. "So that this verse is not quasiparenthetic, as almost all the recent expositors make it... but distinctly part of the argument."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Someone must be the establisher of every house."
2. "Christ, as being instrumentally the Establisher of all things, must be the Establisher of the house, and so greater than Moses."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Every family must have a founder; every dispensation an author; every house a builder."
2. "The Lord Jesus is worthy of more honor than Moses. He is so, as the maker of a house deserves more honor than the house."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The verb includes not only erection, but furnishing with the entire equipment."
2. "The application of built or established to Christ is guarded against possible misapprehension."
3. "The special foundership of Christ does not contradict or exclude the general foundership of God."

### John Calvin:
1. "We are then to understand that nothing is done in the Church which ought not to he ascribed to Gods power."
2. "He alone has founded it by his own hand and Paul says of Christ that he is the head, from whom the whole body, joined together and connected by every subservient juncture, makes an increase according to what is done proportionally by every member."
3. "Hence he often declares that the success of his ministry was God’s work."
