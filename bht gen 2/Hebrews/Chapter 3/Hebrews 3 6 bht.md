# Hebrews 3:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ, as the Son and heir, surpasses Moses who was a servant in God's house. We, as the family of God, can also hold this position by holding fast to our hope in Christ and the fulfillment of God's kingdom in him. Our confidence in God and our joyful faith are essential to realizing the divine promises. As God's house, we must not waver in our faith but continue to hold onto our hope until the end. By doing so, we can confidently claim our place as part of the family of Christ.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The entire group of words, kauchma ground of glorying, kauchsiv act of glorying, and kaucasqai to glory, is peculiarly Pauline. Outside of the Pauline letters kaucasqai occurs only James 1:9; James 4:16; kauchsiv only James 4:16; and kauchma only here. The thought here is that the condition of being and continuing the house of God is the holding fast of the hope in Christ (ejlpidov of the object of hope) and in the consummation of God 's kingdom in him; making these the ground of boasting, exultantly confessing and proclaiming this hope." 
2. "There must be, not only confidence, but joyful confidence. Comp. Romans 5:3; Ephesians 3:12, Ephesians 3:13; Philippians 3:3."

### Philip Schaff:
