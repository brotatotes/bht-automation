# Hebrews 3:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the people of Israel engaged in strife and murmuring, they not only provoked God but also tempted Him by doubting His power and goodness. This combination of provocation and temptation reflects the rebellious nature of their hearts, which were hardened towards God. This hardened state can be both a result of their own actions and a manifestation of their resistance to His grace. Rather than submitting to God, they chose to reject His voice and follow their own obstinate ways.
