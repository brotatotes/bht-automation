# Hebrews 3:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the wilderness where God's people were tempted, they forgot His power and put His patience to the test. Despite witnessing His mighty works, they shamelessly rebelled and provoked Him to anger. They tempted God and disregarded His punishment and great mercy, becoming even more guilty. It is a solemn reminder that we should not boast in our ancestors' faith but instead heed the lessons of their sin and punishment, turning our hearts to the voice and Gospel of Christ.
