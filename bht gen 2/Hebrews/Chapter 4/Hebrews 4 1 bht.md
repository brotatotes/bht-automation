# Hebrews 4:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
There is a rest that awaits us in heaven, beyond the types and shadows of the land of Canaan. It is not just a physical rest, but a rest of the soul and body, where we will be free from labor and the troubles of this world. This rest is God's provision for us in the New Testament, which we enter by faith and a confession of our belief in Him.

2.
