# Hebrews 4:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our ultimate happiness lies in being united with God and molded into His likeness, finding rest from our toils and anxieties. Let us not grieve improperly for those who have departed to heaven, for they have found rest in the arms of God. May we strive to enter into this rest, running forward and continually growing closer to our Savior. Let us find peace and joy in the rest that Christ offers, freeing us from the need to seek our own righteousness and bringing harmony between us and God.
