# Hebrews 4:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In order to avoid falling into perdition, it is important to recognize that the rest being discussed here is not the eternal rest that is obtained through works. Instead, it refers to the Gospel rest, which believers can enter into in the present moment. While it is true that believers may stumble and experience a temporary loss of faith, they cannot ultimately fall away because they are preserved by the power of God. Therefore, let us remain diligent and vigilant, striving earnestly to enter into this rest through a steadfast faith in Christ.
