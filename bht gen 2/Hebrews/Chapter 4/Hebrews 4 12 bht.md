# Hebrews 4:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The word of God is not to be taken lightly, for it has a judicial power that can bring judgment and exclusion. It is a double-edged sword that judges and searches the deepest parts of the heart, dividing the soul and spirit. This truth is all-penetrating and searching, bringing to light the thoughts and intents of the heart. The word of God lays bare self-deceptions and exposes hidden sins, revealing the truth and bringing about judgment and discernment. It is living and powerful, sharp and penetrating, discerning the intentions and thoughts of every individual.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The qualities here attributed to the word of God, and the whole context, show that it is regarded in its JUDICIAL power, whereby it doomed the disobedient Israelites to exclusion from Canaan, and shall exclude unbelieving so-called Christians from the heavenly rest."
2. "Its double power seems to be implied by its being 'two-edged.' 'It judges all that is in the heart, for there it passes through, at once punishing [unbelievers] and searching [both believers and unbelievers].' [CHRYSOSTOM]"
3. "The word of God divides the closely joined parts of man's immaterial being, soul and spirit, and penetrates to the innermost parts of the spirit. 'The dividing of the soul from the spirit' answers to the 'joints' which the sword, when it reaches unto, divides asunder, as the 'spirit' answers to the innermost 'marrow'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The truth of God is all-penetrating and searching, and that the real thoughts and intents of the heart will be brought to light, and that if there is insincerity and self-deception there can be no hope of escape."
2. "The Word of God is 'what God speaks' - whether it be a promise or a threatening; whether it be Law or gospel; whether it be a simple declaration or a statement of a doctrine."
3. "The truth of God will detect the feelings of the hypocrite and self-deceiver. They cannot always conceal their emotions, and the time will come when truth, like light poured into the soul, will reveal their unbelief and their secret sins."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word of God has an incisive and penetrating quality. It lays bare self - delusions and moral sophisms." 
2. "The form of expression is poetical, and signifies that the word penetrates to the inmost recesses of our spiritual being as a sword cuts through the joints and marrow of the body. The separation is not of one part from another, but operates in each department of the spiritual nature."
3. "The word carries on the thought of dividing. From krinein to divide or separate, which runs into the sense of judge, the usual meaning in N. T., judgment involving the sifting out and analysis of evidence. In kritikov the ideas of discrimination and judgment are blended. Vulg. discretor. Of the thoughts and intents of the heart."

### John Calvin:
1. "Whenever the Lord addresses us by his word, he deals seriously with us, in order that he may touch all our inmost thoughts and feelings; and so there is no part of our soul which ought not to be roused."
2. "The word of God, then, is far from being so efficacious towards them as to penetrate into them to the dividing of the soul and the spirit."
3. "All our faculties ought to be open to receive his word; for he would not have his word scattered in vain, so as to disappear or to fall neglected on the ground, but he would have it effectually to constrain the consciences of men, so as to bring them under his authority."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The word of God...true of any real word of God."
2. "The Logos of God is personified...where Jesus is pictured as the Logos on a par with God."
3. "God's word like his eye sees the secret lurking doubt and unbelief 'of the thoughts and intents of the heart'."

### John Gill:
1. "For the word of God is quick and powerful...he is the living God; he is the living Redeemer and Mediator, and he lives forever." 
2. "And sharper than any two-edged sword...he pierces the hearts of men, cuts them to the quick, and lays them open. Jehovah is called a two-edged sword...and Philo the Jew speaks of the flaming sword of the Logos." 
3. "And is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart; Christ knows what is in man; he is the searcher of the hearts, and the trier of the reins of the children of men; and this will be more apparent at the last day, when he will make manifest the counsels of the heart, and will critically inquire, and accurately judge of them."

### John Wesley:
1. "The word of God...is living and powerful, attended with the power of the living God, and conveying either life or death to the hearers." 
2. "Sharper than any two-edged sword, penetrating the heart more than this does the body, piercing...the inmost recesses of the mind."
3. "[The word of God] is a discerner, not only of the thoughts, but also of the intentions."
