# Hebrews 4:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Having a great high priest is significant, as he is superior to the Levitical priests and fulfills their role. He surpasses them in honor and greatness, being the eternal Son of God. Our high priest has gone through the heavens, accomplishing his redemptive work and entering into God's immediate presence. He serves as our mediator and advocate, interceding on our behalf and granting us access to God. His priesthood is a source of comfort and assurance, as he supports and cares for us in our journey of faith.

1. "The 'object' is to show that Christians have a great High Priest as really as the Jews had; to show wherein he surpassed the Levitical priesthood; to show how all that was said of the Aaronic priesthood, and all the types pertaining to that priesthood, were fulfilled in the Lord Jesus."
2. "In no part of the Bible can there be found so full an account of the design of the Mosaic institutions, as in Heb. 5â€“10 of this Epistle; and were it not for this, the volume of inspiration would be incomplete."

1. "Emphasizing Christ's priestly character to Jewish readers, as superior to that of the Levitical priests. He is holding up the ideal priesthood."

3. "The name Jesus applied to the high priest is forcible as recalling the historical, human person, who was tempted like his brethren. We are thus prepared for what is said in Hebrews 4:15 concerning his sympathizing character."

2. "Jesus has passed through the upper heavens up to the throne of God where he performs his function as our high priest. This idea will be developed later."
3. "The exhortation to the Jewish Christians to hold on to the confession of Christ already made. Before making the five points of Christ's superior priestly work, the author gives a double exhortation like that in Hebrews 2:1-4 to hold fast to the high priest and to make use of him."
