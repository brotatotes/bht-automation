# Hebrews 4:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our High Priest is not distant and unfeeling, but one who can sympathize with us in our weaknesses and temptations. He shares in our experiences and understands the challenges we face. His sympathy is not only compassionate but is also accompanied by his support and deliverance. Despite being tempted in every way, he remained sinless, with no inherent sin in him to be stirred by temptation. Therefore, he is not only able to understand us but also able to help us overcome sin in our own lives.
