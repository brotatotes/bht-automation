# Hebrews 4:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Approach confidently to the throne of grace, where we find God seated as a merciful sovereign ready to dispense compassion and grace for our every need. We can come boldly, not relying on our own merits, but on the sufficient sacrifice of Jesus. This access to God is the essence of our faith, where we find forgiveness for our past sins and obtain the grace we need for present and future trials. The throne of grace is not a place of judgment, but a place where we experience the free favor and power of God.
