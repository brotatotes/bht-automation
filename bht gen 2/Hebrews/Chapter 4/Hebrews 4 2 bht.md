# Hebrews 4:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Gospel is the good news and glad tidings of salvation by Christ, preached to us and to them alike. It brings the message of rest and promises for those who believe. However, merely hearing the Gospel is not enough; it must be received and mixed with faith in order to truly benefit from it. The word heard, if not united with faith, brings no profit and can even lead to increased damnation. So, let us not only hear the Gospel, but also receive it with faith and allow it to have its saving power in our lives.
