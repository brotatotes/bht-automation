# Hebrews 4:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are certain to enter into a rest, not the eternal rest in heaven, but a spiritual rest in Christ under the Gospel dispensation. This rest is a relief from the burden of the law of Moses and the toil and labor of seeking salvation by works. It is an inward peace of the soul, experienced amidst worldly troubles and temptations. This rest is reserved for us, as there remains an eternal rest in heaven for believers, which those who heard in Moses' time hoped for but fell short of.
