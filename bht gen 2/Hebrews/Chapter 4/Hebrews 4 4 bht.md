# Hebrews 4:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's rest on the seventh day was not simply a temporary cessation from work, but rather an enduring state of rest that continues to this day. It is not a rest born out of weariness or inactivity, but rather the ongoing upholding and governing of all creation. God's rest is a reflection of his perfect satisfaction and delight in his works. This rest serves as a memorial of God's completion of creation and a foreshadowing of the eternal rest that believers will one day enter into.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He (God, not Moses, nor ἡ γραφή : see above on εἴρηκεν : see ch. Heb 13:5 ) hath spoken somewhere (see above on ch. Heb 2:6 ) concerning the seventh day... And God rested..." 
2. "The rest here spoken of must not be understood only as that of one day after the completion of creation; but as an enduring rest, commencing then and still going on, into which God’s people shall hereafter enter." 
3. "God’s rest is not a rest necessitated by fatigue, nor conditioned by idleness: but it is, in fact, the very continuance in that upholding and governing, of which the Creation was the beginning."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "A rest not ending with the seventh day, but beginning then and still continuing, into which believers shall hereafter enter."
2. "God's rest is not a rest necessitated by fatigue, nor consisting in idleness, but is that upholding and governing of which creation was the beginning."
3. "God's 'work' was one, comprehending, however, many 'works'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The work was done. 'That' was the rest of God. He was happy in the contemplation of his own works; and he instituted that day to be observed as a memorial of 'his' resting from his works, and as a 'type' of the eternal rest which remained for man."
2. "The idea is this, that the notion of 'rest' of some kind runs through all dispensations. It was seen in the finishing of the work of creation; seen in the appointment of the Sabbath; seen in the offer of the promised land, and is seen now in the promise of heaven."
3. "When it is said that 'God did rest,' of course it does not mean that he was wearied with his toil, but merely that he 'ceased' from the stupendous work of creation. He no more put forth creative energy, but calmly contemplated his own works in their beauty and grandeur."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "It is not, of course, absolute rest from all creative activity as Jesus shows in John 5:17."
3. "But the seventh day of God's rest was still going on (clearly not a twenty-four hour day)."

### John Gill:
1. "God did rest the seventh day from all his works: of creation, but not of providence; for in them he works hitherto."
2. "This rest suppose[s] cessation from working in a creative way, and the utmost delight, complacency and satisfaction in what he had done."

### John Wesley:
1. For, long after he had rested from his works, he speaks again. Genesis 2:2.
