# Hebrews 4:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage cited emphasizes the future nature of the rest referred to in the psalm. It indicates that men, even in the days of Moses and David, had not yet fully entered into that rest. However, it also implies that some would still enter into it. This means that the promise of rest remains and is reserved for others. Thus, the rest spoken of in the psalm is not the Sabbath rest provided by God, and it is clear that those who do not believe will not enter into it.
