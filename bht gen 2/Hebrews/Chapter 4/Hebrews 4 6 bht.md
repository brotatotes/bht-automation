# Hebrews 4:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's promise of rest remains unfulfilled for some, as seen in the failure of the Israelites under Moses, Joshua, and even David to fully enter in. However, it is implied that there are those who will enter, as God's warning to some not to enter presupposes others who will. The reason for not entering is not simply unbelief, but rather disobedience. The call to not harden one's heart and to heed God's voice is still relevant today, as the rest that God has prepared awaits those who have faith and enter in.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Since what God once purposed, He always purposes."
2. "That some have entered in, as a matter of fact, is true enough; but even they not yet perfectly."
3. "To-day, if you hear His voice, harden not your hearts."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The denial of entrance to unbelievers is a virtual promise of entrance to those that believe."
2. "God wishes not His rest to be empty, but furnished with guests."
3. "Unbelief... rather 'disobedience'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Since there is a rest spoken of in the Scriptures, implying that it is to be enjoyed by some, and since they to whom it was first promised did not inherit it, it follows that it must still be in reserve."
2. "The implied argument to prove this is: (1) That there was a 'rest' spoken of which deserved to be called a 'divine rest,' or the 'rest of God;' (2) It could not be supposed that God would prepare such a rest in vain, for it would follow that if he had suited up a world of rest, he designed that it should be occupied."
3. "As he knew, therefore, that they to whom it was first offered would not enter in, it must be that he designed it for some others, and that it 'remained' to be occupied by us now."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The promise has not been appropriated. It must be appropriated in accordance with God's provision."
2. "The rest was not provided for nothing. God's provision of a rest implies and involves that some enter into it. But the appropriation is yet in the future."
3. "The Israelites under Moses and Joshua are meant. Because of unbelief, disobedience."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In all these verses where 'it remains' is used, the phrase has the same meaning not that a rest now remains and is still future, but that the promise was not fulfilled in the Sabbath-rest or in the Canaan-rest..."
2. "...when this Epistle was written, it was still a warning and an invitation."
3. "It awaited the faith and the entrance which were to exhaust its meaning."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It remaineth...This left-over promise is not repeated, though not utilized by the Israelites under Moses nor in the highest sense by Joshua and David." 
2. "Failed to enter in...It is a rabbinical argument all along here, but the author is writing to Jews."

### John Gill:
1. "It follows by just consequence, that some must enter therein; for God's swearing concerning some, that they should not enter into his rest, supposes that others should."
2. "Enter not in because of unbelief."
