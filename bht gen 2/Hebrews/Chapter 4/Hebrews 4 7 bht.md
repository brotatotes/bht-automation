# Hebrews 4:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the book of Hebrews, the writer emphasizes the importance of the term today in relation to God's promise of rest. This today represents a specific opportunity that is distinct from previous times of rest, such as the rest after creation and the rest in the promised land. By referring to the Psalms, the writer confirms that this offer of rest continues to have relevance and significance in his readers' time. He encourages them not to harden their hearts, but rather to heed God's voice and seize the opportunity for rest that is available to them.
