# Hebrews 4:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Joshua led the Israelites into the promised land, but that was not the ultimate rest that God had in mind. Their rest in Canaan was just a temporary and imperfect representation of the true spiritual rest that God had planned for his people. God spoke of another day of entering the rest, a future time when the divine ideal of rest would be fulfilled. The rest spoken of in the Psalm is a divine rest that goes beyond the physical land of Canaan.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Those who entered the promised land with Joshua did enter into that rest of God." 
2. "For if Joshua had given them rest, He would not speak after this of another day."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Answer to the objection which might be made to his reasoning, namely, that those brought into Canaan by Joshua did enter the rest of God."
2. "If the rest of God meant Canaan, God would not after their entrance into that land, have spoken of another (future) day of entering the rest."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The object is to prove that Joshua did 'not' give the people of God such a rest as to make it improper to speak of a 'rest' after that time."
2. "Joshua 'did' give them a rest in the promised land; but it was not all which was intended, and it did not exclude the promise of another and more important rest."
3. "Then 'God' would not have spoken of another time when that rest could be obtained."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Israel's rest in Canaan did not fulfill the divine ideal of the rest."
2. "Jesus [ιησους]. Rend. Joshua, and see on Matthew 1:21."
3. "After the entrance into Canaan under Joshua."

### John Calvin:
1. "They to whom David addressed the Psalm were in possession of that land, but they were reminded of the duty of seeking a better rest."
2. "And we may hence easily learn the difference between us and them; for though the same end is designed for both, yet they had, as added to them, external types to guide them; not so have we, nor have we indeed any need of them, for the naked truth itself is set before our eyes."
3. "Now that the Apostle separates the shadow from the substance, he did so for this reason, — because he had to do with the Jews, who were too much attached to external things."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Clearly, therefore, the Psalm speaks of a Divine rest into which men are bidden to enter, different from the rest of Canaan, and long subsequent to it."
2. "For if Joshua (here and in Acts 7:45, Jesus, the Greek form of Joshua, quite misleads) had given them rest had led them into the rest of which we are speaking He (i.e God, who further defines ‘the day’ in David, and describes the rest as still unentered) would not have gone on speaking after that of another day (or of another day after that, i.e still future)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Joshua (Ιησους). The Greek form is Jesus." 
2. "Condition of the second class (determined as unfulfilled) with ε and aorist indicative in the condition and αν with the imperfect in the conclusion." 
3. "He would not have spoken (ουκ ελαλε). Wrong translation, 'he would not speak' (be speaking), in the passage in David. Imperfect tense, not aorist."

### John Gill:
1. "Joshua was a type of Christ in many actions of his life; in the miracles he wrought, or were wrought for him; in the battles he fought, and the victories he obtained; in saving Rahab and her family; in receiving the Gibeonites, who came submissively to him; and in leading the children of Israel into Canaan's land, which he divided to them by lot."
2. "Though he brought them into a land of rest, into the typical rest, where they had rest for a while from their temporal enemies, yet he did not give them the true spiritual rest."
3. "God, in David's time, and by him, would not have so long after appointed another day of rest; meaning, not any particular day of the week, but the whole Gospel dispensation, in the times of the Messiah."

### John Wesley:
1. The rest — All the rest which God had promised.
