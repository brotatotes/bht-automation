# Hebrews 5:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The role of a high priest is to be a mediator between God and mankind. This requires that the high priest be chosen from among men, as they can understand and have compassion on the people they represent. The appointment of a high priest is not a mere human decision, but a divine ordination. The high priest serves to bring God near to people and people near to God through his offering of various gifts and sacrifices. This duty includes presenting both inanimate gifts and animal sacrifices.
