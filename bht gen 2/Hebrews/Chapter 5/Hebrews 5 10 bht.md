# Hebrews 5:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Melchizedek and Christ share common traits, making Melchizedek a significant type of Christ. The Holy Spirit intentionally withheld information about Melchizedek to elevate his typological representation of Christ. Though little is known about him, it is established that he served as both a priest and the king of Salem. The designation of Christ as the Son of God further emphasizes his divine nature and the eternal priesthood that he embodies.
