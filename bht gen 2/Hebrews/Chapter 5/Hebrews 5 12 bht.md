# Hebrews 5:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
You should be able to teach others about the basics of the Christian faith, but instead, you are in need of someone to teach you those very principles again. It is important to remember that we should not only seek to learn for our own benefit, but also for the purpose of instructing and edifying others. The foundational elements of the Gospel are necessary for our spiritual growth, just like milk is necessary for infants. As believers, we should continually strive to deepen our understanding of these truths and share them with others.
