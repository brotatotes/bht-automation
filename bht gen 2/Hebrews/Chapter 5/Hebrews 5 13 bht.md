# Hebrews 5:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle is referring to those who, like children, are not able to receive or comprehend the deeper truths of the gospel. They rely solely on milk, representing a basic and limited understanding of the word of God. These individuals lack the experience and maturity to grasp the profound teachings of righteousness and justification that the gospel offers. They remain unskilled and inexperienced, unable to go beyond the elementary principles of faith. Their spiritual growth is hindered as they cling to a simplistic and one-dimensional understanding of God's truth.
