# Hebrews 5:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For those who have matured in their faith, there are deeper truths to explore, referred to as strong meat. These truths pertain to the concept of perfection and are reserved for those who have grown and developed in their spiritual understanding. Through the maturing process, believers gain a strength in their understanding that allows them to discern between the teachings of Christ and the teachings of men. This strength comes from a habitual exercise of their spiritual senses, enabling them to navigate and comprehend these deeper truths with ease and profit.

### Henry Alford:
1. "Solid food belongs to the grown up, to those who by virtue of their habit have their organs of sense exercised with a view to the distinction of good and evil." 
2. "The spiritual sense is found in the reference; the word 'habit' refers to long usage, so that it stands in a causal relation to the result."
3. "The distinction of good and evil is manifestly not to moral qualities, but to excellence and inferiority, wholesomeness and corruptness in doctrine."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "He calls those perfect who are adults; he mentions them in opposition to babes... For the middle and manly age is the full age of human life; but he calls those by a figure men in Christ; who are spiritual."
2. "And such he would have all Christians to be, such as have attained by continual practice a habit to discern between good and evil... And truly what sort of faith is that which doubts, being suspended between truth and falsehood? Is it not in danger of coming to nothing every moment?"
3. "But among those who are freed from this diabolical prohibition and enjoy the liberty of learning, there is yet often no less indifference both as to hearing and reading. When thus we exercise not our powers, we are stupidly ignorant and void of all discernment."
