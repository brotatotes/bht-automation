# Hebrews 5:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The high priest is called to exercise moderation and reason in ruling over his own passions and in judgment towards the errors of others. He is to show compassion to sinners, always mindful of his own weaknesses and infirmities. This compassion should extend to those who are ignorant and have gone astray, even as he remains steadfast and does not compromise in dealing with sin. By understanding the struggles and limitations of others, the high priest can effectively minister to them with empathy and grace.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The high priest is taken from among men, in order that he may have a fellow-feeling for those on whose behalf he officiates."
2. "Sensible of his own ignorance, he is able to sympathize with those who are ignorant; and compassed about with infirmity, he is able to succour those who have like infirmities."
3. "They [ministers of the gospel] can enter into the feelings of those who are conscious of guilt; they can sympathize with those who tremble in dread of death; they can partake of the emotions of those who expect soon to appear before God."

### Marvin Vincent:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The true position of a priest in relation to those who are not only suffering, but are also guilty, is between the two. His is a blended feeling of sorrow and blame. Were there no sorrow, there would be no fitness for the office manward; were there no blame, there would be no holiness, and so no fitness for the office Godward." 
2. "The persons for whom the priest acts are not innocent, or the function would cease; they are sinners, and are described as ignorant and out of the way (erring or, it may be, led out of the way)."
3. "All men are blameably ignorant, and are out of the way; every sin is want of knowledge, as well as want of wisdom; we all have gone astray, and for all the priest acts; those being excepted who are presumptuous and defiant sinners for whom no sacrifice could be accepted."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "If the priest is cordially to plead with God for the sinner, he must bridle his natural disgust at the loathsomeness of sensuality, his impatience at the frequently recurring fall, his hopeless alienation from the hypocrite and the superficial, his indignation at any confession he hears from the penitent."
2. "The one article with both participles probably makes it a hendiadys, sins of ignorance (both accidence and sudden passion) as opposed to high-handed sins of presumption and deliberate purpose."
3. "The priest himself has weakness lying around him like a chain. Not so Jesus."

### John Gill:
1. "Who can have compassion on the ignorant,.... Who have committed sins of ignorance, and bring their sacrifices for them; these he does not insult and upbraid, nor break out into anger and indignation against; but pities them, and sympathizes with them..."
2. "...and on them that are out of the way; of God's commandments; who are like sheep going astray, and turn to their own way; who transgress the law of God, and err from it; perhaps such who sin knowingly and wilfully, and through infirmity, are meant..."
3. "...for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity; not of body only, but of mind, sinful infirmity; he had much of it, it beset him all around..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Who can have compassion ‚Äî In proportion to the offence: so the Greek word signifies."
2. "On the ignorant ‚Äî Them that are in error."
3. "Seeing himself also is compassed with infirmity ‚Äî Even with sinful infirmity; and so needs the compassion which he shows to others."
