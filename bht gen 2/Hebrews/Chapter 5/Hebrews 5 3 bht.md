# Hebrews 5:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The duty of the high priest extends beyond offering sacrifices for the sins of the people; he is also called to offer sacrifices for his own sins. This concept applies not only to human high priests but also to Christ himself. Although Christ is distinct, he fulfills the role of the high priest, who recognizes the need for atonement and offers himself as the ultimate sacrifice. Therefore, just as the high priest confesses his sins and the sins of his household, Christ acknowledges the sins of humanity and offers himself as the perfect atonement.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And on account of it (the infirmity wherewith he himself is encompassed; not fem. for neut., as Bengel, altern.: nor is αὕτη, Matthew 21:42, which he alleges, the slightest justification for such a notion) he must even as for the people, so also for himself, offer for sins."
2. "Much has been said as to the applicability or otherwise of these considerations to Christ. Some have considered all that has hitherto been said as spoken of human high priests in contradistinction to Him."
3. "It is better to understand it all as spoken of high priests in general: and then, as Ebrard well says, leave it to the Writer himself, Hebrews 5:5 ff., to determine how far these requisites are satisfied in Christ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "on account of this" infirmity.
2. "he ought . . . also for himself, to offer for sins"
3. "in behalf of the people . . . on account of sins."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He needs the same atonement; he offers the sacrifice for himself which he does for others."
