# Hebrews 5:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The office of the high priesthood is not to be taken lightly, as it requires a divine calling. Just as the Levitical high priests were chosen by God to represent the people, offer sacrifices, and resolve matters, so Christ, our ultimate high priest, embodies all the excellence of the Levitical priesthood. Therefore, it is not for anyone to self-appoint or assume this honor, but only those called by God, just as Aaron was. It is important to note that the priestly office does not include preaching, as it is a distinct role.
