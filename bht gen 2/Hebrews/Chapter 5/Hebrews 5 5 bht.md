# Hebrews 5:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ did not exalt himself to be the high priest, but the honor and appointment came from God, who declared Him as His Son and called Him into this role. This divine appointment is not a recent event, but a reality from eternity, establishing Christ's unique position as both Son and High Priest.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Thus Christ also (as well as those others) did not glorify HIMSELF to be made High Priest."
2. "It asserts, that such divine appointment was wrapped up and already involved in that eternal generation to the Sonship which was declared in these words."
3. "The true account seems to be this: the word ἐδόξασεν contains in it the whole process of exaltation (through suffering) by which the Lord Jesus has attained the heavenly High Priesthood."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Glorified not himself - did not assume the glory of the priestly office of Himself without the call of God."
2. "The connection of Sonship and priesthood is typified in the Hebrew title for priests being given to David's sons."
3. "Christ did not constitute Himself the Son of God, but was from everlasting the only-begotten of the Father. On His Sonship depended His glorification, and His being called of God, as Priest."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Paul claimed that Christ held that office; but, as he was not descended from Aaron, and as no one might perform its duties without being regularly called to it, it was incumbent on him to show that Jesus was not an intruder, but had a regular vocation to that work."
2. "He received his appointment from him. This was decisive in the case, and this was sufficient, if it could be made out, for the only claim which Aaron and his successors could have to the office, was the fact that they had received their appointment from God."
3. "The propriety of this application is founded on the fact that the language in the Psalm is of so general a character, that it may be applied to 'any' exaltation of the Redeemer, or to any honor conferred on him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He did not glorify himself, but God who styled him 'son' glorified him."
2. "Thou art my Son is introduced thus in close connection with the call to the priesthood, in recognition of the fact that the priesthood of Christ had its basis in his sonship."
3. "Christ's priestly vocation ceases to be an accident in his history, and becomes an essential characteristic of his position as Son: sonship, christhood, priestliness, inseparably interwoven."

### John Calvin:
1. "We must however bear especially in mind what we said on the first chapter; that the begetting of Christ, of which the Psalmist speaks, was a testimony which the Father rendered to him before men."
2. "One indued with no honor, with no power? Nay, one who was to be a Mediator between himself and man; his begetting then included his priesthood."
3. "Christ did not make himself a high priest but God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "These requisites of the high priests are all found in Christ, and found in Him in such a degree as proves Him to be superior to all others."
2. "He it was that made Him Priest, and made Him Priest in the very passage that speaks of Him as 'Son;' the 'Only-begotten.'"
3. "Others who regard the quotation as giving honour to the Son without making that honour an assertion of His Priesthood, interpret simply Christ did not Himself assume the office of Priest; God who acknowledges Him as His Son in a sense that raises Him above all creatures, God gives Him the office."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus had divine appointment as high priest also."
2. "God did glorify Jesus in appointing him priest."
3. "Clearly the Father nominated the Son to the Messianic priesthood."

### John Gill:
1. "It was a glorifying of Christ, to make him an high priest; not as God, for as such no addition can be made to his glory."
2. "Christ did not take this high and honourable office to himself, nor the glory of it... he appointed him to this office; he sent him to execute it; he anointed him with the oil of gladness above his fellows."
3. "These words... are not to be considered as constitutive of Christ's priesthood, as if that was intended by the begetting of him as a Son; but as descriptive of the person, who called him to it, who stood in the relation of a Father to Christ, and Christ in the relation of a Son to him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Christ glorified not himself to be an high priest."
2. "Did not take this honour to himself, but received it from him who said, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee."
3. "Not, indeed, at the same time; for his generation was from eternity."
