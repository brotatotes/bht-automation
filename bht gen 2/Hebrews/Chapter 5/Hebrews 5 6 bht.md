# Hebrews 5:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage from Psalm 110:4 clearly refers to Jesus as an eternal priest, appointed by God in a distinct order, different from the Aaronic priesthood. This establishes the superiority of Christ's priesthood, which is not limited to a specific lineage but is everlasting. The mention of the order of Melchizedek signifies the unchanging nature of Christ's priesthood, and it signifies a shift and fulfillment from the old law to the new covenant.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In examining this last predication, we find that Œ∫Œ±œÑ·Ω∞ œÑ·Ω¥ŒΩ œÑŒ¨ŒæŒπŒΩ, according to the ordinary meaning of œÑŒ¨ŒæŒπœÇ, imports, according to the office or order, the rank which Melchisedek held."
2. "So that Œ∫Œ±œÑ·Ω∞ œÑ·Ω¥ŒΩ œÑŒ¨ŒæŒπŒΩ will be very nearly the same as Œ∫Œ±œÑ·Ω∞ œÑ·Ω¥ŒΩ ·ΩÅŒºŒøŒπœåœÑŒ∑œÑŒ±, ch. Hebrews 7:15; and the Peschito has this latter expression both in the Psalm, and throughout our Epistle."
3. "I may add to what was there said, that it is thus declared, that He, in whom all the theocratic promises find their fulfillment, in whom the true Kingdom of God comes and is summed up, was to be, as in Zechariah 6:12 ff., 'a priest upon His throne,' and such a priest (i.e. necessarily High Priest, if a King; as indeed the word is given in Heb 5:10 and ch. Heb 6:20) as should be after the order of Melchisedek."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He is a Priest absolutely, because He stands alone in that character without an equal."
2. "He is 'High Priest' in respect of the Aaronic type, and also in respect to us, whom He has made priests by throwing open to us access to God."
3. "Melchisedec was at once man, priest, and king. Paul's selecting as the type of Christ one not of the stock of Abraham, on which the Jews prided themselves, is an intimation of Messianic universalism."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Psalm referred to Christ...the Psalm was understood by the Jews at that time to have such a reference, and that it was so universally admitted that no one would call it in question."
2. "The priesthood of the Messiah was not to change from hand to hand; it was not to be laid down at death; it was to remain unchangeably the same."
3. "To say that he was of the same 'order' with Melchizedek, was to say that he was of the same 'rank' or 'stations.' He was like him in his designation to the office."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Christ is prophetically pointed out in Psalms 110:0 as an eternal priest, independent of fleshly descent, a king, and superior in dignity to the Levitical priests."
2. "According to the order [Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ± œÑŒ∑ŒΩ œÑŒ±ŒæŒπŒΩ]... According to the rank which Melchisedec held."
3. "Almost = like. For Melchisedec see ch. 7."

### John Calvin:
1. "This is a remarkable passage, and indeed the whole Psalm from which it is taken; for there is scarcely anywhere a clearer prophecy respecting Christ‚Äôs eternal priesthood and his kingdom."
2. "Melchisedec was God‚Äôs priest; and the Psalmist testifies that that king whom God has set on his right hand would be a |kohen| according to the order of Melchisedec. Who does not see that this is to be understood of the priesthood?"
3. "As it was a rare and almost a singular thing for the same person to be a priest and a king, at least an unusual thing among God‚Äôs people, hence he sets forth Melchisedec as the type of the Messiah, as though he had said, 'The royal dignity will not prevent him to exercise the priesthood also, for a type of such a thing has been already presented in Melchisedec.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Then follows a correction (according to the second of the above interpretations), or an assertion in plainer terms (according to the first) of this appointment."
2. "Even as also he saith in another (literally, ‚Äòa different‚Äô) place; a psalm written with a different purpose; a quotation from the 110th Psalm, which is generally accepted by the Jews themselves as Messianic."
3. "Showing that if Jesus is the Christ it is by a Divine appointment He holds the character and performs the functions of a Priest a perpetual Priest the only Priest with honours and qualifications higher and greater than those of Aaron."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is this crucial passage by which the author will prove the superiority of Jesus to Aaron as high priest."
2. "The point lies in the meaning of the phrase 'After the order of Melchizedek.'"
3. "But at this point the only thing pressed is the fact of the divine appointment of Jesus as priest."

### John Gill:
1. "Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedec; that the psalm, from whence these words are taken, belongs to the Messiah" 
2. "it very clearly expresses the priesthood of Christ, the eternity of it, and the order according to which it was"
3. "it being not according to the order of Aaron, but of another, shows the change of the priesthood, and so of the law"

### John Wesley:
1.  Psalm 110:4.
