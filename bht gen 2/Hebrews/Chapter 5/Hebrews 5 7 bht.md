# Hebrews 5:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In his time on earth, Jesus experienced the sinless infirmities of human nature, going through a whole course of life marked by prayers, supplications, strong crying, and tears. In the garden, he offered up earnest prayers and wept, fearing the weight of God's justice and the dishonor that sin had brought upon a holy God. Through his suffering, Jesus showed utmost submission to the will of the Father, learning obedience and proving that it was not the physical pain, but the dishonor inflicted by sin on a holy God, that deeply grieved his pure soul.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The sufferings of Christ are now adduced...as proving the proposition, οὐχ ἑαυτὸν ἐδόξασεν γενηθῆναι ἀρχιερέα."
2. "He regards the verses as introduced to shew that Christ was never, not even in his deepest humiliation, severed from the Father...these obedience and sufferings were all a part of His being glorified for his High Priestly office: a part of that office itself."
3. "Being paraphrased, ‘who had a course of glorifying for the High Priest’s office to go through, not of his own choice, but appointed for Him by the Father, as is shewn by that sharp lesson of obedience...which He, though God’s own Son, learned during the days of his flesh: when He cried to God with tears for deliverance from death, and was heard on account of His resignation to the Father’s will (“Not my will, but Thine be done”),’ &c."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "His crying and tears were part of the experimental lesson of obedience which He submitted to learn from the Father."
2. "The 'tears' are an additional fact here communicated to us by the inspired apostle, not recorded in the Gospels, though implied."
3. "To have been passively content at the approach of such a cloud would have been, not faith, but sin. The cup of death He prayed to be freed from was, not corporal, but spiritual death, that is, the (temporary) separation of His human soul from the light of God's countenance."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The object of this verse and the two following is, to show that the Lord Jesus had that qualification for the office of priest to which he had referred in Hebrews 5:2."
2. "The Son of God wept - and if he poured forth tears it cannot be wrong for us."
3. "They who maintain that the prayer of faith is always literally answered, must hold that the Christian is under such a guidance of the Spirit of God that he cannot ask anything amiss."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The phrase 'unto him that was able to save him from death' connects itself with the thought of Christ's real humanity."
2. "He appealed to one who could answer his prayer."
3. "He was heard on account of his godly fear."

### John Calvin:
1. "It hence appears that our faith is thus confirmed, and that his honor is not diminished for having borne our evils."
2. "By these words he intimates that he rightly prayed, because he fled to God the only Deliverer. His tears and crying recommend to us ardor and earnestness in prayer, for we ought not to pray to God formally, but with ardent desires."
3. "And hence we may conclude that God often hears our prayers, even when that is no way made evident. For though it belongs not to us to prescribe to him as it were a fixed rule, nor does it become him to grant whatsoever requests we may conceive in our minds or express with our tongues, yet he shows that he grants our prayers in everything necessary for our salvation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Having offered up and being heard...He learned obedience." 
2. "His tears...seem implied in such passages as Matthew 26:38; Matthew 27:46." 
3. "God heard Him, not by delivering Him from the necessity of dying, not even by raising Him from the dead, but by strengthening Him to bear all...and by making the pangs of death the birth-throes of an endless life for him, and for all who were to believe."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Since Jesus was 'without sin' he did not have to offer sacrifices 'for himself,' yet in all other points he felt the sympathy of the human high priest, even more so by reason of his victory over sin." 
2. "The word ικετηριος is an adjective from ικετης (a suppliant from ικω, to come to one) and suggests one coming with an olive-branch (ελαια). Here only in the N.T."
3. "Jesus in Gethsemane at once surrendered his will to that of the Father who heard his plea and enabled him to acquiesce in the Father's will."

### John Gill:
1. "In the time of his humiliation, when he was attended with the sinless infirmities of the flesh, or human nature; it may take in the whole course of his life on earth, especially the latter part of it." 
2. "As the days of Christ's flesh were filled up with prayers and supplications, so should ours be also."
3. "And it may be observed to our comfort, that as Christ's crying and tears were confined to the days of his flesh, or to the time of his life here on earth, so shall ours be also."

### John Wesley:
1. "Having offered up prayers and supplications — Thrice. With strong crying and tears — In the garden."
2. "What he most exceedingly feared was the weight of infinite justice; the being 'bruised' and 'put to grief' by the hand of God himself."
3. "Throughout his whole life, he showed that it was not the sufferings he was to undergo, but the dishonor that sin had done to so holy a God, that grieved his spotless soul."
