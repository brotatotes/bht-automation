This highlights the significance of Jesus' human experience and how it enabled him to understand the extent of submission and obedience to the will of God.

2. "The 'object' here is, to show how well suited the Lord Jesus was to be a Saviour for mankind; and the argument is, that he has set us an example, and has shown that the most perfect obedience may be manifested in the deepest sorrows of the body and the soul."
3. "Hence, learn that one of the objects of affliction is to lead us 'to obey God.' In prosperity we forget it. We become self-confident and rebellious....

### Philip Schaff:

1. "Though he were a Son.... yet learned he obedience." 
2. "Through sufferings he became obedient to death, even the death of the cross: and this he learnt; not that he was ignorant of the nature of it; nor was he destitute of an obedient disposition to it; but the meaning is, he had an experience of it, and effected it; and which was voluntary, and done in our room and stead."
3. "Christ's sonship did not exempt him from obedience and sufferings; this shows the dignity of Christ's person, that he is the Son of God, not as Mediator, for as such he is a servant; and it would be no wonder that he should learn obedience as a servant."
