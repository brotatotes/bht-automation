# Hebrews 6:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Leaving the beginning teachings of Christ does not mean forsaking the basic truths, but rather progressing beyond them, just as a builder moves on from laying the foundation. We must not linger in the elementary principles, but instead strive for a deeper understanding and maturity in our faith. This involves not revisiting the foundations of repentance and faith, but pressing forward to greater knowledge and the fullness of the Gospel message. As we continue on this path, we can receive the Holy Spirit and gain insight into the eternal consequences of our choices.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Therefore, leaving the word of the beginning of Christ, let us press on to maturity."
2. "Not again laying the foundation of repentance from dead works, and faith on God."
3. "Full trust, rested on God, that He has fulfilled his promises in Christ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "As in building a house one must never leave the foundation: yet to be always laboring in 'laying the foundation' would be ridiculous."
2. "Let us together press forward."
3. "This repentance from dead works is therefore paired with 'faith toward God.' The three pairs of truths enumerated are designedly such as JEWISH believers might in some degree have known from the Old Testament, but had been taught more clearly when they became Christians."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Let us advance to a higher state of knowledge than the mere elements of the subject."
2. "You must either advance or recede; and if you do not go forward, you will go back into entire apostasy, when it will be impossible to be renewed."
3. "Even if none have ever reached that point on earth, that fact does not make it any the less desirable or proper to aim at it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Leaving the principles of the doctrines of Christ... does not imply ceasing to believe in elementary truths or to regard them as important, but leaving them 'as a builder leaves his foundation in erecting his building.'"
2. "The more difficult point, which it will require matured perception to grasp, is that Christ's priesthood involves the entire abolition of the old covenant."
3. "The phrase 'dead works'... refers to works without the element of life which comes through faith in the living God. There is a sharp opposition, therefore, between dead works and faith."

### John Calvin:
1. "For by the word of beginning he understands the first rudiments, taught to the ignorant when received into the Church."
2. "They then act most unreasonably who remain in the first elements, for they propose to themselves no end."
3. "He mentions repentance and faith, which include the fullness of the Gospel; for what else does Christ command his Apostles to preach, but repentance and faith?"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Leaving behind the discussion of the beginning about Christ," another way of saying again.
2. "Let us go on to the stage of adults, not babes, able to masticate solid spiritual food."
3. "The metaphor is common (1 Corinthians 3:11) and the foundation is important, but one cannot be laying the foundation always if he is to build the house."

### John Gill:
1. "The principles of this doctrine are either the easier parts of the Gospel, called milk in the latter part of the preceding chapter; which are not to be left with dislike and contempt, nor so as to be forgotten, nor so as not to be recurred to at proper times; but so as not to abide in and stick here, without going further."
2. "Let us go on to perfection: in a comparative sense, to a more perfect knowledge of things, which the clear revelation and ministry of the Gospel lead unto; and which the rites and ceremonies, types and figures of the law, never could."
3. "For these are not the six principles of the Christian religion, as they are commonly called, but so many articles of the Jewish creed; some of which were peculiar to the Jews, and others common to them, with us Christians."

### John Wesley:
1. "Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ... Let us go on to perfection."
2. "Not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works... And faith in God."
3. "The next thing was, to lay hands upon them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost: after which they were more fully instructed, touching the resurrection and the general judgment; called eternal, because the sentence then pronounced is irreversible, and the effects of it remain for ever."
