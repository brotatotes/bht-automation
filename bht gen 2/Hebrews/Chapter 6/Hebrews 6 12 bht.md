### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

3. "Not that they have actually entered on the perfect inheritance, which Hebrews 11:13; Hebrews 11:39; Hebrews 11:40 explicitly denies; though doubtless the dead in Christ have, in the disembodied soul, a foretaste of it; but 'them (enumerated in Hebrews 11:2-40) who in every age have been, are, or shall be, inheritors of the promises'; of whom Abraham is an illustrious example (Hebrews 11:2-58.11.40-:)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That ye be not slothful - Indolent; inactive. This was what he was especially desirous of guarding them against. By diligent and strenuous effort only could they secure themselves from the danger of apostasy."
2. "But followers - Imitators - that you may live as they lived."

### John Calvin:
1. "It had far more weight, when he reminded them, that the fathers were not made partakers of the promises except through the unconquerable firmness of faith; for examples convey to us a more impressive idea of things."
2. "But Abraham’s example is referred to, not because it is the only one, but because it is more illustrious than that of any other... It is, then, no wonder that the Apostle selected him from all the rest, and turned towards him the eyes of his readers as to the clearest mirror of faith."
3. "What is meant is, a firm faith, which has patience as its companion... For faith is what is, chiefly required; but as many who make at first a marvelous display of faith, soon fail, he shows, that the true evidence of that faith which is not fleeting and evanescent, is endurance."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In this hope ye need to persevere, that ye become not slothful, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises."
2. "The Greek word has a nobler meaning than this English equivalent. Scholars, it was said of old, should not only learn from their master, they should imitate (or, as we say, should copy) them."
3. "Patience or lone-suffering is the mental state that bears long with the trials of the Christian life, and with the delays of the fulfillment of the Divine promise, with cheerful courage and without despondency or dejection."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "That ye become not sluggish (or dull of hearing)" as some already were (Hebrews 5:11).
