# Hebrews 6:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The promise in Genesis 22:17 expresses the certainty and abundance of blessings that God will bestow upon Abraham. This includes both material blessings for his descendants as well as the spiritual blessings that come from being chosen, justified, pardoned, adopted, and sanctified by God. Thus, the promise encompasses both the natural and spiritual seed of Abraham and has been completely fulfilled.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The expression occurs in formulæ jurandi in several places in the LXX (as e. g. Ezekiel 33:27 , ζῶ ἐγώ , εἰ μὴν οἱ ἐν ταῖς ἠρημωμέναις μαχαίραις πεσοῦνται)."
2. "Thus frequently the LXX, for the Heb. idiomatic conjunction of the absolute infinitive with the finite verb."
3. "The Writer alters, not from a wish to abbreviate (Jac. Cappell.) nor because he quoted from memory (Abresch), nor because he was unwilling to introduce Abraham’s bodily descendants, but wished to direct his readers’ thoughts to his spiritual seed."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The increase of Abraham's seed is virtually an increase of himself."
2. "The argument here refers to Abraham himself as an example."
3. "Therefore Paul quotes Genesis 22:17, 'thee,' instead of 'thy seed'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Surely blessing I will bless thee - That is, I will certainly bless thee." 
2. "The phrase is a Hebrew mode of expression, to denote emphasis or certainty." 
3. "I will greatly increase thee - I will grant thee an exceedingly numerous posterity."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Surely blessing I will bless thee." (ει μην ευλογων ευλογησω σε) 
2. "Blessing I will bless is a Hebraism, emphasizing the idea contained in the verb." 
3. "Comp. LXX, Genesis 22:17; Numbers 25:10; Deuteronomy 14:4."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The repetition [of 'Blessing I will bless'] indicates...either the certainty of the thing promised...or the continuousness and consequent completeness of it."
2. "The multiplying is the essential thing, and, as Abraham could be multiplied only through his descendants, the promise in this shorter form leaves the meaning unchanged."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Surely (ε μην). By itacism for η μην (Deissmann, Bible Studies, p. 205). The quotation is from Genesis 22:16. (the promise renewed to Abraham with an oath after offering of Isaac)."
2. "Blessing (ευλογων). Hebraism (present active participle) for the Hebrew infinitive absolute and so with πληθυνων (multiplying)."

### John Gill:
1. "Which is expressive of the certainty of the blessings; the reality and substantiality of them; the abundance of them, and the continuance of the same."

### John Wesley:
