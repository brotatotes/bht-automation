# Hebrews 6:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By the unchangeable promise and oath of God, He provides us with unshakeable assurance and removes any suspicion of falsehood. We can take refuge in Christ, our fortress and stronghold, finding strength and security in Him. As we lay hold of the hope set before us, the object of our hope, we find consolation in the certainty that God, who cannot lie, has promised eternal life to His people. Let us embrace this firm assurance and run to Christ, finding safety and encouragement in Him.
