# Hebrews 6:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through our hope in Christ, we have an anchor for our souls that keeps us steady and secure. This hope is both sure and steadfast, never to be lost. It is anchored in the person, blood, and righteousness of Christ, as well as the immutability and faithfulness of God. By this anchor, our souls enter into heaven itself, fixed in the promises that slide us back to the priesthood of Christ.
