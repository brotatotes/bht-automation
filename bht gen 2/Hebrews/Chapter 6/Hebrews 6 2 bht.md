# Hebrews 6:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The early Hebrew converts needed elementary instruction in the significance of their own ceremonial law in light of its fulfillment in Christ. They were taught the doctrine of baptism, both in water and by the Holy Spirit, as an emblematic representation. Resurrection, along with eternal judgment, was a foundational belief of Christianity that confirmed and shed clearer light on Jewish doctrine. The diverse baptisms mentioned refer to the various ablutions and immersions required by the mystery religions and Jewish cultus. The believers were urged not to rest in their previous knowledge, but to continue growing in their faith.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The converts being Jews, their first and most obviously elementary instruction would be, the teaching them the typical significance of their own ceremonial law in its Christian fulfilment."
2. "By laying on of hands, the sick were healed, officers and teachers of the Church were admitted to their calling, and converts were fully admitted into the Christian Church after baptism."
3. "And then notice, that these also were points of Jewish doctrine, confirmed and brought into clearer light by the Gospel."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The six particulars here specified had been, as it were, the Christian Catechism of the Old Testament; and such Jews who had begun to recognize Jesus as the Christ immediately on the new light being shed on these fundamental particulars, were accounted as having the elementary principles of the doctrine of Christ." 
2. "The first and most obvious elementary instruction of Jews would be the teaching them the typical significance of their own ceremonial law in its Christian fulfilment."
3. "Resurrection, &c.—held already by the Jews from the Old Testament: confirmed with clearer light in Christian teaching or 'doctrine.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There are two baptisms whose necessity is taught by the Christian religion - baptism by water, and by the Holy Spirit; the first of which is an emblem of the second."
2. "To understand the true doctrine respecting baptism was one of the first principles to be learned then as it is now, as baptism is the rite by which we are 'initiated' into the Church."
3. "The belief of the resurrection of the dead is an elementary article in the system of Christianity. It lies at the foundation of all our hopes. Christianity is designed to prepare us for a future state; and one of the first things, therefore, in the preparation, is to 'assure' us there is a future state, and to tell us what it is."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The meaning here is lustral rites in general, and may include the baptism of John and Christian baptism."
2. "The teaching would cover all such rites, their relations and comparative significance."
3. "The resurrection of Christ as involving the resurrection of believers would, of itself, change the whole aspect of the doctrine of resurrection as held by a Few."

### John Calvin:
1. "For what is the doctrine of baptism but what he mentions here, faith in God, repentance, judgment, and the like?"
2. "Let us then know, that it was instituted by its first founders that it might be an appointed rite for prayer"
3. "And this passage tends to confirm pedobaptism; for why should the same doctrine be called as to some baptism, but as to others the imposition of hands, except that the latter after having received baptism were taught in the faith, so that nothing remained for them but the laying on of hands?"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The plural βαπτισμων 'by itself does not mean specifically Christian baptism, but ablutions or immersions such as the mystery religions and the Jewish cultus required for initiates, proselytes, and worshippers in general" (Moffatt)."
2. "'The laying on of hands' seems to us out of place in a list of elementary principles, but it was common as a sign of blessing, healing, in the choice of the Seven, in the bestowal of the Holy Spirit, in separation for a special task, in ordination."
3. "The resurrection of the dead is easily seen to be basal as well as eternal judgment."

### John Gill:
1. "since there is but one baptism, and the above reasons for the plural expression are not solid, and sufficiently satisfying, it is best to interpret this of the divers baptisms among the Jews"
2. "and of eternal judgment: articles of faith, which distinguished the Jews from the Gentiles, who were greatly strangers to a future state"
3. "the believing Hebrews were not to rest in the knowledge of these things, and in the smaller degrees of light they had in them, under the former dispensation; but were to go on to perfection"
