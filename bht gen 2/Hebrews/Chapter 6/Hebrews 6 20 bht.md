# Hebrews 6:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, as our forerunner, leads the way into the heavenly sanctuary on our behalf. His ascent into heaven is our promotion, and where He has entered, we are called to follow. As our High Priest, He represents and intercedes for us, taking care of our affairs and presenting our services to God. His role as our forerunner is of great honor, as He is infinitely superior to us. We can take comfort in knowing that Jesus has cleared the way for us and opened the gates of heaven, and His presence in the heavenly sanctuary guarantees our own entrance.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "πρόδρομος is a good classical word, signifying ordinarily the scouts who were sent before an army... It is a figure analogous, in its propriety, to ἀπαρχὴ τῶν κεκοιμημένων, πρωτότοκος ἐκ τῶν νεκρῶν, in theirs." 
2. "And it is one full of comfort to us: as Thl., ὁ γὰρ πρόδρομος, τινῶν ἐστιν ἀκολουθούντων πρόδρομος · καὶ οὐδὲ πάνυ πολὺ τὸ μέσον τοῦ προδρόμου καὶ τῶν ἑπομένων, ὥσπερ οὐδὲ Ἰωάννου καὶ χριστοῦ. μὴ τοίνυν ἀσχάλλετε. ὁσονούπω εἰσελευσόμεθα ὅπου ὁ πρόδρομος ἡμῶν" 
3. "entered Jesus, having become a High Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedek"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Where [Jesus], as forerunner for us (that is, in our behalf), entered."
2. "The 'for us' implies that it was not for Himself, as God, He needed to enter there, but as our High Priest, representing and introducing us."
3. "Christ's ascension is our promotion: and whither the glory of the Head has preceded, thither the hope of the body, too, is called."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The meaning here is, that Jesus went first into the heavenly sanctuary. He led the way. He has gone there on our account, to prepare a place for us."
2. "No man can be a Christian who does not do this, or who does not desire to be perfect as God is perfect. No one can be a Christian who is 'satisfied' or 'contented' to remain in sin."
3. "True piety is 'principle.' It is not fancy, or dreaming, or visions, or enthusiasm. It is based on knowledge, and does not go 'beyond' that. No man has any more religion than he has 'knowledge' of the way of salvation."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "(Opou, strictly where, instead of opoi whither) indicates an abiding there"
2. "The peculiarity of the new economy is that Christ as high priest goes nowhere where his people cannot follow him."
3. "The sin in the case supposed is the relinquishment of the spiritual gifts and powers accompanying faith in Christ, and rejecting Christ himself."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Levitical high priest entered the Holy of Holies on behalf of the people, as Christ also entered into the Holiest of all."
2. "He is now gone to prepare a place for us; we are to follow and to share His glory and His throne."
3. "The 'priest for ever' of the Psalm is now changed into 'high priest,' a title made appropriate by the fact that it is not into the holy place simply, but into the immediate presence of God, He is gone."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus has shown us the way, has gone on ahead, and is the surety and guarantor of our own entrance later."
2. "In point of fact, our anchor of hope with its two chains of God's promise and oath has laid hold of Jesus within the veil. It will hold fast.
3. "There he functions as our great high priest, better than Aaron for he is 'after the order of Melchizedek,' the point that now calls for elucidation."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ is the most excellent runner; there is none like him; there is none that can come up to him; he has out ran and exceeded all others; he has performed in the best manner..." 
2. "he has cleared the way thither, and opened the gates of heaven for his people; and is a guide and pattern for them to follow." 
3. "he represents their persons, appears and intercedes for them, takes care of their affairs, and presents their services; prepares mansions of glory for them, and takes possession of heaven in their name, and opens the way for them to follow him thither"

### John Wesley:
1. "A forerunner uses to be less in dignity than those that are to follow him. But it is not so here."
2. "Christ who is gone before us is infinitely superior to us."
3. "What an honour is it to believers, to have so glorious a forerunner, now appearing in the presence of God for them."
