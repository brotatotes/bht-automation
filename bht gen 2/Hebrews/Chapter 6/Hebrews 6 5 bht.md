# Hebrews 6:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers have experienced the goodness of God's word, finding comfort and peace in its teachings. They have a genuine pleasure in the truth of God and delight in the Bible. Their minds are enlightened and they have tasted the heavenly gift, experiencing the influences of the Holy Spirit. They partake in the powers of the new dispensation, which include the extraordinary energy of the gospel to sanctify and save. This taste is a foretaste of the perfect future in the world to come, where believers will fully enjoy the fulness of Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "What is καλὸν θεοῦ ῥῆμα? The epithet is frequently applied to the word of God: and usually with reference to its quickening, comforting, strengthening power, as sent or spoken by God to men."
2. "Then it is a far more debated question, what is meant by δυνάμεις μέλλοντος αἰῶνος. Some have said, those powerful foretastes of glory which belong indeed to the future state in their fulness, but are vouchsafed to believers here."
3. "Thus they would mean the χαρίσματα, given by the Spirit in measure to all who believed, 'distributing severally to every man as He will.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "We do not yet enjoy all the fulness of Christ, but only have a taste OF Him, the heavenly gift now; but believers may taste the whole word of God already, namely, God's 'good word of promise.'"  
2. "By faith, Christians make the world to come a present reality, though but a foretaste of the perfect future."  
3. "The powers of this new spiritual world, partly exhibited in outward miracles at that time, and then, as now, especially consisting in the Spirit's inward quickening influences are the earnest of the coming inheritance above, and lead the believer who gives himself up to the Spirit to seek to live as the angels, to sit with Christ in heavenly places, to set the affections on things above, and not on things on earth, and to look for Christ's coming and the full manifestation of the world to come."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Word of God, or the truth which he taught, was itself a good. It was what the soul desired, and in which it found comfort and peace."
2. "This language describes a state of mind of which every sincere Christian is conscious. It is that of pleasure in the Word of God. He loves the Bible; he loves the truth of God that is preached."
3. "The mind is: (a)Enlightened; then. (b)Tastes the gift of heaven, or has some experience of it; then. (c) It is made to partake of the influences of the Holy Spirit; then. (d)There is experience of the excellence and loveliness of the Word of God; and, (e) Finally there is a participation of the full 'powers' of the new dispensation; of the extraordinary energy which God puts forth in the gospel to sanctify and save the soul."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "To the word are attached life (Acts 5:20); spirit and life (John 6:63); salvation (Acts 11:14); cleansing (Ephesians 5:26); especially the impartation of the Spirit (John 3:0; 34; Acts 5:32; Acts 10:44; Ephesians 6:17; Hebrews 2:4)."
2. "The world to come is the world of men under the new order which is to enter with the fulfillment of Christ's work."

### John Wesley:
1. "And have tasted the good word of God - Have had a relish for, and a delight in it."
