# Hebrews 6:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who have turned away completely from their faith, rejecting both its power and its outward expression, are the subject of the apostle's warning. He states that it is impossible to bring these individuals back to a state of repentance. Their actions speak loudly, as they treat the Son of God with great disrespect, denying his divinity and diminishing the significance of his sacrifice. These wilful total apostates have cut themselves off from the opportunity of renewal, having chosen to crucify Christ anew through their words and deeds.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Instead of εἰς μετάνοιαν, one would expect ἐν μετανοίᾳ or διὰ μετανοίας, inasmuch as ἀνακαινίζεσθαι in full measure can only be brought about by μετάνοια, and must therefore be preceded by it."
2. "They crucify Him anew, and as at his former crucifixion, put Him to shame before all."
3. "The impossibility lies merely within the limits of the hypothesis itself. Whether God, of His infinite mercy and almighty power, will ever, by judgments or the strong workings of His Spirit, reclaim the obdurate sinner, so that even he may look on Him whom he has pierced, is, thank Him, a question which neither this, nor any other passage of Scripture, precludes us from entertaining."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Instead of 'going on to perfection,' they should need to learn again the first principles of Christianity."
2. "They tear him out of the recesses of their hearts where He had fixed His abode and exhibit Him to the open scoffs of the world as something powerless and common."
3. "It is the curse of evil eternally to propagate evil."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The apostle does not say that any true Christian ever had fallen away. He makes a statement of what would occur on the supposition that such a thing should happen." 
2. "Their apostasy and rejection of the Saviour would be like holding him up publicly as deserving the infamy and ignominy of the cross."
3. "The means used by God to preserve his people from apostasy have been entirely effectual. There is no evidence that one has ever fallen away who was a true Christian."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "If they shall fall away...It means to deviate, turn aside." 
2. "To renew them again... The verb N. T. o. Anakainoun to renew, 2 Corinthians 4:16; Colossians 3:10." 
3. "Seeing they crucify to themselves - afresh...They declare that Christ 's crucifixion has not the meaning or the virtue which they formerly attached to it."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Apostle warns us, that repentance is not at the will of man, but that it is given by God to those only who have not wholly fallen away from the faith." 
2. "The ungodly indeed deceive themselves by such sayings as this, — that it will be sufficient for them to repent of their wicked life at their last breath. But when they come to die, the dire torments of conscience which they suffer, prove to them that the conversion of man is not an ordinary work."
3. "But when any one rises up again after falling, we may hence conclude that he had not been guilty of defection, however grievously he may have sinned."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The present active infinitive of ανακαινιζω with αδυνατον bluntly denies the possibility of renewal for apostates from Christ."
2. "This is the reason why renewal for such apostates is impossible. They crucify Christ."
3. "Present active participle of παραδειγματιζω, late verb from παραδειγμα (example), to make an example of, and in bad sense to expose to disgrace."

### John Gill:
1. "They may indeed fall, not only into afflictions and temptations, but into sin; and from a lively and comfortable exercise of grace, and from a degree of steadfastness in the Gospel; but not irrecoverably."
2. "To renew them again unto repentance, is a thing impossible: the meaning of which is not only that it is difficult; or that it is rare and unusual; or that it is unsuitable and improper; but it is absolutely impossible."
3. "Men may be said to crucify him again, when, by denying him to be the Son of God, they justify the crucifixion of him on that account; and when they lessen and vilify the virtue of his blood and sacrifice; and when both by errors and immoralities they cause him to be blasphemed, and evil spoken of; and when they persecute him in his members."

### John Wesley:
1. "The apostle here describes the case of those who have cast away both the power and the form of godliness; who have lost both their faith, hope, and love."
2. "Of these wilful total apostates he declares, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance."
3. "Seeing they crucify the Son of God afresh — They use him with the utmost indignity."
