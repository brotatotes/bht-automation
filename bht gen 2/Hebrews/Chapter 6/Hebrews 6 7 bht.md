# Hebrews 6:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The earth, symbolizing true believers, willingly receives the nourishing rain of God's word that falls frequently upon it. This rain represents the grace of Christ, which refreshes and revives, making believers fruitful. These believers bring forth herbs that are suitable for God, the owner of the soil, and for those who cultivate it. As the Gospel takes root in their hearts, it produces the fruits of the Spirit and the fruits of righteousness, pleasing both God and those who labor in the ministry.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "which has drunk in"; not merely receiving it on the surface. Answering to those who have enjoyed the privilege of Christian experiences, being in some sense renewed by the Holy Ghost; true alike of those who persevere and those who "fall away."
2. The "oft" implies, on God's part, the riches of His abounding grace ("coming" spontaneously, and often); and, on the apostate's part, the wilful perversity whereby he has done continual despite to the oft-repeated motions of the Spirit.
3. The heart of man is the earth; man is the dresser; herbs are brought forth meet, not for the dresser, by whom, but for God, the owner of the soil, for whom it is dressed. The plural is general, the owners whoever they may be; here God.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is to show the consequences of not making a proper use of all the privileges which Christians have, and the effect which would follow should those privileges fail to be improved."
2. "The comparison of 'drinking in' the rain is designed to distinguish a mellow soil which receives the rain, from hard or rocky land where it runs off."
3. "The design is to show that a Christian who makes proper use of the means of growing in grace which God bestows upon him, and who does not apostatize, meets with the divine favor and approbation."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The inevitableness of the punishment illustrated by a familiar fact of nature."
2. "The natural result of the ground's receiving and absorbing the rains is fruitfulness, which redounds to the benefit of those who cultivate it."
3. "The blessing is increased fruitfulness."

### John Calvin:
1. "If we desire to bring forth good fruit, as soon as the Lord sows his word, it ought to strike roots in us without delay; for it cannot be expected to fructify, if it be either choked or perish."
2. "So they who receive the seed of the Gospel into their hearts and bring forth genuine shoots, will always make progress until they produce ripe fruit."
3. "So they who destroy the seed of the Gospel either by their indifference or by corrupt affections, so as to manifest no sign of good progress in their life, clearly show themselves to be reprobates, from whom no harvest can be expected."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Which hath drunk (η πιουσα). Articular second aorist active participle of πινω, to drink."
2. "Meet (ευθετον). Old compound verbal (ευ, τιθημ) well-placed, fit (Luke 9:62)."
3. "It is tilled (γεωργειτα). Present passive indicative of γεωργεω, old and rare verb from γεωργος (tiller of the soil, γη, εργον, 2 Timothy 2:6), here only in the N.T."

### John Gill:
1. "The earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it...the former is spoken of in this verse, to which true believers in Christ agree; who are the good ground, into which the seed of God's word is received, and brings forth fruit."
2. "The 'rain' that comes upon them may signify either the grace of Christ, which, like rain, is an instance of his sovereignty... refreshes, revives, and makes fruitful."
3. "and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed; God the Father, who is the husbandman, and ministers of the Gospel, who arc labourers under him; and where the Gospel comes in power, it brings forth the fruits of the Spirit, the fruits of righteousness."
