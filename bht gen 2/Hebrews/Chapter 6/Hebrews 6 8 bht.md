# Hebrews 6:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage refers to a land that produces thorns and briers, symbolizing wicked individuals who cause harm through their actions and words. These people generate errors and evil deeds, demonstrating that the seed of the word was never sown in their hearts. They are already cursed by the law and are nearing the day of reckoning, whether through the impending destruction of Jerusalem or the final judgment. Like the land that is abandoned and left uncultivated, their destiny is one of burning, similar to what happened to Jerusalem.
