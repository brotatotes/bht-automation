# Hebrews 7:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The type of Melchizedek reveals the superiority of Christ, surpassing even Abraham and the lineage of Levi. It highlights the unique and everlasting priesthood of Christ, which is superior to any other priesthood. We can find further insights into this in Genesis 14:18 and the surrounding verses.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Christ unites these offices in their highest sense, and so restores the patriarchal union of these offices."
2. "It is used to imply that the God whom Melchisedec served is THE TRUE GOD, and not one of the gods of the nations around."
3. "As priest he first blessed Abraham on God's part; next he blessed God on Abraham's part: a reciprocal blessing."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The account of Melchizedek, which is very brief, occurs in Genesis 14:18-20. The name occurs in the Bible only in Genesis 14:0, Psalms 110:4, and in this Epistle. Nothing else is certainly known of him."
2. "That he combined in himself the offices of priest and king, furnished to the apostle a beautiful illustration of the offices sustained by the Redeemer, and was in this respect, perhaps, the only one whose history is recorded in the Old Testament, who would furnish such an illustration."
3. "That his genealogy was not recorded, while that of every other priest mentioned was so carefully traced and preserved, furnished another striking illustration. In this respect, like the Son of God, he stood alone."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. For this Melchisedec, etc. See Genesis 14:18-20; Psalms 110:0.

### John Calvin:
1. "He enumerates particularly the things connected with Melchisedec, in which he resembled Christ... It was doubtless necessary that in him who was to be a type of the Son of God all things excellent should be found: and that Christ was shadowed forth by this type is evident from the Psalm referred to."
2. "He is then called the King of righteousness, because of what he effects in diffusing righteousness on all his people. It hence follows, that out of his kingdom nothing but sin reigns among men."
3. "But as peace among the Hebrews means also a prosperous and happy state, it may be so taken here: yet I prefer to understand it here of that inward peace which tranquilizes the conscience and renders it confident before God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is a daring thing to put Melchizedek above Aaron, but the author does it."
2. "Melchizedek is the only one in his line and stands alone in the record in Genesis."
3. "He is called 'priest' and note του υψιστου applied to God as the Canaanites, Phoenicians, Hebrews did."

### John Gill:
1. "It is most proper not to inquire curiously who he was, since the Scripture is silent concerning his genealogy and descent; and that as it should seem on purpose, that he might be a more full and fit type of Christ." 
2. "Salem, of which he was king, was not Shalem, a city of Shechem, in the land of Canaan, but Jerusalem is the place; which is the constant opinion of the Jews." 
3. "He was both king and priest, in which he was an eminent type of Christ; and his being a king is no objection to his being a priest, since it was usual for kings to be priests."

### John Wesley:
1. "Christ, as appears from his type, Melchisedec, who was greater than Abraham himself, from whom Levi descended"
2. "has a priesthood altogether excellent, new, firm, perpetual"
3. "Genesis 14:18, etc."
