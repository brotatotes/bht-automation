# Hebrews 7:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The concept of being in the loins of one's father is emphasized here, illustrating how Levi and his descendants were seminally connected to Abraham. Just as all of mankind were in the loins of Adam when he sinned, resulting in our own fall, Levi's connection to Abraham carries significant doctrinal implications. It points to important beliefs such as personal election in Christ, the eternal provision of blessings to the elect, eternal justification, the reality of original sin, and the deep union believers have with Christ in his crucifixion, burial, resurrection, and exaltation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He was yet in the loins of his father."
2. "On the expression cf. Heb 7:5"
3. "Whether Christ also did not pay tithe in Abraham, that He never was in the loins of an earthly father."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Christ did not, in this sense, pay tithes in Abraham, for He never was in the loins of an earthly father."
2. "Being supernaturally, without human father, conceived, as He is above the natural law of birth, so is he above the law of tithes."
3. "The blessings which Abraham had before meeting Melchisedec were the general promises, and the special one of a natural seed, and so of Levi; but the promises under which Christ was comprehended, and the faith for which Abraham was so commended, followed after Abraham's meeting Melchisedec, and being blessed by him."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The meaning of the apostle is, that he was even then, in a certain sense, in the loins of Abraham, when Melchizedek met him; or it was all the same as if he were there, and had then an existence."
2. "The Jews valued themselves on the dignity and honor of the Levitical priesthood, and it was important to show them on their own principles, and according to their own sacred writings, that the great ancestor of all the Levitical community had himself acknowledged his inferiority to one who was declared also in their own writings to be like the Messiah."
3. "The fact that a remote ancestor had done homage or fealty to the ancestor of another class of titled birth, would be regarded as proof of acknowledged inferiority in the family, and might be used with force and propriety in an argument."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The whole Jewish law, its ordinances and priesthood, are regarded as potentially in Abraham."

2. "Levi was not yet born."
3. "The reference is to Abraham, the forefather (œÄŒ±œÑœÅŒøœÇ) of Levi. This is a rabbinical imaginative refinement appealing to Jews."

### John Gill:
1. "Levi and his whole posterity; which is to be understood seminally, just as all mankind were in the loins of Adam, when he sinned and fell, and so they sinned and fell in him."
2. "It serves to illustrate several points of doctrine, in which either of the public heads, Adam and Christ, are concerned, with respect to their seed and offspring; such as personal election in Christ, an eternal donation of all blessings of grace to the elect in him, eternal justification in him, the doctrine of original sin, and the saints' crucifixion, burial, resurrection, and session in Christ, and together with him."
