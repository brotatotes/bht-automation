# Hebrews 7:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The purpose of the Levitical priesthood was to provide temporary forgiveness for sins, but it was imperfect and unable to bring about true perfection. The sacrifices offered by the priests were limited in their effect, only covering sins of ignorance and offering temporal, rather than eternal, life. If the Levitical priesthood was able to provide perfection, there would have been no need for another priest to arise after the order of Melchizedek. The imperfections of the Levitical priesthood made way for a higher and more excellent priesthood under Christ, bringing about a better dispensation and a true path to salvation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The bringing of man to his highest state, viz, that of salvation and sanctification."
2. "Not only they, but the whole system of which the priesthood was the basis and center."
3. "Implying diversity of nature and order: in which case it cannot be the subject to ŒªŒ≠Œ≥ŒµœÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ, which has Œ∫Œ±œÑ·Ω∞ œÑ·Ω¥ŒΩ œÑŒ¨ŒæŒπŒΩ ·ºàŒ±œÅœéŒΩ for its predicate, thus nullifying the ·ºïœÑŒµœÅŒøŒΩ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Perfection is the bringing of man to his highest state, namely, that of salvation and sanctification."
2. "Upon it, the people have received the law, implying that the people were still observing the law."
3. "For God does nothing needless, therefore there was a need for a different priest of a different order to arise."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Even from their own Scriptures it was apparent that a priest was to arise of another order, and of a more permanent character, and this he says was full proof: that there was defect of some kind in the previous order."
2. "What this defect was, he does not here specify, but the subsequent reasoning shows that it was in such points as these - that it was not permanent; that it could not make the worshippers perfect; that the blood which they offered in sacrifice could not take away sin, and could not render those who offered it holy."
3. "If that system would lead to perfection; if it was sufficient to make the conscience pure, and to remove sin, then there was no necessity of any other. Yet the Scriptures have declared that there 'would be' another of a different order, implying that there was some defect in the former."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In Christ, as the Melchisedec - priest, the ideal of the priesthood is realized." 
2. "By this word is signified the establishment of a perfect fellowship between God and the worshipper." 
3. "Not merely another, but a different kind of priest."

### John Calvin:
1. "He now reasons thus, If the ministry of the Church was perfect under the order of Aaron, why was it necessary to return to another order? For in perfection nothing can be changed." 
2. "This he proves by the abrogation of the priesthoods and in this way: Had the authority of the ancient priesthood been such as to be sufficient fully to establish the Law, God would have never introduced in its place another and a different priesthood."
3. "The imperfection of the Levitical priesthood was doubtless its capacity really to make an atonement for sin, as its work was ceremonial and typical: but it was enough for the present purpose merely to say that it was not perfect, as it failed to answer the great end of establishing a priesthood."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If sinners are to be forgiven, forgiveness must be consistent with the Divine character and law; the conscience must be pacified and man made holy."
2. "The case is made clear by the parenthetic statement for on the ground of the Levitical priesthood the people have received the law; so that now, if the priesthood is removed, the economy itself is removed also."
3. "Under the Gospel, God appoints, as He foretold, a priest who does not answer to the description given of priests under the law a clear proof that He who first made the law has annulled it."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Levitical priesthood failed to give men 'a perfectly adequate relation to God'." 
2. "The condition is of the second class, 'if there were perfection, etc.'"
3. "Of a different line (ŒµœÑŒµœÅŒøŒΩ), not just one more (Œ±ŒªŒªŒøŒΩ)."

### John Gill:
1. "The design of [the commentary] is to show, that there is no perfection by [the Levitical priesthood]; as is clear from the priests themselves, who were but men, mortal men, sinful men, and so imperfect."
2. "The sacrifices the priests offered did not extend to all kind of sins, only to sins of ignorance, not to presumptuous ones; and there were many under that dispensation punished with death; and at most they only delivered from temporal, not eternal punishment, and only entitled to a temporal life, not an eternal one."
3. "Had perfection been by [the Levitical priesthood], what further need was there that another priest should arise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?"

### John Wesley:
1. "The apostle now demonstrates that the Levitical priesthood must yield to the priesthood of Christ..."
2. "If now perfection were by the Levitical priesthood...What farther need was there, that another priest...should be set up?"
3. "From this single consideration it is plain, that both the priesthood and the law...were now to give way to a better priesthood and more excellent dispensation."
