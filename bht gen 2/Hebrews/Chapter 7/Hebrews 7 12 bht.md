# Hebrews 7:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If the priesthood is changed, there inevitably follows a necessary change of the law. The ministry of Moses and Aaron, being temporary and interconnected, were annulled by the arrival of Christ. His priesthood brought about a transfer to a new basis. The Levitical priesthood became obsolete, and a new covenant was established. Through Christ's priesthood, there was a shift in the ceremonial and political arrangements of the law. This change impacted the entire legal system. The apostle's argument is powerful and undeniable, revealing God's purpose to choose a different priesthood for his Son.
