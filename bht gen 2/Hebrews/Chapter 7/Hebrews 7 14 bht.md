# Hebrews 7:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is undeniable that our Lord emerged from the tribe of Judah. This fact was well-known and widely accepted during that era. The Messiah's connection to the tribe of Judah is significant because the Mosaic laws made no mention of priests coming from this tribe. This underscores the uniqueness of Jesus' priesthood and signifies a change from the established order.
