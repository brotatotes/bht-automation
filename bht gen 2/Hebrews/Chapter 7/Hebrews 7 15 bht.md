# Hebrews 7:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The need for a change in the priesthood is strongly evident, as it is based on the fact that the Messiah was to come from the tribe of Judah and also be of the order of Melchizedek. The Levitical priesthood, with its external rituals, falls short in comparison to the spiritual and everlasting priesthood of Christ. The distinction between the two priesthoods emphasizes the temporary nature of the former and the superior nature of the latter. The change in the law is emphasized, highlighting the spiritual power behind Christ's priesthood.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And it is yet more abundantly manifest, if according to the similitude of Melchisedek ariseth a different priest."
2. "But the alteration of the law is the proposition here: and so Estius, Schlichting, Seb. Schmidt, Kuinoel, Tholuck, Bleek, LÃ¼nem., al."
3. "The alteration of the law is the proposition here."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Christ is appointed Priest, 'not according to the law of a carnal (that is, a mere outward) commandment,' but 'according to the power of an indissoluble life.'"
2. "The Levitical law required a definite carnal descent. In contrast stands 'the power'; Christ's spiritual, inward, living power of overcoming death."
3. "The 'order' cannot mean a series of priests, for Melchisedec neither received his priesthood from, nor transmitted it to, any other mere man; it must mean 'answering to the office of Melchisedec.' Christ's priesthood is similar to Melchisedec's in that it is 'for ever'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A strong proof of the necessity of such a change of the priesthood was furnished from the fact that the Messiah was to be of the tribe of Judah; but a much stronger, because 'as a priest' he was to be of the order of Melchizedek."
2. "Resembling; that is, he was to be of the order of Melchizedek."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Thoroughly evident."
2. "The unsatisfactory character of the Levitical priesthood."
3. "Emphasizing the personal resemblance to Melchisedec."

### John Calvin:
1. "He proves by another argument, that the Law is abolished."
2. "The ancient priesthood, he says, had to do with external rites; but in Christ's priesthood there is nothing but what is spiritual."
3. "It hence appears, that the former was evanescent and temporary; but that the latter was to be perpetual."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "More abundantly evident...thoroughly clear with still added and the comparative piling Ossa on Pelion like Philippians 1:23." 
2. "Likeness. See Hebrews 4:15, only N.T. examples. Cf. the verb in verse Hebrews 7:3." 
3. "Ariseth another priest. As said in verse Hebrews 7:11, now assumed in condition of first class."

### John Gill:
1. "From a fact which cannot be denied; for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest."
2. "Hence we learn that Melchizedek and Christ are not the same person; and that the order and similitude of Melchizedek are the same."
3. "Christ's being of his order only imports that there is a resemblance and likeness between him and Melchizedek, in many things."

### John Wesley:
1. "Both the priesthood and the law are changed, because the priest now raised up is not only of another tribe, but of a quite different order."
