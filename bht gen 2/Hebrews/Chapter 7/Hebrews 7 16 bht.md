# Hebrews 7:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage emphasizes the distinction between the temporal and external nature of the Mosaic law, particularly regarding the priesthood, and the enduring and spiritual nature of Christ's priesthood. The old law focused on outward observances and was limited by its temporary nature. In contrast, Christ's priesthood is not bound by earthly limitations but is characterized by the power of an everlasting and unchanging life. It is through His priesthood that we find a better hope to approach and draw near to God, surpassing the imperfection and insufficiency of the previous commandment.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "not according to the law of a carnal commandment...an exterior ordinance founded on the present fleshly and decaying state of things." 
2. "the power here spoken of does not, however, strictly correspond, in its relation to the priesthood spoken of, with 'the law of a carnal commandment' above. That was the rule, by and after which the priesthood was constituted: this, the vigour inherent in the glorious priesthood of Christ."
3. "for it is of His enduring Melchisedek-priesthood in glory that this is spoken to endure forever."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The law" is here not the law in general, but the statute as to the priesthood.
2. "Carnal," as being only outward and temporary, is contrasted with "endless," or, as Greek, "indissoluble."
3. The law can give a commandment, but it cannot give life. But our High Priest's inherent "power," now in heaven, has in Him "life for ever".

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'carnal' means 'fleshly;' and the idea is, that the Law under which the priests of the old dispensation were made was external, rather than spiritual; it related more to outward observances than to the keeping of the heart."
2. "It was not concerned mainly with outward observances, and did not pass over from one to another by death, but was unchanging in its character, and spiritual in its nature."
3. "It was enduring and perpetual as a priesthood, and was thus far exalted above the service performed by the priests under the former dispensation."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The priest must be of proper descent, without bodily blemish, ceremonially pure."
2. "Jesus was high priest in virtue of the energy of indissoluble life which dwelt in him, unlike the priests who die."
3. "For there is a disannulling of a foregoing commandment, because of its weakness and unprofitableness (for the law made nothing perfect), and the bringing in thereupon of a better hope through which we draw nigh unto God."

### John Calvin:
1. "We know how Aaron and his sons were initiated into their office... What was fulfilled in Christ by the hidden and celestial power of the Spirit, was shadowed forth under the Law by ointment, various vestments, the sprinkling of blood, and other earthly ceremonies." 
2. "However spiritual then might have been the meaning of these shadows, they were yet but shadows in themselves; and as they were made up of the elements of this world, they may justly be called earthly."
3. "As Christ is a perpetual priest, it was necessary, that he should be different from Aaron as to the manner of his appointment; and so it was, for it was not Moses, a mortal man, who consecrated him, but the Holy Spirit, and that not with oil, nor with the blood of goats, nor with the outward pomp of vestments, but with celestial power..."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Carnal (œÉŒ±œÅŒ∫ŒπŒΩŒ∑œÇ). 'Fleshen' as in 1 Corinthians 3:1, not œÉŒ±œÅŒ∫ŒπŒ∫Œ∑œÇ (fleshlike, 1 Corinthians 3:3). The Levitical priests became so merely by birth."
2. "Of an endless life (Œ∂œâŒ∑œÇ Œ±Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±ŒªœÖœÑŒøœÖ). Late compound (alpha privative and verbal adjective from Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±ŒªœÖœâ, to dissolve, as in 2 Corinthians 4:1), indissoluble."
3. "Jesus as priest lives on forever. He is Life."

### John Gill:
1. "Not after the law of a carnal commandment: either the ceremonial law in general, which was a carnal one...the sacrifices of it were the flesh of beasts; and these were for the sins of the flesh, and for the removing the ceremonial uncleanness of it..."
2. "...the law of the priesthood is particularly intended; or that commandment which respected the priesthood of Aaron; which law regarded the carnal descent of his sons; enjoined a carnal inauguration of them, and provided for their succession and continuance in a carnal way..."
3. "...this may be understood either of the Gospel, according to which Christ is a priest; and which is called 'life', in opposition to the law which is the ministration of death...and there is a 'power' goes along with it; which distinguishes it from the weak and beggarly elements of the ceremonial law..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Not after the law of a carnal commandment - Not according to the Mosaic law, which consisted chiefly of commandments that were carnal, compared to the spirituality of the gospel."
2. "But after the power of an endless life - Which he has in himself, as the eternal Son of God."
