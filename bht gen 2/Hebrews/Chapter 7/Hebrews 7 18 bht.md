# Hebrews 7:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The idea conveyed in the commentaries is that the previous commandment regarding the Levitical priesthood is done away with and replaced by a new and everlasting priesthood. The ceremonial law, although beneficial in certain aspects such as convicting of sin and guiding the conduct of believers, is ultimately insufficient in terms of justification and salvation. It lacked the power to remove the guilt of sin or cleanse individuals from its defilement. The introduction of a more perfect plan with the arrival of the Messiah resulted in the annulment of the former laws.
