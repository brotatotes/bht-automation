# Hebrews 7:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The law, though valuable, had limitations and couldn't achieve true perfection. However, through the introduction of a better hope, found in Christ, everything changed. This better hope fulfilled the promises and prophecies of the Old Testament and brought about the perfection that the law could not accomplish. By drawing near to God through Christ, we are able to experience true perfection. Christ's sacrifice paid our debts, satisfied the demands of the law, and provided pardon and reconciliation. Through Him, we have the confidence and encouragement to approach God and experience the fullness of His presence.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The law could not bring men to true justification or sanctification before God, which is the 'perfection' that we all need in order to be accepted of Him, and which we have in Christ." 
2. "The law brought nothing to its perfected end - everything in it was introductory to its antitype in the Christian economy, which realizes the perfection contemplated." 
3. "There takes place a repealing of the commandment, but a bringing in afterwards [of] a better hope, not one weak and unprofitable, but something better than the good things which the pre-existing law promised, bringing us near to God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "For the law made nothing perfect - The Levitical, ceremonial law. It did not produce a perfect state; it did not do what was desirable to be done for a sinner."
2. "But there is now the introduction of a better system by which we can approach a reconciled God. The 'better hope' here refers to the more sure and certain expectation of heaven introduced by the gospel."
3. "By which better hope; that is, by means of the ground of hope furnished by the gospel, to wit, that God is now reconciled and that we can approach him with the assurance that he is ready to save us."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The A. V. overlooks the parenthesis, ignores the connection of bringing in with disannulling, translates de but instead of and, and supplies did; thus making an opposition between the law which made nothing perfect and the bringing in of a better hope, which did make something perfect."
2. "The bringing in of a better hope... is 'a bringing in upon,' upon the ground formerly occupied by the commandment... For better, see on ch. Hebrews 1:4. The comparison is not between the hope conveyed by the commandment, and the better hope introduced by the gospel, but between the commandment which was characteristic of the law and the hope which characterized the gospel."
3. "Christianity is the religion of good hope because by it men first enter into intimate fellowship with God. The old priesthood could not effect this."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Law was only a beginning; then something more perfect was necessarily to follow; for it is not fit that Godâ€™s children should always continue in childish elements."
2. "But as the preposition denotes a consequence, when one thing follows another, it ought, as I think, to be thus rendered, 'but added was an introduction into a better hope.'"
3. "And whosoever continues in the Law, knowingly and willingly deprives himself of the privilege of approaching nigh to God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "And yet law is necessary." 
2. "This better hope does bring us near to God as we come close to God's throne through Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "For the law made nothing perfect... it could not perfectly make atonement for sin; nor make men perfectly holy or righteous; it could neither justify nor sanctify... but the bringing in of a better hope did."
2. "Christ himself may be designed, who is often called hope, being the object, ground, and foundation of it... and it may have respect to his coming in the flesh, being sent, or brought in by his father... it brought to perfection all the types, promises, and prophecies of the Old Testament, the whole law, moral and ceremonial..."
3. "and it is through Christ and his priesthood that souls have encouragement to draw nigh to God; for Christ has paid all their debts, satisfied law and justice, procured the pardon of their sins, atonement and reconciliation for them."

### John Wesley:
1. "The law...made nothing perfect." 
2. "The bringing in of a better hope...does." 
3. "By which we draw nigh to God...And this is true perfection."
