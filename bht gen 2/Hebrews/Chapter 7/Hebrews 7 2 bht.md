# Hebrews 7:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Melchizedek, a sample of God's preservation amidst apostasy, was recognized by Abraham as a priest of God, and Abraham's offering to him was an act of pious thankfulness to God. The designation Melchizedek signifies the literal interpretation of his Hebrew name, while King of peace reflects his character. This act of offering a tenth to God predates the Levitical law, highlighting its importance as a duty. Melchizedek's righteousness and peaceful rule are reminiscent of Christ's, as righteousness and peace are joined in all who believe in him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Melchisedec is a sample of how God preserves, amidst general apostasy, an elect remnant."
2. "The Levitical was parenthetical, and severed the kingdom and priesthood; the patriarchal was the true forerunner of Christ's, which, like Melchisedec's, unites the kingship and priesthood."
3. "Christ is the true Prince of peace. The peace which He brings is the fruit of righteousness."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This does not appear to have been on the part of Abraham so much designed as a present to Melchizedek personally, as an act of pious thankfulness to God."
2. "From this it is evident that the propriety of devoting a tenth part of what was possessed to God, was regarded as a duty before the appointment of the Levitical law."
3. "Paul does not say that this name was given to him with any such reference; or that it was 'designed' to be symbolical of what the Messiah would be, but that there was a 'remarkable coincidence;' that it was a fact which was worth at least 'a passing thought.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The first designation is the literal interpretation of the Hebrew name."
2. "Then follows a designation derived from his character, king of peace."
3. "The passage in Genesis, however, points to a place, and the writer might naturally have desired to indicate the typical meaning of the city over which Melchisedec reigned."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "So Abraham recognized Melchizedek as a priest of God."
2. "The author gives in Greek the meaning of the Hebrew words Melchizedek (King of righteousness, cf. Hebrews 1:8) and Salem (peace)."

### John Gill:
1. "it was a voluntary act, and not what any law obliged to"
2. "to testify his gratitude to God, for the victory obtained"
3. "his kingdom lies in righteousness, as well as peace; the subjects of it are righteous persons, and all his ways are just and true"

### John Wesley:
1. "Being first — According to the meaning of his own name."
2. "King of righteousness, then — According to the name of his city."
