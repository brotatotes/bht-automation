# Hebrews 7:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ's priesthood is superior to the law-priesthood because it is confirmed by the oath of God. By taking an oath, God establishes the solemnity and weight of Christ's Melchisedec-like priesthood, emphasizing its superiority. Christ's appointment to the priesthood surpasses that of Aaron, as God's oath signifies the honor and importance given to him. This oath, referenced in the book of Psalms and cited as proof of Christ's priesthood, highlights the magnificence of the covenant God has made with us through Christ, surpassing the old covenant of Moses.
