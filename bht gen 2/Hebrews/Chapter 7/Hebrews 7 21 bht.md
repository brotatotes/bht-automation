# Hebrews 7:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ's priesthood is superior to the Levitical priesthood because it was confirmed with an oath from God. This oath not only demonstrates the importance and validity of Christ's priesthood, but also assures believers of its enduring nature. God will not change His mind or regret appointing Christ as our high priest. His priesthood is unchangeable and everlasting, according to the order of Melchizedek.
