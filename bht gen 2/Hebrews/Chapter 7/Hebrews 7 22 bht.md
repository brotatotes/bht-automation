# Hebrews 7:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus became the surety and mediator between God and man, establishing a better and unchangeable covenant. This covenant, referred to both as a testament and a compact, was made by the Father with Christ on behalf of all the elect, securing promises and blessings for them. Jesus, the testator, offered himself as a pledge, guaranteeing the fulfillment of this covenant through his death. In doing so, he demonstrated unparalleled love by taking on the responsibility of satisfying for their sins, working out a righteousness for them, and preserving their happiness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This He did by becoming responsible for our guilt, by sealing the covenant with His blood, and by being openly acknowledged as our triumphant Saviour by the Father, who raised Him from the dead."
2. "Thus He is at once God's surety for man, and man's surety for God, and so Mediator between God and man."
3. "The Greek term implies that it is appointed by God, and comprises the relations and bearings partly of a covenant, partly of a testament."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There is all the additional security in the suretyship of Jesus which arises from the solemnity of an oath."
2. "The Great Surety comes in, and says that it is not so. He has become responsible for this; he the surety, the pledge, that all proper honor shall be paid to justice."
3. "The new covenant is that made by means of Christ. This is 'better' because: (1) The terms are more simple and easy; (2) The observances and rites are much less onerous and hard; (3) It relates to all people, not being confined to the Jewish people; (4) It is now sure."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The idea underlying all these words is that of putting something into one's hand as a pledge." 
2. "The thought of a covenant is introduced for the first time, and foreshadows ch. 8 6 - 13." 
3. "It adds to the thought of the inferiority of the Levitical priesthood that of the inferiority of the dispensation which it represented."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Of so much better a covenant hath Jesus become surety, i.e He has pledged Himself for the maintenance of it, and for the fulfilment of its promises."
2. "The covenant is the result of His death, and His presence above as Priest and the glory and honour with which He is crowned are a perpetual security for its continuance and completion."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The surety (εγγυος). Vulgate sponsor. Old word, here only in the N.T., adjective (one pledged, betrothed), from εγγυη, a pledge, here used as substantive like εγγυητης, one who gives a pledge or guarantee."
2. "There may be a play on the word εγγιζω in verse Hebrews 7:19. Εγγυαω is to give a pledge, εγγυαλιζω, to put a pledge in the hollow of the hand."
3. "It is not clear whether the author means that Jesus is God's pledge to man, or man's to God, or both. He is both in fact, as the Mediator (ο μεσιτης, Hebrews 8:6) between God and man (Son of God and Son of man)."

### John Gill:
1. "a testament, because it is founded in the good will and pleasure of God, and respects an inheritance bequeathed by God the Father to his children, which was confirmed and comes to them by the death of Christ the testator"
2. "a covenant, it being a compact or agreement made by the Father with Christ, as the representative of all the elect; in which promises and blessings of all sorts are provided and secured for them in him"
3. "Christ is not the surety for the Father to his people, but for them to the Father; as to satisfy for their sins, to work out a righteousness for them, to preserve and keep them, and make them happy; which is an instance of matchless love."

### John Wesley:
1. "Of so much better a covenant — Unchangeable, eternal."
2. "Was Jesus made a surety — Or mediator."
3. "The original word means either a covenant or a last will and testament."
