# Hebrews 7:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The priesthood under the old covenant was marked by its imperfection, as there were many priests who served one after another. This constant change was a result of their mortality, as death prevented them from continuing their priestly duties. The high priesthood in particular was not exempt from the inevitability of death. The frequent changes in the priesthood were also influenced by a system where the office could be bought for money, leading to those offering the highest price being appointed. In contrast, Jesus Christ is the one and only high priest, unaffected by death, who holds an unchangeable priesthood.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And they indeed (the Œø·º± Œº·Ω≤ŒΩ Œ≥Œ¨œÅ of Hebrews 7:20; i. e. the Levitical priests) are appointed priests in numbers, on account of their being by death hindered from continuing." 
2. "The verb is a vox media, and may be applied to any sort of endurance treated of in the context...which clearly here treats of abiding in the priesthood."
3. "Besides which, it would be somewhat tautological to say that they were hindered by death from continuing in life."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Christ dies not, and so hath a priesthood which passes not from one to another."
2. "He [Christ] hath a priesthood which passes not from one to another."
3. "Hindered from permanently continuing, namely, in the priesthood."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The object of this verse and the following is, to state one more reason of the excellence of the priesthood of Christ."
2. "It is, that owing to the frailty of human nature, and the shortness of life, the office of priest there was continually changing."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:

2. "The ancient priests were many, for death put an end to their priesthood; but there is no death to prevent Christ from discharging his office."
3. "Thus a different cause produces different effects."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Many in number (œÄŒªŒµŒπŒøŒΩŒµœÇ). Comparative predicate adjective, 'more than one,' in succession, not simultaneously."
2. "Because they are hindered (Œ¥ŒπŒ± œÑŒø Œ∫œâŒªœÖŒµœÉŒ∏Œ±). Articular infinitive (present passive) with Œ¥ŒπŒ± and the accusative case, 'because of the being hindered.'"
3. "By death (Œ∏Œ±ŒΩŒ±œÑœâ). Instrumental case."
4. "From continuing (œÄŒ±œÅŒ±ŒºŒµŒΩŒµŒπŒΩ). Present active infinitive of the compound (remain beside) as in Philippians 1:25 and in the ablative case."

### John Gill:
1. "This shows the imperfection of this priesthood, since it was in many hands; no one continuing and being sufficient to execute it; but Christ is the one and only high priest; there is no other, nor is there any need of any other."
2. "Death puts a stop to men's works, and to the exercise of their several callings; no office, even the most sacred, exempts from it; no, not the office of high priests."
3. "The office was bought for money, and men that would give most were put into it: hence there were frequent changes; the Jews themselves say, they changed every twelve months."

### John Wesley:
