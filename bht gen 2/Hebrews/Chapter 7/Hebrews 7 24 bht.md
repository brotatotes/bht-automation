# Hebrews 7:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Because he lives forever, Christ's priesthood is unchanging and does not pass on to another. His divine nature and office as a priest continue continually, unlike the mortal priests who served before him. While human priests served for a time and then passed their duties to others, Christ's priesthood remains forever, unwavering and unalterable. This unchangeable priesthood brings comfort and glory to the believers, as Christ's sacrifice and intercession are everlasting and eternally effective.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "They, on account of their deaths, are subject to continual renewal: He, because He lives for ever, has, &c."
2. "The adjective a pure predicate, not an epithet. ἀπαράβατος is a word of later Greek... unalterable; which may not be passed by or put aside."
3. "The sun, in Plut. de Oracul. Defect. p. 410, has a τάξις ἀπαράβατος: and Hierceles, Aur. Carm. p. 26, has, τὸ ἀπαράβατον τῆς ἐν τοῖς δημιουργηθεῖσιν εὐταξίας, and p. 72, ἡ τῶν καθηκόντων τήρησις ἀπαράβατος."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He—emphatic; Greek, 'Himself.' So in :-, 'THOU art a priest'; singular, not priests, 'many.'"
2. "unchangeable—Greek, 'hath His priesthood unchangeable'; not passing from one to another, intransmissible. Therefore no earthly so-called apostolic succession of priests are His vicegerents."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Because he remains forever, he has an unchanging priesthood."
2. "The reason in their case, why it passed to others, was not that they did not perform the office well, but that they were mortal."
3. "The idea is not strictly that it was 'unchangable,' but that 'it did not pass over into other hands.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The emphasis is on unchangeable."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "By some commentators, the 'abiding' which is here affirmed of Christ is applied not to His life, but to His priesthood."
2. "The 'for ever' of the Psalm relates to the priesthood of Christ, and answers to the 'for ever' of the arrangement with Melchisedec."
3. "Though the life of Christ is eternal, as are the effects of His priesthood, yet His exercise of that office will cease when all the glorious ends of it are completely answered in the eternal salvation of the redeemed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Because he abideth (δια το μενειν αυτον). Same idiom as in verse Hebrews 7:23, 'because of the abiding as to him' (accusative of general reference, αυτον)."
2. "Unchangeable (απαραβατον). Predicate adjective in the accusative (feminine of compound adjective like masculine), late double compound verbal adjective in Plutarch and papyri, from alpha privative and παραβαινω, valid or inviolate."
3. "God placed Christ in this priesthood and no one else can step into it. See verse Hebrews 7:11 for ιερωσυνη."

### John Gill:
1. "But this man, because he continueth ever... he not only continued in his divine nature...but he continued in his office as a priest."
2. "The virtue of his sacrifice always remains, and he himself ever lives as an intercessor."
