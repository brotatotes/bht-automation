# Hebrews 7:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ, being the eternal and all-powerful God, is fully capable of saving us completely from the condemnation and effects of sin. He actively intercedes for those who come to Him in faith, pleading on their behalf before God. This is possible because He is alive forever, fulfilling His role as our Savior and constantly making intercession for us.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "He intercedes only for those who come unto God through Him, not for the unbelieving world."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "It includes every form of Christ's identifying himself with human interests."
3. "The Logos is not treated by Philo as a divine-human personality intervening for men, but as a poetical personification allegorically considered."

### John Calvin:
1. "The chief good of man is to be united to his God, with whom is the fountain of life and of all blessings; but their own unworthiness drives all away from any access to him." 
2. "Seeing he ever liveth, etc. What sort of pledge and how great is this of love towards us! Christ liveth for us, not for himself! That he was received into a blessed immortality to reign in heaven, this has taken place, as the Apostle declares, for our sake." 
3. "He at the same time teaches us by what Christ is doing, that he is performing his office as a priest; for it belongs to a priest to intercede for the people, that they may obtain favor with God. This is what Christ is ever doing, for it was for this purpose that he rose again from the dead."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He is able also to save...all that approach through him to God, ever living as he does...to undertake for them." 
2. "The word rendered 'undertake' means primarily 'to see' or 'meet in with a person on behalf of another,' and so includes all that Christ does for us, either by His perpetual oblation in heaven, or by His mediation generally and kingship as Head over all." 
3. "This mediation is of the very essence of the work of Christ so far as His priestly office is concerned, and is the ground of the triumphant outburst of St. Paul when he concludes that none can condemn, seeing that Christ who died is now risen, and is making continual intercession on our behalf."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Since he alone holds this priesthood." 
2. "The common meaning is completely, utterly." 
3. "His intercession has red blood in it, unlike Philo's conception."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ was called to this work by his Father; he was promised by him to do it, and was sent by him to effect it, and has accomplished it."
2. "Christ is able; as appears from the help his Father laid on him, who knew him to be mighty; from his own undertaking it, being mighty to save; and from his having completely effected it; and he must needs be able to do it, since he is the mighty God."
3. "Christ ever lives as God, he is the living God; and though he died as man, he is risen from the dead, and will not die again, but live for evermore; and he lives as Mediator and Redeemer, and particularly as a priest; one branch of whose office it is to intercede for his people."

### John Wesley:
1. "He is able to save to the uttermost - from all the guilt, power, root, and consequence of sin."
2. "Them who come - by faith."
3. "Seeing he ever liveth to make intercession - he ever lives and intercedes."
