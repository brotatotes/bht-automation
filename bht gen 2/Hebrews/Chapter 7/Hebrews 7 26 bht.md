# Hebrews 7:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For us, sinful and stained, having a high priest like Jesus is truly remarkable. He is not only holy before God, but also harmless and free from any sin in himself. He is set apart from sinners and his purity surpasses that of the heavens. It's an incredible paradox and a great blessing that such a high priest is provided for us.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For such an High Priest was for us, becoming also holy, harmless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens." 
2. "ὅσιος...seems always to betoken...piety towards God...perfect in piety and reverent holiness towards His Heavenly Father."
3. "ἄκακος...betokens simplicity, and freedom from vice or evil suspicion."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "There was also becoming (besides the other excellencies of our High Priest) such an High Priest."
2. "Temptation, to which He was exposed, left no trace of evil in Him."
3. "Just as Moses on the mount was separated from and above the people, and alone with God. This proves Jesus is GOD."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was not requisite merely that he should have great power; or that he should be of a rank superior to that of the Jewish priesthood; but there was a special propriety that he should surpass all others in 'moral' purity."
2. "Such an high priest we have in the person of the Lord Jesus; and there is no truth more interesting, and no proposition more susceptible of proof, than that he is exactly Fitted to man."
3. "He is benevolent, and pities our woes; wise, and is able to enlighten our ignorance; compassionate, and ready to forgive our faults. He has made such a sacrifice as was necessary to put away our guilt, and offers such intercession as we need to have offered for us in order that we may be preserved from falling."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "There was an essential fitness in the gift of our great high priest."
2. "Holy...always with a relation to God; never of moral excellence as related to men."
3. "Undefiled...denoting a condition realized in Christ's exaltation."

### John Calvin:
1. "This honor belongs to Christ alone. Then what was required for the real discharge of the office was wanting in the priests of the law."
2. "For there was some holiness, and harmlessness, and purity in Aaron, but only a small measure; but Christ, exempt from the common lot of men, is alone free from every sin; hence in him alone is found real holiness and innocency."
3. "No one is a lawful priest, except he is appointed by God’s command; and God has nowhere conferred this honor on angels. It would then be a sacrilegious usurpation, were they, without being called, to intrude into the office."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Such" (τοιουτος) refers to the Melchizedek character of Jesus as high priest and in particular to his power to help and save as just explained in Hebrews 7:24. 
2. Holy (οσιος). Saintly, pious, as already noted. 
3. Undefiled (αμιαντος). Untainted, stainless. Not merely ritual purity, but real ethical cleanness.

### John Gill:
1. "He was typified by the high priest, who had holiness to the Lord written on his forehead, and far exceeds any of the priests in holiness."
2. "He was separated from them in Adam; he was not among the individuals of human nature that sinned in him."
3. "And he had no communion with them in sin; nor did he encourage them to it in the days of his flesh."

### John Wesley:
1. "For such an high priest suited us — Unholy, mischievous, defiled sinners: a blessed paradox!"
2. "Holy - With respect to God. Harmless — With respect to men. Undefiled — With any sin in himself. Separated from sinners — As well as free from sin."
3. "And made — Even in his human nature. Higher than the heavens — And all their inhabitants."
