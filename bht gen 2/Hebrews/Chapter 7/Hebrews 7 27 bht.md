# Hebrews 7:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The great High Priest, Jesus, does not need to offer sacrifices daily like the high priests in Judaism. Unlike the earthly priests who had to offer sacrifices for their own sins, Jesus had no sin of His own. He offered Himself as the perfect and spotless sacrifice, once for all. By doing so, Jesus fulfilled the law and obtained complete salvation for all who believe in Him. His sacrifice was sufficient and did not need to be repeated. Through His sacrificial offering, Jesus brought about complete atonement and brought an end to the need for continual sacrifices.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Wesley:
1. "Who needeth not to offer up sacrifices daily... for he offered once for all."
2. "He then offered up himself 'without spot to God'."

### Henry Alford:
1. "The Writer is not setting forth the ideal of a high priest, but speaking of the actually existing attributes of our great High Priest, as He is."
2. "The true meaning is the simple one, held fast by Calov., Seb. Schmidt, Wolf, Bleek, Tholuck, Lünem., Delitzsch, al., that the allusion is to the daily offerings of the priests, Exodus 29:38-42; Numbers 28:3-8, which are spoken of as offered by the high priests, though they took part in them only on festival days."
3. "Still it must be confessed that the application of such an idea to the daily sacrifices has no authority in the law: and it would seem probable, as Bleek suggests, that the ceremonies of the great day of atonement were throughout before the mind of the Writer, as the chief and archetypal features of the high priest’s work, but repeated in some sort in the daily sacrifices."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Who needeth not daily (kaq' hJmeran). Apparently inconsistent with ch. 9 7, but the sense is, 'who hath no need day by day as the high priest had (year by year) to offer sacrifices,' etc. The great point is repetition, whether daily or yearly."
2. "Once [εφαπαξ] . Rend. once for all. Contrasted with daily."
3. "When he offered up himself [εαυτον ανενεγκας] . A new thought. For the first time Christ appears as victim."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The priests daily offered sacrifices... The high priests took part in these daily-offered sacrifices only on festival days; but as they represented the whole priesthood, the daily offerings are here attributed to them."
2. "The 'daily' strictly belongs to Christ, not to the high priests, 'who needeth not daily, as those high priests (year by year, and their subordinate priests daily), to offer.'"
3. "This he did... for the people's only. The negation is twofold: He needeth not to offer (1) daily nor (2) to offer for His own sins also; for He offered Himself a spotless sacrifice."

### John Calvin:
1. "One of the defects of the ancient priesthood was, that the high priest offered sacrifices for his own sins; how then could he have pacified God for others, who had God justly displeased with himself?"
2. "The other defect was, that they offered various sacrifices daily; it hence follows, that there was no real expiation; for sins remain when purgation is repeated."
3. "The case with Christ was wholly different; for he himself needed no sacrifice, as he was sprinkled with no spot of sin; and such was the sacrifice, that it was alone sufficient to the end of the world, for he offered himself."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ needed not to offer for his own, nor could he, for he had none of his own; what he had was by imputation."
2. "Christ offered himself, his whole human nature, soul and body, and both as in union with his divine nature."
3. "Hereby justice was satisfied; the law fulfilled; sin taken away, and complete salvation obtained."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "First (προτερον). Regular adverb for comparison between two, though πρωτον often occurs also (John 1:41), with επειτα (then) following."
2. "For the sins (τον). Only the article in the Greek with repetition of υπερ or of αμαρτιων."
3. "When he offered up himself (εαυτον ανενεγκας). First aorist active participle of αναφερω, to offer up. See same idea in Hebrews 9:14 where εαυτον προσηνεγκεν is used. Old verb for sacrifice to place on the altar (1 Peter 2:5; 1 Peter 2:24)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Jewish high priest was a sinful man. He had the same fallen and corrupt nature as others."
2. "It became necessary, therefore, to repeat them every day to keep up the proper sense of their transgressions, and to furnish a suitable acknowledgment of the tendency to sin alike among the people and the priests."
3. "He made such an atonement that it was not needful that it should be repeated. Thus, he put an end to sacrifice."
