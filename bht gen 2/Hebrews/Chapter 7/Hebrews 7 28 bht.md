# Hebrews 7:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible teaches that the Law appoints men as high priests, but these men have their own weaknesses and imperfections. However, Christ, being the Son of God, did not have these same weaknesses and imperfections. He did not need to offer sacrifices for his own sins because he was free from sin and his sacrifice was perfect. Christ's priesthood is superior to that of the Levitical priests and is permanent, as he remains a priest forever. The oath of God established Christ as the eternal, perfect high priest, fulfilling the shortcomings of the Law.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Law makes men high priests, who have infirmity."
2. "Christ had not the first, and therefore need not offer for his own sin: he was free from the second, and therefore need not repeat His sacrifice."
3. "He, by that ἀσθένεια which He took on Him, went out through death into glory eternal, and an unrenewable priesthood."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He needed not, as they, to offer FOR
	HIS OWN SIN; and being now
	exempt from death and 'perfected for evermore,' He needs
	not to REPEAT His
	sacrifice."
2. "which—which oath was after the law, namely, in Hebrews 7:27- :, abrogating the preceding law-priesthood."
3. "Consecrated as a perfected priest by His perfected sacrifice, and consequent anointing and exaltation to the right hand of the Father."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He stands alone. In that office he had no predecessor, and has no one to succeed him. In this respect he was without father, mother, or descent - and he stands in lonely majesty as the only one who sustains the office." 
2. "He is superior to all the Jewish priesthood - sustaining a rank and performing an office above them all. The great ancestor of all the Levitical priests recognized his inferiority to one of the rank or 'order' of which the Messiah was to be, and received from him a blessing." 
3. "The office now is permanent. It does not change from hand to hand; He who sustains this office does not die, and we may ever apply to him and cast our cares on him."

2. "God's sworn declaration constitutes a son, perfected forevermore."
3. "Christ's ministry is superior to that of the Levitical priests as he himself is superior to them."

### John Calvin:
1. "Since the law makes no real priests, the defect must by some other means be remedied; and it is remedied by the word of the oath."
2. "Christ was made a priest, being not of the common order of men, but the Son of God, subject to no defect, but adorned and endowed with the highest perfection."
3. "He again reminds us, that the oath was posterior to the law, in order to show that God, being not satisfied with the priesthood of the law, designed to constitute a better priesthood."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For the law appointed men high priests having infirmity..."
2. "Their expiations, their intercessions, their benedictions, all had the character of weakness, and as such they were not fit to meet our needs."
3. "Perfected' or 'made perfect' (not 'consecrated') 'for evermore;' it is the same word as is used in chap. Hebrews 2:10, 'made perfect through suffering;’ and in Hebrews 5:9, 'having been made perfect;' and this condition is continuous and unchanging, forming a contrast to the condition of the priests of the Law."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "After the law...with an oath."
2. "Son... linked with Psalms 110:4."
3. "Perfected... the process was now complete."
