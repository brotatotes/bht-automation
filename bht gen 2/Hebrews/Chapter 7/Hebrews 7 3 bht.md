# Hebrews 7:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Melchizedek's priesthood is unique because there is no record of his parentage, highlighting his eternal existence. This distinction separates his priesthood from the Levitical priesthood, where genealogy was of utmost importance. The comparison of Melchizedek to Christ emphasizes the eternal nature of Christ's priesthood and the superiority of His sacrifice. It is important to reject unfounded theories that suggest Christ or any other figure appeared as Melchizedek. The priesthood of Christ surpasses all others, rendering all sacrifices inferior and unnecessary. In Christ, we find the ultimate fulfillment of the priesthood and the ultimate sacrifice for our sins.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Without father, c.â€”explained
	by 'without genealogy' (so the Greek is for 'without
	descent) compare Hebrews 7:6, that
	is, his genealogy is not known, whereas a Levitical priest
	could not dispense with the proof of his descent." 
2. "having neither beginning of
	days nor end of lifeâ€”namely, history not having recorded his
	beginning nor end, as it has the beginning and end of Aaron."
3. "The Son of God is the more ancient, and is the archetype: compare Psalms 110:4- :, where the heavenly things are represented as the primary
	archetype of the Levitical ordinances."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is morally certain, however, that the apostle did not use the word here in either of the senses, for there is no evidence that Melchizedek was 'fatherless' in any of these respects."
2. "The simple thought is, that the name of his ancestry does not appear in any record of those in the priestly office."
3. "The meaning here is not that Melchizedek was of low and obscure origin... for there is no reason to doubt that Melchizedek had an ancestry as honorable as other kings and priests of his time."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The meaning is that there is no record concerning his parentage. This is significant as indicating a different type of priesthood from the Levitical, in which genealogy was of prime importance."
2. "Son of God, not Son of man, for the likeness to Jesus as Son of man would not hold; Jesus, as man, having had both birth and death."
3. "The emphasis is on the eternal duration of the ideal priesthood, and the writer explains the Psalm as asserting eternal duration as the mark of the Melchisedec order."

### John Calvin:
1. "He then exempts Melchisedec from what is common to others, a descent by birth; by which he means that he is eternal, so that his beginning from men was not to be sought after."
2. "And what was shadowed forth in Melchisedec is really exhibited in Christ. It behooves us then to be satisfied with this moderate view, that while Scripture sets forth to us Melchisedec as one who had never been born and never died, it shows to us as in a mirror, that Christ has neither a beginning nor an end."
3. "It seems not to be worth oneâ€™s while to refute the delirious notions of those who dream that Christ himself, or the holy Spirit, or an angel, appeared at that time."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "His is a priesthood purely personal, and not to be traced to natural descent or hereditary claim."
2. "Unlike the Jewish priests... the high priest holding his office until he died."
3. "All sacrifices are superseded by the sacrifice of the cross, and all priesthoods by the priesthood of our Lord."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The argument is that from silence, made much of by Philo, but not to be pressed."
2. "Melchizedek has been made more mysterious than he is by reading into this interpretation what is not there."
3. "Such artificial interpretation does not amount to proof, but only serves as a parallel or illustration."

### John Gill:
1. "But all this is on purpose concealed, that he might be a more apparent of Christ, who, as man, is 'without father' for though, as God, he has a Father, and was never without one, being begotten by him, and was always with him, and in him; by whom he was sent, from whom he came, and whither he is gone; to whom he is the way, and with whom he is an advocate: yet, as man, he had no father."
2. "And he is without mother, though not in a spiritual sense, every believer being so to him as such; nor in a natural sense, as man, for the Virgin Mary was his mother; but in a divine sense, as God."

### John Wesley:
1. "Without father, without mother, without pedigree â€” Recorded, without any account of his descent from any ancestors of the priestly order."
2. "Being â€” In all these respects. Made like the Son of God."
3. "Christ alone does really remain without death, and without successor."
