# Hebrews 7:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Consider the great magnitude and distinction of Melchizedek, to whom even the patriarch Abraham paid tithes, acknowledging his superiority. This act was not insignificant, as Abraham offered the best portion of the spoils, demonstrating his recognition of Melchizedek's higher rank and dignity. Melchizedek, as the recipient of tithes and the one who blessed Abraham, surpassed even the Levitical priesthood. So, if Abraham, a patriarch of great honor, acknowledged the surpassing dignity of Melchizedek, how much greater must Christ be, the fulfillment and embodiment of the Melchizedekian priesthood.
