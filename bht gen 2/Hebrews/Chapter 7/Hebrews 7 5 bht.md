# Hebrews 7:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Levites, descendants of Abraham, were granted the right to receive tithes from their brethren, highlighting their superiority among the Israelites. However, even they were inferior to the priests, and the priests themselves were lesser in comparison to Abraham, who paid tithes to the priest Melchizedek. Thus, Melchizedek's priesthood surpassed all others, signifying his preeminence.
