# Hebrews 7:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Melchizedek, unlike the Levitical priests, does not have to establish his genealogy from them, for his genealogy is not counted from them. Despite this, he received tithes from Abraham and blessed him. This highlights Melchizedek's superiority and signifies that he is a more appropriate type of Christ. It is worth noting that Abraham, the one who was highly favored by God and the recipient of the promises, acknowledged Melchizedek's authority and received his blessing. Thus, when considering Christ, we must recognize the significance and fulfillment of the promises.
