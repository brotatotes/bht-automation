# Hebrews 7:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The greater, without a doubt, bestows a blessing upon the lesser - an act of authority and superiority over the one who receives it. This principle is unquestionable, and it is demonstrated in the instance where Melchizedek, as a priest of the most high God, blesses Abraham, thereby signifying his greater status and the divine authority with which he pronounces this blessing.
