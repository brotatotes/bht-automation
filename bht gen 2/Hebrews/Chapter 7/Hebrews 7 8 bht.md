# Hebrews 7:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Levitical priests, in contrast to Melchizedek, were mortal and subject to death. They did not continue in their office due to death. However, in the case of Melchizedek, the Scripture testifies that he lives. There is no mention of his death, indicating the perpetuity of his priesthood. This testimony points to the fulfillment of his office in the person of Jesus Christ, who is represented as living without any record of birth or death. Melchizedek's enduring priesthood serves as a contrast to the temporary nature of the Levitical priesthood.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Levitical priesthood being still in existence in the Writer’s time: men who die receive tithes."
2. "The testimony meant is certainly that of scripture; probably, that in Psalms 110:4, where an eternal priesthood, and therefore duration, is predicated of Melchisedek."
3. "This clearly cannot be interpreted of the priesthood of Melchisedek enduring, as Œc.: for what is here said is eminently personal, and that Melchisedek himself is meant, is shown by the historical reference to the fact of his receiving tithes of Abraham."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Melchisedec's is an enduring, the Levitical a transitory, priesthood."
2. "The Levitical priesthood was parenthetical and temporary, between Melchisedec's typically enduring priesthood, and its antitypical realization in our ever continuing High Priest, Christ."
3. "Melchisedec 'liveth' merely in his official capacity, his priesthood being continued in Christ. Christ, on the other hand, is, in His own person, 'ever living after the power of an endless life.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They who thus received tithes, though by the right to do this they asserted a superiority over their brethren, were mortal... They had no exemption from sickness, affliction, or bereavement, and death came to them with just as much certainty as he approached other men." 
2. "The fair and obvious meaning is, that all the record we have of Melchizedek is, that he was 'alive'... From anything that the record shows, it might appear that he continued to live on, and did not die."
3. "The apostle is desirous of making out a contrast between them and the priesthood of Christ on 'this point' among others, and in doing this, he appeals to the record in the Old Testament, and says that there was a case which furnished an intimation that the priestly office of the Messiah was not to pass over from him to others by death."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Levites are dying men, who pass away in due course, and are succeeded by others."
2. "Melchisedec does not appear in Scripture as one who dies, and whose office passes to another."
3. "Melchisedec... being attested that he liveth."

### John Calvin:
1. "He takes the silence respecting his death, as I have said, as an evidence of his life."
2. "And by these words the Apostle intended to show, that the dignity of Melchisedec’s priesthood was to be perpetual, while that of the Levites was temporary."
3. "The Levites were dying men, which showed the character of their office, Melchisedec is represented as not dying, which betokens that his office as a priest is perpetual."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them, of whom It is witnessed that he liveth."
2. "No 'end of life' is affirmed of him at all."
3. "Under the law the priesthood was temporary. Before the law the priest was priest as long as he lived, and so was perpetual..."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Of whom it is witnessed (μαρτυρουμενος). 'Being witnessed,' present passive participle of μαρτυρεω (personal construction, not impersonal)."
2. "That he lives (οτ ζη). Present active indicative of ζαω). The Genesis record tells nothing of his death."

### John Gill:
1. "The priests and Levites were not only men, and mortal men, subject to death, but they did die, and so did not continue, by reason of death." 
2. "But there he receiveth them, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth which is to be understood of Melchizedek; who is not opposed to men, as if he was not a man, nor to mortal men, but to men that die; nor is he said to be immortal, but to live."
3. "And this may respect the silence of the Scripture concerning him, which gives no account of his death; and may be interpreted of the perpetuity of his priesthood, and of his living in his antitype Christ; and the testimony concerning him is in Psalms 110:4."

### John Wesley:
1. "He of whom it is testified that he liveth — Who is not spoken of as one that died for another to succeed him; but is represented only as living, no mention being made either of his birth or death."
