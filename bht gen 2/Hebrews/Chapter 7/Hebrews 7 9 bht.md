# Hebrews 7:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Levi, the ancestor of the Jewish priesthood, is shown to have paid tithes to Melchizedek through his forefather Abraham. This act of tithing by Levi in the person of Abraham demonstrates the superiority of Melchizedek's priesthood over the Levitical priesthood. This comparison between Melchizedek and the Levitical priests highlights the unique position of Christ as not just one of the sons of Abraham, but as being exempt from the common order of humanity. The fact that Levi, the representative of the Jewish priesthood, paid tithes to Melchizedek signifies the superiority of Melchizedek's priesthood and its fulfillment in Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Writer therefore proceeds to a third proof, showing that in Abraham even Levi himself, the patriarch of the Jewish priesthood, paid tithes." 
2. "The phrase is used when anything is about to be said that is unexpected, or somewhat strained, not likely to be universally recognized, at least in the general way in which it is asserted."
3. "Levi also, who receiveth tithes, hath been taken tithes of."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I may say that, virtually, Levi, in the person of his father Abraham, acknowledged Melchisedec's superiority, and paid tithes to him."
2. "Paid tithes," literally, "hath been tithed," that is, been taken tithes of.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It means, that in the circumstances of the case, the same thing occurred in regard to the superiority of Melchizedek, and the inferiority of the Levitical priesthood, as if Levi had been present with Abraham, and had himself actually paid tithes on that occasion."
2. "Here nothing indicating any such change had occurred. Melchizedek had no descendants of which mention is made, and the act of Abraham, as the head of the Hebrew race, stood therefore as if it were the act of all who descended from him."
3. "Levi is here spoken of as the ancestor of the tribe, or collectively to denote the entire Jewish priesthood."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Levi himself, in the person of Abraham, was tithed by Melchisedec."
2. "As I may say [ως επος ειπειν] . = so to speak."
3. "In Abraham [δι αβρααμ] . Lit. through Abraham."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ is not to be counted simply as one of the sons of Abraham, but is to be exempted by a peculiar privilege from the common order of men."
2. "Since Melchisedec is a type of Christ, it is by no means reasonable that the one should be set in opposition to the other; for we must remember that common saying, that what is subordinate is not in opposition."
3. "I hence conclude, that the ancients invented a sacrifice, of which Moses had never thought; for Melchisedec offered bread and wine, not to God, but on the contrary to Abraham and his companions."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And so to say (a phrase which, like ‘as it were,’ is used to moderate a strong expression or to qualify a statement that is not literally true; the other sense of the original, ‘in a word,’ ‘to speak briefly,’ is not appropriate here)."
2. "An obvious objection to the previous reasoning is that Abraham was not a priest. It was therefore not unnatural that he should pay tithes and receive the blessing. But the objection is answered by the fact that as Abraham had obtained the promise, he was the representative of all his descendants."
3. "Levi was in him, not physically and seminally merely, but representatively; and so Abraham on his own behalf and on theirs recognised a priesthood beyond the limits of the dispensation which belonged to his own line."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "So to say" (ως επος ειπειν). An old idiom, here only in the N.T., common in Philo, used to limit a startling statement, an infinitive for conceived result with ως.
2. "Hath paid tithes" (δεδεκατωτα). Perfect passive indicative of δεκατοω, "has been tithed."
3. "This could only be true of Levi 'so to speak'."

### John Gill:
1. "And as l may so say,.... With truth, and with great propriety and pertinence:"
2. "Paid tithes in Abraham; that is, to Melchizedek; and therefore Melchizedek must be greater than they, and his priesthood a more excellent one than theirs; since they who receive tithes from others gave tithes to him."

### John Wesley:
1. And even Levi, who received tithes — Not in person, but in his successors, as it were, paid tithes - In the person of Abraham.
