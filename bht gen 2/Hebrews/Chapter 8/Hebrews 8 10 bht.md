1. "That I will make (ην διαθησομα). Future middle of διατιθημ, 'that I will covenant,' cognate accusative (ην), using the same root in the verb as in διαθηκη."

3. "A god (εις θεον). Note the Hebraistic use of εις in the predicate instead of the usual nominative θεος as in 'a people' (εις λαον). This was the ideal of the old covenant (Exodus 6:7), now at last to be a fact."

1. "The laws of God are meant not the precepts of the ceremonial law, which were now abrogated, but either the moral law, and its commands; which is a transcript of the divine nature, was inscribed on Adam's heart in innocence, and some remains of it are even in the Gentiles, but greatly obliterated through the sin of man."

3. "And the 'writing' them in, or on the heart, intends a filling the soul with love and affection to them, so that it regards them singly and heartily; and a powerful inclination of the heart to be subject to them, through the efficacious grace of God."
