# Hebrews 8:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the new covenant, all true believers will be taught by the Spirit of God and will not need to rely on human teaching to know the Lord. This knowledge of God in the new dispensation is greater than what was experienced under the old covenant. It is a deep, personal knowledge of God that extends from the least to the greatest among believers. This order of knowledge reflects the divine plan of salvation, where even the lowliest and poorest will be saved first, so that the full glory of God's people may be revealed.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "And the inner reason of this now follows, making...the condition of the last mentioned."
3. "Under the old covenant, the priests' lips were to keep knowledge, and they were to teach the people God's ways: under the New, there is no more need for the believer to have recourse to man for teaching in the knowledge of God, for the Holy Spirit, which is given to all that ask, reveals the things of Christ to each."

1. "Under the new covenant, the Holy Spirit teaches every believer."
2. "Not that the mutual teaching of brethren is excluded while the covenant is being promulgated; but when once the Holy Spirit shall have fully taught all the remission of their sins and inward sanctification, then there shall be no further need of man teaching his fellow man."
3. "The New Testament is shorter than the Old Testament because, instead of the details of an outward letter law, it gives the all-embracing principles of the spiritual law written on the conscience, leading one to spontaneous instinctive obedience in outward details."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "No one shall be under a necessity of imparting instruction to another, or of exhorting him to become acquainted with the Lord. This is designed to set forth another of the advantages which would attend the new dispensation."

1. "For the right knowledge of God is a wisdom which far surpasses the comprehension of man's understanding; therefore, to attain it no one is able except through the secret revelation of the Spirit."

3. "Their objection is this: 'After the coming of Christ every one is to teach his neighbor; away then with the external ministry, that a place may be given to the internal inspiration of God.' But they pass by this, that the Prophet does not wholly deny that they would teach one another, but his words are these, They shall not teach, saying, Know the Lord; as though he had said, 'Ignorance shall not as heretofore so possess the minds of men as not to know who God is.'"
