# Hebrews 8:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The first covenant, described as old and antiquated, has been made irrelevant by the introduction of a new covenant. This new covenant not only supersedes the old, but it is also established upon better promises. The knowledge of this new way of pardon has been sought throughout history, and it is only found in the Gospel. The old covenant, weak and feeble like an old man near the end of his life, is gradually disappearing and will eventually vanish away. Its dissolution is connected to the coming of Christ and is completed with the destruction of Jerusalem.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In saying, 'a new covenant,' He hath made old the first covenant."
2. "That which is being made old and getting into old age is nigh unto vanishing away."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "From the time of God's mention of a NEW covenant (since God's words are all realities) the first covenant might be regarded as ever dwindling away, until its complete abolition on the actual introduction of the Gospel."
2. "Both covenants cannot exist side by side. Mark how verbal inspiration is proved in Paul's argument turning wholly on the one word 'NEW' (covenant), occurring but once in the Old Testament."
3. "The Greek for (Kaine) New (Testament) implies that it is of a different kind and supersedes the old: not merely recent (Greek, 'nea')."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The object of the apostle is to show that by the very fact of the arrangement for a new dispensation differing so much from the old, it was implied of necessity that that was to be superseded, and would vanish away."
2. "We have a better covenant than the old one was - one less expensive and less burdensome, and one that is established upon better promises."
3. "The knowledge of some way of pardon is what human nature has been sighing for for ages; which has been sought in every system of religion, and by every bloody offering; but which has never been found elsewhere."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The whole statement indicates that the writer regarded the Sinaitic covenant, even in Jeremiah's time, as obsolete, and that Jeremiah himself so regarded it."
2. "When God announced a new covenant he proclaimed the insufficiency of the old, and the promise of a new covenant carried with it the promise of the abrogation of the old."
3. "The new covenant is so shaped as to avoid the defects of the old one, and some one has remarked that, in one aspect, it is a criticism of the Sinaitic covenant."

### John Calvin:
1. "From the fact of one covenant being established, he infers the subversion of the other; and by calling it the old covenant, he assumes that it was to be abrogated; for what is old tends to a decay."
2. "By saying, 'a new covenant,' he has made ancient the first: now what is ancient and becomes old is nigh a dissolution (or disappearing)."
3. "It is said to be ancient in contrast with the new; and old or aged is afterwards added to be ancient in order to show its weak and feeble character, being like an old man tottering on the brink of the grave, who, when buried, disappears from among the living."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He hath made the first old...That which is becoming old and waxeth aged."

### John Gill:
1. "If the second is new, the first must be old; which is called so, not on account of its date and duration; but on the account of its faultiness and deficiency, its weakness, and unprofitableness, and especially its being antiquated, and made to give way to another."
2. "The apostle argues from the first covenant, being old, to its being near to dissolution, or a disappearance; and the dissolution or disappearance of this covenant was gradual."
3. "This covenant was of right abolished at the time of Christ's death; upon his ascension the Spirit was given, and the Gospel published among all nations, by which it more and more disappeared; and in fact it quite vanished away, when the city and temple of Jerusalem were destroyed."

### John Wesley:
1. "He hath antiquated the first — Hath shown that it is disannulled, and out of date."
2. "Now that which is antiquated is ready to vanish away — As it did quickly after, when the temple was destroyed."
