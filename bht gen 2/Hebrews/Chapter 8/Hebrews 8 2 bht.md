# Hebrews 8:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ, as the Great High Priest, has entered into the heavenly Holy of Holies, which surpasses the earthly temple. The earthly tabernacle was a representation of the true tabernacle in heaven, where God Himself dwells. Christ's presence and intercession sanctify and prepare a place in this genuine tabernacle for His people. Through His sacrifice and ministry, He mediates for us and grants us access to God. His human nature, divinely conceived, fulfills the symbolism of the old tabernacle. In Christ, we have a minister and mediator in the heavenly sanctuary.

### Henry Alford:
1. "The difference between ἀληθινός and ἀληθής is well sketched by Kahnis, Abendmahl, p. 119...In ἀληθής, the idea corresponds to the thing, in ἀληθινός, the thing to the idea." 
2. "Both are agreed that τὰ ἅγια betokens the immediate, immaterial presence of God, the veritable Holy of Holies, beyond, and approached through, the heavens." 
3. "That glorified body of His, in which they are accepted before God, and in which as a heavenly temple, they serve God, and God dwells, He has passed through, not by passing out of it, but by finally establishing it as an accomplished thing in God’s sight, and in and as proceeding forth from it carrying on his intercession and λειτουργία τῆς σκηνῆς τῆς ἀληθινῆς in the ἅγια itself."

### John Calvin:
1. "Then the old tabernacle was not the empty inventions of man, but the effigy of the heavenly tabernacle."
2. "Whatever of an earthly kind appears at first sight to be in Christ, it is to be viewed spiritually by the eye of faith.

3. "Hence it is the 'genuine' tabernacle and see John 1:9 for αληθινος. Pitched (επηξεν)."

### John Gill:
