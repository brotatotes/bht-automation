# Hebrews 8:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As the high priest, it was necessary for Christ to have something to offer as a sacrifice. However, it was not just any offering that would suffice. Neither the Levitical sacrifices nor a human nature in a state of innocence or sinfulness would be suitable. Instead, what was necessary for Christ was a human nature, perfect in parts and qualities, to be taken into a close and inseparable union with his divine person. Through this unique union, Christ became the high priest who could offer himself as a sacrifice for the sins of humanity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For the Writer is evidently, from what follows, laying the stress on the heavenly λειτουργία of Christ: and this ὃ προσενέγκῃ applies therefore to His work not on earth, but in heaven."
2. "Thus regarded then, what is it which our High Priest in heaven has to offer? In ch. Hebrews 5:7, He is described as προσενέγκας prayers and supplications in the days of His flesh: and it might be thought that His ἐντυγχάνειν ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν, ch. Hebrews 7:25, might be here meant, the offering being those intercessions."
3. "Still, as Delitzsch also remarks, this is not the place to enlarge on this matter, seeing that it is merely incidentally introduced here, the present object being to show that it is in heaven, and not on earth, that our High Priest ministers."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "As the high priest did not enter the Holy Place without blood, so Christ has entered the heavenly Holy Place with His own blood."
2. "That 'blood of sprinkling' is in heaven. And is thence made effectual to sprinkle believers as the end of their election."
3. "The term 'consecrate' as a priest, is literally, to fill the hand, implying that an offering is given into the hands of the priest, which it is his duty to present to God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices - This is a general statement about the functions of the high priest. It was the uniqueness of the office; it constituted its essence, that some gift or sacrifice was to be presented."
2. "If this idea that a priest must offer sacrifice be correct, then it follows that the name priest should not be given to any one who is not appointed to offer sacrifice."
3. "Wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer - That the Lord Jesus should make an offering. That is, since he is declared to be a priest, and since it is essential to the office that a priest should make an offering, it is indispensable that he should bring a sacrifice to God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices. Therefore Christ, a high priest, must have gifts and sacrifices to offer." 
2. "Wherefore it is necessary." 
3. "The statement is a truism unless it be assumed that the Hebrew Christians were ignorant of the doctrine of Christ's priesthood."

### John Calvin:
1. "It hence appears that the priesthood is an empty name without a sacrifice."
2. "That our prayers may be heard, they must be founded on a sacrifice."
3. "And hereby is abundantly exposed the effrontery of the Papists who make Apostles and martyrs to share with Christ as mediators in the work of intercession; for in vain do they assign them such an office, except they supply them with sacrifices."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Is appointed (καθιστατα). As in Hebrews 5:1. To offer (εις το προσφερειν)."
2. "It is necessary (αναγκαιον). A moral and logical necessity (from αναγκη necessity) as seen in Acts 13:46; Philippians 1:24."
3. "This high priest also (κα τουτον). 'This one also,' no word for high priest, accusative of general reference with the infinitive εχειν (have)."

### John Gill:
1. "It was his human nature that it was necessary he should have to offer...it was necessary Christ should have, and offer, for it is for men that he became an high priest."
2. "Something to offer as a sacrifice was necessary to him as a priest, but not any thing was proper to him; Levitical sacrifices would not do, these could not take away sin."
3. "Yet not human nature under any consideration was necessary for him to have and offer; not merely as in a state of innocence, without any infirmity, nor as sinful, yet as perfect as to parts and qualities; and a nature, and not a person, was necessary to be had, and to be taken into close and inseparable union to his divine person."
