# Hebrews 8:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ's role as a high priest is not on earth, as offering sacrifices here would conflict with his divine nature. He does not belong to the category of priests on earth because there are already individuals appointed to fulfill that role. His priesthood is exercised in heaven, where he offered himself as the ultimate sacrifice for our sins. Christ's priesthood surpasses the Levitical order, which is now abolished, and his sacrifice brings about a spiritual benefit rather than simply an external action.

3. "There are already those who offer the gifts according to the law."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Implying that Christ's priestly office is exercised in heaven, not in earth; in the power of His resurrection life, not of His earthly life."
2. "If His priesthood terminated on the earth, He would not even be a priest at all."
3. "I conceive that the denial here of Christ's priesthood on earth does not extend to the sacrifice on the cross which He offered as a priest on earth but applies only to the crowning work of His priesthood, the bringing of the blood into the Holy of Holies, which He could not have done in the earthly Holy of Holies, as not being an Aaronic priest."

### Albert Barnes:

### John Calvin:
1. "We must always hold this truth that when the Apostle speaks of the death of Christ, he regards not the external action, but the spiritual benefit."
2. "He suffered death as men do, but as a priest he atoned for the sins of the world in a divine manner; there was an external shedding of blood, but there was also an internal and spiritual purgation."

2. "His coming into the world, and his appearance in human nature, was in the character of a priest, and to qualify himself for one."
