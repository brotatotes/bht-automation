# Hebrews 8:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Levitical priests served as a shadow and copy of the heavenly realities of true worship. The material tabernacle itself was an emblem of a spiritual sanctuary. The rituals were designed to shadow forth what is found spiritually in Christ, as demonstrated in the command to create the tabernacle according to the pattern shown on Mount Sinai. This pattern represented the heavenly model, revealing the divine institution of the tabernacle and its worship. Through these copies, shadows, and patterns, we gain a glimpse of the spiritual glory of true worship and the beauty of our high priest, Jesus Christ.
