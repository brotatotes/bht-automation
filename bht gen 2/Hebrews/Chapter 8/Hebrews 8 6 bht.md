# Hebrews 8:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ's ministry is superior to that of the earthly priests because he serves in the heavenly sanctuary. He is the Mediator of a better covenant, with promises that far surpass those of the Old Testament. The Old Testament promises mainly focused on earthly blessings, while the New Testament promises are centered on heavenly and spiritual blessings. Christianity is revealed to be better than Judaism in every aspect. Christ's priesthood is exceptional because he guarantees the fulfillment of the superior promises of the gospel, surpassing the temporal promises of the law.
