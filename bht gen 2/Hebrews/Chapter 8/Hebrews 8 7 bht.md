# Hebrews 8:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The old covenant, or the covenant of the law, was not faultless or perfect. While the law itself was blameless in its morality, it was not able to provide the complete salvation that humanity needed. This imperfection is highlighted by the fact that a search was necessary for something more adequate, a second covenant. The old covenant was preparatory, serving as a temporary and imperfect system that pointed towards the need for a better covenant. The new covenant, established through Christ, fulfilled what the old covenant lacked and was enacted upon better promises.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Argumentation, exactly as in ch. Hebrews 7:11, from sayings of God, to shew the imperfection of the former covenant." 
2. "For if that first (covenant) were blameless..." 
3. "A place would not be sought...for a second."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "faultless‚Äîperfect in all its parts, so as not to be found fault with as wanting anything which ought to be there: answering all the purposes of a law."
2. "The law in its morality was blameless (Greek, 'amomos'); but in saving us it was defective, and so not faultless (Greek, 'amemptos')."
3. "The old covenant would have anticipated all man's wants, so as to give no occasion for seeking something more perfectly adequate."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is implied here that God had said that that covenant was not perfect or faultless."
2. "The meaning is not that that first covenant made under Moses had any real faults - or inculcated what was wrong, but that it did not contain the ample provision for the pardon of sin and the salvation of the soul which was desirable."
3. "It was merely 'preparatory' to the gospel."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The statement that a better covenant was enacted upon better promises is justified by the very existence of that second covenant."
2. "A search would not have been going on. This implies a sense of dissatisfaction while the old covenant was still in force, and a looking about for something better."
3. "It is to be shown that the Levitical system answered to a covenant which was recognized as imperfect and transitory by an O. T. prophet, since he spoke of a divine purpose to establish a new covenant."

### John Calvin:
1. "He confirms what he had said of the excellency of the covenant which God has made with us through Christ; and he confirms it on this ground, because the covenant of the Law was neither valid nor permanent..."
2. "Though the crime of violating the covenant was justly imputed to the people, who had through their own perfidy departed from God, yet the weakness of the covenant is also pointed out, because it was not written in their hearts."
3. "Then, to render it perfect and valid, God declares that it needed an amendment. It was not, therefore, without reason that the Apostle contended that a place was to be sought for a second."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The better promises implied in what follows are themselves a proof of the inferiority of the old covenant."
2. "No place would have been sought, i.e in the development of the Divine purpose, in the plan of redemption."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The word Œ¥ŒπŒ±Œ∏Œ∑Œ∫Œ∑ (covenant) is not expressed, but clearly meant by the feminine gender œÄœÅœâœÑŒ∑." 
2. "The condition is second class and assumes that the old covenant was not 'blameless,' apparently a serious charge which he hastens to explain." 
3. "The conclusion with Œ±ŒΩ and the imperfect passive indicative (ŒµŒ∂Œ∑œÑŒµŒπœÑŒø) is clearly a second-class condition."

### John Gill:
1. "The covenant here designed is the covenant of grace, as administered under the legal dispensation, and which was a typical one."
2. "The works it required were typical of Christ's obedience to the law, in the room and stead of his people, by which he fulfilled it."
3. "The mediator of it, Moses, was a type of Christ, the Mediator of the new covenant; and it was confirmed by the blood of beasts, which was typical of the blood of Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "If that dispensation had answered all God's designs and man's wants, if it had not been weak and unprofitable unable to make anything perfect, no place would have been for a second."
