# Hebrews 8:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The new covenant, fulfilled by the Saviour, surpasses the old covenant in its ability to bring forgiveness and a change of heart. It is not limited to Israel but extends to all the Israel of God. This new covenant is perpetual and unchangeable, never to be abolished. It is ratified by the death of Christ and frees believers from burdensome ceremonies. With a more profound understanding of spiritual religion, the new covenant brings larger influences of the Spirit. It encompasses the days of the Messiah and future beyond, offering grace and restoration to all who embrace it.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The true fulfillment can only be sought in the covenant brought in by the Saviour, and in the salvation through Him imparted to mankind, and ever more and more unfolded and completed." 
2. "The prophecy...begins with Jeremiah's constant formula, 'Behold, the days come.'" 
3. "Both these, Israel first and Judah afterwards, were sent into captivity for their sins: and both are specified severally in Godâ€™s promise of grace and restoration."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The whole meaning is, that there was a deficiency which the giving of a new covenant would remove."
2. "The word 'covenant' here refers to the arrangement, plan, or dispensation into which he would enter in his dealings with people."
3. "The word 'Israel' is used in the Scriptures to denote the kingdom of Israel in contradistinction from that of Judah, and together they denote the whole people of God, or the whole Hebrew nation."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "The Law, then, was the covenant which was broken, as God complains, by the people. To remedy this evil, he promised a new and a different covenant, the fulfillment of which prophecy was the abrogation of the old covenant."
2. "There is no doubt but that the Prophet includes the whole dispensation of Moses when he says, 'I have made with you a covenant which you have not kept.'... It is a common saying that the accessory is of the same character with his principal. No wonder, then, that the ceremonies, which are nothing more than appendages to the old covenant, should come to an end, together with the whole dispensation of Moses."
3. "Now, by the days which the prophet mentions, all agree that Christâ€™s kingdom is signified; it hence follows, that the old covenant was changed by the coming of Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The covenant, as a revelation of Godâ€™s holiness, was faultless; but as the people fell away under it, it failed as a covenant of works to establish abiding fellowship between them and God, and so proved weak and profitless."
2. "The prediction that follows is taken from the last great series of his prophecies (chaps, 30-31), which are distinctly Messianic. It points to the new covenant which God will one day make with His people, based upon the absolute remission of sins and on a no less absolute change of heart."
3. "The covenant is â€˜forâ€™ them rather than with them, though in a sense it was both and is so described."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The covenant was all right, but the Jews failed to keep it. Hence God made a new one of grace in place of law."
2. "I will make (ÏƒÏ…Î½Ï„ÎµÎ»ÎµÏƒÏ‰). Future active of ÏƒÏ…Î½Ï„ÎµÎ»ÎµÏ‰, old compound verb to accomplish as in Mark 13:4; Romans 9:28."
3. "A new covenant (Î´Î¹Î±Î¸Î·ÎºÎ·Î½ ÎºÎ±Î¹Î½Î·Î½). In Hebrews 12:24 we have Î´Î¹Î±Î¸Î·ÎºÎ·Ï‚ Î½ÎµÎ±Ï‚, but ÎºÎ±Î¹Î½Î·Ï‚ in 1 Corinthians 11:25. ÎšÎ±Î¹Î½Î¿Ï‚ is fresh, on new lines as opposed to the old (Ï€Î±Î»Î±Î¹Î¿Ï‚) as in 2 Corinthians 3:6; 2 Corinthians 3:14; Î½ÎµÎ¿Ï‚ is young or not yet old."

### John Gill:

2. "It is always new, its vigour and efficacy are perpetual; it will never be antiquated, or give place to another."
3. "The time of doing all this is called 'the days to come'; the last days, the days of the Messiah, which were future in Jeremiah's time."
