# Hebrews 8:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the day that I took them by the hand to lead them forth, the covenant with Israel was specified negatively as not being like the first one. The Law served as an ideal for religious constitution, yet the Jews continuously fell into idolatry. However, the new covenant brought forgiveness of sins and the enabling power of the Spirit, leading to obedience through love. Despite Israel's unfaithfulness, God's promise of a better and lasting covenant remains, rooted in His care and tenderness as a parent.
