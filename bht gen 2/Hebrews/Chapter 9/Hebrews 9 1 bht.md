# Hebrews 9:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The first covenant had specific regulations and rituals for worship, as well as a physical sanctuary. These outward expressions of worship were made with earthly materials and were temporary in nature. The author of Hebrews focuses on describing the tabernacle and the various rituals associated with it, showing that they were a part of the old covenant and were meant to foreshadow the reality to come.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The old covenant also had liturgical ordinances, which were ‘juris divini,’ ordinances which rested their obligatory right upon revelation from God and declaration of His will."
2. "The first (covenant) had not merely a worldly sanctuary, but the only sanctuary which was upon earth: that one which was constructed after the pattern of things in the heavens."
3. " Possibly another reason for inserting it might be, to define beyond doubt the substantival use of the neuter adj. ἅγιον when joined with an epithet such as κοσμικόν."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Accordingly then... the first covenant had... had, not 'has,' for as a covenant it no longer existed, though its rites were observed till the destruction of Jerusalem."
2. "Material, outward, perishing (however precious its materials were), and also defective religiously."
3. "The outer tabernacle the Jews believed, signified this world... and the inner holiest place, the third part, appropriated to God and not accessible to men."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The object is to describe the tabernacle in which the service of God was celebrated under the former dispensation, and to show that it had a reference to what was future, and was only an imperfect representation of the reality."
2. "It was important to show this, as the Jews regarded the ordinances of the tabernacle and of the whole Levitical service as of divine appointment, and of perpetual obligation."
3. "The first covenant... had religious rites and services connected with it. Had also ordinances... regulating the worship of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Ordinances of divine service." 
2. "The meaning is ordinances directed to or adapted for divine service."
3. "And its sanctuary a sanctuary of this world."

### John Calvin:
1. "He says first, that under the old covenant there was a specific form of divine worship, and that it was peculiarly adapted to that time."
2. "He then intimates that all the rites of the Mosaic Law were a part of the old covenant, and that they partook of the same ancientness, and were therefore to perish."
3. "And he calls it a worldly sanctuary, because there was no heavenly truth or reality in those rites; for though the sanctuary was the effigy of the original pattern which had been shown to Moses; yet an effigy or image is a different thing from the reality..."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This verse concedes the excellency of the old economy. It had ordinances of divine worship."
2. "The writer speaks in the past tense, because he looks back to the original institution and the first tabernacle, partly also because from the vantage ground of the new covenant, the old seems obsolete and its holy place of this world."
3. "As the writer is commending the first covenant, 'of this world' can hardly be only depreciatory. The word used, when not used ethically, describes the world in its order and beauty; and this is part of the thought: of this world indeed, and yet costly and beautiful."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Even the first covenant is doubtful." 
2. "Ordinances are regulations, as in Luke 1:6; Romans 5:16."
3. "Its sanctuary, a sanctuary of this world, is described as το αγιον κοσμικον."

### John Gill:
1. "The design of the apostle in this chapter... is to show the pre-eminence of Christ, from the tabernacle, and the things in it; as well as from the priesthood and covenant; and as also the abrogation of the Levitical ceremonies in particular, as well as the first covenant in general."
2. "The word 'first', here used, designs not the tabernacle, but the covenant... these ordinances were no other than the carnal ordinances, or rites of the ceremonial law... they were figures and types of justification by the righteousness of Christ."
3. "And a worldly sanctuary... because it consisted of earthly matter, and worldly things; it was in the world, and only had its use in the world, and so is opposed to the heavenly sanctuary."

### John Wesley:
1. The first covenant had ordinances of outward worship, and a worldly - a visible, material sanctuary, or tabernacle. Of this sanctuary he treats, Hebrews 9:2-5. Of those ordinances, Hebrews 9:6-10.
