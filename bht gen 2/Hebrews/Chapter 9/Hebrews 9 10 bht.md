# Hebrews 9:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The rituals and ordinances of the old covenant focused on external practices, such as sacrifices and dietary regulations, which could not truly perfect or transform a person inwardly. These laws were temporary and preparatory, designed to lead God's people to a time of reformation when the shortcomings of the old covenant would be remedied. The time of reformation ultimately came with the arrival of Jesus Christ and the establishment of the new covenant, which surpassed the limitations of the old and offered a more perfect way of reconciliation with God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The gifts and offerings, e.g. those of the day of atonement, had far other reference than merely to meats and drinks and washings: nay, these were parables in reference to higher things."
2. "The law prescribed much about eating: nothing about drinking, except some general rules of uncleanness...But subsequent circumstances and usage added other observances and precedents."
3. "They regarded material things, gifts, sacrifices, meats, drinks, washings, which from their very nature could only affect the outward, not the inward man."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The rites of meats, &c., go side by side with the sacrifices."
2. "Carnal ordinances" stand in apposition to "sacrifices."
3. "The season of rectification, when the reality should supersede the type."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The ordinances of the Jews, in connection with the services of religion, consisted much of laws pertaining to what was lawful to eat and drink, etc."
2. "The various ablutions which were required in the service of the tabernacle and the temple - washing of the hands, of the victim that was to be offered, etc."
3. "The object was rather to keep them 'externally' pure than to cleanse the conscience and make them holy in heart."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The impotence of the gifts and sacrifices lay in the fact that they were only symbolic ordinances."
2. "Meats and drinks and divers washings... concerning which the Levitical law laid down no prescriptions except as to abstinence in the case of a Nazarite vow, and of the priests when they were about to officiate."
3. "The time of reformation" is the Christian age, when God made with his people a better covenant."

### John Calvin:
1. "The new covenant succeeded the old as a reformation."
2. "By these trifling observances a more certain opinion may be formed how far short was the Law of the perfection of the Gospel."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They may have been performed in a right spirit. They may have been accompanied by some spiritual blessing. But they were mainly material, not spiritual."
2. "Burdensome in themselves, they were also inadequate for spiritual purposes. They were imposed on men to prepare them for better things, and for a better time, when all is to be put right in the conscience, in the life, and with God."
3. "The contrast, the time of reformation not 'a time,' as if there were several, not quite 'the time;' the Greek simply marks the quality of the time itself 'until what is to prove God's set time, when all is to be made straight' is described in the following verses."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "What ritual value these Levitical sacrifices had was confined to minute regulations about diet and ceremonial cleansing."
2. "Carnal ordinances (δικαιωμασιν σαρκος). But the correct text is undoubtedly simply δικαιωματα σαρκος (nominative case), in apposition with δωρα τε κα θυσια (gifts and sacrifices)."
3. "Διορθωσις is a late word, here alone in N.T., used by Hippocrates for making straight misshapen limbs like ανορθοω in Hebrews 12:12. Here for reformation like διορθωμα (reform) in Acts 24:2."

### John Gill:
1. "There only were meat offerings and drink offerings; things which only respect the body, and cannot therefore make perfect, as to the conscience."
2. "Since these only sanctified to the purifying of the flesh, or what was outward, they could not reach the conscience, or make perfect with respect to that."
3. "In [the time of reformation], things that were faulty and deficient are amended and perfected, and in which burdensome rites and ceremonies are removed, and better ordinances introduced."

### John Wesley:
1. "They could not so perfect him, with all their train of precepts relating to meats and drinks, and carnal, gross, external ordinances." 
2. "[They] were therefore imposed only till the time of reformation - Till Christ came."
