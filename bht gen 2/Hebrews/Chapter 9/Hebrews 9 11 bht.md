# Hebrews 9:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ is the high priest who brings forth good things that are to come. He entered through a more noble and perfect tabernacle, which is his own body, not of this creation. Christ's coming as the high priest signifies a radical transformation in the way things were done before, bringing forth a new and superior covenant. His birth was not by human means, but by the power of the Holy Ghost in the humble womb of a virgin.
