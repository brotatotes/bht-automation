## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The atonement effected by the goat sin offering (of which the ceremony of the scapegoat is a part, and not distinct from the sin offering) consisted in the transfer of the people's sins on the goat, and their consequent removal out of sight." 
2. "Christ's death is symbolized by the slain goat; His resurrection to life by the living goat sent away."
3. "The entrance of our Redeemer, once for all, into the heavenly holiest place, secures eternal redemption to us; whereas the Jewish high priest's entrance was repeated year by year, and the effect temporary and partial."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was 'by,' or 'by means of' - διὰ dia - blood thus sprinkled on the mercyseat, that the high priest sought the forgiveness of his own sins and the sins of the people."
2. "That blood was not shed for himself - for he had no sin - and consequently there was a material difference between his offering and that of the Jewish high priest."
3. "The redemption which the Lord Jesus effected for his people is eternal. It will continue forever. It is not a temporary deliverance leaving the redeemed in danger of falling into sin and ruin, but it makes salvation secure."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "If Christianity gives us only the shedding of blood, even Christ's blood, it does not give us a real or an efficient atonement."
2. "Having found and won by his act of entrance into the heavenly sanctuary."
3. "A redemption not ritual, but profoundly ethical and spiritual."

### John Calvin:
1. "All these things tend to show that the things of Christ so far excel the shadows of the Law, that they justly reduce them all to nothing."
2. "What is the value of Christ’s blood, if it be deemed no better than the blood of beasts?"
3. "As soon then as Christ came forth with the efficacious influence of his death, all the typical observances must necessarily have ceased."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But by his own blood he entered in once for all... by services of a greater and more perfect tabernacle neither of human workmanship nor of created materials." 
2. "Christ, by the one sacrifice of Himself, has obtained for us an everlasting deliverance from the guilt of sin, ending in a complete deliverance from the power of it, and that at the price of Himself or of His blood." 
3. "Redemption is obtained for us when Christ enters into the holy place, as redemption is made ours when His blood is applied to our consciences; both truths are consistent with the other teaching that atonement expiation was made when He died for our sins."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He is both victim and High Priest."
2. "The value of Christ's offering consists in the fact that he is the Son of God as well as the Son of man, that he is sinless and so a perfect sacrifice with no need of an offering for himself, and that it is voluntary on his part."
3. "The author now turns to discuss the better sacrifice already introduced."

### John Gill:
1. "By his own blood he entered in once into the holy place; which shows the truth of his human nature, and the virtue of its blood, as in union with his divine Person."
2. "Having obtained eternal redemption; for us, from sin, Satan, the law, and death, to which his people were in bondage, and which he obtained by paying a ransom price for them."
3. "This is called an eternal redemption, because it extends to the saints in all ages; backwards and forwards; it includes eternal life and happiness; and such as are sharers in it shall never perish, but shall be saved with an everlasting salvation."

### John Wesley:
1. The holy place — Heaven.For us — All that believe.
