# Hebrews 9:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The ashes of the heifer, consumed by fire as a sin-offering, were sprinkled on those who were legally unclean to remove their ceremonial uncleanness and allow them to be re-admitted to the temple and the congregation. While this ritual only purified the flesh, it served as a symbolic representation, pointing to the need for a greater purification. It is a reminder that the ashes of the heifer cannot truly purify from sin, but rather it was a temporary provision under the Levitical law. (Numbers 19:17-19)

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If the blood of mere brutes could purify in any, however small a degree, how much more shall inward purification, and complete and eternal salvation, be wrought by the blood of Christ, in whom dwelt all the fulness of the Godhead?"
2. "The type is full of comfort for us. The water of separation, made of the ashes of the red heifer, was the provision for removing ceremonial defilement whenever incurred by contact with the dead."
3. "In our wilderness journey we are continually contracting defilement by contact with the spiritually dead, and with dead works, and need therefore continual application to the antitypical life-giving cleansing blood of Christ, whereby we are afresh restored to peace and living communion with God in the heavenly holy place."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The ashes of the heifer...were regarded as an evidence of participation in that sacrifice."
2. "[The ashes of the heifer] was arranged that there should be this 'permanent sacrifice' - the ashes of the heifer that had been sacrificed - of which they could avail themselves at any time, without the expense and delay of making a bloody offering specifically for the occasion."
3. "The offering thus made removed the obstructions to the worship of God so far as to allow him who had been defiled to approach him in a regular manner."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The two examples selected cover the entire legal provision for removing uncleanness, whether contracted by sin or by contact with death."
2. "The Levitical law required two remedies: the Christian economy furnishes one for all phases of defilement."
3. "The literal rendering of the participle brings out better the incidental or occasional character of the defilement."

### John Calvin:
1. "The cleansing of the flesh they leave explained of what avails among men, as the heathens had their expiations to blot out the infamy of crimes... Often does this declaration occur in the writings of Moses, that iniquity was expiated when a sacrifice was duly offered. This is no doubt the spiritual teaching of faith."
2. "Besides, all the sacrifices were destined for this end, that they might lead men to Christ; as the eternal salvation of the soul is through Christ, so these were true witnesses of this salvation."
3. "If the blood of beasts was a true symbol of purgation, so that it cleansed in a sacramental manner, how much more shall Christ who is himself the truth, not only bear witness to a purgation by an external rite, but also really perform this for consciences?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This case of the ‘ashes of the heifer’ is one of the most suggestive symbols of the Law, and is well worth examination."
2. "The heifer without spot, slain by the priest without the camp, its blood sprinkled in the direction of the tabernacle, the animal itself burnt with solemn rites, its ashes laid up in a clean place to be used with water in cleansing those who had been defiled by contact with a dead body, itself a symbol and a result of sin all are instructive."
3. "All was done to secure an outward purity only."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The ashes of a red heifer whose ashes mingled with water were sprinkled on the contaminated or defiled ones."
2. "This ceremonial ritual does serve 'for the cleansing of the flesh,' but not for the conscience."
3. "The cow was αμωμον, the individual καθαρος."

### John Gill:
1. "Neither of them can purge from sin."
2. "It only sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh."
3. "It did not really sanctify the heart, or purify and cleanse the soul from sin."

### John Wesley:
1. "If the ashes of an heifer — Consumed by fire as a sin-offering, being sprinkled on them who were legally unclean." 
2. "Purified the flesh — Removed that legal uncleanness, and re-admitted them to the temple and the congregation." 
3. "Numbers 19:17,18,19."
