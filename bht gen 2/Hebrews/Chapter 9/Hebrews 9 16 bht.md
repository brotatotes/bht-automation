# Hebrews 9:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The covenant of grace is like a testament or will to Christ and his people, consisting of gifts and legacies. Christ, as God, has the right to distribute the inheritance of grace and glory, and everything given is tied to his death. The necessity of Christ's death is due to divine perfections, the declaration of God's righteousness, and the fulfillment of his promises. The death of Christ confirms and purchases the benefits of the covenant. The focus here is on the significance and purpose of Christ's death, rather than playing with linguistic ambiguity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is obvious that in no general axiomatic sense can it be predicated of a covenant, or of an ordinance. Only when we recur to sense (1), that of a testament, can it be true, that where a διαθήκη is, there must of necessity be death, and that, the death τοῦ διαθεμένου, of him who has made the testament." 
2. "I believe then it will be found that we must at all hazards accept the meaning testament here, as being the only one which will in any way meet the plain requirements of the verse."
3. "And when Ebrard insists on the former of these facts, and altogether omits noticing the second, saying that according to our interpretation God Himself must have died, we can only marvel at this fresh instance of the inconceivable rashness and carelessness which unfortunately characterize his spirited and clever commentary."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The need of death before the testamentary appointment takes effect, holds good in Christ's relation as MAN to us; Of course not in God's relation to Christ."
2. "Thus, Luke 22:29- : may be translated, 'Blood of the covenant'; for a testament does not require blood shedding."
3. "These requisites of a will, or testament, concur here: (1) a testator; (2) heirs; (3) goods; (4) the death of the testator; (5) the fact of the death brought forward in court."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word διαθήκη diathēkē - διαθήκη diathēkē - occurs in the New Testament thirty-three times... In the Septuagint it occurs not far from 300 times, in considerably more than 200 times of which it is the translation of the Hebrew word בּרית beriyt."
2. "There must also of necessity be - ἀνάγκη anagkē - That is, it is necessary in order to confirm the covenant, or it would not be binding in cases where this did not occur. The 'necessity' in the case is simply to make it valid or obligatory."
3. "Under the Jewish economy this arrangement assumed one form; under the Christian another. In neither was it a compact or covenant between two parties in such a sense that one party would be at liberty to reject the terms proposed."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The English Version has involved this passage in hopeless obscurity by introducing the idea of a testament and a testator." - Rendall
2. "It is based upon klhronomia inheritance; it being claimed that this word changes the whole current of thought. Hence it is said that the new covenant established by Christ is here represented as a testamentary disposition on his part, which could become operative in putting the heirs in possession of the inheritance only through the death of Christ."
3. "If covenant the meaning is not difficult. If he had meant to say it is necessary that the institutor die, he might better have used genesqai: 'it is necessary that the death of the institutor take place'; but he meant to say that it was necessary that the institutor die representatively; that death should be born for him by an animal victim."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Apostle, alluding to its secondary meaning, holds that the promises should not have been otherwise ratified and valid, had they not been sealed by the death of Christ."
2. "We must ever hold this truth, that no symbols have ever been adopted by God unnecessarily or unsuitably."
3. "The covenant of God which was made with blood may be fitly compared to a testament, as it is of the same kind and character."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And it is a covenant with all the requisite validity."
2. "For where a covenant is, there must also be the death of the covenanting victim."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A testament  (διαθηκη). The same word occurs for covenant (verse Hebrews 9:15) and will (verse Hebrews 9:16). This double sense of the word is played upon also by Paul in Galatians 3:15. We say today 'The New Testament' (Novum Testamentum) rather than 'The New Covenant.' Both terms are pertinent."
2. "That made it  (του διαθεμενου). Genitive of the articular second aorist middle participle of διατιθημ from which διαθηκη comes. The notion of will here falls in with κληρονομια (inheritance, 1 Peter 1:4) as well as with θανατος (death)."
3. "Of force  (βεβαια). Stable, firm as in Hebrews 3:6; Hebrews 3:14. Where there hath been death  (επ νεκροις). 'In the case of dead people.' A will is only operative then."

### John Gill:
1. "The covenant of grace, is properly a covenant to Christ, and a testament or will to his people: it is his and their Father's will, concerning giving them both grace and glory; it consists of many gifts and legacies."
2. "Christ, as God, has an equal right to dispose of the inheritance, both of grace and glory; and as Mediator, nothing is given without his consent; and whatever is given, is given with a view to his 'death', and comes through it, and by virtue of it."
3. "The necessity of Christ's death is on account of the divine perfections; particularly for the declaration of God's righteousness, or by reason of his justice; and also because of his purposes and decrees, which have fixed it, and of his promises, which are yea and amen in Christ, and are ratified by his blood, called therefore the blood of the covenant."

### John Wesley:
1. "I say by means of death; for where such a covenant is, there must be the death of him by whom it is confirmed - Seeing it is by his death that the benefits of it are purchased."
 
2. "It seems beneath the dignity of the apostle to play upon the ambiguity of the Greek word, as the common translation supposes him to do."
