# Hebrews 9:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For a covenant is only binding when the party who made it is dead, and it has no power while that person is still alive. This illustrates the necessity of Christ's death, as a testament or will is not executed until the testator has passed away. Just as the legatees cannot claim their portion or the executor make dispositions while the testator is alive, the saints' right to the covenant is evident through Christ's death. The complexity of this passage leaves much room for interpretation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "A testament is of force in the case of the dead, seeing that it is never availing when he that made it is alive."
2. "Surely it is not availing when he that made it is alive."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "After—literally, 'over,' as we say 'upon the death of the testators'; not as THOLUCK, 'on the condition that slain sacrifices be there,' which the Greek hardly sanctions." 
2. "Otherwise—'seeing that it is never availing' [ALFORD]."
3. "BENGEL and LACHMANN read with an interrogation, 'Since, is it ever in force (surely not) while the testator liveth?'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "For a covenant is completed or confirmed over dead sacrifices, seeing it is never of force as long as the victim set apart for its ratification is still living." 
2. "The idea is, that a covenant with God was ratified over the animals slain in sacrifice, and was not considered as confirmed until the sacrifice was killed."
3. "It can be confirmed only by its being slain."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "For a covenant is of force (or sure) over (or upon) dead (victims)."
2. "Since it hath not then force when the institutor is alive" : until he has been representatively slain.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For a covenant is of force over the dead..."
2. "...since it has no avail at all while the covenanting victim liveth."

### John Gill:
1. "The necessity of Christ's death is here urged, from the nature and force of a testament or will, among men, which does not take place, and cannot be executed, till a man is dead."
2. "No claim can be made by the legatees for the part they have in it, nor can any disposition be made by the executor of it."
3. "The sense is, that there was a necessity of it, that the saints right unto it, upon the foot of justice, might be evident by it."

### John Wesley:
1. After he is dead — Neither this, nor after men are dead is a literal translation of the words. It is a very perplexed passage.
