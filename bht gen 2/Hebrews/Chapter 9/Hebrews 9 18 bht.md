# Hebrews 9:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The first Jewish covenant was not established without blood, as it was originally transacted without the blood of an appointed sacrifice. This lack of bloodshed in the first covenant demonstrates its temporary nature and the need for a greater, more perfect sacrifice.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Neither has the first (διαθήκη, testament) been inaugurated...inasmuch as the rites &c. belonging to it were still subsisting." 
2. "ἐγκαινίζω is an Alexandrine verb: used in the LXX for to re-create or make anew: also for to put forth as new, to inaugurate." 
3. "Notice that the reference is, here, simply to the first encænia of the law when it was put forth as new: not to any subsequent renewal of sacrifices by death."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Where the disposition, or arrangement, is ratified by the blood of another, namely, of animals, which cannot make a covenant, much less make a testament, it is not strictly a testament, where it is ratified by the death of him that makes the arrangement, it is strictly...a testament." 
2. "The Old Testament strictly and formally began on that day of inauguration."
3. "Thus, in Hebrews 9:15, referring to the old dispensation, we may translate, 'the first (covenant)': or better, retain 'the first (testament),' not that the old dispensation, regarded by itself, is a testament, but it is so when regarded as the typical representative of the new, which is strictly a Testament."


### Albert Barnes:
1. "The admitted principle which the apostle had stated, that the death of the victim was necessary to confirm the covenant, was the 'reason' why the first covenant was ratified with blood."
2. "The reasoning of Paul is clear and explicit; but who could see the force of the former?"
3. "The word used to 'ratify,' to 'confirm,' to 'consecrate,' to 'sanction.' Literally, 'to renew.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A covenant must be ratified by death."
2. "The first covenant was ratified by slaying victims and sprinkling their blood."
3. "The first (covenant) has been inaugurated without blood."

### John Calvin:
1. "And doubtless that is a testimony, μαρτυρία, to which angels from heaven has borne witness, and of which there have been so many illustrious witnesses on earth, even all the holy Prophets, Apostles, and a vast number of martyrs, and of which at last the Son of God himself became a surety." 
2. "He hence concludes, that men were even then reminded, that it could not be valid and efficacious except death intervened." 
3. "For the majesty of God is justly to be dreaded by us, and the way to his presence is nothing to us but a dangerous labyrinth, until we know that he is pacified towards us through the blood of Christ, and that this blood affords to us a free access."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It does not follow that because a testator must die before his will can take effect, therefore the first covenant was inaugurated with blood."
2. "All solemn covenants under the Law were made valid by the death of a victim which represented the covenanting persons, and pledged them on peril of their lives to faithfulness."
3. "If the rendering 'testament' is preferred, and 'testator,' it is best to regard Hebrews 9:16-17 as an illustrative argument, a parallel case, suggested partly by the mention of an inheritance and partly by the double meaning of the Greek word (covenant or testament), which is applied to any arrangement or distribution by will, or in any other way."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
