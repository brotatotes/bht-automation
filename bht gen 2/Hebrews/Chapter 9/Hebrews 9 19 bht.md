# Hebrews 9:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This passage provides insight into the practice of sprinkling blood in the establishment of the law covenant. The author draws from the account in Exodus 24:3, emphasizing the importance of speaking out clearly and plainly the whole counsel of God. The mixture of blood and water used for sprinkling symbolizes both justification and sanctification through Christ's sacrifice. Although these details are not specifically mentioned in Exodus, they are understood to be known from other passages of Moses. The act of sprinkling the book itself underscores its imperfections and insufficiency, pointing towards the need for a better covenant.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The law was ·ΩÅ ŒΩœåŒºŒøœÇ œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ ·ºêŒΩœÑŒøŒª·ø∂ŒΩ, and these ·ºêŒΩœÑŒøŒªŒ±ŒØ were faithfully reported, spoken according to the law, i.e. as the law directed, not varying from it in any point." 
2. "The key to the additions made here to the text of Exodus is, that the account is filled up by subsequent usage. We may presume, that the solemn legal appointment of various ceremonial details was in fact only a divine sanction of practices already existing: sacrifice having been long in use, and that under the direction and approval of God Himself."
3. "The hyssop indeed we find thus prescribed, ref. Exod., in sprinkling the blood on the door-posts at the Passover."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The law in Exodus sanctioned formally many sacrificial practices in use by tradition, from the primitive revelation long before."
2. "Scarlet or crimson, resembling blood: it was thought to be a peculiarly deep, fast dye, whence it typified sin."
3. "The sprinkling of the roll (so the Greek for "book") of the covenant, or testament, as well as of the people, implies that neither can the law be fulfilled, nor the people be purged from their sins, save by the sprinkling of the blood of Christ."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Since the account is not contained in the Old Testament, it must have been either by tradition, or by direct inspiration."
2. "Nothing is more probable than what is here stated. If Moses sprinkled 'the people;' if he read 'the book of the law'...nothing would be more natural than that he should sprinkle the book of the covenant, and even the tabernacle and its various sacred utensils."
3. "We are not to suppose that either Moses or Paul designs to say that the blood was actually sprinkled on each one of the three millions of people in the wilderness, but the meaning doubtless is that the blood was sprinkled over the people, though in fact it might have fallen on a few."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The statement of verse 18 historically confirmed by the story of the establishment of the law - covenant, Exodus 24:0."
2. "Water, scarlet wool, hyssop - sprinkled the book. None of these are mentioned in the O. T. account, which the writer appears to have filled up from the details of subsequent usage."
3. "It will also be observed that the sacrifices on the occasion of establishing the law covenant were not made according to the Mosaic ritual. They were offered, not by the priests, but by the young men, Exodus 24:5."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For (a proof of the assertion in Hebrews 9:18) when every commandment had been spoken by Moses according to the law (as the law directed, without any variation from it) unto all the people..."
2. "He took the blood of the calves and the goats (these last are not expressed in Exodus 24:6-8, but are implied in Exodus 5:5) with water and scarlet wool and hyssop..."
3. "...and sprinkled both the book itself (which probably lay on the altar) and all the people."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The author uses the account in Exodus 24:3 'with characteristic freedom'" (Moffatt).
2. "Both the book itself...[and] all the details." 
3. "Sprinkled. First aorist active indicative from œÅŒ±ŒΩœÑŒπŒ∂œâ (from œÅŒ±ŒΩœÑŒøœÇ and this from œÅŒ±ŒπŒΩœâ), like Œ≤Œ±œÄœÑŒπŒ∂œâ from Œ≤Œ±œÄœÑœâ."

### John Gill:
1. "This may instruct persons concerned in the public ministry, to speak out plainly and clearly the whole counsel of God." 
2. "The blood, with water, was typical of the blood and water which sprung from the side of Christ pierced on the cross, the one signifying justification by him, the other sanctification."
3. "The book of the law was sprinkled, not because of any impurity in it, but to show the imperfection of it, and its insufficiency to justify men."

### John Wesley:
1. "The blood was mixed with water to prevent its growing too stiff for sprinkling; perhaps also to typify that blood and water, John 19:34." 
2. "All these circumstances are not particularly mentioned in that chapter of Exodus, but are supposed to be already known from other passages of Moses." 
3. "And the book itself ‚Äî Which contained all he had said."
