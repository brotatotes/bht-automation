# Hebrews 9:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This passage reminds us of the importance of the blood of Christ in affirming the promises of God. Just as the old covenant was confirmed through the sprinkling of blood, the new covenant is also established by the precious blood of Jesus. This demonstrates the significance of His sacrifice and the sealing of the covenant through His blood. The mention of God's command further underscores the authority of this covenant and the need for obedience to its terms. Through the blood of Christ, we can experience redemption and partake in the blessings of the new covenant.

### Henry Alford:
1. "The word Î´Î¹Î±Î¸Î®ÎºÎ· has the double sense of a covenant and a testament. Both these senses may be applied to both Î´Î¹Î±Î¸á¿†ÎºÎ±Î¹: to the latter more properly belongs the testamentary sense, but to the former also in as far as it was typical of and foreshadowed the other."
2. "Christ, the heir of all things, has bequeathed to us His people an everlasting inheritance; has died, sealing the testament with His blood."
3. "So that, if our á½…Î¸ÎµÎ½ in Heb 9:18 were to be filled up, it would be, â€˜Whence, i. e. since the former covenant also had its testamentary side, and thus was analogous to as well as typical of the latter.â€™"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Behold the blood of the covenant, which the Lord has made with you concerning all these words."
2. "The Greek "diathece" means both "testament" and "covenant": the term "covenant" better suits the old dispensation, though the idea testament is included, for the old was one in its typical relation to the new dispensation, to which the term "testament" is better suited."
3. "Christ has sealed the testament with His blood, of which the Lord's Supper is the sacramental sign."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This is the blood by which the covenant is ratified. It was the means used to confirm it; the sacred and solemn form by which it was made sure."
2. "When this was done, the covenant between God and the people was confirmed - as a covenant between man and man is when it is sealed."
3. "In the transactions between God and man, though called a 'covenant' or 'compact,' the idea of a 'covenant' or 'compact' is so far excluded that God never loses his right to 'command' or 'enjoin'."

### John Calvin:
1. "This passage reminds us that the promises of God are then only profitable to us when they are confirmed by the blood of Christ."
2. "If this thought only came to our minds, that what we read is not written so much with ink as with the blood of Christ, that when the Gospel is preached, his sacred blood distills together with the voice, there would be far greater attention as well as reverence on our part."
3. "Christ employs his Spirit to sprinkle us in order to wash us by his own blood when he leads us to true repentance, when he purifies us from the depraved lusts of our flesh, when he imbues us with the precious gift of his own righteousness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The design of this sprinkling is now explained, saying, 'This is the blood of the covenant which God commanded to you-ward.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This is (Ï„Î¿Ï…Ï„Î¿). Instead of Î¹Î´Î¿Ï… of the LXX (Exodus 24:8), just like our Lord's words in Mark 14:24, a possible reminiscence of the Master's words (Dods)."
2. "The author also has ÎµÎ½ÎµÏ„ÎµÎ¹Î»Î±Ï„Î¿ (he commanded) for Î´Î¹ÎµÎ¸ÎµÏ„Î¿ of the LXX."
3. "A possible reminiscence of the Master's words."

### John Gill:
1. "This proves what the apostle had asserted...that it was dedicated with blood, or confirmed by it."
2. "Compare with this Matthew 26:28 which God hath enjoined unto you."
3. "The people of Israel, to observe, and which they promised to do; see Exodus 24:7."
