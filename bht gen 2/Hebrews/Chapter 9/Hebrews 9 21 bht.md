# Hebrews 9:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The tabernacle and its vessels were purified by sprinkling them with blood. This points to the cleansing power of Christ's blood in the church, which cannot enter into God's presence without it. The sprinkling of blood is significant for the elect, symbolizing their hearts being purified and their garments made white through the blood of Christ. This reminds us of the importance of blood for the remission of sins, as stated in Leviticus 17:11. Ultimately, the sprinkling of blood highlights the central role of Christ's sacrifice in the redemption and purification of believers.
