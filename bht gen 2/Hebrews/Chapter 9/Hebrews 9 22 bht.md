# Hebrews 9:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible makes it clear that without the shedding of blood, there can be no forgiveness of sins. This principle is seen throughout the Old Testament, where blood was necessary for purification and atonement. The blood of Christ is the ultimate means of forgiveness, as it alone can cleanse us from all sin. Though there were some exceptions in the Old Testament, the general rule remains that without the shedding of blood, there can be no remission. Therefore, we must place our faith in the sacrificial death of Christ and His precious blood to find true forgiveness and redemption.
