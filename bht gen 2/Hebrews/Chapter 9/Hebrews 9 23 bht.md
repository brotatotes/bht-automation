# Hebrews 9:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It plainly appears that the heavenly things themselves, which were the patterns for the earthly tabernacle, needed to be purified. Just as the tabernacle and its utensils were purified by sacrifices and sprinklings, the heavenly things required a purification of a greater nature. This purification is accomplished by the better sacrifices - the sacrifice and sprinkling of the blood of Christ. The significance and virtue of these better sacrifices surpass all others, resulting in the purification of the heavenly realities.
