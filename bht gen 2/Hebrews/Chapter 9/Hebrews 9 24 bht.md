# Hebrews 9:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ did not enter the man-made holy places, but rather the true holy place, heaven itself. The earthly tabernacle and temple were only representations, mere figures of the true heavenly sanctuary where God's presence is fully manifested. It is in this heavenly sanctuary that Christ appears and pleads for us, just as the Levitical high priests appeared before the shekinah in the tabernacle. His entrance into heaven and constant intercession on our behalf is a source of great assurance and security for believers.
