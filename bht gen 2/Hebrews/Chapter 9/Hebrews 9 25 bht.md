# Hebrews 9:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ's offering of himself once for all is perpetual in its effects and sustains his eternal priesthood. Unlike the Levitical priests who offered animal sacrifices, Christ offered himself as the true sacrifice. His sacrifice does not need to be repeated like the offerings under the Law. Instead, he entered into heaven with his own blood, completely fulfilling the requirements for salvation and putting an end to sin. This highlights the perfection of his sacrifice and refutes erroneous beliefs about continuous offerings.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "That He may oftentimes offer Himself just as the high priest enters into the holy place year by year with the blood of others."
2. "This προσφέρειν ἑαυτόν is not to be understood of Christ’s death, nor confounded, as Owen, Thol., De Wette, Ebrard, Lünem., and many others have done, with παθεῖν below: see there."
3. "He enters, furnished with, as it were clad with, that which follows. We use our ‘in’ of even the lesser articles of personal wear in a similar sense: ‘a man in spectacles’."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It was not into the typical, but the true sanctuary, that Christ is entered."
2. "His sacrifice needs not, as the Levitical sacrifices did, to be repeated."
3. "Nor yet did He enter for this purpose that He may offer Himself often, that is, present Himself in the presence of God, as the high priest does, year by year, on the day of atonement, entering the Holy of Holies."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In this respect the offering made by Christ, and the work which he performed, differed from that of the Jewish high priest."
2. "It was not needful that he should enter the holy place but once. Having entered there, he permanently remains there."
3. "Christ entered there with his own blood."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Nor yet did he enter that he might offer himself often." 
2. "His offering did not need repetition like the Levitical sacrifices." 
3. "The point is that, being once in the heavenly sanctuary, Christ was not compelled to renew often his presentation of himself there, since, in that case, it would be necessary for him to suffer often."

### John Calvin:
1. "But as that only true sacrifice which Christ offered once for all is ever efficacious, and thus perpetual in its effects, it is no wonder that on its virtue, which never fails, Christ’s eternal priesthood should be sustained." 
2. "And here again he shows how and in what things Christ differs from the Levitical priest. Of the sanctuary he had spoken before; but he notices one difference as to the kind of sacrifice, for Christ offered himself and not an animal." 
3. "He adds another; that he repeated not his sacrifice, as under the Law, for the repetition there was frequent and even incessant."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "That he should offer himself often (ινα πολλακις προσφερη εαυτον). Purpose clause with ινα and present active subjunctive of προσφερω (keep on offering himself, like Hebrews 5:1; Hebrews 5:3)."
2. "With blood not his own (εν αιματ αλλοτριω). So-called instrumental use of εν (accompaniment). αλλοτριος means 'belonging to another,' 'not one's own' (Luke 16:12)."

### John Gill:
1. "which shows the perfection of his sacrifice, for justice was satisfied, the law fulfilled, sin done away, and complete salvation obtained at once"
2. "which lies against the errors of the Socinians, who say he offers himself now in heaven; and of the Papists, who pretend to offer the body of Christ daily in their mass"
3. "Christ entered into heaven with his own blood, he having been altar, priest, and sacrifice"
