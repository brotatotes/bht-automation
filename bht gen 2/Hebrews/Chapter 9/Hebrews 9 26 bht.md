## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "when Christ’s view in entering heaven was, to offer, present, himself often to God, then, as a condition of that frequent presentation, there would be an antecedent necessity for Him to suffer often: because that self-presentation is in fact the bringing in before God of the Blood of that his suffering" (source).
2. "those supposed repeated sufferings must necessarily in that case take place within the temporal limits indicated by ἀπὸ καταβολῆς κόσμου: that such sufferings would be spread over the space of time from the καταβολὴ κόσμου till He entered into the presence of God" (source).
3. "hath He been manifested for the putting away of sin by means of His sacrifice" (source).

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It would have been necessary for Him often to suffer... His oblation of Himself before God was once for all...since the foundation of the world, if the one oblation 'in the fulness of time' were not sufficient."
2. "Rome's fiction of an UNBLOODY sacrifice in the mass, contradicts her assertion that the blood of Christ is present in the wine; and also confutes her assertion that the mass is propitiatory; for, if unbloody, it cannot be propitiatory; for without shedding of blood there is no remission."
3. "He hath not only droned for all actual sins, but destroyed sin itself. Hebrews 9:26- :, 'Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin (not merely the sins: singular, not plural) of the world.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "For then must he often have suffered - That is, if his blood had no more efficacy than what the Jewish high priest offered, and which was so often repeated, it would have been necessary that Christ should have often died."
2. "Once for all; once in the sense that it is not to be repeated again."

### John Calvin:
1. "For then must he often have suffered, etc. He shows how great an absurdity follows, if we do not count it enough that an expiation has been made by the one sacrifice of Christ."
2. "Except then the sacrifice of Christ was efficacious, no one of the fathers would have obtained salvation; for as they were exposed to God’s wrath, a remedy for deliverance would have failed them, had not Christ by suffering once suffered so much as was necessary to reconcile men to God from the beginning of the world even to the end."
3. "But now once in the end of the world, etc. He calls that the end of the world or the consummation of the ages, which Paul calls 'the fullness of time,' (Galatians 4:4;) for it was the maturity of that time which God had determined in his eternal purpose."
