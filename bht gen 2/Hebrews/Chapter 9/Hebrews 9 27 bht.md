# Hebrews 9:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The certainty of death, appointed by God, holds the same significance as the singular death of Christ, who is not only a suitable comparison to mankind but is mankind. Just as death occurs only once, after which comes judgment, the final destiny of all individuals, it is crucial to acknowledge that after judgment, there is an eternal state of either joy or anguish. Therefore, since death happens only once and Christ died once for all, it is only fitting to patiently await His second coming, just as we patiently endure the certainty of death and the imminent day of judgment.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Christ is not only a fit object of comparison with man, but is man." 
2. "Inasmuch as it is appointed to men once to die, and after that, judgment." 
3. "Next to death, with no more like events between, comes judgment: this is the fact contemplated the appointed destiny of man."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The two most solemn facts of our being are here connected with the two most gracious truths of our dispensation, our death and judgment answering in parallelism to Christ's first coming to die for us, and His second coming to consummate our salvation."
2. "Once - and no more."
3. "After the judgment comes the full and final state of joy, or else woe."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Thus, it is with 'death.' That does not, and cannot occur many times. It is the great law of our being that people die only once, and hence, the same thing was to be expected to occur in regard to him who made the atonement."
2. "Whatever truths or facts then pertain to death; whatever lessons it is calculated to convey, pertain to it as an event which is not to occur again."
3. "The main thought of the apostle here may be, that after death will commence a state of 'retribution' which can never change. Hence, there was a propriety that Christ should die but once."

### John Calvin:
1. "since we patiently wait after death for the day of judgment, it being the common lot of nature which it is not right to struggle against; why should there be less patience in waiting for the second coming of Christ?"
2. "For if a long interval of time does not diminish, as to men, the hope of a happy resurrection, how unreasonable would it be to render less honor to Christ?"
3. "But less would it be, were we to call upon him to undergo a second death, when he had once died."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is appointed (αποκειτα). Present middle (or passive) of αποκειμα, 'is laid away' for men."
2. "Once to die (απαξ αποθανειν). Once for all to die, as once for all to live here. No reincarnation here."
3. "After this cometh judgement (μετα τουτο κρισις). Death is not all. Man has to meet Christ as Judge as Jesus himself graphically pictures (Matthew 25:31-46; John 5:25-29)."

### John Gill:
1. "By which it is fixed that men shall die, and how long they shall live, and when they shall die; so that they cannot die sooner nor later."
2. "And generally speaking men die but once; it is not usual for men to die, and live again, and then die again."
3. "There is a particular judgment which is immediately after death; by virtue of which, the souls of men are condemned to their proper state of happiness or woe."

### John Wesley:
1. "At the moment of death every man's final state is determined."
2. "There is not a word in scripture of a particular judgment immediately after death."
