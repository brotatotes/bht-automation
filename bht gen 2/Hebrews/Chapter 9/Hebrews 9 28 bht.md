# Hebrews 9:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ, the representative man, bore the sins of many in his death on the cross. He made a sacrificial offering that abolished sins once for all. At his second coming, he will come without sin to manifest the efficacy of his death. This second appearance will bring complete salvation to those who are waiting for him, confirming them in the everlasting inheritance that he has promised. His first appearance involved bearing the sins as our sacrifice, but the second appearance will bring salvation and eternal glory.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It was a death in which He bore the sins of many, but He shall appear the second time without sin, with no sin upon Him, and consequently the whole work of atonement done and accomplished by that first offering." 
2. "At His first appearance in the world He came with sin, not in him, but on him: He was made to be sin: but this sin has been once for all taken away by his bearing it as our Sacrifice."
3. "The object of Christ’s second appearance shall be, to bring in salvation: this is the bright and Christian side of His appearing, the side which we, who ought to be waiting for Him, should ever look upon."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Christ—Greek, 'THE Christ'; the representative MAN; representing all men, as the first Adam did."
2. "He did not need to die again and again for each individual, or each successive generation of men, for He represents all men of every age, and therefore needed to die but once for all, so as to exhaust the penalty of death incurred by all."
3. "He, the One, was offered for many; and that once for all... No longer in the alien 'form of a servant,' but in His own proper glory... apart from, separate from, sin... to bring in completed salvation."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There was a fitness that the great victim should die but once."
2. "Christ endured sufferings in his own person, which, if they had been inflicted on us, would have been the proper punishment of sin."
3. "He will come to save them from all their sins and temptations; to raise them from their graves; to place them at his right hand in glory, and to confirm them in the everlasting inheritance which he has promised to all who truly love him, and who wait for his appearing."

### John Calvin:
1. "He once appeared and made a sacrifice to abolish sins, and that at his second coming he will make openly manifest the efficacy of his death, so that sin will have no more power to hurt us."
2. "Christ at his coming will make it known how truly and really he had taken away sins, so that there would be no need of any other sacrifice to pacify God."
3. "Those shall find complete salvation who recumb with quiet minds on the death of Christ; for this looking for or wanting has a reference to the subject discussed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Once for all" (verse Hebrews 9:26) as already stated.
2. Blessed assurance of the Second Coming of Christ, but this time "apart from sin" (χωρις αμαρτιας, no notion of a second chance then).
3. Final and complete salvation for "them that wait for him" (τοις αυτον απεκδεχομενοις).

### John Gill:
1. "Christ bore not the sins of all men; for as all men have not faith, all are not justified, pardoned, and saved... his bearing them supposes they were upon him, though not in him, imputed, though not inherent."
2. "The way in which he came to bear them was this; he became a surety for all the elect...which is an instance both of his great love, and of his great strength."
3. "This is to be understood of Christ's visible and personal appearance on earth...and this is said to be 'the second time'; that is, that he appears on earth, and personally...and as this will be the second, it will be the last."

### John Wesley:
1. "Christ having once died to bear the sins — The punishment due to them."
2. "Will appear the second time — When he comes to judgment."
3. "Without sin — Not as he did before, bearing on himself the sins of many, but to bestow everlasting salvation."
