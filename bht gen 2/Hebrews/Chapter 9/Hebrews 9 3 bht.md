# Hebrews 9:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The second veil, also known as the innermost veil, was a significant barrier that separated the holy place from the most holy place. This veil, like the first veil that separated the holy place from the courts, partitioned different sections of the tabernacle. The presence of the veils symbolized the separation between God and mankind, highlighting the sinfulness that kept humans from direct access to God. However, through the death of Christ, represented by the tearing of the veil, a new way to God was opened, allowing for direct communion between God and His people.
