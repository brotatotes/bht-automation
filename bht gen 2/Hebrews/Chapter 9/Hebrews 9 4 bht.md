# Hebrews 9:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The presence of the golden censer, exclusively used by the high priest on the day of atonement, and the ark of the covenant, which held the tables of the covenant, are mentioned. Additionally, the ark contained the manna, a symbol of God's providence for His people. These items hold deep symbolic meaning, representing the high priest's role in atonement and God's faithfulness in providing for His chosen ones.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The first difficulty is respecting the meaning of the word Œ∏œÖŒºŒπŒ±œÑŒÆœÅŒπŒøŒΩ. And here the etymology gives us no help. For the word is a neut. adj., importing anything having regard to or employed in the burning of incense. It may therefore mean either an altar upon which, or a censer in which, incense was burnt." 
2. "The Author treats the Holy of holies, irrespective of the veil, as symbolical of the heavenly sanctuary, and had also a motive to include in it the altar of incense, whose offerings of incense are the symbol of the prayers of the saints."
3. "The language of the Mischna concerning the golden censer is very strong, and more weight still is given to it when we reflect that it is especially of the day of expiation that our Writer is preparing to speak."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The golden censer was only used on the day of atonement... and is therefore associated with the holiest place, as being taken into it on that anniversary by the high priest." 
2. "The incense answers to the prayers of the saints; and the altar though outside the holiest place, is connected with it... even as we find an antitypical altar in heaven." 
3. "In 1 Kings 8:9; 2 Chronicles 5:10, it is said there was nothing in the ark of Solomon's temple save the two stone tables of the law put in by Moses. But the expression that there was nothing THEN therein save the two tables, leaves the inference to be drawn that formerly there were the other things mentioned... the pot of manna and the rod of Aaron."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The fact that Moses does not expressly mention it [the golden censer], does not prove that in fact no such censer was laid up in the most holy place."
2. "The object of the incense burned in worship was to produce an agreeable fragrance or smell."
3. "As the manna, also, would not of itself keep, Exodus 16:20, the fact that this was to be laid up to be preserved from age to age, was a perpetual miracle in proof of the presence and faithfulness of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The writer clearly speaks of an abiding-place of the qumiathrion in a particular division of the tabernacle."
2. "The facts of the case then are as follows : (a) according to Exodus 31:0 the incense - altar was in the holy place, not in the holy of holies; (b) Philo and Josephus use qumiathrion for the altar of incense; (c) there is no mention in O. T. Of a censer set apart for the day of atonement; (d) the high priest was to enter with incense, so that the ark might be veiled by the smoke (Leviticus 16:12)."
3. "The writer follows the rabbinical tradition that the pot of manna and the rod were inside of the ark."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The altar of incense was used for the Holy of Holies ("its ritual associations," Dods)."
2. "There were three treasures in the ark of the covenant (a pot of manna, Aaron's rod, the tables of the covenant)."
3. "Not definitely clear about these items in the ark, but on front, except that 1 Kings 8:9 states that it did contain the tables of the covenant."

### John Gill:
1. "The burning coals signify the very great sufferings of Christ, not only the sufferings of his body but those of his soul, when the wrath and hot displeasure of God was poured out upon him."
2. "The incense being put upon the burning coals in the censer, shows that Christ's intercession proceeds upon the foot of his blood and sacrifice, his sufferings and death; and hence it becomes grateful, and has its influence; the smoke of it covers the mercy seat, or throne of grace, and makes that accessible."
3. "The manna, in this pot, was typical of Christ; in the signification of its name, whether it comes from 'manah', which signifies to appoint, prepare, and distribute, Christ being appointed, prepared, and distributed, as food for his people; or from 'man hu', what is it? the words said by the Israelites when they first saw it, not knowing what it was; so Christ is unknown to his people until revealed to them, and remains unknown to all natural and unregenerate men." (143 words)

### John Wesley:
1. "Having the golden censer - Used by the high priest only, on the great day of atonement."
2. "And the ark, or chest, of the covenant - So called from the tables of the covenant contained therein."
3. "Wherein was the manna - The monument of God's care over Israel."
