# Hebrews 9:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The priests, both ordinary and high, would regularly enter the tabernacle and perform their assigned duties. The common priests would enter the holy place every day, morning and evening, serving by attending to the lamps, offering incense, and changing the shewbread. On the other hand, the high priest would enter the holiest part once a year to perform various sacred rituals. It is important for those engaged in these sacred services to be diligent and thorough in carrying out their duties.
