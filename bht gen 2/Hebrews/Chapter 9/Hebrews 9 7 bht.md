# Hebrews 9:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The high priest's entrance into the holy of holies once a year, without any accompanying person, symbolized the uniqueness and significance of this day of atonement. The sins of ignorance, or errors, committed by the people were to be atoned for through these sacrifices. It is important to understand that these sacrifices served as a reminder of sin and the need for forgiveness, both for the priests and the people. Christ, as our ultimate high priest and sinless Savior, offered Himself as the perfect sacrifice for the sins of all mankind.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "No one would think, if I said I was in the habit of seeing a certain person but once in every year, of asking how long I spent in his company during that day, and how often I looked upon him."  
2. "The high priest alone, not without blood, which he offers on behalf of himself and the ignorances of the people." 
3. "And here, though I prefer the more strictly grammatical rendering, I am by no means sure that the other is absolutely excluded."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "once every year—the tenth day of the seventh month. He entered within the veil on that day twice at least. Thus 'once' means here on the one occasion only."
2. "not without blood."
3. "their ignorance was culpable ... Though one's ignorance may mitigate one's punishment, it does not wholly exempt from punishment."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The only important point being that he entered it only on one day of the year, while the holy place was entered every day." 
2. "the priests even of the highest order were sinners, and needed expiation like others."
3. "The repetition of these sacrifices was a constant remembrancer of sin, and the design was that neither the priests nor the people should lose sight of the fact that they were violators of the Law of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Errors [αγνοηματων] . Lit. ignorances. See on ch. Hebrews 5:2.

### John Calvin:
1. "no sin is free from error or ignorance; for however knowingly and willfully any one may sin, yet it must be that he is blinded by his lust, so that he does not judge rightly"
2. "men never deliberately rush headlong into ruin, but being entangled in the deceptions of Satan, they lose the power of judging rightly"
3. "sins were called ignorances"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Not without blood. According to Leviticus 16:14. Not even he could enter the second tent (Holy of Holies) without blood." 
2. "The errors of the people. Late word from αγνοεω, not to know (Hebrews 5:2), only here in the N.T., but in LXX, papyri, and inscriptions where a distinction is drawn between errors (αγνοηματα) and crimes (αρμαρτηματα)." 
3. "But these sins of ignorance (αγνοηματα) were sins and called for atonement. See Hebrews 10:26 for wilful sinning."

### John Gill:
1. "The high priest went into the holy of holies but once a year, on the day of atonement... no other man, either Israelite or priest, might go in along with him; he went in alone without any attendance." 
2. "The Jews say that a cord or thong was bound to the feet of the high priest when he went into the holy of holies, that if he died there, the rest might be able to draw him out."
