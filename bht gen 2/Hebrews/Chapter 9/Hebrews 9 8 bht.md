# Hebrews 9:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The arrangement of the sanctuary, excluding all but the high priest once a year, symbolized the limited access to God under the Old Testament economy. The tabernacle served as a reminder of important truths and the inaccessibility of God. The priests acted as intermediaries between the people and God. However, through Christ's redemption, the way to the true Holy of Holies has been fully opened. The Old Testament foreshadowed the need for a more perfect and accessible way, which has now been made known through Jesus Christ.

### Henry Alford:
1. "the Holy Spirit signifying (by the typical arrangement of the sanctuary, excluding all from it except the high priest once a year: Î´Î·Î»Î¿á¿¦Î½Ï„Î¿Ï‚ is not, as Semler, to be referred back to the prophecy of Jeremiah above quoted."
2. "what first tabernacle? That which was first in time, or first in order of space? Clearly the latter, which has already been used in Hebrews 9:6."

### Marvin Vincent:
