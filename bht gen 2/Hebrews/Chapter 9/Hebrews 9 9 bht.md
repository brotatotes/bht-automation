# Hebrews 9:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The tabernacle served as a representation of heavenly truths and was a temporary symbol of the new covenant. The Levitical offerings, while made with good intentions, were unable to bring about true perfection or cleanse the conscience. These offerings only provided temporary purification and could not bring lasting peace to the soul. As a result, the tabernacle and its offerings pointed to the need for a better and more perfect sacrifice to come.

2. "The present implies only the matter-of-fact endurance of the Levitical offerings, not their subsistence in the divine plan."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The arrangements and services of the tabernacle were a representation of important realities."
2. "The idea is, that all kinds of offerings to God were made there."
3. "They could not expiate guilt; they could not make the soul pure; they could not of themselves impart peace to the soul by reconciling it to God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The way into the holiest was not yet manifest while the first tabernacle continued to be a recognized institution, seeing that the first tabernacle was a parable."
2. "The radical defect of the Levitical system was its inability to deal with the conscience, and thus bring about the 'perfection' which is the ideal of true religion."
3. "That ideal contemplated the cleansing and renewal of the inner man; not merely the removal of ceremonial uncleanness, or the formal expiation of sins."

### John Calvin:
1. "He means that that tabernacle was a second pattern which corresponded with the first."
2. "They did not reach the soul so as to confer true holiness."
3. "The Apostle understands by these words that they were earthly symbols, which did not reach the soul."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The arrangement might have taught those who first witnessed it (then present) that the gifts and sacrifices which are still being offered (present tense) could not meet the needs of the human conscience or give free access to God."
2. "The arrangement teaches us (‘now’ present) the same lessons imposed, as it is till the fulness of the time when all is to be rightly arranged and with better results."
3. "And according to which parable (or tabernacle, i.e a holy place with the holy of holies veiled and inaccessible either meaning gives the same lessons, and the Greek admits either) were offered gifts and sacrifices which could not give peace to the conscience or satisfy God’s justice."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

### John Gill:
1. "The tabernacle in general was a figure of Christ's human nature, and the most holy part of it was a figure of heaven itself."

3. "The ordinances of the Gospel being greatly preferable to them; and while it did continue, it was only a parable, as the word here used signifies; it was like a dark saying; it had much obscurity and darkness in it."
