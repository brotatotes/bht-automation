# James 1:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let the rich brother rejoice in his humility, for through his humbling, he is reminded of his true condition and brought into a state of lowliness. This reminder serves as a cautionary lesson against the haughtiness that often accompanies prosperity. As the flower of the grass, riches are beautiful but transient, passing away quickly, whether through death or the fleeting nature of worldly possessions. Therefore, the rich should not find their glory in their wealth, but rather in their humility and the enduring nature of their brotherhood in Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Let the rich brother glory in his humiliation, for, or because, considered merely as a rich man, he shall pass away." 
2. "The lowly Christian is called on to boast in what is in reality his exaltation."
3. "The parallelism coheres. The ὕψος of the ταπεινός brother is that which is really but not apparently his exaltation, whereas the ταπείνωσις of the πλούσιος brother is that which is apparently but not really his debasement."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "So far as one is merely 'rich' in worldly goods, 'he shall pass away'; in so far as his predominant character is that of a 'brother,' he 'abideth for ever'." 
2. "To avoid making the rich a brother, he translates, 'But the rich glories in his humiliation,' namely, in that which is really his debasement, just as the low is told to rejoice in what is really his exaltation."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The apostle says that even in that a Christian may find occasion for thanksgiving."
2. "The transition from affluence to poverty is often borne by Christians with the manifestation of a most lovely spirit, and with an entire freedom from murmuring and complaining."
3. "He should, therefore, esteem it a favor that this lesson is brought impressively before his mind."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In that he is made low [εν τη ταπεινωσει αυτου]. A form of expression similar to the preceding. Lit., in his humiliation."
2. "Both the A. V. and Rev. preserve the kinship between tapeinov and tapeinwsei, by the word low."
3. "Flower [ανθος]. Only here, ver. 11, and 1 Peter 1:24."

### John Calvin:
1. "He bids them to glory in their lowness or littleness, in order to repress the haughtiness of those who are usually inflated with prosperity."
2. "As the flower of the grass...the meaning is, that glorying in riches is foolish and preposterous, because they pass away in a moment."
3. "The opinion of Macknight and some others, that the reference is to the lowness to which the rich were reduced by persecution, does not comport with the passage, for the Apostle afterwards speaks of the shortness of man’s life and its uncertainty, and not of the fading nature of riches."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Let the rich brother glory in that he is made low: literally, ‘in his humiliation.’ There is here also the same diversity of meaning as in the former verse. It is usually understood of humility of spirit..."
2. "Others refer it to a rich man being stripped of his possessions by persecution for the sake of the Gospel: ‘Let him glory in being thus deprived of his worldly wealth.’"
3. "Perhaps the words may also be taken in their most literal meaning: ‘Let the rich brother rejoice when he becomes poor,’ when he is reduced from affluence to poverty, because he is then freed from the snares and temptations of riches."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Cross of Christ lifts up the poor and brings down the high. It is the great leveller of men." 
2. "This warning is here applied to 'the rich brother,' but it is true of all." 
3. "He shall pass away (παρελευσετα). Future middle indicative (effective aoristic future, shall pass completely away from earth)."

### John Gill:
1. "Such an one should rejoice or glory in his lowness, or low estate; in the consideration of the low estate, out of which he was raised, by the good providence of God."
2. "...in that low estate he may quickly expect he shall be brought into, either in the above manner, or by some calamity or another, and at least by death, which will put him upon a level with others."
3. "Because, as the flower of the grass he shall pass away; shortly, and suddenly; either he himself by death, or his riches at death, or before, and therefore are not to be gloried in."

### John Wesley:
1. "The rich, in that he is made low — Is humbled by a deep sense of his true condition."
2. "Because as the flower — Beautiful, but transient."
3. "He shall pass away — Into eternity."
