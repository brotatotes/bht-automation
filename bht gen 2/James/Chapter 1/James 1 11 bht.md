# James 1:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Earthly riches, with their outward show and glory, can be enticing and captivating. They may appear pleasant and desirable, but like the flower of the field, they are temporary and can swiftly fade away at the appearance of adversity. Just as the scorching wind and burning heat of the sun wither the grass and flowers, so too shall the rich wither away in the midst of their pleasures and pursuits. Riches are uncertain and have the tendency to vanish like a vain show, leaving behind nothing but a pitiful and fleeting beauty.
