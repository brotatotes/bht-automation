# James 1:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Blessed is the person who remains steadfast in the face of trials and tribulations, not faltering in their faith. They are like gold tested by fire, their endurance revealing the truth and strength of their love for God. They are promised a crown of life, an eternal reward that shines even brighter than an earthly crown. This beatitude reminds us that enduring temptation leads to spiritual growth and the fulfillment of God's promises to those who love Him.

Or affliction, which is designed by temptation, as in James 1:2 and the man that endures it is he that so bears it, and bears up under it, as not to be offended at it, and stumble in the ways of Christ, and fall away from the truth, and a profession of it.
2. Such expect afflictions, and when they come, they are not moved by them, but, notwithstanding them, continue in the ways and work of the Lord; and such are happy persons; they are happy now, and shall be hereafter.
