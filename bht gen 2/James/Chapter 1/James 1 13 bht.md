# James 1:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Before discussing temptations, which serve to test and strengthen faith, let it be clear that temptations to sin are different. No one should claim that God tempts them to sin, for God cannot be tempted by evil and does not tempt anyone to sin.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The ‘tentatio’ is a trying of the man by the solicitation of evil: whether that evil be the terror of external danger, or whatever it be, all πειράζεσθαι by means of it arises not from God, but from ourselves our own ἐπιθυμία."
2. "God ordains the temptation, overrules the temptation, but does not tempt, is not the spring of the solicitation to sin."
3. "God is unversed in things evil."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Let no one fancy that God lays upon him an inevitable necessity of sinning."
2. "God does not send trials on you in order to make you worse, but to make you better."
3. "Neither do any of our sins tempt God to entice us to worse things, nor does He tempt any of His own accord."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "No one should charge it on God. He did nothing in any way with a view to induce men to do evil."
2. "Whatever there was in any form of trial that could be regarded as an inducement or allurement to sin, is not the thing which he contemplated in the arrangement, and does not proceed from him."
3. "God does not place inducements before us with a view that we should sin, or in order to lead us into sin."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Not by God, as the direct agent, but by agency proceeding from God."
2. "Some of the best expositors render is unversed in evil things, as better according both with the usage of the word and with the context."
3. "He himself tempteth no man."

### John Calvin:
1. "This warning is very necessary, for nothing is more common among men than to transfer to another the blame of the evils they commit; and they then especially seem to free themselves, when they ascribe it to God himself."
2. "The meaning is, that man in vain evades, who attempts to cast the blame of his vices on God, because every evil proceeds from no other fountain than from the wicked lust of man."
3. "God does not desire what is evil: he is not, therefore, the author of doing evil in us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If, instead of enduring the temptation, we yield to it and are overcome by it, we must not lay the blame of our fall from virtue upon God."
2. "Temptations may be considered as either external or internal. The trials which occur in the course of life, the afflictions which befall us, the persecutions to which religion may expose us, are external temptations and tests of character. But when these draw out our sinful desires and excite to sinful actions, they become internal, and are solicitations to evil."
3. "God certainly tempts in the sense of tries. But the design of the Divine trying is not to excite to sin, not that sin should arise, but that it should be overcome; He tries our virtues, in order that they may be purified."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Let no one say...when he is tempted." 
2. "It is contemptible, but I have heard wicked and weak men blame God for their sins."
3. "The context calls for 'untemptable' rather than 'untempted'."

### John Gill:
1. "Before he treats of temptations, which were the means of trying and exercising grace, and of purging away the dross of sin and corruption, but here of temptations to sin, and which are in themselves sinful."
2. "Nor can he commit it, it being contrary to his nature, and the perfections of it; whereas no one can tempt another to sin, unless he is sinful himself, and delights in sin, and in those that commit it."
3. "let no man talk at this wicked rate, for God cannot be tempted with evil; or 'evils'... he is proof against all such temptations: he cannot be tempted by anything in himself, who is pure and holy, or by any creature or thing without him, to do any sinful action."

### John Wesley:
1. But let no man who is tempted - To sin.Say, I am tempted of God — God thus tempteth no man.
