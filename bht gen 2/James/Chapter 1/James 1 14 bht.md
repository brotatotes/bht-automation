# James 1:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When confronted with temptation, it is essential to recognize that the root cause resides within ourselves. Our own desires and inclinations, stemming from our individual nature and experiences, become the catalyst for the temptations that we encounter. Just as a fish is enticed by bait or a person is captivated by a seductive charm, we too are drawn into sinful behaviors. It is crucial to acknowledge the role that our own lust and corrupt nature play in these temptations. By taking responsibility for our actions and seeking refuge in God, we can resist the enticements that lead us astray.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "each man is tempted, being drawn out and enticed by his own lust"
2. "the image... habent: imaginem meretricis suppeditant voces œÉœÖŒªŒªŒ±Œ≤Œµ·øñŒΩ, œÑŒØŒ∫œÑŒµŒπŒΩ, ·ºÄœÄŒøŒ∫œçŒµŒπŒΩ, necnon et ·ºêŒæŒ≠ŒªŒ∫ŒµŒπŒΩ atque Œ¥ŒµŒªŒµŒ¨Œ∂ŒµŒπŒΩ"
3. "St. James is not here speaking of the original source of sin in man, but of the actual source of temptation to sin, when it occurs"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The cause of sin is in ourselves. Even Satan's suggestions do not endanger us before they are made our own."
2. "Each one has his own peculiar lust, arising from his own temperament and habit."
3. "Lust flows from the original birth-sin in man, inherited from Adam."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The fountain or source of all temptation is in man himself...There must be some 'lust;' some desire; some inclination; something which is unsatisfied now, which is made the foundation of the temptation, and which gives it all its power."
2. "The word rendered 'lust' in this place...means desire in general; an earnest wish for anything...it seems here to be used with reference to the original propensities of our nature - the desires implanted in us, which are a stimulus to employment."
3. "The whole passage, with the words and figures which are used, show that the idea in the apostle‚Äôs mind was that of an enticing harlot. The 'epithumia' is personified. She persuades the understanding and will into her impure embrace. The result of this fatal union is the 'conception' and ultimate 'bringing forth' of actual sin, which again brings forth death. This is the true genealogy of sin."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Drawn away, as beasts are enticed from a safe covert into a place beset with snares."
2. "Note the present participle, as indicating the progress of the temptation: 'is being drawn away.'"
3. "Enticed, as a fish with bait. Also the present participle."

### John Calvin:
1. "As the inclination and excitement to sin are inward, in vain does the sinner seek an cause from an external impulse."
2. "It ensnares us by its allurements, and it does us away; each of which is sufficient to render us guilty."
3. "He is in the first drawn off from the line of duty, and then he is caught by something that is pleasing and plausible, but like the bait, it has in it a deadly hook."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "These solicitations, he observes, arise from within; they have their origin in our evil desires; our passions are the occasion of our yielding to temptation."
2. "St. James is not speaking here of the original source of sin in the human race, but of the cause of temptation to evil."
3. "It is we ourselves that yield. We sin simply because we choose to sin."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "When he is drawn away by his own lust...Like a fish drawn out from his retreat." 
2. "Enticed...to catch fish by bait or to hunt with snares." 
3. "Allured by definite bait."

### John Gill:
1. "The metaphor is taken either from fishes, who are enticed by the bait, and drawn out by the hook; or from a lascivious woman, who meeting with a young man, entices him, and draws him away after her to commit iniquity with her."
2. "By 'lust' is meant the principle of corrupt nature, which has its residence in the heart of man; is natural and hereditary to him, and therefore is called his own."
3. "Sin often promises pleasure, though it is but an imaginary, and a short-lived one; which takes with a man's own lust and corruption within him, and so he is allured and drawn aside; and to this, and not to God, should he attribute temptation to sin."

### John Wesley:
1. "Every man is tempted, when - In the beginning of the temptation. He is drawn away - Drawn out of God, his strong refuge."
2. "By his own desire - We are therefore to look for the cause of every sin, in, not out of ourselves. Even the injections of the devil cannot hurt before we make them our own."
3. "And every one has desires arising from his own constitution, tempers, habits, and way of life. And enticed - In the progress of the temptation, catching at the bait."
