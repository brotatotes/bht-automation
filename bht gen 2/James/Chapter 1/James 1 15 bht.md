# James 1:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When our desires are indulged and nurtured, sin is conceived. It happens when we willingly yield to the allurements of temptation and entertain them in our thoughts. And though desire itself may not be sin, just as a father begets a child in his likeness, desire begets sin. Ultimately, sin, when fully matured, gives birth to death, yielding its fruits without hesitation or delay.

### Henry Alford:
1. "Then lust having conceived, bringeth forth sin: and sin, when completed, bringeth forth death." (δέ brings out the new subject) - The imagery is throughout consistent.
2. "The consequence is that she τίκτει ἁμαρτίαν, sin, in general, of some kind, of that kind to which the temptation inclines: then, ἡ ἁμαρτία, that particular sin, when grown up and mature, herself ἀποκύει, 'extrudit,' as if all along pregnant with it, Death, the final result of sin."
3. "So that temptation to sin cannot be from God, while trial is from Him. The one, being δοκίμιον ἡμῶν, κατεργάζεται ὑπομονήν · ἡ δὲ ὑπομονή, ἔργον τέλειον ἔχουσα, τὴν ζωήν: the other, being ἐξέλκυσις κ. δέλεαρ arising from ἐπιθυμία, τίκτει ἁμαρτίαν · ἡ δὲ ἁμαρτία ἀποτελεσθεῖσα ἀποκύει θάνατον."

2. "Or (2) Sin, figured as male, when it has reached maturity, becomes the begetter of death."
3. "The harlot, Lust, draws away and entices the man. The guilty union is committed by the will embracing the temptress: the consequence is that she beareth sin.... Then the sin, that particular sin, when grown up, herself, as if all along pregnant with it, bringeth forth death."

### John Calvin:

2. "Sin, when it is finished: being solicited, is agreed to, and actually committed."
3. "Every sin is deserving of death, death is the just wages of it; yea, even the motions of sin work in men to bring forth fruit unto death."

### John Wesley:
1. "Desire having conceived - By our own will joining therewith."
