# James 1:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God is the source of all good gifts, and He is free from any evil or temptation. We should be grateful for His countless blessings and attribute all glory to Him. Even in times of trial, our difficulties can be seen as tests that ultimately produce righteousness in us. As the Father of lights, God is the creator and maintainer of all that is excellent and glorious. He is unchanging in His nature, understanding, and dealings with humanity, always discerning between good and evil and loving the former while hating the latter.
