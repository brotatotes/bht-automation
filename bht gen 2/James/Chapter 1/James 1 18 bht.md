# James 1:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's will is the driving force behind our regeneration. It is through His love, freedom, and purity that we are brought forth as His children. This new life is a result of the word of truth, the gospel, which has the power to transform us from within. As Christians, we are like the first-fruits, set apart and consecrated for God's glory. Our regeneration is not a natural occurrence but a deliberate act of God's choice and grace. Through us, God sanctifies the rest of His creation, making us a testament to His goodness and love.
