# James 1:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When believers encounter various trials and tribulations, they are encouraged to consider it a great joy. These trials encompass not only temptations to sin but also afflictions and persecutions for the sake of the Gospel. The trials are not random occurrences but fall upon believers due to the wickedness and malice of their enemies. However, amidst these trials, believers can find joy because of the reward awaiting them in heaven. This calls for a steadfast attitude of joy, which is the highest form of patience and encompasses all other virtues.
