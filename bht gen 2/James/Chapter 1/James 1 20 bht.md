# James 1:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Man's angry zeal does not produce the righteousness that God desires. Instead of promoting peace and righteousness, it often leads to contention and strife. We must be cautious not to abuse the word of God, using it to fuel our own anger and disputes, as this does not further the righteousness of God. Let us approach the word and ordinances of God with a spirit of peace, seeking to fulfill the righteous duties prescribed by him.
