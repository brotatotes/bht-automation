# James 1:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Instead of merely hearing and acknowledging the word, we are called to actively engage with it, putting it into practice and living in accordance with its teachings. Merely listening is not enough, we must be transformed by the word. Those who deceive themselves by only hearing but not doing the word will find themselves greatly mistaken in the end.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But be ye (not, ‘become ye,’ any more than in Matthew 6:16; Matthew 10:16; Matthew 24:44; John 20:27; Romans 12:16. In all these places no other meaning will suit the context but simply “be ye:” with reference indeed to some future act by which the word γίνεσθαι gets its propriety; but ‘become’ in English carries a very different meaning, viz. that of change into the state mentioned from some other previous one, which is in none of these cases implied) doers of the word."
2. "Theile remarks well, 'Substantiva plus sonant quam participia;' the substantive ποιητής carries an enduring, a sort of official force with it: 'let this be your occupation.'"
3. "The 'hearer only' does this, when he infers that the mere sound of the word received in his outward ear will suffice for him. Cf. ἀπατῶν καρδίαν αὐτοῦ, James 1:26."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Be ye doers . . . not hearers only"; not merely "Do the word," but "Be doers" systematically and continually, as if this was your regular business.
2. James here again refers to the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 7:21-29).
3. "Deceiving your own selves—by the logical fallacy (the Greek implies this) that the mere hearing is all that is needed."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only - Obey the gospel, and do not merely listen to it." 
2. "It is implied here, that by merely hearing the word but not doing it, they would deceive their own souls."
3. "If a man supposes that by a mere punctual attendance on preaching, or a respectful attention to it, he has done all that is required of him, he is laboring under a most gross self-deception."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Deceiving [παραλογιζομενοι] . The deception referred to is, therefore, that into which one betrays himself by false reasoning - reasoning beside the truth."
2. "Hearers [ακροαται] . Used by James only."
3. "The deception referred to is, therefore, that into which one betrays himself by false reasoning - reasoning beside the truth."

### John Calvin:
1. "The doer here is not the same as in Romans 2:13, who satisfied the law of God and fulfilled it in every part, but the doer is he who from the heart embraces God’s word and testifies by his life that he really believes."
2. "Faith with all its works is included by James, yea, faith especially, as it is the chief work which God requires from us."
3. "We ought to labor that the word of the Lord should strike root in us, so that it may afterwards fructify."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The implanted word, or the word of truth, must be so heard and received as to produce a corresponding course of action."
2. "The hearing is in order to the doing; if this be wanting, the hearing is of no value."
3. "And of all deceptions, self-deception is the worst. If a man were deceived by others, it would be comparatively easy to undeceive him, by placing things in their true light."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "But be ye...Doers of the word." 
2. "Hearers...Deluding yourselves."

### John Gill:
1. "But be ye doers of the word...who submit to the ordinances it directs to, and keep them as they have been delivered; and live, and walk, becoming their profession of it." 
2. "The word should not be barely heard, and assented to; but what is heard should be put in practice."
3. "Such as rest upon the outward hearing of the word will be sadly deceived, and will find themselves miserably mistaken, another day."
