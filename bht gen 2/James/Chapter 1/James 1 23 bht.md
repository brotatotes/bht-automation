# James 1:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The scripture glass presents a revealing reflection of one's inner being, offering a profound glimpse at the state of one's soul. It is not enough to simply hear the word; one must also actively engage with it, putting its teachings into practice. This transformative process allows the mirror of God's word to guide and shape us, enabling us to become more like Him and reflecting His glory. Through careful contemplation of the scriptures, we are not only able to see our true selves but also witness the wondrous majesty of God Himself.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The true disciple, say the rabbis, learns in order that he may do, not in order that he may merely know or teach."
2. "As a man may behold his natural face in a mirror, so the hearer may perceive his moral visage in God's Word."
3. "This faithful portraiture of man's soul in Scripture, is the strongest proof of the truth of the latter. In it, too, we see mirrored God's glory, as well as our natural vileness."
