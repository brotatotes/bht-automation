# James 1:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A person looks briefly at themselves, but quickly moves on and completely forgets what they saw. This kind of forgetting cannot be used as an excuse.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He contemplated himself...and has departed...and immediately forgot of what appearance he was."
2. "The forgetting is also a permanent state; but the Apostle rather chooses in this case to bring out the act itself, as one immediately and suddenly taking place."
3. "It is to be observed that the κατανοεῖν answers to the hearing of the word: the ἀπεληλυθέναι to the relaxing the attention after hearing, letting the mind go elsewhere, and the interest of the thing heard pass away: and then the forgetfulness in both cases follows."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Contemplate" here, and in James 1:23, implies that, though cursory, yet some knowledge of one's self, at least for the time, is imparted in hearing the word (James 1:23- :).
2. "And... and"—The repetition expresses hastiness joined with levity [BENGEL].
3. "Forgetteth what manner of man he was—in the mirror. Forgetfulness is no excuse (James 1:25; 2 Peter 1:9)."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. He beholdeth [κατενοησεν] . The aorist tense, throwing the sentence into a lively, narrative form : he beheld himself and forgot. Compare ver. 11.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A man has seldom any true or accurate notion of his own features: from beholding himself in a glass or mirror, he retains no distinct recollection of what he has seen."
2. "No distinct impression is made on him; he cannot recall his own features."
3. "This most especially have been the case, when we take into consideration the imperfect nature of the mirrors of the ancients."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He glanced at himself and off he has gone and straightway forgot what sort of a man he was."
2. "The tenses thus present a vivid and lifelike picture of the careless listener to preaching."


### John Gill:
1. "He takes a slight glance of himself, and departs."
2. "He forgets either his spots, blemishes, and imperfections; or his comeliness and beauty."
3. "So a bare hearer of the word, who is not concerned to practise what he hears, while he is hearing, he observes some things amiss in himself, and some excellencies in Christ; but, when the discourse is over, he goes his way, and thinks no more of either."

### John Wesley:
1. He beheld himself, and went away — To other business.And forgot — But such forgetting does not excuse.
