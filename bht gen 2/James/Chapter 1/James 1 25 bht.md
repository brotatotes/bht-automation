# James 1:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who carefully examine and contemplate the Gospel, the perfect law of liberty, will be guarded against misconceptions about the law. The law of love brings true freedom, freeing us from the bondage of sin and making us righteous. It is in the active obedience to the will of God, not just passive hearing, that true happiness is found.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "the rule of life as revealed in the gospel, which is perfect and perfecting, but not in contrast with the former law as being not perfect, and not able to make perfect: that distinction is not in view here"
2. "the law of our liberty, not as in contrast with a former law of bondage, but as viewed on the side of its being the law of the new life and birth, with all its spontaneous and free development of obedience"
3. "the life of obedience is the element wherein the blessedness is found and consists"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "A blessed curiosity if it be efficacious in bearing fruit."
2. "The Gospel rule of life, perfect and perfecting."
3. "In the very doing there is blessedness."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The object is not to contrast the manner of looking in the glass, and in the law of liberty, implying that the former was a 'careless beholding,' and the latter an attentive and careful looking, as Doddridge, Rosenmuller, Bloomfield, and others suppose..."
2. "Referring to the law of God or his will, however made known, as the correct standard of conduct. It is called the perfect law, as being wholly free from all defects; being just such as a law ought to be."
3. "The meaning is, that he shall be blessed in the very act of keeping the law. It will produce peace of conscience; it will impart happiness of a high order to his mind; it will exert a good influence over his whole soul."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A more happy or forcible word could not have been chosen to express the nature and ultimate object of reflection, and to enforce the necessity of it, in order to discover the living fountain and spring - head of the evidence of the Christian faith in the believer himself, and at the same time to point out the seat and region where alone it is to be found" 
2. "The perfect law of liberty...the law of liberty is added as defining the perfect law"
3. "The life of obedience is the element wherein the blessedness is found and consists"

### John Calvin:
1. "The teaching of the law, let it no longer lead you to bondage, but, on the contrary, bring you to liberty; let it no longer be only a schoolmaster, but bring you to perfection: it ought to be received by you with sincere affection, so that you may lead a godly and a holy life."
2. "And, doubtless, he alone is the end and perfection of the law; and James adds liberty, as an inseparable associate, because the Spirit of Christ never regenerates but that he becomes also a witness and an earnest of our divine adoption, so as to free our hearts from fear and trembling."
3. "He means that blessedness is to be found in doing, not in cold hearing. The very doing of the law of liberty, of what the gospel prescribes, makes a man blessed or happy."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "whoso looketh into: literally, ‘stoopeth down to look into,’ representing the earnest inspection: ‘whoso fixedly contemplatech’ (comp. 1 Peter 1:12; John 20:5)." 
2. "The perfection which belongs to the Gospel is that it is ‘the law of liberty.’ This could not be said of the Mosaic law: in many respects, it was a law of bondage (Galatians 5:1)."
3. "The perfect law of liberty, then, is not lawlessness; on the contrary, it is holiness a disposition to obedience ‘the moral law transfigured by love.’"

2. "The law of liberty... rests on the work of Christ, whose truth sets us free."
3. "But a doer that worketh... not by mere listening or mere talk."

### John Gill:
1. "By which is meant, not the moral law, but the Gospel; for only of that is the apostle speaking in the context...this is compared to a glass by the Apostle Paul, 2 Corinthians 3:18..."
2. "This doctrine is as a glass to look into; in which is beheld the glory of Christ's person and office, and grace..."
3. "But a doer of the work; of the work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope, and of every work and ordinance the Gospel ministry points unto; doing and being subject to all in faith, from a principle of love, and with a view to the glory of God and Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "But he that looketh diligently... into the perfect law... guarding us against misunderstanding what St. Paul says concerning the 'yoke and bondage of the law.'" 
2. "He who keeps the law of love is free... He that does not, is a slave to sin and a criminal before God."
3. "Shall be happy... not merely in hearing, but doing the will of God."
