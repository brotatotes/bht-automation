# James 1:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A person may think they are religious, appearing to observe the external practices of worship, but if they fail to control their tongue and engage in gossip or slander, their religion is in vain. It is not the outward show of piety that defines true religion, but rather the impact it has on our conduct as a whole. Sinful speech contradicts the genuineness of one's religion, revealing that there is no true piety present. Let us be mindful of our words and ensure that our actions align with the principles of our faith.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "If any man imagines that he is religious, not bridling his tongue but deceiving his heart."
2. "This man, of whom the religious service is vain."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If any man think himself to be (so the Greek) religious, that is, observant of the offices of religion, let him know these consist not so much in outward observances, as in such acts of mercy and humble piety..."
2. "James does not mean that these offices are the great essentials, or sum total of religion but that, whereas the law service was merely ceremonial, the very services of the Gospel consist in acts of mercy and holiness..."
3. "Discretion in speech is better than fluency of speech... God alone can enable us to do so. James, in treating of the law, naturally notices this sin."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A man may undoubtedly have many things in his character which seem to be evidences of the existence of religion in his heart, and yet there may be some one thing that shall show that all those evidences are false."
2. "Religion is designed to produce an effect on our whole conduct; and if there is any one thing in reference to which it does not bring us under its control, that one thing may show that all other appearances of piety are worthless."
3. "A single unsubdued sinful propensity neutralizes all these things, and shows that there is no true religion."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A man can scarcely seem to be religious, when, as Trench observes, 'his religious pretensions are belied and refuted by the allowance of an unbridled tongue.'" 
2. "The derivation is uncertain. Qreomai, to mutter forms of prayer, has been suggested, as the followers of Wycliffe were called Lollards, from the old Dutch lullen or lollen, to sing."
3. "Hence the adjective here refers to a zealous and diligent performance of religious services."

### John Calvin:
1. "He now reproves even in those who boasted that they were doers of the law, a vice under which hypocrites commonly labor, that is, the wantonness of the tongue in detraction."
2. "He who is neither an adulterer, nor a thief, nor a drunkard, but, on the contrary, seems brilliant with some outward show of sanctity will set himself off by defaming others, and this under the pretense of zeal, but really through the lust of slandering."
3. "For by saying that his religion is vain, he not only intimates that other virtues are marred by the stain of evil-speaking, but that the conclusion is, that the zeal for religion which appears is not sincere."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The words denote the false opinion which a man has of himself; the false estimate which he has formed of his religion." 
2. "To be religious, in the sense of our verse, is to be a diligent observer of the external forms of worship: ‘If any man among you think that he is observant of religious service,’ that he is a true worshipper of God." 
3. "This man’s religion, religious service or worship,  is vain  of no value in the sight of God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Θρησκος refers to the external observances of public worship, such as church attendance, almsgiving, prayer, fasting."
2. "The picture is that of a man putting the bridle in his own mouth, not in that of another."
3. "Religion means religious worship in its external observances, religious exercise or discipline, but not to the exclusion of reverence. It is vain or empty."

### John Gill:
1. "If any man among you seem to be religious...and bridleth not his tongue; but boasts of his works...this man's religion is vain."
2. "Who takes no care of what he says...and gives his tongue a liberty of speaking anything...this man's religion is vain."
3. "All his preaching, praying, hearing, and attendance on the ordinances will be of no avail to him...by his evil tongue, brings a scandal and reproach upon the ways of God, and doctrines of Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "If any one be ever so religious...and bridleth not his tongue...he only deceiveth his own heart, if he fancies he has any true religion at all."
