# James 1:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Pure and undefiled religion is one that is genuine and sincere, free from any improper mixture. It is not merely about outward ceremonies, but about actively and practically caring for those in need, such as the fatherless and widows. Alongside this compassionate service, true religion also involves maintaining personal purity, avoiding the influence and contamination of the world and its ways. This is the kind of religion that is pleasing and acceptable to God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Religious service pure and unpolluted in the estimation of Him who is our God and Father."
2. "To visit orphans and widows in their affliction."
3. "To preserve himself unspotted from the world."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Pure" expresses the positive, "undefiled" the negative side of religious service; just as visiting the fatherless and widow is the active, keeping himself unspotted from the world, the passive side of religious duty. This is the nobler shape that our religious exercises take, instead of the ceremonial offices of the law. 
2. God is so called to imply that if we would be like our Father, it is not by fasting, etc., but in being "merciful as our Father is merciful".
3. Religion in its rise interests us about ourselves, in its progress about our fellow creatures, and in its highest stage, about the honor of God.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The two adjectives, pure and undefiled, present the positive and negative sides of purity."

3. "Unspotted [ασπιλον]. See on 1 Peter 1:19."

### John Calvin:
1. "Religion without the things he mentions is nothing."
2. "James then teaches us that religion is not to be estimated by the pomp of ceremonies; but that there are important duties to which the servants of God ought to attend."
