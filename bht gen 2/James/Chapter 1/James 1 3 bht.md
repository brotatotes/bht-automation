# James 1:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Trials test our faith and produce patience, as it is through the trying of our faith that we develop endurance. Afflictions, when sanctified by God, serve as a means to refine and strengthen our faith, ultimately leading to the fruit of patience. This process of testing and purifying our faith is necessary for our spiritual growth and development.
