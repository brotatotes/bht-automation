## BHT:
In facing trials, it is important to allow patience to fully develop and produce its intended effects. Patience is not merely a show, but genuine and sincere endurance. By persevering through hardships until the end, we can be perfected and complete in our character, lacking in nothing that God requires of us. Through this process, we are adorned with every Christian grace, demonstrating the maturity and completeness of our faith.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Let endurance have a perfect work." 
2. "The allusion seems to be to our Lord's saying... So that the words are to be taken simply and literally; ὑπομονή as the abstract, endurance, and ἔργον as the work wrought out by ὑπομονή in its continuance."
3. "The purpose of that work is, to make as perfect and entire, deficient in nothing."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Let endurance have a perfect work...showing the most perfect degree of endurance, namely, 'joy in bearing the cross'." (taken out of the previous "worketh patience" or endurance)
2. "The work of God in a man is the man. If God's teachings by patience have had a perfect work in you, you are perfect."
3. "Entire—that which has all its parts complete, wanting no integral part."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Let patience have her perfect work - Let it be fairly developed; let it produce its appropriate effects without being hindered."
2. "Afflictions, perhaps more than anything else, will do this, and we should therefore allow them to do all that they are adapted to do in developing what is good in us."
3. "The idea here is, that it is desirable not only to have the elements or principles of piety in the soul, but to have them fairly carried out, so as to show what is their real tendency and value."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The man himself is characterized from his condition and work." 
2. "Perfect and entire...denotes that which has reached its maturity or fulfilled the end contemplated."

3. "The first refers to the maturity of grace; and the second to its completeness, no grace being wanting."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Patience under trials has preeminently a sanctifying tendency. The most perfect Christians are not the most active, but the most enduring; not so much in the bustle of the world is the work of grace carried on, as in the quietness of the sick-chamber."
2. "'The work of God in a man,' as Dean Alford observes, 'is the man. If God’s teaching by patience have had a perfect work in you, you are perfect.' Of course by this cannot be meant absolute perfection; the word denotes maturity in grace, not absolute but relative holiness."
3. "Perfect and entire are almost synonymous terms; perfect denotes that which has attained to its maturity, entire that which is complete in all its parts."

3. "Lacking in nothing" (εν μηδεν λειπομενο) as a negative statement of the preceding positive as often in James.

### John Gill:
1. "Patience may be said to be perfect, when it appears to be real and sincere, and not dissembled; for as there may be a feigned faith, a dissembled love, and an hypocritical hope, so likewise a mere show of patience."
2. "And this phrase may also design the constant exercise of this grace to the end; for he that endures, or is patient, and continues so unto the end, shall be saved, and enjoy that perfection of glory and happiness expressed in the next clause."
3. "When patience has had its perfect work, and has been tried to the uttermost, and is found right, and has held out to the end; then shall the saints be perfect in holiness and happiness, and be entire, whole, and complete."

### John Wesley:
1. "Let patience have its perfect work — Give it full scope, under whatever trials befall you."
2. "That ye may be perfect and entire — Adorned with every Christian grace."
3. "And wanting nothing — Which God requires in you."
