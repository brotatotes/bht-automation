# James 1:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let us approach God with unwavering faith, fully persuaded that He is able and willing to give us what we ask for. Doubt, on the other hand, stems from pride and leads to instability. When we doubt, we are like waves of the sea, driven by the wind and tossed about. Thus, we must come to God with settled convictions, steadfast in our belief that He will grant our requests. May we not waver, but instead have complete confidence in God's promises and His love towards us.
