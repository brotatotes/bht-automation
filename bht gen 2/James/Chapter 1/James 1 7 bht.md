## BHT:
That man, who lacks faith, cannot expect to receive anything from the Lord. Without true faith, he cannot receive the grace and blessings that come from God. The doubter should not deceive himself into thinking that he will receive anything from the Lord, for it is faith that allows us to receive from Him. May we always approach God with steadfast faith and trust in His promises.
