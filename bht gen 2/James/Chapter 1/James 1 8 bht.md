1. "Man. Instead of a general term in verse James 1:7, perhaps for variety, but often in James, though in other Epistles usually in distinction from woman." 
2. "Double-minded. First appearance of this compound known and in N.T. only here and James 4:8. Apparently coined by James, but copied often in early Christian writings and so an argument for the early date of James' Epistle." 
3. "Unstable. Late double compound, it means unsteady, fickle, staggering, reeling like a drunken man. Surely to James such 'doubt' is no mark of intellectuality."
