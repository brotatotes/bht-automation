# James 1:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The brother, in this context, refers to those who are spiritually connected to Christ, rather than simply being related by blood. Of low degree highlights the condition of poverty and affliction that these individuals may face. Instead of becoming double-minded, they are encouraged to rejoice in their exalted state as children of God and heirs of glory. This rejoicing serves as a powerful remedy against double-mindedness, demonstrating their trust in God's grace and provision.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We must not pray before God, we must not be before God, double-minded; in our trials, we shall get no heavenly wisdom, if this is so."
2. "This double-mindedness, one soul drawn upwards to God, the other drawn downwards to the world, causes nothing but instability, and cannot result in that joy which is to be our attitude in trial."
3. "The poor and humble forget the exceeding honour thus done to them, which ought to be to them ground of boasting, far more worthy than the rich in this world have in their riches which shall so soon fade away."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The best remedy against double-mindedness is that Christian simplicity of spirit whereby the 'brother'... may 'rejoice' in that he is exalted."
2. "The rich may rejoice 'in that he is made low,' by being stripped of his goods for Christ's sake."
3. "The design of the Epistle is to reduce all things to an equable footing."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Wherever change occurs in the external circumstances of life, there a man’s religion is put to the test, and there he should feel that God is trying the reality of his faith."
2. "There is almost no trial of religion which is more certain and decisive than that furnished by a sudden transition from poverty to affluence, from adversity to prosperity, from sickness to health."
3. "The most important thing conceivable for us is to know whether we are true Christians, and we should rejoice in everything that will enable us to settle this point."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The brother of low degree [ο αδελφος ο ταπεινος] . Lit., the brother, the lowly one. Not in the higher Christian sense of tapeinov (see on Matthew 11:29), but, rather, poor and afflicted, as contrasted with rich."
2. "Rejoice [ανθος] . Not strong enough. It is, rather, boast. So Rev., glory. Compare Romans 5:3; Philippians 3:3."
3. "In that he is exalted [εν τω υψει αυτου] . Lit., in his exaltation. Rev., in his high estate."

### John Calvin:
1. "Set before them this consolation, that they were the free-men of God, having been set free by his grace from the most miserable bondage of Satan."
2. "He forbids the rich to be proud...he who estimates this favor of God aright, will regard all other things as worthless."
3. "Behold, how a lowly brother ought to glory in his elevation or exaltation; for if he be accepted of God, he has sufficient consolation in his adoption alone, so as not to grieve unduly for a less prosperous state of life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We must avoid all doubting of God in prayer, all double-mindedness; we must exercise confidence in Him, and realize His gracious dealings in all the dispensations of His Providence..." 
2. "Whether rich or poor, we must place implicit trust in Him."
3. "Let the poor brother rejoice in the dignity and glory which as a Christian he possesses, in those spiritual riches which are conferred upon him, and in the crown of life which is in reserve for him."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The lowly" brother, in outward condition (Luke 1:52), humble and poor as in Psalms 9:39; Proverbs 30:14, not the spiritually humble as in Matthew 11:29; James 4:6.
2. In the LXX ταπεινος was used for either the poor in goods or the poor in spirit. Christianity has glorified this word in both senses.
3. Paradox, but true. In his low estate he is "in his height" (υψος, old word, in N.T., also in Luke 1:78; Ephesians 3:1; etc.).

### John Gill:
1. "By 'the brother' is meant, not one in a natural, but in a spiritual relation; one of Christ's brethren, and who is of that family that is named of him..."
2. "...but his outward state and condition, being, as to the things of this world, poor, and mean in his outward circumstances, and so humbled and afflicted."
3. "...this height of honour and grandeur, of which he may boast and glory, amidst his outward poverty, lies in his high birth and descent, being born from above, and of God, and belonging to his family..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Let the brother — St James does not give this appellation to the rich." 
2. "Of low degree — Poor and tempted." 
3. "Rejoice — The most effectual remedy against doublemindedness. In that he is exalted — To be a child of God, and an heir of glory."
