# James 2:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The sin being addressed here is the practice of showing partiality or favoritism based on outward circumstances. Such conduct goes against the faith of Christ, which emphasizes the equality of all believers. True service to God involves active benevolence towards others, particularly the poor and afflicted. In Christ, believers share in the glory of the Lord, and therefore should not discriminate or treat others with neglect or contempt. This admonition reminds us to honor and respect all individuals, regardless of their social standing, as we are all part of the family of God.
