# James 2:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If someone keeps the entire law except in one point, they bear the guilt of breaking the whole law. This is because the law is an indivisible whole, where violation of one commandment is an offense against the entirety of God's law. Thus, no one can claim righteousness solely based on their obedience to certain parts of the law while neglecting others. We are all subject to judgment and in need of God's grace.

### Marvin Vincent:
