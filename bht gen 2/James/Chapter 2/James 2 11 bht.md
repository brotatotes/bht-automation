# James 2:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The unity of the law is seen in the fact that the same authority establishes every commandment. Whether it is the commandment against adultery or the commandment against murder, they both originate from the same Lawgiver. Therefore, if one violates any of these commandments, they are transgressing the entire law. The law is not meant to be fragmented, but to be obeyed in its entirety.
