# James 2:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who do not show mercy to others will face judgment without mercy. This means that strict justice will be applied to them without any leniency. On the other hand, those who have shown mercy to others can rejoice in the view of the judgment, knowing that they will obtain mercy on that day. The mercy of God towards believers, which is in response to the mercy they have shown, will triumph over judgment.
