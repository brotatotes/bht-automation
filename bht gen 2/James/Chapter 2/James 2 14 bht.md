# James 2:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Faith alone without works is empty and unprofitable. The message James conveys is not at odds with the teachings of other apostles. Rather, he emphasizes the need for true, living faith that is accompanied by good works. There is a distinction between a dead, superficial faith and genuine faith that produces fruits of love. James does not pit faith against works, but rather highlights the insufficiency of a mere profession of faith without the evidence of a transformed life. True faith is not just a belief, but an active and transformative force.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "Can his faith save him?"
3. "Here, and not in λέγῃ, nor in ἡ πίστις, lies the true key to the nullity of the faith in question."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "James here...combats the Jewish tendency...to substitute a lifeless, inoperative acquaintance with the letter of the law, for change of heart to practical holiness, as if justification could be thereby attained."
2. "What doth it profit...though a man say...referring to a mere profession of faith, such as was usually made at baptism...the empty name of boasted faith, contrasted with true fruit-producing faith."
3. "The 'him' also in the Greek is emphatic; the particular man who professes faith without having the works which evidence its vitality."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He doubtless had in his eye those who abused the doctrine of justification by faith, by holding that good works are unnecessary to salvation, provided they maintain an orthodox belief."
2. "The apostle, therefore, in the question before us, implicitly asserts that faith would not 'profit' at all unless accompanied with a holy life."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. What doth it profit ? [τι το οφελος] . Lit., what is the profit ? Ofelov, profit, only here, ver. 16, and 1 Corinthians 14:32.

### John Calvin:
1. "The sum, then, of what is said is, that faith without love avails nothing, and that it is therefore wholly dead."
2. "James then, as he was satisfied that it was a false pretext by which hypocrites covered themselves, was not disposed to raise a dispute about a word or an expression."
3. "Salvation comes to us by faith... because it joins us to God. And this comes not in any other way than by being united to the body of Christ, so that, living through his Spirit, we are also governed by him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "James carefully separates appearance and reality from each other the shadow from the substance."

3. "James admits the existence of a speculative faith; the man is supposed to have faith of a certain kind, though not saving faith."

2. "True faith indeed has no causal influence on salvation, or has any virtue and efficacy in itself to save."
3. "As for the other faith, a man may have it, and be in the gall of bitterness, and bond of iniquity; he may have all faith in that sense, and be nothing; it is no other than the devils themselves have; and so he may have it, and be damned."

### John Wesley:
1. "There is, therefore, no contradiction between the apostles: they both delivered the truth of God, but in a different manner, as having to do with different kinds of men."
2. "Here, therefore, true, living faith is meant: but in other parts of the argument the apostle speaks of a dead, imaginary faith."
3. "He does not, therefore, teach that true faith can, but that it cannot, subsist without works: nor does he oppose faith to works; but that empty name of faith, to real faith working by love."
