# James 2:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If a fellow believer is found in a destitute and hungry condition, lacking even the basic necessities for survival, it is essential for us to show compassion and provide assistance. James uses the example of physical needs to highlight the importance of not just faith, but also corresponding actions. Like words without action are futile, a faith devoid of works is empty and cannot save. It is not enough to simply acknowledge the need, we must be actively involved in meeting the needs of our brothers and sisters, fulfilling our duty as members of the body of Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But if a brother or sister be naked and destitute of daily food..."
2. "Extreme destitution and nakedness in the literal, or almost literal sense, might well go together."
3. "[The phrase] daily food [refers to] the food for each day."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But if," taking up the argument against such a one as "said he had faith, and yet had not works," which are its fruits.
2. "A brother," a fellow Christian, to whom we are specially bound to give help, independent of our general obligation to help all our fellow creatures.
3. "Be found, on your access to them."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The verb uJparcw originally means to make a beginning; hence, to begin or to come into being; and, though used substantially as a synonym of einai, of a thing actually existing and at hand, it has a backward look to an antecedent condition which has been protracted into the present."
2. "Thus we might paraphrase here, 'If a brother or sister, having been in a destitute condition, be found by you in that condition.'"
3. "Destitute [λειπομενοι] . Lit., left behind; and hence lacking, as Rev. Compare ch. 1 4, 5. This usage of the word occurs in James only."

### John Calvin:
1. "If any one...boasted that he was satisfied with faith without works, he compares this shadowy faith to the saying of one who bids a famished man to be filled without supplying him with the food of which he is destitute."
2. "As, then, he who sends away a poor man with words, and offers him no help, treats him with mockery, so they who devise for themselves faith without works, and without any of the duties of religion, trifle with God."
3. "This is adduced as an illustration: as the saying of a man to the naked, 'Be ye clothed,' when he does nothing, effects no good, is wholly useless, so is that faith that produces no works; it being as it were dead, it cannot save."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To prove the uselessness of a barren faith, the apostle illustrates the subject by showing the uselessness of a barren charity, which every one will at once admit."
2. "Love is the indispensable attendant on a living faith, the instrument by which it works."
3. "If a brother or sister, a Christian brother or sister, a fellow-believer, bringing forward more strongly our duty to assist them, and our culpability if we refuse such assistance."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It does not here mean absolutely naked, but without sufficient clothing as in Matthew 25:36; John 21:7; Acts 19:16."
2. "Present passive participle of λειπω and ablative case τροφης like λειπετα σοφιας (James 1:5)."
3. "The old adjective εφημερος (ο επ ημεραν ων, that which is for a day) occurs here only in the N.T., though εφημερια (daily routine) is found in Luke 1:5; Luke 1:8."

### John Gill:
1. "A Christian man or woman, a fellow member of a church of Christ; for this relation is to be understood in a spiritual sense."
