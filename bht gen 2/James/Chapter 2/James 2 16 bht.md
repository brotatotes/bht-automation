# James 2:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Instead of just offering kind wishes and words of farewell, Jesus teaches us to go beyond mere sentiments and actively bless others. It is not enough to say go in peace, be warmed and filled, while neglecting to provide for the physical needs of those in need. We must accompany our words with actions, offering necessary provisions and practical care. The apostle highlights the emptiness of kind professions without corresponding acts, emphasizing that both charity and faith must be demonstrated through works to be truly beneficial.

3. "And the apostle, by this instance, shows, that as that charity which lies only in words, and in tongue, and not in deed, and in truth, is unprofitable, and good for nothing, even to them that profess it; so that faith, which a man says he has, and yet is without works, is alike unprofitable unto him."
