# James 2:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Faith without works is compared to a lifeless carcass, a body without a soul, and a dead, empty notion. It is of no true value and profit, just as merely bidding the naked be clothed is of no practical benefit. Good works are the necessary evidence and manifestation of a living, active faith, revealing the true nature of believers who have been regenerated.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "So also faith, if it have not works, is dead...in itself." 
2. "The quasi-identification of the πίστις with the man, and ascription of the ἔργα to it as a possession, show in what relative places the two stand in the Apostle's estimate."
3. "It is dead, not merely 'ad rem,' as Plaut...but absolutely, καθʼ ἑαυτήν, in itself: has no living root whereby it energizes."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If the works which living faith produces have no existence, it is a proof that faith itself (literally, 'in respect to itself') has no existence; that is, that what one boasts of as faith, is dead."
2. "Faith" is said to be "dead in itself," because when it has works it is alive, and it is discerned to be so, not in respect to its works, but in respect to itself.
3. "Even so presumed faith, if it have not works, is dead, being by itself 'alone,' that is, severed from works of charity; just as the body would be 'dead' if alone, that is, severed from the spirit."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Being alone [καθ εαυτην] . Wrong. Rev., correctly, in itself. The phrase belongs to dead. It is dead, not merely in reference to something else, but absolutely.

### John Calvin:
1. "He says that faith is dead, being by itself, that is, when destitute of good works."
2. "We hence conclude that it is indeed no faith, for when dead, it does not properly retain the name."
3. "It is sufficiently evident that the Apostle reasons from what is impossible."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "As this love, which merely expends itself in kind words and wishes, is of no value; so neither is the faith of him who professes to believe the Gospel, yet walks not up to his profession." 
2. "From this it is evident that by works is not meant merely something which is added to faith, but something which proceeds from it; as life is seen by its actions, so is faith by its works."
3. "More correctly rendered they are ‘by itself’ denoting that a simple assent is useless, or rather ‘in itself,’ i.e is wholly and completely dead has no living root which might spring up."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "If it keep on not having works."
2. "In and of itself (according to itself), inwardly and outwardly dead."

### John Gill:
1. "Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone. It is like a lifeless carcass, a body without a soul." 
2. "Works, without faith, are dead works, so faith, without works, is a dead faith, and not like the lively hope and faith of regenerated persons." 
3. "Good works are second acts, necessarily flowing from the life of faith; to which may be added, and by these faith appears to be living, lively and active, or such who perform them appear to be true and living believers."

### John Wesley:
1. "So likewise that faith which hath not works is a mere dead, empty notion."
2. "Of no more profit to him that hath it, than the bidding the naked be clothed is to him."
