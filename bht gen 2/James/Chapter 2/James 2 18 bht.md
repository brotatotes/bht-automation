# James 2:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Faith is not simply a matter of words or beliefs, but it is demonstrated through actions. It is not enough to claim to have faith; it must be evident through the works that we do. Our faith cannot be separate from our works, for they go hand in hand. Words alone cannot prove the reality of our faith; it is the visible manifestation of our works that truly reveals the authenticity of our faith. So, let us not just talk about our faith, but let us live it out and show it through the good works we do.
