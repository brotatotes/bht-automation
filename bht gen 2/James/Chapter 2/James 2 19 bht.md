# James 2:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believing in the existence of one God is commendable, but it is essential to recognize that this belief alone is shared by demons. What distinguishes them is not just their belief, but also their trembling in fear at the thought of judgment. Mere intellectual assent is not sufficient for salvation. We need a faith that goes beyond knowledge and leads to obedience. It is through obedience and transformation that our faith becomes meaningful and effective in our lives.
