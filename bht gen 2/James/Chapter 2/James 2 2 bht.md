# James 2:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The presence of a man adorned with gold rings signifies his elevated position and prosperity. His extravagant display of wealth is in stark contrast to the presence of a poor man who is dressed in ragged, unimpressive clothing. This stark contrast between the two individuals emphasizes not only the stark difference in their outward appearances but also highlights the vast disparity in their social statuses. It serves as a poignant reminder of the socioeconomic diversity that exists within society.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The word may well be understood of a Christian assembly, so in Test. XII. Patrum, p. 747, ἐν ταῖς συναγωγαῖς τῶν ἐθνῶν, or as merely an assembly in general, cf. ref. Heb., μὴ ἐγκαταλείποντες τὴν ἐπισυναγωγὴν ἑαυτῶν."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Church, a people bound together by mutual ties and laws, though often it may happen that the members are not assembled." 
2. "The introduction of this custom into Jewish Christian places of worship is here reprobated by James."
3. "This shows the error of comparing the Church to the temple, and the ministry to the priesthood; the temple is represented by the whole body of worshippers; the church building was formed on the model of the synagogue."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'synagogue' (συναγωγὴν sunagōgēn) would properly refer to the whole congregation, considered as 'assembled together,' without respect to the question whether all were truly pious or not; the word 'church' (ἐκκλησία ekklēsia) would refer to the assembly convened for worship as called out, referring to the fact that they were called out from the world, and convened as worshippers of God..."
2. "It is probable that the Christian church was modelled, in its general arrangements, after the Jewish synagogue; but there would be obviously some disadvantages in retaining the name, as applicable to Christian worship."
3. "A man with a gold ring - Indicative of rank or property. Rings were common ornaments of the rich; and probably then, as now, of those who desired to be esteemed to be rich."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word synagogue is a transcript of this. From sun, together, and agw, to bring. Hence, literally, a gathering or congregation..."
2. "Not a man wearing a single gold ring (as A. V. and Rev.), which would not attract attention in an assembly where most persons wore a ring, but a gold - ringed man, having his hands conspicuously loaded with rings and jewels."
3. "The ring was regarded as an indispensable article of a Hebrew's attire, since it contained his signet; and the name of the ring, tabbath, was derived from a root signifying to impress a seal."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The reference is undoubtedly to the Christian places of assembly, for worship."
2. "Such rings could only be worn by free citizens, and were consequently a symbol of rank or riches."
3. "Into their place for religious assembly two men entered, the one gorgeously arrayed with jewelled fingers and a great display of riches; the other a poor man in shabby apparel, soiled with his daily manual occupations."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Here the first [meaning of synagogue] is the probable meaning as it clearly is in Hebrews 10:25 (την επισυναγωγην εαυτων), where the longer compound occurs."
2. "A man with a gold ring (ανηρ χρυσοδακτυλιος). 'A gold-fingered man,' 'wearing a gold ring.'"
3. "In bright (brilliant) clothing as in Luke 23:11; Acts 10:30; Revelation 18:41."

### John Gill:
1. "A man with a gold ring; on his finger, which shows him to be a man of dignity and wealth."
2. "In goodly apparel; gay clothing, bright shining garments, glistering with gold and silver, very rich and costly, as well as whole, neat, and clean."
3. "And there come in also a poor man in vile raiment; mean and despicable, filthy and ragged."

### John Wesley:
1. With gold rings — Which were not then so common as now.
