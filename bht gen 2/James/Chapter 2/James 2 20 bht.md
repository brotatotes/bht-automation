# James 2:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Thou wouldest fain be ignorant that faith without works is idle, useless, and unprofitable. Vain and empty men, who are puffed up with pride, often deceive themselves with a delusive hope, resting on an unreal faith. The apostle James introduces the argument that true faith is always accompanied by works, as exemplified by the actions of Abraham and Rahab. Those who try to prove that man is justified by works from this passage miss the point entirely. True faith is active and alive, producing good works, and is demonstrated and known by its fruitfulness.
