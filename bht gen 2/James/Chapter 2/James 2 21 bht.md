# James 2:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Abraham's justification by works does not contradict the teaching that he was justified by faith. The works serve as evidence of genuine faith, showing the real impact of Abraham's faith in his life. His act of offering Isaac was a significant display of obedience and a demonstration of his faith and love for God. James and Paul are not in conflict; James focuses on the connection between faith and works, affirming that true faith produces good works. Therefore, Abraham's faith was genuine and manifested through his works, showing his justification before God.

### Henry Alford:
1. "Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered Isaac his son at the altar?"
2. "The Apostle and his readers being all Jews, [Abraham] justified by works, the category to which the ground of his justification belonged."
3. "Not, as E.V., al., 'had offered:' the aor. part., as so often, is synchronous with the aor. itself in the same sentence. ·ºÄŒΩŒ±œÜŒ≠œÅœâ in this reference with ·ºêœÄŒØ is not ‚Äòto offer up in sacrifice,‚Äô but simply to offer, to bring as a sacrifice to the altar: whether the entire ‚Äòoffering up‚Äô takes place or not."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Abraham... justified by works‚Äîevidentially, and before men... In James 2:23, James, like Paul, recognizes the Scripture truth, that it was his faith that was counted to Abraham for righteousness in his justification before God." 
2. "When he had offered‚Äîrather, "when he offered," that is, brought as an offering at the altar; not implying that he actually offered him."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The point on which the apostle has his eye is the nature of saving faith; and his design is to show that a mere faith which would produce no more effect than that of the demons did, could not save." 
2. "The evidence to which he appeals in regard to faith, is good works and a holy life; and where that exists it shows that the faith is genuine."
3. "This demonstrates that what the apostle refers to here is the evidence by which it is shown that a man‚Äôs faith is genuine, and that he does not refer to the question whether the act of justification, where a sinner is converted, is solely in consequence of believing."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The participle states the ground of his justification."
2. "By works gives the general ground; offered, etc., the specific work."
3. "The word ajnenegkav is, lit., brought up to; and means, not actually to offer up in sacrifice (though Isaac was morally sacrificed in Abraham 's will), but to bring to the altar as an offering."

### John Calvin:
1. "James does not speak here of the cause of justification, or of the manner how men obtain righteousness...his object was only to shew that good works are always connected with faith." 
2. "James has quite another thing in view, even to shew that he who professes that he has faith, must prove the reality of his faith by his works."
3. "In this sense we fully allow that man is justified by works, as when any one says that a man is enriched by the purchase of a large and valuable chest, because his riches, before hid, shut up in a chest, were thus made known."
