# James 2:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By works, faith is brought to its full manifestation and development, proving its genuineness. The combination of faith and works is evident, showing that true faith will always produce good deeds. Abraham's obedience in offering Isaac was a clear demonstration of his lively and active faith, verifying his justification. The completion of faith through works does not mean that works bring salvation, but rather that they serve as evidence of a living and active faith. This illustrates the inseparable relationship between faith and obedience, emphasizing the necessity of both for a mature and complete Christian character.
