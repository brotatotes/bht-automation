# James 2:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Abraham's faith was fully realized through his obedience and willingness to offer up Isaac. This act proved the genuineness of his faith and fulfilled the scriptural declaration that he believed God. His faith was imputed to him for righteousness, making him the friend of God. This title continues to hold significance among Jews and Muslims. The works he performed in faith were pleasing to God, as evidenced by his designation as the friend of God by both his descendants and God Himself.

### Henry Alford:
1. "Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness."

3. "He was called God's friend, 'amatus a Deo,' not 'amans Deum.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "James must mean by works the same thing as Paul means by faith, only that he speaks of faith at its manifested development, whereas Paul speaks of it in its germ."
2. "Abraham's offering of Isaac was not a mere act of obedience, but an act of faith."
3. "The 'Scripture' would not be 'fulfilled,' as James says it was, but contradicted by any interpretation which makes man's works justify him before God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The fair meaning of the declaration that he believed God was carried out in the subsequent act."
2. "His faith was shown to be genuine; and the fair meaning of the declaration that he believed God was carried out in the subsequent act."
3. "His act showed that the declaration of the Scripture that he 'believed' was well founded."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Was fulfilled [ŒµœÄŒªŒ∑œÅœâŒ∏Œ∑] . Not was confirmed, which the word does not mean either in New - Testament or in classical usage, but was actually and fully realized."
2. "Imputed [ŒµŒªŒøŒ≥ŒπœÉŒ∏Œ∑] . Lit., as Rev., reckoned. He was called the friend of God. The term, however, does not occur either in the Hebrew or Septuagint, though it is found in the A. V. and retained in Rev. Old Testament."
3. " 'The friend of God' is still the favorite title of Abraham among the Jews and Mohammedans."

### John Calvin:
1. "The imputation of righteousness which Moses mentions, preceded more than thirty years the work by which they would have Abraham to have been justified."
2. "Why then does James say that it was fulfilled? Even because he intended to shew what sort of faith that was which justified Abraham; that is, that it was not idle or evanescent, but rendered him obedient to God, as also we find in Hebrews 11:8."
3. "Man is not justified by faith alone, that is, by a bare and empty knowledge of God; he is justified by works, that is, his righteousness is known and proved by its fruits."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This great act of obedience on the part of Abraham was a proof of the fulfilment of the scriptural declaration made concerning him."
2. "It is therefore evident that this act of obedience was not the cause of Abraham‚Äôs justification; but, because it proved that Abraham was possessed of a living faith, it fulfilled the words of Scripture."
3. "Abraham was the Beloved of God...this is still the favorite description of Abraham, both by the Jews and by the Mahometans."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "James quotes Genesis 15:6 as proving his point in verse James 2:21 that Abraham had works with his faith, the very same passage that Paul quotes in Romans 4:3 to show that Abraham's faith preceded his circumcision and was the basis of his justification."
2. "And both James and Paul are right, each to illustrate a different point."
3. "Philo calls Abraham the friend of God and see Jubilees 19:9; 30:20. The Arabs today speak of Abraham as God's friend. It was evidently a common description before James used it, as in Isaiah 41:8; 2 Chronicles 20:7."

### John Gill:
1. "By this it was made known what a strong faith he had in God, and what reason there was to believe that he was a justified person."
2. "His justification was by faith, or that object which his faith regarded, and had to do with, was his justifying righteousness."

### John Wesley:
1. "Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness - This was twice fulfilled, - when Abraham first believed, and when he offered up Isaac." 
2. "He was called the Friend of God - Both by his posterity, 2 Chronicles 20:7; and by God himself, Isaiah 41:8 so pleasing to God were the works he wrought in faith."
