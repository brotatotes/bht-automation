# James 2:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Works are not the cause or condition of justification, but rather the evidence and expression of a true and living faith. Both Paul and James emphasize that faith and works go hand in hand, but in different contexts. Paul speaks of justification before God, while James speaks of the evidence of faith seen by others. So, it's crucial to understand that they are not speaking of the same faith or the same works. Faith without works is dead, and true faith is demonstrated through its fruitfulness in good works.
