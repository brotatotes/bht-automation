### Henry Alford:
1. "Ne se causarentur opera tanti patris Abrah√¶ imitari non valere, pr√¶sertim cum nullus eos modo cogeret Deo filios offerre perimendos, ‚Ä¶ addit et mulieris exemplum, mulieris criminos√¶, mulieris alienigen√¶, qu√¶ tamen per opera misericordi√¶, per officium hospitalitatis, etiam cum periculo vit√¶ su√¶ Dei famulis exhibitum, justificari a peccatis meruit"
2. "Abrahami exemplum Hebr√¶is ad Christum conversis sufficere debebat, sed quia etiam alienigenis scribebat, adjunxit exemplum f≈ìmin√¶ extrane√¶"
3. "Post virum ponitur mulier: nam viros et mulieres appellat," ch. James 4:4 (see note there)

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is clear from the nature of Rahab's act, that it is not quoted to prove justification by works as such."
2. "In this belief she hid the spies at the risk of her life. Hence James names this as an example of faith, rather than of obedience."
3. "But as an example of free grace justifying men through an operative, as opposed to a mere verbal faith, none could be more suitable than a saved 'harlot.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Her act showed that she truly believed God. If that act had not been performed, the fact would have shown that her faith was not genuine, and she could not have been justified." 
2. "The act which she performed was the public manifestation of her faith, the evidence that she was justified."
3. "When we commend the faith of a man who has been a profane swearer, or an adulterer, or a robber, or a drunkard, we do not commend his former life, or give a sanction to it. We commend that which has induced him to abandon his evil course, and to turn to the ways of righteousness."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Rahab became the wife of Salmon, and the ancestress of Boaz, Jesse's grandfather. Some have supposed that Salmon was one of the spies whose life she saved."
2. "At any rate, she became the mother of the line of David and of Christ, and is so recorded in Matthew's genealogy of our Lord, in which only four women are named."
3. "There is a peculiar significance in this selection of Rahab with Abraham as an example of faith, by James the Lord's brother."

### John Calvin:
1. "He designedly put together two persons so different in their character, in order more clearly to shew, that no one, whatever may have been his or her condition, nation, or class in society, has ever been counted righteous without good works."
2. "Whosoever, then, seeks to be counted righteous, though he may even be among the lowest, must yet shew that he is such by good works."
3. "The meaning is, that faith having no works is like a dead carcass without life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The example is not so obvious as that of Abraham; and we can assign no sufficient reason why it was selected by both writers."
2. "Indeed, Rahab herself gives this as the reason of her conduct: 'I know that the Lord hath given you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon as, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you. The Lord your God, He is God in heaven above and in the earth beneath'"
3. "Her faith cooperated with her works, and by works was her faith made perfect received its full realization; and in this sense she is said to be justified by works."
