# James 2:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Ye look upon him — With respect. The two who entered are treated very differently based on their external appearance. The rich man is brought to a place of honor, while the poor man is disregarded and left to stand or sit in a lowly position. This demonstration of favoritism based on outward circumstances goes against the principles of true religion, which calls for treating all individuals with equal respect and dignity. It serves as a reminder that in the eyes of God, every person, regardless of their social status, is deserving of love and acceptance.

1.
