# James 2:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Are you not partial within yourselves, making distinctions between the rich and the poor? By doing so, you have become judges with evil thoughts. You reason wrongly and judge unjustly, valuing outward appearances over the true worth of individuals. Remember, fine clothing does not guarantee a person's character or worth.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Did ye not, in making such distinction between rich and poor, become of the number of those who doubt respecting their faith?" 
2. "Your faith abolishes such distinction: you set it up in practice. You are not then whole in that faith." 
3. "The evil thoughts are in the judges themselves, and consist in the undue preference given by them to the rich."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Have ye not made distinctions" or "differences" (so as to prefer one to another)?
2. "Do ye not partially judge between men, and are become evilly-thinking judges?"
3. "Did ye not doubt" (respecting your faith, which is inconsistent with the distinctions made by you between rich and poor)?

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Do you not show that you are partial?"
2. "They did it not from benevolence; not from a desire to do justice to all according to their moral character; but from that improper feeling which leads us to show honor to men on account of their external appearance, rather than their real worth."
3. "The sense is, that we have no right to form a decisive judgment of men on their first appearance, as we do when we treat one with respect and the other not."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Are ye not divided in your own mind?"
2. "Judges with evil thoughts."
3. "Their evil processes of thought lead to these unjust discriminations."

### John Calvin:
1. "This evil also happens, that ye think not that ye sin, nor know that your thoughts are so wicked as they are."
2. "And do ye not make a difference among (or, in) yourselves, and become judges, having evil thoughts?"
3. "The difference made here was the respect of persons that was shewn, and they made this difference in themselves, in their own minds, through the perverse or false thoughts or reasonings which they entertained."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Did you not doubt in yourselves? Did you not, in showing this respect of persons, waver between God with whom there is no respect of persons and the world, and thus become double-minded?"
2. "For to hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect to persons is a contradiction in terms."
3. "Some consider 'the evil thoughts' as the objects of their judgments, and render the clause: 'Are you not judges of evil disputations' of such disputations as a strife about precedence would give rise to."

1. "Are ye not divided in your own mind?"
2. "Judges with evil thoughts."
3. "They are guilty of partiality (a divided mind) as between the two strangers."

2. "...make a difference among yourselves, by such a conduct, towards the rich and the poor..."
3. "...make a distinction between the rich and the poor, by an evil way of thinking, that one is better than the other, and to be preferred before him."

2. "But are become evil-reasoning judges - You reason ill, and so judge wrong."
3. "For fine apparel is no proof of worth in him that wears it."
