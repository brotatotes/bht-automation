# James 2:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Pause and reflect, the admonition comes, encouraging us to reconsider our judgments. Shouldn't the benefit of the doubt be given to the poor? And if God himself chooses to honor them so greatly, shouldn't we be quick to extend that same honor as well?

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Did not God choose out the poor as regards the world rich in faith, i.e. to be rich in faith, or so that they are rich in faith...the riches are the treasures of salvation, and especially, owing to the following heirs of the kingdom which He promised, the sonship in God’s family."
 
2. "Not the measure of faith, in virtue of which one man is richer than another, is before the Writer’s mind, but the substance of the faith, by virtue of which substance every believer is rich."
 
3. "The riches are the treasures of salvation, and especially, owing to the following heirs of the kingdom which He promised, the sonship in God’s family."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The poor, as a class, furnish more believers than the rich as a class."
2. "The rich, if a believer, renounces riches as his portion; the poor, if an unbeliever, neglects that which is the peculiar advantage of poverty."
3. "Their riches consist in faith. Christ's poverty is the source of the believer's riches."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "...the poor in fact might be made more entitled to esteem than they were."
2. "The fact that God has chosen one to be an 'heir of the kingdom' is as good a reason now why he should not be treated with neglect, as it was in the times of the apostles."
3. "Faith in God the Saviour will answer more purposes, and accomplish more valuable ends for man, than the wealth of the Indies could: and this the poor may have as well as the rich."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Poor as to the world, in the world's esteem."
2. "Faith is not the quality in which they are to be rich, but the sphere or element; rich in their position as believers."
3. "Not the measure of faith, in virtue of which one man is richer than another, is before the writer's mind, but the substance of the faith, by virtue of which every believer is rich."

### John Calvin:
1. "He proves now by a two-fold argument, that they acted preposterously, when for the sake of the rich they despised the poor: The first is, that it is unbecoming and disgraceful to cast down those whom God exalts, and to treat reproachfully those whom he honors."
2. "As God honors the poor, then every one who repudiates them, reverses the order of God."
3. "The other argument is taken from common experience; for since the rich are for the most part vexatious to the good and innocent, it is very unreasonable to render such a reward for the wrongs they do, so that they should be more approved by us than the poor, who aid us more than they wrong us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Hath not God chosen the poor of this world...the poor in worldly wealth." 
2. "The rich in faith...are not those who abound in the greatness of faith, but such as God has enriched with the various gifts of the Spirit which we receive by faith."
3. "The rich are under far greater temptations than the poor; they are led to trust in uncertain riches, and to seek their good things in this world, to fix their happiness here, and to forget 'the kingdom which God hath promised to them that love Him.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "God chose for himself" (1)
2. "God chose poor people" (2)
3. "Rich because of their faith" (3)

### John Gill:
1. "God has chosen the poor of this world; and which is to be understood... of eternal election, which is the act of God the Father, and passed before the foundation of the world; and is an act of sovereign grace, and is irrespective of faith, holiness, and good works; and is the source of all grace, and remains immutable and irrevocable."
2. "The Gentiles, in common, were despicable with the Jews, and especially the poor of them; and yet God chose these."
3. "Men are chosen, not because they do believe, or shall believe, but that they might believe; and which faith they have in consequence of election; and which when they have, they are rich."

### John Wesley:
1. "Hearken — As if he had said, Stay, consider, ye that judge thus."
2. "Does not the presumption lie rather in favour of the poor man?"
3. "And those whom God so highly honours, ought not ye to honour likewise?"
