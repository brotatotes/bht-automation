# James 2:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When we disregard or mistreat the poor, we dishonor those whom God honors. It is important not to automatically give preferential treatment or respect to the rich, especially if they have a history of oppressing others. God often chooses to exalt and honor the poor, and when we go against this order, we are perverting God's intentions. Let us strive to treat all individuals with fairness and compassion, regardless of their socioeconomic status, and remember that God's perspective on honor may challenge our own human tendencies.
