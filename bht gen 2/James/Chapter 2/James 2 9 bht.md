# James 2:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If you show favoritism, you commit sin, breaking the commandment to love others as yourself. This violation of God's law leaves one convicted and transgressing the very law that convicts them. We must be aware of the seriousness of this sin, as the law itself condemns it, as seen in Leviticus 19:15 and Deuteronomy 1:17. Let us be mindful of not committing this sin and facing the consequences of the law's convictions.
