# James 3:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Beware of eagerly seeking the position of a teacher, as few are truly qualified to fulfill its responsibilities. Many who assumed this role without understanding caused harm instead of good. As teachers, we must be mindful of the greater condemnation we will face if we misuse our position. Instead of rushing into teaching, it is better to humbly listen and learn, ensuring that when we do reprove, it is done with a right spirit and for the right reasons. Those who enter into teaching without knowledge or fail to live by their own teachings will face a harsher judgment.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The more the idea prevailed, that faith, without corresponding obedience, was all that is needful, the more men would eagerly press forward to teach: as indeed the Church has found in all ages when such an opinion has become prevalent."
2. "Be not (‚Äòbecome not:‚Äô let not that state of things prevail among you in which you become) many teachers, my brethren, knowing (as ye do: or, as ye ought to do: it is a good remark of Huther‚Äôs, that Œµ·º∞Œ¥œåœÑŒµœÇ, being closely joined to the imperative, is itself hortatory: ‚Äòknowing, as ye might know)..."
3. "we (i. e. as many of us as are teachers) shall receive greater condemnation (than others who are not teachers: Œ∫œÅ·øñŒºŒ±, in the phrase Œ∫œÅ·øñŒºŒ± ŒªŒ±ŒºŒ≤Œ¨ŒΩŒµŒπŒΩ, according to N. T. usage, is not a ‚Äòvox media,‚Äô but signifies condemnation only...")

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Few govern the tongue well...only such as can govern it are fit for the office."
2. "Faith without works...prompted 'many' to set up as 'teachers'."
3. "If we teachers abuse the office, we shall receive greater condemnation than those who are mere hearers."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A small number, well qualified, would better discharge the duties of the office, and do more good, than many would; and there would be great evil in having many crowding themselves unqualified into the office."
2. "The evil reprehended is that of seeking the office of public instructor, especially the sacred office. It would seem that this was a prevailing fault among those to whom the apostle wrote."
3. "No better 'stand-point' can be taken in making up the mind in regard to this work; and if that had been the position assumed in order to estimate the work, and to make up the mind in regard to the choice of this profession, many a one who has sought the office would have been deterred from it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Jas. is warning against the too eager and general assumption of the privilege of teaching."
2. "The privilege of teaching was not restricted to a particular class, but was exercised by believers generally."

### John Calvin:
1. "Be not many masters. The common and almost universal interpretation of this passage is... it is dangerous, and exposes one to a heavier judgment, in case he transgresses."
2. "But I take masters not to be those who performed a public duty in the Church, but such as took upon them the right of passing judgment upon others."
3. "And that he forbade them to be many, it was done for this reason, because many everywhere did thrust in themselves; for it is, as it were, an innate disease in mankind to seek reputation by blaming others."


### Philip Schaff:
1. "Do not rashly enter upon the office of a teacher."
2. "The opportunity of exercising the office of teachers was greater in these days of early Christianity than in ours."
3. "Many, especially in a season of religious excitement, assume the office of teacher, without any qualification of knowledge or experience, and thus expose themselves to the reproof of St. James."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "There is thus a clear complaint that too many of the Jewish Christians were attempting to teach what they did not clearly comprehend."
2. "Teachers are necessary, but incompetent and unworthy ones do much harm."
3. "The pretence of knowledge adds to the teacher's responsibility and condemnation."

### John Gill:
1. "Be not many teachers; or be not fond, and forward, and ambitious of being preachers of the word, but rather choose to be hearers of it."
2. "Reproof for sin ought to be given; sin should not be suffered upon the brethren; to reprove is not blameworthy, but commendable, when it is done in a right manner, with a good spirit, and to a good end."
3. "Knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation: should men enter into the office of teaching others without a call, or perform it negligently, or live not according to the doctrine they teach others, such would be judged out of their own mouths, and by their own words, and their condemnation would be aggravated."

### John Wesley:
1. "Be not many teachers ‚Äî Let no more of you take this upon you than God thrusts out; seeing it is so hard not to offend in speaking much." 
2. "Knowing that we ‚Äî That all who thrust themselves into the office. Shall receive greater condemnation ‚Äî For more offences."
3. "St. James here, as in several of the following verses, by a common figure of speech, includes himself: we shall receive, - we offend,- we put bits,- we curse - None of which, as common sense shows, are to be interpreted either of him or of the other apostles."
