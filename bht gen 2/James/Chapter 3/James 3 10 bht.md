# James 3:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is a moral incongruity for blessing and cursing to come out of the same mouth. The juxtaposition of these opposite acts reveals an inconsistency that is unbecoming and scandalous. As believers, we should recognize that such behavior is unworthy of our calling as Christians and strive to align our words with the blessings and grace of God.
