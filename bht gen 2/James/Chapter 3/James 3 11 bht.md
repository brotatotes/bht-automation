# James 3:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Doth a fountain send forth at the same place...at divers places, and at different times, as Pliny observes, it may send forth sweet [water] and bitter. This illustration from nature highlights the unnaturalness of blessings and curses coming from the same mouth. It suggests that just as a fountain can produce both sweet and bitter water at different times and places, it is not fitting for a person to speak both blessings and curses.
