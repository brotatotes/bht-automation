# James 3:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
No tree can bring forth fruits inconsistent with its nature, as for example, the fig tree, and olive berries, illustrating how absurd it is for a man to both bless and curse with his tongue. Just as a fig tree produces figs and an olive tree produces olive berries, a person's words should align with their character and nature. It is incongruous for salt water to yield fresh water, just as it is incongruous for a person's speech to be a mixture of blessings and curses.

2. "No tree can bring forth fruit inconsistent with its own nature."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "No tree 'can' bring forth fruit inconsistent with its nature, as for example, the fig tree, olive berries: so if a man speaks bitterly, and afterwards speaks good words, the latter must be so only seemingly, and in hypocrisy, they cannot be real." 
2. "So the mouth that emits cursing cannot really emit also blessing."
