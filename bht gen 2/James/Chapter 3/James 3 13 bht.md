## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The σοφός is an able man, the  ἐπιστήμων a well-informed man. But the distinction must be very uncertain: for while Plato says, Rep. 5. p. 477 B, ἐπιστήμη ἐπὶ τῷ ὄντι πέφυκε γνῶναι ὡς ἔστι τὸ ὄν , in the Phædrus, p. 96 B, he says again, οἱ σοφοὶ ἐπιστήμῃ σοφοί εἰσιν … ἐπιστήμη ἄρα σοφία ἐστίν )  among you?" 
2. "Let him shew... out of... his works... in meekness of wisdom." 
3. "Meekness is the attribute, σοφία the character to which it belongs: 'in that meekness which is the proper attribute of wisdom'."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "All wish to appear 'wise': few are so."
2. "Show 'by works,' and not merely by profession."
3. "Wisdom and knowledge, without these being 'shown,' are as dead as faith would be without works."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The primary things to be sought in reference to that office were wisdom and knowledge, and they who were endowed with these things should be selected for public instructors."
2. "He should be a man of a holy life."
3. "True wisdom is always meek, mild, gentle; and that is the wisdom which is needful, if men would become public teachers."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Wise and endued with knowledge... denotes the habit or quality, while ejpisthmwn indicates the special development and intelligent application of the quality to particular things."
2. "Meekness of wisdom... The meekness which is the proper attribute of wisdom."
3. "Knowledge is proud that she has learned so much, Wisdom is humble that she knows no more."

### John Calvin:
1. "That supercilious censors, who largely indulge themselves, and at the same time spare none, seem to themselves to be very wise, but are greatly mistaken; for the Lord teaches his people far otherwise, even to be meek, and to be courteous to others."
2. "They, then, are alone wise in the sight of God, who connect this meekness with an honest conversation; for they who are severe and inexorable, though they may excel others in many virtues, do not yet follow the right way of wisdom."
3. "Wisdom the effect first, then knowledge the cause or what precedes it. In what follows the order is reversed; knowledge distinguishes between good and bad works, and the good ought to be exhibited with that meekness which wisdom dictates."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The want of command over our tongues argues a defect in wisdom and knowledge; so that if you do not govern your tongues, your boast of these qualities is a mere pretence."
2. "Wisdom denotes the adaptation of means to ends, and knowledge the acquisition of particular facts; the knowledge of facts constitutes the materials with which wisdom works."
3. "The meekness of wisdom is seen in the government of the tongue."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Speech and wisdom are both liable to abuse."
2. "Actions speak louder than words even in the case of the professional wise man."
3. "Startling combination."

### John Gill:
1. "And he is a wise man, who is both wise to do good, and wise unto salvation."
2. "Such an one ought to perform good works, and he will perform them; and it is right in him to show them forth, that they may be a means of others glorifying God upon the sight of them."
3. "And all this should be 'with meekness of wisdom'; in a wise and humble manner, without trusting to, and depending upon, such works for justification and salvation; and without glorying in them, and boasting of them; acknowledging the deficiency and imperfection of them, and his own weakness in the performance of them; and ascribing them to the power and grace of God, by the assistance of which they are performed."

### John Wesley:
1. Let him show his wisdom as well as his faith by his works; not by words only.
