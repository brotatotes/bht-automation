# James 3:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Beware of bitter envy and strife, for such malicious ambition and contention contradicts the true essence of Christian zeal, which is fueled by love. Out of the heart flows thoughts, words, and actions, so let us not boast or lie against the truth with arrogant claims of worldly wisdom. May our lives reflect the word of truth, seeking no position that we could not rightly pursue if all were known. Let us instead cultivate a spirit of kind and generous emulation, free from envy and self-serving motives, and strive for unity and peace in our relationships.

2. "Out of [the heart] come thoughts and words and acts."
3. "Their whole lives would be thus a negation and an opposition."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Kindly, generous emulation, or zeal, is not condemned, but that which is 'bitter'."
2. "To boast of your wisdom is virtually a lying against the truth (the gospel), while your lives belie your glorying."

2. "Do not boast, in such a case, of your qualifications to be public teachers."
3. "Men should seek no office or station which they could not properly seek if the whole truth about them were known."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The bad sense is predominant in the New Testament. See Acts 5:17; Romans 13:13; Galatians 5:20, and here, where the bad sense is defined and emphasized by the epithet bitter."
2. "Emulation is the better general rendering, which does not necessarily include envy, but may be full of the spirit of self-devotion."
3. "It is derived from eriqov, a hired servant, and means, primarily, labor for hire. Compare Tobit 2:11: My wife did take women's work to do [ηριθευετο]. Thus it comes to be applied to those who serve in official positions for their own selfish interest, and who, to that end, promote party spirit and faction."

### John Calvin:
1. "For immoderate rigor necessarily begets mischievous emulations, which presently break forth into contentions."
2. "That we may then really glory that we are the children of God, he bids us to act calmly and meekly towards our brethren; otherwise he declares that we are lying in assuming the Christian name."
3. "Contests and quarrels ever arise from malignity and envy."

1. "If ye have bitter envying zeal or emulation in a bad sense, as is evident from the epithet 'bitter,'"
2. "Strife, or rather factiousness, contention, party-strife; the reference being specially to religious controversies."
3. "In your hearts, glory not, boast not, and lie not, by a false pretence to wisdom and knowledge, against the truth."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Pride of knowledge is evil and leaves a bitter taste."
2. "Wisdom is essential for the teacher. Boasting arrogance disproves the possession of wisdom."
3. "By your conduct, do not belie the truth which you teach; a solemn and needed lesson."

### John Gill:
1. "Envy at the happiness of others, whether at the external blessings of Providence, as riches and honours, or at the internal endowments of their minds, as their wisdom and knowledge, their parts and abilities, is a root of bitterness in the heart."
2. "Strife in the mind, or an intention to strive and quarrel with others, who are the objects of envy, is very sinful, and of pernicious consequence."
3. "For a man to assert himself to be a wise and knowing man, and yet cherishes bitterness in his heart, and quarrelling and contention in his mind, arising from envy, he lies both against the truth of God's word and his own conscience."

### John Wesley:
1. "True Christian zeal is only the flame of love."
2. "Even in your hearts - Though it went no farther."
3. "Do not lie against the truth — As if such zeal could consist with heavenly wisdom."
