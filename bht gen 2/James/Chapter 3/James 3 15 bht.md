# James 3:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The wisdom being addressed is not true wisdom, but a counterfeit version that is earthly, sensual, and devilish. It is a wisdom that places emphasis on worldly knowledge rather than spiritual understanding. This type of wisdom often leads to strife and contention, and is rooted in pride and selfishness. It is acquired through the strength of human nature rather than being a gift from God. True wisdom, on the other hand, comes from above and is heavenly, spiritual, and divine. It is opposite to the characteristics displayed by the earthly and carnal wisdom.
