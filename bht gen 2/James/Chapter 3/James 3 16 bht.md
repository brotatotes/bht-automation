# James 3:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When envy and strife take hold of individuals or communities, there is a state of disorder and turmoil. This state of confusion not only disrupts peace and harmony but also gives rise to various forms of wickedness. It leads to disturbances, uneasiness, and tumults, and it incites people to commit all sorts of evil deeds to satisfy their insatiable desires. These effects of envy and strife are contrary to true wisdom and hinder any progress in divine matters. It is crucial, therefore, to cultivate a spirit of peace and unity, rejecting the temptations of jealousy and contention.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Justification of the foregoing assertion."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The envious man stands in his own light. He thinks his candle cannot shine in the presence of another's sun. He aims directly at men, obliquely at God, who makes men to differ."
2. "confusion—literally, 'tumultuous anarchy': both in society and in the individual mind; in contrast to the 'peaceable' composure of true 'wisdom'."
3. "James does not honor such effects of this earthly wisdom with the name 'fruit,' as he does in the case of the wisdom from above."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "For where envying and strife is, there is confusion - Everything is unsettled and agitated. There is no mutual confidence; there is no union of plan and effort; there is no co-operation in promoting a common object; there is no stability in any plan."
2. "And every evil work - All love and harmony of course are banished; all happiness disappears; all prosperity is at an end. In place of the peaceful virtues which ought to prevail, there springs up every evil passion that tends to mar the peace of a community."
3. "Where this spirit prevails in a church, it is of course impossible to expect any progress in divine things; and in such a church any effort to do good is vain."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Confusion [ακαταστασια] . See on restless, ver. 8."
2. "Evil [φαυλον] . An inadequate rendering, because it fails to bring out the particular phase of evil which is dominant in the word: worthlessness, good - for - nothingness."
3. "In the New Testament it appears in this latest stage, and is set over against good. See John 3:20; John 5:29; Titus 2:8. Rev., vile, which, according to its etymology, Lat., vilis, follows the same process of development from cheap, or paltry, to bad."

### John Calvin:
1. "For wisdom requires a state of mind that is calm and composed, but envying disturbs it, so that in itself it becomes in a manner tumultuous, and boils up immoderately against others."
2. "James meant to express something more than levity, even that the malignant and the slanderer does everything confusedly and rashly, as though he were beside himself."
3. "For envying, by which hypocrites are influenced, produces effects contrary to wisdom."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For, the reason assigned for the above description of earthly wisdom, where envying and strife is; where zeal (in a bad sense) and party-strife are, there is confusion and every evil work all kinds of wickedness."
2. "Certainly the reference is primarily to religious controversy; but the supposition that the controversy between the Jewish and Gentile Christians is here referred to is without foundation."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Confusion (ακαταστασια)... a state of disorder" (1 Corinthians 14:33).
2. "Vile (φαυλον)... first slight, ordinary, then bad" (John 5:39).


### John Gill:
1. "Where these are cherished in the heart, and especially where they break out into action, in families, neighbourhoods, states, or churches: there is confusion and every evil work..."
2. "These occasion disturbances, raise uneasiness, make disquietude, and cause tumults whenever they appear..."
3. "...and put persons upon doing everything that is wicked, to gratify such insatiable lusts."
