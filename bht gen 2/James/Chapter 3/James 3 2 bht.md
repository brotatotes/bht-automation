# James 3:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If a person can control their tongue, they can control their whole body and are considered perfect. No one is exempt from stumbling in their speech, but it is especially important for religious teachers to be mindful of their words. Offenses committed through speech are common, but those who are cautious in their speech can be seen as wise and prudent. Ultimately, it is through the control of our tongue that we can demonstrate self-control and avoid causing harm to others.
