# James 3:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Men, like horses, have a tendency to go their own way without any direction or control. Just as horses need a bridle in order to be guided and governed, so too do men need to bridle their tongues. The power and influence of the tongue is significant, as it has the ability to direct and shape the course of our lives. By exercising control over our tongues, we can bring our entire bodies and actions under control and live in a manner that is pleasing to God.
