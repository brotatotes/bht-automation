# James 3:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Just as large ships are controlled by a small rudder, our tongue has great influence over our entire body. The tongue can steer us away from being carried away by our passions and desires. Just as ships rely on the guidance of the helmsman, we too need faithful ministers of the word to guide us in the right direction. The imagery of ships in James' epistle highlights the power and responsibility we have in controlling our speech.
