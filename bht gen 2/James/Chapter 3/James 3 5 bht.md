# James 3:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The tongue, though small, boasts great influence. It can either be a bridled and sanctified tongue, influenced by the grace of God, or an evil tongue that does great mischief. The power of the tongue is remarkable, for it is as choice silver to the righteous, feeding many with their words. Whether it is used for good or for evil, the tongue has the potential to have a tremendous impact.
