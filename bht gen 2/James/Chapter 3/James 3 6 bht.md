# James 3:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The tongue is like a raging fire that spreads and consumes with its iniquity. It is a combination of all sorts of evil, defiling not just itself but also the whole body. Just as a small flame can set a whole forest ablaze, the tongue has the power to set the entire course of a person's life on fire. It is influenced by the temptations of Satan, who stirs up and instigates the tongue to speak many wicked things, leading to its eventual destruction in hell.
