# James 3:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The tongue, whether our own or of others, cannot be tamed or controlled by mere human effort. It is a restless and uncontrollable force, constantly causing mischief and destruction. Like a deadly poison, it has the power to bring about ruin and devastation in our relationships and communities. Only through the grace and guidance of God can we hope to govern our tongues and use our words wisely and lovingly.
