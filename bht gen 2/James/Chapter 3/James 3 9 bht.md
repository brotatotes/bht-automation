## BHT:
We have lost the likeness of God through the fall, but there is still an indelible nobleness that remains within us, reminding us of our created state and the potential we have to reflect God's image.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Therewith bless we the Lord and Father" - i.e. as applied to God, ‘praise we' - the first person is used of mankind in general, considered as one agent.
2. "Which have been created after the likeness of God" - the likeness of God remains in us, marred indeed, but not destroyed. This likeness we ought to revere, in ourselves and in others.
3. "Not man’s original state, but man’s present state is here under consideration: and on that consideration depends the force of the Apostle’s argument."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Father" implies His paternal love; "Lord," His dominion.
2. We ought to reverence this remnant and earnest of what man shall be in ourselves and in others.
3. "image," according to the Alexandrians, was something in which men were created, being common to all, and continuing to man after the fall, while the "likeness" was something toward which man was created, to strive after and attain it: the former marks man's physical and intellectual, the latter his moral pre-eminence.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "All this is done by the same organ - the tongue."
2. "The absurdity of employing the tongue in such contradictory uses as to bless one who has to us the relation of a father, and to curse any being, especially those who are made in his image."
3. "There is an absurdity in cursing men who are thus made, like what there would be in both blessing and cursing the Creator himself."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To praise God is the proper use of the tongue."
2. "Man in his understanding and affections, and especially in his conscience, still bears the traces of the moral image of his Creator; indeed, it is by reason of this resemblance that we can attain to a knowledge of the perfections of God, and are rendered capable of religion."
3. "He who curses man curses the image of God, and consequently God Himself in His image."
