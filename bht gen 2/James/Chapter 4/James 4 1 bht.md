# James 4:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle raises a thought-provoking question: Where do conflicts and disputes originate? They stem from the selfish desires for worldly pleasures, as opposed to pursuing peace. Wars and fights, both physical and internal, arise from these sensual cravings. It is not merely theological debates or religious controversies, but also legal disputes driven by the wealthy to oppress the poor. This battle extends beyond external conflicts and encompasses the internal struggle between the flesh and the Spirit within believers. So let us strive for peace, rejecting the allure of selfish desires that fuel quarrels and wars.
