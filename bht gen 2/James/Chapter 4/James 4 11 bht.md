# James 4:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do not speak against one another, brethren... Speaking evil of others is a grave offense and goes against the true spirit of religion. It is common in the world, but it is decidedly against the principles of the Christian faith. We should not place ourselves above the law and judge our brothers and sisters. Instead, we should humbly think of ourselves and avoid undervaluing others. Let us remember that it is God's role to judge, not ours.

3. "By condemning thy fellow-men, thou steppest out of thy province, which is not to judge the law, but to obey it. Judgment is the province of God, the one Lawgiver, not of the subject to the law, and far less of the trangressor of the law."
