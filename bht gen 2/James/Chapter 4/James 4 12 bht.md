# James 4:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We must recognize that there is one lawgiver who holds the authority to save and destroy. This exclusive role is reserved for God alone, who possesses the power and sovereignty to execute His judgments. As fallible humans, we should refrain from taking on the audacious task of passing judgment on our neighbors. It is essential for us to remember our place and not interfere with God's prerogative as the ultimate Judge.
