## BHT:
Come now, ye that say — As peremptorily as if your life were in your own hands.

It reminds us that our lives are not in our control, and we should humbly seek God's guidance and trust in His providence rather than presuming on our own abilities.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Go to now - The apostle here introduces a new subject, and refers to another fault which was doubtless prevalent among them, as it is everywhere, that of a presumptuous confidence respecting the future, or of forming plans stretching into the future, without any proper sense of the uncertainty of life, and of our absolute dependence on God."
2. "Ye that say - You that form your plans in this manner or that speak thus confidently of what you will do in the future."
3. "And buy and sell, and get gain - It is not improbable that there is an allusion here to the commercial habits of the Jews at the time when the apostle wrote. Many of them were engaged in foreign traffic, and for this purpose made long journeys to distant trading cities."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Go to is an obsolete phrase, though retained in Rev. It is a formula for calling attention: come now." 
2. "Better, as Rev., spend a year there. The word poihsomen implies more than mere continuance; rather, a doing something with the year."

### John Calvin:
1. "He condemns here another kind of presumption, that many, who ought to have depended on God’s providence, confidently settled what they were to do, and arranged their plans for a long time, as though they had many years at their own disposal, while they were not sure, no not even of one moment."
2. "James roused the stupidity of those who disregarded God’s providence, and claimed for themselves a whole year, though they had not a single moment in their own power; the gain which was afar off they promised to themselves, though they had no possession of that which was before their feet."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The sin consisted in a presumptuous confidence in themselves, and in a want of realization of their dependence on God."
2. "There could be nothing wrong in the mere merchandise; the sin consisted in a presumptuous confidence in themselves, and in a want of realization of their dependence on God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "One would point out the city on the map as he made the proposal." 
2. "We will do a year there."
3. "A vivid picture of the Jewish merchants of the time."

1. "The apostle design by this to condemn merchandise, and the lawful practice of buying and selling, and getting gain; but that men should not resolve upon those things without consulting God, and attending to his will, and subjecting themselves to it."
2. "Without considering the uncertainty and frailty of human life."
