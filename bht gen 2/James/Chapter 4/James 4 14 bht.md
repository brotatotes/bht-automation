# James 4:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We cannot predict or determine the course of our lives, as they are as uncertain and fleeting as a vapor. It is foolish to make plans without considering the brevity of life and seeking God's guidance. Our lives are like a mist that appears briefly and then disappears, and we cannot rely on our own strength or assume anything about our future. We should humbly acknowledge our limited control over our lives and remember that our significance lies in God's hands.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For of what sort is your life? for ye are a vapor, which appeareth for a little time, afterwards as it appeared, so vanishing."
2. "Ye are a vapour, which appeareth for a little time, vanishing."
3. "It is not your life, which is not a thing seen, but ye, that πρὸς ὀλίγον φαίνεσθε a vapour, which appeareth for a little time, afterwards as it appeared, so vanishing."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "what—literally, 'of what nature' is your life? that is, how evanescent it is."
2. "Ye yourselves are transitory; so everything of yours, even your life, must partake of the same transitoriness."
3. "afterwards vanishing as it came; literally, 'afterwards (as it appeared), so vanishing'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We have no power of penetrating the future so as to be able to determine what will occur in a single day or a single hour, and yet we are almost habitually forming our plans as if we saw with certainty all that is to happen."
2. "All your plans must depend of course on the continuance of your life; but what a frail and uncertain thing is that! How transitory and evanescent as a basis on which to build any plans for the future!"
3. "The comparison of life with a vapor is common, and is as beautiful as it is just... So of life. Soon it disappears altogether. The works of art that man has made, the house that he has built, or the book that he has written, remain for a little time, but the life has gone."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Ye know not what your life shall be on the morrow, for ye are a vapor." 
2. "What is your life? It is even a vapor."
3. "The vapor vanishes even as it appeared."

### John Calvin:
1. "For he who remembers the shortness of his life, will have his audacity easily checked so as not to extend too far his resolves."
2. "By the similitude of vapor, he strikingly shews that the purposes which are founded only on the present life, are altogether evanescent."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Ye are a mere vapour; a smoke, or an exhalation from the ground."
2. "There is hardly a finer image in any author of the uncertainty, the brevity, and the vanity of human life."
3. "We appear as a flash, and then are swallowed up in darkness."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Ποια η ζωη υμων... As vapour (ατμις). This is the answer. Old word for mist (like ατμος, from which our 'atmosphere'), in N.T. only here and Acts 2:19 with καπνου (vapour of smoke (from Joel 2:30)."
2. "For a little time  (προς ολιγον). See same phrase in 1 Timothy 4:8, προς καιρον in Luke 8:13, προς ωραν in John 5:35."
3. "That appeareth and then vanisheth away  (φαινομενη επειτα κα αφανιζομενη). Present middle participles agreeing with ατμις, 'appearing, then also disappearing,' with play on the two verbs (φαινομαι, αφανιζω as in Matthew 6:19, from αφανης hidden Hebrews 4:13) with the same root φαν (φαινω, α-φαν-ης)."

### John Gill:
1. "No man can secure a day, an hour, a moment, and much less a year of continuance in this life; nor can he foresee what will befall him today or tomorrow; therefore it is great stupidity to determine on this, and the other, without the leave of God."
2. "What is your life? Of what kind and nature is it? What assurance can be had of the continuance of it? It is even a vapor that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away."
3. "The allusion is to the breath of man, which is in his nostrils, and who is not to be accounted of, or depended on."
