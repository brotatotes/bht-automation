# James 4:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Instead of arrogantly asserting our own plans and actions, we should humbly acknowledge our dependence on God's will and recognize that our lives and future endeavors are subject to his sovereignty. Our success should be grounded in the favor of the Lord, as there is nothing within our absolute control that determines the outcome of our plans. It is important for us to internalize this dependence and integrate it into the very fabric of our speech, forming all our plans with reference to God's will.

1. "Ye say, ‘Today or tomorrow we shall go into such a city;' instead of saying, ‘If the Lord will.’ Ye assert your self-dependence, instead of humbly acknowledging your dependence on God."
2. "But our version is better, as both the living and the doing are made dependent on God. The meaning being precisely the same as our common phrase: ‘God willing (Deo volente), I shall do so and so.' We must, however, beware of allowing this expression of dependence to degenerate into a mere form, as is too frequently the case; it must be the real feeling of our heart."
3. "We must not only acknowledge in words, but deeply realize our dependence on God."

2. "Here are two conditions of doing anything; the one is, if it should be agreeable to the determining will and purpose of God, by which everything in the world comes to pass, and into which the wills of men should be resolved, and resigned; and the other is, if we should live, since life is so very uncertain and precarious."
3. "Since the words are so short and comprehensive, it might be proper for Christians to use themselves to such a way of speaking; upon all occasions."

### John Wesley:
1. Instead of your saying — That is, whereas ye ought to say.
