# James 4:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we are cautioned against boasting or finding joy in our own abilities and achievements. Such behavior is regarded as wicked and reflects a neglect of God's providence in our lives. By relying solely on ourselves, we demonstrate an arrogant attitude that disregards the uncertainty of life and the fact that our plans can easily be thwarted. We should humbly acknowledge our dependence on God and refrain from boasting about our wisdom or control over the future. Any glorying in our own accomplishments is considered sinful, for it rejects our reliance on God.

2. "The Syriac version renders it, 'all such rejoicing is from evil'; from an evil heart, and from the evil one, Satan."
