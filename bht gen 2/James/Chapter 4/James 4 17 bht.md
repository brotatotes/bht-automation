# James 4:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To know what is right and fail to act upon it is a great sin. It is even more sinful when one is aware of their duty and intentionally neglects to carry it out. The omission of a known duty is just as wrong as the commission of a known sin. Therefore, it is important to not only have knowledge but to also put it into practice.
