# James 4:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A person driven by intense desire and envy may resort to forceful measures to obtain what they want, even going as far as to harm others. This kind of behavior stems from an insatiable soul that is constantly seeking satisfaction. However, these wicked lusts ultimately lead to destruction rather than fulfillment. Striving and fighting with others over material desires is not only fruitless but also sinful. Instead, it is better to turn to God in prayer, seeking His blessings on our endeavors and trusting in His provision rather than succumbing to jealousy and hatred.
