# James 4:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When we approach God with impure motives, seeking to fulfill our own selfish desires, our prayers will not be answered. It is important for us to pray with the right intentions, rooted in faith and gratitude. We should not pray simply to indulge in worldly pleasures, but rather to seek God's will and bring glory to His name. If our prayers are focused on self-gratification, they will not align with God's plans for our lives. Instead, we should strive to pray selflessly, seeking to serve and bless others in accordance with God's desires.
