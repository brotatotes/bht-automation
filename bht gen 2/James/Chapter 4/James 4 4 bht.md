# James 4:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who have turned their affections towards the world and its desires instead of faithfully loving God have broken their covenant with Him, becoming adulterers and adulteresses. This metaphorical language emphasizes the seriousness of their unfaithfulness. By seeking the friendship and approval of the world, these individuals align themselves against God; their desires and actions are in opposition to His will. It is impossible to serve both God and the world simultaneously; choosing the world as a friend unavoidably makes one an enemy of God.
