# James 4:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Scripture is not in vain, for it serves a purpose of teaching, guiding, and comforting us, providing us with doctrines, reproofs, corrections, and instructions. The Holy Spirit dwelling in us is not driven by envy, for He opposes the works of the flesh, including envy. Instead, the Spirit is a spirit of grace, freely bestowing favors and increasing blessings upon us, promoting love rather than envy. The spirit of love within believers stands against envy, countering the unloving attitudes that arise from worldly friendships.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We are married to one, even God, who has implanted in us His Spirit: and He is a jealous God, who will not suffer us to be friends of His enemy and His friends at the same time."
2. "The only difficulty seems to be, to trace this latter saying in any part of Scripture. For that this is the quotation, and no other, must be maintained against very many Commentators on account of λέγει, which can hardly be otherwise used than at introducing the thing said."
3. "I own that such a solution does not seem to me wholly satisfactory: still there is nothing improbable in the idea that St. James may have combined the general sense of Scripture on the point of God’s jealousy over His people, and instead of the God who dwelt in Israel, may have placed the Holy Spirit who dwelleth in us."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "No word of Scripture can be so."
2. "The friendship of the world tends to breed envy; the Spirit produces very different fruit."
3. "Ye lust, and because ye have not what ye lust after, ye envy your neighbor who has, and so the spirit of envy leads you on to 'fight'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The difficulty has arisen from the fact that no such passage as that which seems here to be quoted is found in the Old Testament."
2. "Two things are clear in regard to the passage: (1) That James meant to adduce something that was said somewhere, or which could be regarded as a quotation, or as authority in the case, for he uses the formula by which such quotations are made; and, (2) That he meant to refer, not to an apocryphal book, but to the inspired and canonical Scriptures."
3. "The abundant facts which existed showing its development and operation in contentions, and wars, and a worldly spirit, proved that it was deeply embedded in the human soul."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Do ye think [δοκειτε] . See on ch. James 1:26. The scripture [η γραφη] . See on Mark 12:10. Properly, a passage of scripture. In vain [κενως] . Only here in New Testament.

### John Calvin:
1. "The friendship of the world is adverse to God."
2. "Envy is a proof or sign of malignity; but the Spirit of God proves himself to be bountiful by the affluence of his blessings."
3. "James denies that the Spirit of God rules where depraved lusts prevail, which excite to mutual contention; because it is peculiarly the office of the Spirit to enrich men more and more continually with new gifts."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Do you think that the scriptural declarations are made in vain? This may refer to the sentiment that follows: or, as we think is better, to what precedes, to the scriptural denunciations against worldliness, and the indulgence of hatred and envy."
2. "Does the Spirit that dwells in us lust to envy? Does He encourage such worldly affections?"
3. "Another important, and perhaps better attested, reading of the Greek is 'caused to dwell,' instead of 'dwelleth;' but this is also in conformity with the interpretation given above: 'Does the Spirit which He caused to dwell in us lust to envy?'" (75 words)

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Scripture...is 'a poetical rendering' of Exodus 20:5." 
2. "In vain...means 'emptily,' not meaning what it says." 
3. "With God presented as a jealous lover, does 'the Spirit' refer to the Holy Spirit as the subject of yearning or to man's spirit as the object of yearning? Probably the former."

### John Gill:
1. "Whatever is written there is to answer some end, as for learning, edification, and comfort, for doctrine, reproof, correction, and instruction in righteousness."
2. "The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?... does the Holy Spirit lust to envy? No; he lusts against the flesh and the works of it, and envy among the rest."
3. "He is a spirit of grace; he bestows grace and favours upon men; and is so far from envying, or putting others upon envying any benefit enjoyed by men, that he increases them, adds to them, and enlarges them."

### John Wesley:
1. "The spirit of love that dwelleth in all believers lusteth against envy - Galatians 5:17; is directly opposite to all those unloving tempers which necessarily flow from the friendship of the world."
