# James 4:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God gives a greater measure of grace to those who reject pride and strive to cultivate humble and loving hearts. Pride, which lies at the root of unkind thoughts and actions, is something that God opposes. This is a principle that can be found in the book of Proverbs, where it states that God opposes the proud. Therefore, let us humble ourselves before God and seek His grace to overcome any tendencies toward pride and unkindness, and instead, embrace humility and love towards others.
