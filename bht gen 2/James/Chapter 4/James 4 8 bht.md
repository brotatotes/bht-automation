# James 4:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Approach God with a genuine desire for his favor, and he will surely respond to your prayers. 
To receive the favor of God, we must turn away from sin and strive for purity in both our actions and our hearts.
Do not deceive yourselves by trying to divide your affections between God and the world; instead, fully commit to serving God alone.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you." (here better 'will:' in speaking of the divine dealings, positive declarations are better softened: cf. John 16:23, E. V. Not that this is always observed: cf. Revelation 7:17, E. V.) to you.
2. "But it is only the pure in heart and hand that can approach God: therefore Purify your hands... ye sinners: and make chaste your hearts... ye double-minded (ye whose affections are divided between God and the world."
3. "The Apostle is addressing not two classes of persons, but one and the same: 'Eosdem vocat peccatores et duplices animo,' Calv."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Draw nigh to God—So 'cleave unto Him,' Deuteronomy 30:20, namely, by prayerfully 'resisting Satan,' who would oppose our access to God."
2. "Cleanse . . . hands—the outward instruments of action. None but the clean-handed can ascend into the hill of the Lord."
3. "purify . . . hearts—literally 'make chaste' of your spiritual adultery, that is, worldliness, 'your hearts': the inward source of all impurity."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If we wish the favor of God, we must come to him; nor can we hope for his mercy, unless we approach him and ask him for it."
2. "To obtain the favor of God, it is necessary to put away our sins; to approach him with a desire to be pure and holy."
3. "There must be a deeper work than mere external reformation; a work which shall reach to the heart, and which shall purify the affections."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Purify [αγνισατε]. One of the three instances in the New Testament in which the word is not used of ceremonial purification."
2. "Double minded [διψυχοι]. Compare ch. 1 8."

### John Calvin:
1. "He intimates that we are destitute of his grace, because we withdraw from him."
2. "God is never wanting to us, except when we alienate ourselves from him."
3. "The main thing is first stated, to draw nigh to God: and then the things which are previously necessary, to cleanse their hands and to purify their hearts."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Draw nigh to God: not to be limited to prayer, but to be understood of our intercourse with God generally."
2. "Cleanse your hands, ye sinners. The priests before they ministered at the altar, and the people before they prayed, always washed their hands, thus intimating the purity with which we ought to approach God."
3. "ye double-minded: having, as it were, two souls the one professing to be attached to God, and the other really attached to the world. The epithets ‘sinners’ and ‘double-minded’ refer not to different, but to the same class of persons."

1. "The priests in the sanctuary drew nigh to God, as we should now." 
2. "If we always had clean (from sin) hands and hearts?"

### John Gill:
1. "Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you... blessed is the man that approaches to him in faith and fear." 
2. "cleansing of their hands and hearts denotes the purity of outward conversation, and of the inward affections; and supposes impurity both of flesh and spirit... though a man attempts the one, he fails in it; and who can say he has done the other? This is not to be done by ceremonial ablutions, moral services, or evangelical ordinances; this is God's work only."
3. "such exhortations are not in vain, since they may be useful to convince men of their pollution, who are pure in their own eyes... and to lead them to inquire after the proper means of cleansing, and so to the fountain of Christ's blood, which only cleanses from all sin."

### John Wesley:
1. "Draw nigh to God in prayer, and he will draw nigh unto you, will hear you."
2. "Cease from doing evil and purify your hearts from all spiritual adultery."
3. "Be no more double minded, vainly endeavouring to serve both God and mammon."
