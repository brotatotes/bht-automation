# James 5:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Attention, you who are wealthy, listen carefully. The apostle directs this warning not only towards the rich themselves but also to the poor who are suffering under their oppression. Your miseries are approaching swiftly and without warning, so it is time to weep and mourn. These impending miseries are not only temporal but also a foreshadowing of the wrath that will come upon those who remain unrepentant in the world to come.
