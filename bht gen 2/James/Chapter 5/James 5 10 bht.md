# James 5:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In times of trials and persecutions, let us look to the prophets as an example. Like us, they were once persecuted, even for speaking in the name of the Lord. Their afflictions were great, yet they remained patient and faithful, ultimately inheriting the promises of God. They serve as a pattern for us, reminding us that our holiness or high commission does not exempt us from suffering. Even though the world may have esteemed the prophets for their gift, they themselves could not bear their message.
