# James 5:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who have endured trials like the prophets and Job are worthy of commendation, for they have shown patience and faithfulness. The book of Job, among other reasons, was written to demonstrate the enduring nature of true religion. Though Job suffered greatly, the Lord ultimately showed him great pity and mercy. In imitating Job's patience, we too can find comfort in the knowledge that God will deliver us in the end. Just as God showed compassion towards Job in his suffering, he will also show us his mercy and love in our times of trial.

1. "The end of the Lord [το τελος κυριου] . A peculiar expression. The happy conclusion to which God brought Job's trials."
2. "Very pitiful and of tender mercy [πολυσπλαγχνος και οικτιρμων] . The former adjective only here in New Testament; the latter here and Luke 6:36. Rev., full of pity and merciful. Polusplagcnov, is from poluv much, and splagcna the nobler entrails, used like our heart, as the seat of the emotions."
3. "The distinction between this and oijktirmwn, merciful, seems to be that the former denotes the general quality of compassion, while the latter emphasizes the sympathy called out by special cases, being the feeling which is moved to pain at another's suffering."
