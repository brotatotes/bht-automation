# James 5:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do not give in to the temptation to swear, whether it is provoked or not. The Jews were known for their common swearing, but the apostle James firmly prohibits all forms of swearing, especially in everyday conversation. He emphasizes the importance of this command by saying, above all things, swear not. Instead, let your yes be yes and your no be no, without the need for any higher asseverations. Ensure that your word is trustworthy and reliable in all your communications.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "So that we may safely say that the Apostle passes from their particular temptations under suffering to their general temptations in life."
2. "The omission of notice of this oath shows that James in this warning has in view only the abuse, common among the Jews generally and among his readers, of introducing in the common every-day affairs of life, instead of the common yea and nay, such asseverations as those here mentioned."
3. "The fact represented by both would be the same: confidence in men’s simple assertions and consequently absence of all need for asseveration."

### John Gill:
1. "As impatience should not show itself in secret sighs, groans, murmurings, and repinings, so more especially it should not break forth in rash oaths, or in profane swearing."
2. "An oath is very lawful, when taken in the fear and name of God, and made by the living God, and is used for the confirmation of anything of moment, and in order to put an end to strife."
