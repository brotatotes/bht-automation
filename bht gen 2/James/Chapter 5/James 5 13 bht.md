# James 5:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In times of affliction, it is important to turn to prayer instead of resorting to cursing. Prayer is not limited to difficult times; God invites us to come to Him at all times. Similarly, when we are in trouble, we should pray and seek God's help. In times of joy and prosperity, we should express our gratitude to God through singing praise. Singing psalms is one way to melodiously and vocally express our joy and thankfulness to God. So, whether in times of suffering or rejoicing, let us turn to prayer and praise to enrich our relationship with God.
