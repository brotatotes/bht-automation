# James 5:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When someone is sick, they are instructed to call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil. This anointing is not simply a human method of cure, but holds sacramental significance. The use of oil as a curative agent and a sign of divine grace is appropriate in performing miraculous cures. The prayers of the elders over the sick represent the whole church and are performed in the name of the Lord. This practice of anointing with oil and praying over the sick shows that they are standing before God and seeking His intervention.
