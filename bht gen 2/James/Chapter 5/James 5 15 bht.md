# James 5:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The prayer of faith, when offered in earnest, has the power to save the sick from their ailments and bring about their restoration. Through this act of faith, the forgiveness of sins may also be granted, allowing for both physical and spiritual healing. This prayer is not a guarantee of instantaneous healing, but rather a means of seeking divine intervention and cooperating with God's will. It is a plea for mercy and a recognition of the need for God's grace in times of illness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The prayer of faith shall save the sick man, and the Lord shall raise him up."
2. "Even if he have committed sins, it shall be forgiven him."
3. "The Apostle is treating of a matter totally distinct from the occasion, and the object, of extreme unction."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He does not say the oil shall save: it is but the symbol."
2. "The absolution of the sick, retained in the Church of England, refers to the sins which the sick man confesses and repents of, whereby outward scandal has been given to the Church and the cause of religion; not to sins in their relation to God, the only Judge."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The prayer of faith is to accompany the use of means, for all means would be ineffectual without the blessing of God."
2. "It may fairly be inferred from this statement: (1)That there would be cases in large numbers where these means would be attended with this happy result; and, (2)That there was so much encouragement to do it that it would be proper in any case of sickness so make use of these means."
3. "Thus used, there was ground of hope and of faith in regard to the recovery of the sufferer; and no one can show that in thousands of instances in the apostlesâ€™ day, and since, the prayer of faith, accompanying the proper use of means, may not have raised up those who were on the borders of the grave, and who but for these means would have died."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word originally means to work. Hence, 'him that is laboring under disease.'"
2. "The Greek gives a shade of meaning which can hardly be transferred neatly into English, representing not merely the fact that the man has sinned, but his condition as a sinner."
3. "Forgiveness is a putting or sending away of sins, with a consequent discharge of the sinner; thus differing from paresiv (Romans 3:25), which a passing by of sin, a pretermission as distinguished from a remission."

### John Calvin:
1. "Whosoever then really seeks to be heard, must be fully persuaded that he does not pray in vain."
2. "But since it appears that the Papists have no certainty as to their anointing, as it is manifest that they have not the gift, it is evident that their anointing is spurious."
3. "And we indeed see that David, when afflicted with disease and seeking relief, was wholly engaged in seeking the pardon of his sins."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Some understand by this, prayer uttered in faith believing prayer confidence in God as the Hearer of prayer."
2. "It would appear from Scripture that this faith must be possessed by both parties; the person who performs the miracle must be endowed with this miraculous faith; and the person on whom the miracle is wrought must have faith to be healed."
3. "We learn from the First Epistle to the Corinthians that this gift of healing was conferred by the Spirit upon many of the early Christians (1 Corinthians 12:9); and from the practice of the disciples of Christ, that they combined the anointing of oil with the exercise of this gift (Mark 6:13)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The prayer of faith shall save. No reference here to salvation of the soul. The medicine does not heal the sick, but it helps nature (God) do it. The doctor cooperates with God in nature." 
2. "The Lord shall raise him up. Precious promise, but not for a professional 'faith-healer' who scoffs at medicine and makes merchandise out of prayer." 
3. "And if he have committed sins. Supposing that he has committed sins as many sick people have. It shall be forgiven him. Not in any magical way, not because his sickness has been healed, not without change of heart and turning to God through Christ. Much is assumed here that is not expressed."

### John Gill:
1. "The prayer of faith shall save the sick... Such a prayer is a means of bringing down from God a blessing on the sick man, and of restoring him to his former health." 
2. "And if he have committed sins... in order to bring him to a sense of them, and to acknowledge them... they shall be forgiven him." 
3. "Indeed the removing the sickness or disease may be called the forgiveness of his sins."

### John Wesley:
1. And the prayer offered in faith shall save the sick - From his sickness; and if any sin be the occasion of his sickness, it shall be forgiven him.
