# James 5:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Elijah, though a great prophet, was not exempt from the weaknesses and flaws of human nature. In fact, he shared the same sinful inclinations as the rest of us. Yet, when facing a time of widespread idolatry, he turned to prayer. Interestingly, the phrase and he prayed in this context goes beyond a simple act of prayer. It signifies a fervent and persistent intercession. Elijah's prayer was not a casual utterance, but a passionate and unwavering plea to God.
