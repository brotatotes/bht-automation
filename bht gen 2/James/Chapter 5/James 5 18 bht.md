# James 5:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The heavens gave rain and the earth brought forth her fruit. The apostle chose to give this example because it was a common thing for the Jews to ask for rain and see their prayers answered. James wants to encourage believers, reminding them that even though they may be weak and imperfect, they should not be discouraged from praying. They should be earnest and fervent in their prayers, just as Elijah was, knowing that God hears and answers the prayers of His people.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The heavens gave rain and the earth brought forth." 
2. "Her fruit...quas ferre solet."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Mark the connection between the prayer and its accomplishment."
2. "Her fruit - her usual and due fruit, heretofore withheld on account of sin."
3. "Three and a half years is the time also that the two witnesses prophesy who 'have power to shut and open heaven that it rain not'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In such circumstances, it is to be fairly presumed that such a man would pray; but it is remarkable that it is not expressly mentioned, and quite as remarkable that James should have made his argument turn on a thing which is not expressly mentioned, but which seems to have been a matter of inference."
2. "It seems probable to me, therefore, that there was some tradition on which he relied, or that it was a common interpretation of the passage in 1 Kings, that Elijah prayed earnestly, and that this was generally believed by those to whom the apostle wrote."
3. "The case referred to here was indeed a miracle, but it was a case of the power of prayer, and therefore to the point."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And he prayed again. This, also, is not expressly mentioned in the Old Testament, but it is certainly implied."
2. "It is there said that ‘Elijah went up to the top of Carmel, and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees’ (1 Kings 18:42); that is, placed himself in the attitude of prayer."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Gave rain (υετον εδωκεν). This idiom is in the LXX of God as here of heaven."
2. "Hυετον is old word for rain (from υω, to rain), genuine here, but not in verse James 5:7."
3. "Brought forth (εβλαστησεν). First aorist active of βλαστανω, old verb, to sprout (intransitive as Mark 4:27), here as occasionally in later Greek transitive with accusative καρπον."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle chose to give this example, because it was a common thing for the Jews to ask for rain: we often read of such a doctor, that he prayed for rain, and it came; and of another, that he asked for the rains, and they descended." 
2. "His view is to observe, that the weakness and infirmities of the saints ought not to discourage them from prayer."
