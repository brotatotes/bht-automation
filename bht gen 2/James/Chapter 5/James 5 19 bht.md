# James 5:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Brethren, be watchful and attentive to those among you who may start drifting away from the truth of Christ. It is crucial that we intervene and bring them back, not only correcting their doctrinal and practical errors but also working to restore them to the path of truth and holiness. Our responsibility as believers extends beyond ourselves; we must actively watch over and help our brothers and sisters in their journey of faith. Let us labor diligently to recover those who have fallen, knowing that it is our calling to guide and support one another in the pursuit of truth.

2. "For this is to be understood of one who has embraced the Christian religion, become a member of a church, and has walked in the path of truth and holiness, but now fallen into error, either in principle, or in practice, or both."
