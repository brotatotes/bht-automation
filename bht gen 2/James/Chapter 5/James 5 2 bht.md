# James 5:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The riches mentioned here were not just material possessions, but also included large stores of corn and costly apparel. These treasures, however, were not a source of security or blessing, but rather a burden. The accumulation of wealth for its own sake, without any consideration for others or for the greater good, only leads to corruption and destruction. It is a reminder that our true treasure lies in our relationships with God and with our fellow human beings, rather than in earthly riches.
