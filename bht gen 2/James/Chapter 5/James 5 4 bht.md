# James 5:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The act of withholding the wages of laborers is not only a sin but also an act of fraud and inhumanity. It is a cry for justice that resonates with God, who hears the cries of the oppressed and is just in avenging their cause. Even though the wages may be kept back by the rich, the cries of the workers do not go unheard by the Lord of hosts, who takes notice of their mistreatment. These sins, which are often done in secret, are not hidden from God and will not go unpunished.
