# James 5:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They lived a life of excess and self-indulgence, satisfying their every desire without regard for others. Their pleasures were short-lived, only providing temporary satisfaction. They constantly sought to gratify their senses through lavish eating, drinking, and entertainment. They lived as if every day were a feast day, reveling in their own selfishness and not considering the consequences of their actions.

### Henry Alford:
1. "Ye luxuriated on the earth and wantoned, ye nourished your hearts in the day of slaughter."
2. "Similes sunt pecudibus quæ ipso adeo mactationis die se pascunt saginantque lætæ et securæ."
3. "Dicit ergo divites tota vita continuare festum."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "The same earth which has been the scene of your wantonness, shall be the scene of the judgment coming on you: instead of earthly delights ye shall have punishments."
3. "That is glutted your bodies like beasts to the full extent of your hearts' desire; ye live to eat, not eat to live."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A life of mere indolence and ease, of delicacy and luxury, is nowhere countenanced in the Bible; and even where unconnected with oppression and wrong to others, such a mode of living is regarded as inconsistent with the purpose for which God made man, and placed him on the earth."
2. "Such acts of oppression and wrong are commonly resorted to in order to obtain the means of luxurious living, and the gratification of sensual pleasures. In all countries where slavery exists, the things here referred to are found in close connection."
3. "They lived only to eat and drink, and to enjoy life. But, by such a course, they were as certainly preparing for perdition, as cattle were prepared to be killed by being stall-fed."

1. "Ye have lived delicately."
2. "'Etrufhsate denotes dainty living : this word, luxurious or prodigal living."
3. "The phrase day of slaughter is used for a day of judgment... According to this, the meaning is, the day of judgment, at the supposed near coming of Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "They who abound in wealth seldom keep within the bounds of moderation, but abuse their abundance by extreme indulgences." 
2. "The Lord allows them to live freely on what they have, yet profusion ought to be avoided and frugality practiced."
3. "For all these things have been said for this end, that we may know that moderation ought to be observed, and that extravagance is displeasing to God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Jews at this time were especially addicted to luxury and debauchery."
2. "You have nourished yourselves like fed beasts prepared for the slaughter."
3. "You have by your devotion to the service of your lusts, and by enjoying yourselves in all security, made yourselves ripe for the impending judgment."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Ye have lived delicately... to lead a soft life" (ετρυφησατε... τρυφη... to break down, to enervate).
2. "Ye have nourished... to feed, to fatten" (εθρεψατε... to fatten).
3. "They are fattening themselves like sheep or oxen all unconscious of 'the day of slaughter' (εν ημερα σφαγης)" (εν ημερα σφαγης... the day of slaughter).

### John Gill:
1. "Some made no use of their riches, either for themselves, or others; some did make use of them, and employed the poor, and then would not give them their wages; and others lived a voluptuous and luxurious life, indulged themselves in carnal lusts and pleasures, and gratified the senses by eating, drinking, gaming, and so were dead while they lived."
2. "The phrase suggests, that their pleasures were but short lived, but for a season, even while they were on earth; and that hereafter they would not live in pleasure."
3. "They indulged themselves in intemperance; they ate and drank, not merely what was necessary, and satisfying, and cheering to nature, but to excess, and gorged, and filled themselves in an extravagant manner."

### John Wesley:
1. Ye have cherished your hearts — Have indulged yourselves to the uttermost.As in a day of sacrifice — Which were solemn feast-days among the Jews.
