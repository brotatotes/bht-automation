# James 5:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The rich, in their corrupted judgments, oppressed and destroyed the righteous, reminiscent of how they crucified and condemned Christ himself. Their audacity towards those they oppressed was even greater, as they were without any protection. The poor faithful suffered injustice from the rich, who lived in sin and condemned both them and their religion. Yet the Lord, the Just One, would not resist them, allowing them to be secure for now, but His coming would bring swift justice.
