# James 5:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Be patient therefore, brethren, and let it continue even to the coming of the Lord. Then, like the husbandman who waits patiently for the precious fruit of the earth, be patient and steadfast in your faith until you receive the early and latter rain. Just as the farmer's hopes and patience are rewarded with a bountiful harvest, so too will your endurance be rewarded when the fruits of your labor are realized at the coming of the Lord.
