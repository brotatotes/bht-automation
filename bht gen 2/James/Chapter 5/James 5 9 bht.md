# James 5:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are urged to refrain from murmuring or grumbling against one another, instead being patient and forgiving. The presence of the Judge, identified as the Lord, is emphasized as a reminder that He is near and fully aware of our actions. This serves as a deterrent against passing judgment on others, as it invites the same judgment upon ourselves. Therefore, it is crucial to be cautious of our attitudes and actions, knowing that the Judge is standing at the door, ready to assess each individual according to their deeds.

They have a sour, dissatisfied, discontented temper; they see no excellence in other persons; they are displeased that others are more prospered, honored, and beloved than they are themselves; they are always complaining of what others do, not because they are injured, but because others seem to them to be weak and foolish."
