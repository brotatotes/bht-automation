# John 1:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the beginning denotes the timeless existence of the Word before the creation of the world. The Word, identified as the Son of God, is not a created being but the means by which God communicates and reveals Himself to humanity. The Word's involvement in the act of creation highlights the essential role the Son of God plays in the redemption of mankind. He is the eternal, supreme, and self-sufficient expression of God's nature. Recognizing the Word as the Son of God and comprehending His eternal essence adds depth and meaning to this passage.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "These words, if they do not assert, at least imply, the eternal pr√¶-existence of the Divine Word."
2. "The usage of œÄœÅœåœÇ here, as with (i.e. ‚Äòchez‚Äô), is sufficiently borne out by the reff."
3. "The rendering of the words being then as above, their meaning is the next question. The omission of the article before Œ∏ŒµœåœÇ is not mere usage; it could not have been here expressed, whatever place the words might hold in the sentence. Œ∏Œµ·Ω∏œÇ ·º¶ŒΩ would give a sense liable to the objections first stated, and destroy the idea of the ŒªœåŒ≥ŒøœÇ altogether."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Was the Word eternal? It was not the eternity of 'the Father,' but of a conscious personal existence distinct from Him and associated with Him."
2. "Was the Word thus 'with God?' It was not the distinctness and the fellowship of another being, as if there were more Gods than one, but of One who was Himself God."
3. "But why all this definition? Not to give us any abstract information about certain mysterious distinctions in the Godhead, but solely to let the reader know who it was that in the fullness of time 'was made flesh.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In both places it clearly means before creation, before the world was made, when as yet there was nothing."
2. "Whatever is meant by the term 'Word,' it is clear that it had an existence before 'creation.' It is not, then, a 'creature' or created being, and must be, therefore, uncreated and eternal."
3. "The Son of God may be called 'the Word,' because he is the medium by which God promulgates His will and issues His commandments."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "John elevates the phrase from its reference to a point of time, the beginning of creation, to the time of absolute pre - existence before any creation."
2. "The Logos was not merely existent, however, in the beginning, but was also the efficient principle, the beginning of the beginning."
3. "Christ is the inner conception 'in the bosom of His Father; ' and that is properly the Word."

### John Calvin:
1. "he is the eternal God, who was manifested in the flesh"
2. "to show it to have been necessary that the restoration of mankind should be accomplished by the Son of God, since by his power all things were created"
3. "he is the eternal Wisdom and Will of God; and... the lively image of His purpose"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In the beginning was the Word... They denote simply the point of time... the difference of thought... is to be found not in the meaning of 'beginning,' but in... the verb which he employs."
2. "He who thus ‚Äòwas in the beginning,‚Äô... here bears the name of ‚Äòthe Word‚Äô (Logos)... it is inconceivable that he can have taken up the term without reference to these doctrines. Hence it is with the history of the term that we first have to do."
3. "There is One by whom the Eternal and Invisible God reveals Himself: the Revealer is a Person: the Revealer is Himself God... God reveals Himself by the Word of God, who is God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In the beginning...John carries our thoughts beyond the beginning of creation in time to eternity." 
2. "The term ŒõŒøŒ≥ŒøœÇ is applied to Christ only... an incidental argument for identity of authorship." 
3. "By exact and careful language John denied Sabellianism by not saying Œø Œ∏ŒµŒøœÇ Œ∑ŒΩ Œø ŒªŒøŒ≥ŒøœÇ."

### John Gill:
1. "This is said not of the written word, but of the essential word of God, the Lord Jesus Christ."
2. "[Christ] is the word as the Son of God, as is evident from what is here attributed to him, and from the word being said to be so."
3. "This word, he says, was in the beginning; by which is meant, not the Father of Christ, but the Son only; and was he, he must be such a beginning as is without one."

### John Wesley:
1. "In the beginning ‚Äî When all things began to be made by the Word: in the beginning of heaven and earth, and this whole frame of created beings, the Word existed, without any beginning."
2. "The Word ‚Äî He is the Word whom the Father begat or spoke from eternity; by whom the Father speaking, maketh all things; who speaketh the Father to us."
3. "And the Word was God ‚Äî Supreme, eternal, independent. There was no creature, in respect of which he could be styled God in a relative sense. Therefore he is styled so in the absolute sense."
