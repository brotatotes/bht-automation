# John 1:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He was in the world, present since its creation, giving light and life to all creatures. The world itself, including everything in it, was made by Him, demonstrating His divine authority and pre-existence as the Son of God. However, tragically, the world did not recognize or acknowledge Him as its Creator, failing to appreciate the countless blessings and mercies bestowed upon them by Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He was in the world - This refers, probably, not to his pre-existence, but to the fact that he became incarnate; that he dwelt among human beings."
2. "The world was made by him - Not only 'men,' but all material things, were made by him."
