# John 1:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus came to his own, he came not only to a specific location, but also to his chosen people. He came to fulfill the promises and prophecies given to the Jewish nation, and to establish the fulfillment of God's plan. However, despite being their long-awaited Messiah, the people of Israel did not receive him as such. Their rejection of Jesus reflects the deep-seated unbelief and spiritual blindness that had characterized their history as a nation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "τὰ ἴδια here cannot well mean the world, or οἱ ἴδιοι mankind in general: it would be difficult to point out any Scripture usage to justify such a meaning."
2. "But abundance of passages bear out the meaning which makes τὰ ἴδια His own inheritance or possession, i.e. Judæa; and οἱ ἴδιοι, the Jews: compare especially the parable Matthew 21:33 ff., and Sir 24:7 ff."
3. "And thus ἦλθεν forms a nearer step in the approach to the declaration in John 1:14. He came to His own."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "His own (property or possession), for the word is in the neuter gender. It means His own land, city, temple, Messianic rights and possessions."
2. "His own (people), for now the word is masculine. It means the Jews, as the 'peculiar people.' Both they and their land, with all that this included, were 'HIS OWN,' not so much as part of 'the world which was made by Him,' but as 'THE HEIR' of the inheritance."
3. "Received him not, nationally, as God's chosen witnesses."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Over that land the laws of God had been extended, and that land had been regarded as especially his."
2. "They were his people, because God had chosen them to be his above all other nations; had given to them his laws; and had signally protected and favored them."
3. "They rejected him and put him to death, agreeably to the prophecy, Isaiah 53:3-4."

### John Calvin:
1. "Here is displayed the absolutely desperate wickedness and malice of men; here is displayed their execrable impiety, that when the Son of God was manifested in flesh to the Jews, whom God had separated to himself from the other nations to be His own heritage, he was not acknowledged or received."
2. "For there is an implied comparison, by which the Evangelist represents the heinous ingratitude of men. The Son of God had solicited an abode for himself in one nation; when he appeared there, he was rejected; and this shows clearly the awfully wicked blindness of men."
3. "He came... into his own. By this phrase the Evangelist compares the Jews with other nations; because by an extraordinary privilege they had been adopted into the family of God. Christ therefore was first offered to them as his own household, and as belonging to his empire by a peculiar right."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He came unto his own home, and his own accepted him not." - Is this verse practically a repetition of John 1:10, in language more solemn and emphatic?
2. "Every change seems to point to a more intimate relationship, a clearer manifestation, and a rejection that is still more without excuse."
3. "In the whole history of Israel had been illustrated unfaithfulness to the truth."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Unto his own things," the very idiom used in John 19:27 when the Beloved Disciple took the mother of Jesus "to his own home."
2. Probably here ο ιδιο means the Jewish people, the chosen people to whom Christ was sent first, but in a wider sense the whole world is included in ο ιδιο.
3. Israel slew the Heir (Hebrews 1:2) when he came, like the wicked husbandmen (Luke 20:14).

### John Gill:
1. "Not all the world, who are his own by right of creation; for these, his own, are opposed to the world, and distinguished from them; and his coming to them designs some particular favour, which is not vouchsafed to all."
2. "By his own are meant the whole body of the Jewish nation; so called, because they were chosen by the Lord above all people; had distinguishing favours bestowed upon them, as the adoption, the covenants, the promises, the giving of the law, and the service of God; and had the Shekinah, and the symbol of the divine presence in a remarkable manner among them."
3. "Now Christ, the word, came to the Jews before his incarnation, not only in types, personal and real, and in promises and prophecies, and in the word and ordinances, but in person."

### John Wesley:
1. "He came in the fulness of time, to his own - Country, city, temple." 
2. "His own - People, received him not."
