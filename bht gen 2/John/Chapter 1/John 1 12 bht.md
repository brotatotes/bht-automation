# John 1:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As believers receive Jesus, they become sons of God and receive the Spirit of God in their hearts, enabling them to cry out to God as their loving Father. This immediate transformation in status and relationship is a result of faith and signifies the special favor bestowed upon them through the adoption of grace. They are not simply believers in Jesus but become his children, enjoying the privileges and everlasting inheritance that come with this intimate and undeserved union with God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἔλαβον = παρέλαβον above as many as recognized Him as that which He was the Word of God and Light of men." 
2. "ἔδωκεν αὐτ. ἐξουσ. ] ἐξουσ. is not merely capability = δύναμιν (Lücke), still less privilege or prerogative (Chrysost. and others), but power (De Wette); involving all the actions and states needful to their so becoming, and removing all the obstacles in their way (e.g. the wrath of God, and the guilt of sin)."
3. "τέκνα θ. γενέσθαι ] The spiritual life owes its beginning to a birth from above, ch. John 3:3-7. And this birth is owing to the Holy Spirit of God; so that this is equivalent to saying, 'As many as received Him, to them gave He His Holy Spirit.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But as many—individuals, of the 'disobedient and gainsaying people' gave he power—The word signifies both authority and ability, and both are certainly meant here."
2. "Jesus is the Son of God; He is never said to have become such."
3. "Believe on his name—a phrase never used in Scripture of any mere creature, to express the credit given to human testimony, even of prophets or apostles, inasmuch it carries with it the idea of trust proper only towards GOD."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To receive him," here, means to "believe" on him.
2. "Sons of God" - Children of God by adoption.
3. The "name" of a person is often put for the person himself.

### John Calvin:
1. "The Evangelist declares that their condition is changed, because the Jews have been rejected, and their place, which had been left empty, is occupied by the Jews; for it is as if he transferred the right of adoption to strangers."
2. "The Evangelist adds, that they become the sons of God, not by the will which belongs to the flesh, but when they are born of God."
3. "Christ exhibited an astonishing instance of his grace in conferring this honor on such persons, so that they began, all at once, to be sons of God; and the greatness of this privilege is justly extolled by the Evangelist."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The thought of this verse is, that the darkness overcame it not!"
2. "The gift is not directly stated as 'sonship,' perhaps because the full manifestation of this blessing belongs to the latter days alone."
3. "It is very important to discriminate between the different phrases which John uses in relation to belief or faith. On the one hand we have the simple expression 'to believe Him,' usually denoting the acceptance of something said as true. On the other hand, we find very frequently in the New Testament, but especially in the writings of John, a remarkable combination of 'believe' with a preposition literally meaning 'into,' by which is denoted not merely an acceptance of words or professions, but such an acceptance of the Person trusted, such an approach of the heart towards Him, as leads to union with Him."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "As many as received him, in contrast with those who did not, exceptional action on the part of the disciples and other believers." 
2. "It is possible that John prefers 'τα τεκνα του θεου' for the spiritual children of God whether Jew or Gentile because of the community of nature."

2. "To be the sons of God is a very special favour...by adopting grace: and in this, Christ, the word, has a concern."
3. "Christ, the word, or Son of God...actually bestows upon them the 'power'...the honour and dignity conferred...an undeserved and distinguishing one...attended with many other privileges...an everlasting one...the open right which believers have unto this privilege, and their claim of it." (129 words)

### John Wesley:
1. "The moment they believe, they are sons."
2. "Because they are sons, God sendeth forth the Spirit of his Son into their hearts."
