# John 1:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
All those who are born again and become children of God, do not obtain this sonship through their physical birth or ancestry. It is not a matter of mere title or privilege, but a transformation of nature. This new birth, also known as regeneration, is a spiritual process initiated by God. It is not something that can be earned by human effort or the desire of man. It is a divine work, not of blood or human will, but solely of God's grace and power.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "John here negatives any such claim, and asserts the exclusive divine birth of all who become children of God by faith."
2. "The conjunctions here rise in climax from one clause to another."
3. "Or perhaps this may be earned somewhat further, and we may better satisfy the climax by regarding the ἐξ αἱμάτων as indicating the mere phenomena of physical generation wherever found: then rising to ἐκ θελήματος σαρκός, the instigation of that capacity by sexual desire: then rising still higher to the most exalted instance of that desire, ἐκ θελήματος ἀνδρός."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Which were born - a sonship, therefore not of mere title and privilege, but of nature, the soul being made conscious of the vital capacities, perceptions, and emotions of a child of God, before unknown."
2. "not of blood, &c. - not of superior human descent, not of human generation at all, not of man in any manner of way."
3. "but of God - Right royal gift, and He who confers must be absolutely divine. For who would not worship Him who can bring him into the family, and evoke within him the very life, of the sons of God?"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It means that they did not become the children of God in virtue of their natural birth, or because they were the children of 'Jews,' or because they were descended from pious parents."
2. "The term 'to be born' is often used to denote this change. It illustrates clearly and beautifully this great change. The natural birth introduces us to life. The new birth is the beginning of spiritual life."
3. "None will go to heaven simply because their 'parents' are Christians. That this work is the work of God, and 'no man' can do it for us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The three clauses, however, really express but one main idea; what that is must be learnt from the contrast in the closing words, ‘but (they were begotten) of God.’"
2. "These believers have received the right to become ‘children of God’ by virtue of a true spiritual filiation, being begotten of God."
3. "The contrast to such a sonship is the very claim which is so strongly made by the Jews in chap. 8, and the validity of which our Lord altogether denies."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "By spiritual generation (of God, εκ θεου), not by physical (εξ αιματων)."
2. "But b of the old Latin reads qui natus est and makes it refer to Christ and so expressly teach the Virgin Birth of Jesus."
3. "The Virgin Birth is doubtless implied in verse John 1:14, but it is not stated in verse John 1:13."

### John Gill:
1. "The birth, here spoken of, is regeneration, expressed by a being born again, or from above; by a being quickened by the Spirit and grace of God; by Christ being formed in men; and by a partaking of the divine nature."
2. "Nor is regeneration owing to the blood of ancestors, to natural descent, as from Abraham, which the Jews valued themselves upon; for sin, and not grace, is conveyed by natural generation."
3. "Regeneration is ascribed to another will and power, even to the will and power of God, and denied of this."

### John Wesley:
1. "Who were born — Who became the sons of God, not of blood."
2. "By natural generation, nor by the will of man - adopting them, but of God - by his Spirit."
