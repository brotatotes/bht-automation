# John 1:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The word 'flesh' is used here to represent human nature and not just a physical body. The Son of God humbled Himself and became fully human in order to have true fellowship and communion with us. This union of divinity and humanity in Christ is the foundation of His work as a Mediator, allowing Him to redeem and reconcile us to God. Those who witnessed His earthly life and ministry could attest to the glory that radiated from Him, depicting the perfect combination of grace, love, wisdom, and power that characterized Jesus, the Son of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He became that, of which man is in the body compounded."
2. "The simplicity of this expression is no doubt directed against the Docetæ of the Apostle’s time, who maintained that the Word only apparently took human nature."
3. "But obviously in the midst of ideas reaching so far deeper than that of regard, or love, of the Father for the Son, the word cannot be interpreted except in accordance with them. It refers to, and contrasts with, the τέκνα τοῦ θεοῦ in John 1:12-13."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But now, married to our nature, henceforth He is as personally conscious of all that is strictly human as of all that is properly divine and our nature is in His Person redeemed and quickened, ennobled and transfigured."
2. "He dwelt among us full of grace and truth"; or, in Old Testament phrase, "Mercy and truth," denoting the whole fruit of God's purposes of love towards sinners of mankind, which until now existed only in promise, and the fulfilment at length of that promise in Christ; in one great word, "the SURE MERCIES of David."
3. "His glory was 'spiritually discerned'—the glory of surpassing grace, love, tenderness, wisdom, purity, spirituality; majesty and meekness, richness and poverty, power and weakness, meeting together in unique contrast; ever attracting and at times ravishing the 'babes' that followed and forsook all for Him."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'flesh,' here, is evidently used to denote 'human nature' or 'man.'"
2. "The expression, then, means that he became a man, and that he became such by the power of God providing for him a body."
3. "He was kind, merciful, gracious, doing good to all, and seeking man's welfare by great sacrifices and love; so much so, that it might be said to be characteristic of him, or he 'abounded' in favors to mankind."

### John Calvin:
1. "The word Flesh expresses the meaning of the Evangelist more forcibly than if he had said that he was made man. He intended to show to what a mean and despicable condition the Son of God, on our account, descended from the height of his heavenly glory."
2. "The first is, that two natures were so united in one Person in Christ, that one and the same Christ is true God and true man."
3. "The second is, that the unity of person does not hinder the two natures from remaining distinct, so that his Divinity retains all that is peculiar to itself, and his humanity holds separately whatever belongs to it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He who was in the beginning, who was with God, who was God, ‘became flesh;’ did not merely take to Him a human body, did not merely become an individual man, but assumed  human nature in its entireness...entered into such a condition that He could have perfect communion and fellowship with us, and we with Him." 
2. "The word ‘became’ does not denote that His divine nature was laid aside, and that His mode of being was simply human...What is really indicated is the passing into a new state, a transition rather than a transformation."
3. "The glory was like that of an only son sent from a father; no image but this...can express the twofold character of the glory, as at once derivative and on a level with its source."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Pre-existence of the Logos has already been plainly stated and argued."
2. "John does not here say that the Logos entered into a man or dwelt in a man or filled a man."
3. "By this word John insists that in the human Jesus he beheld the Shekinah glory of God who was and is the Logos who existed before with God."

### John Gill:
1. "Flesh here signifies the whole human nature, to show that it was a real human nature, and not a phantom or appearance that he assumed."
2. "Christ remained what he was, and became what he was not; they are so united as to be but one person, and this union is the foundation of the virtue and efficacy of all Christ's works as Mediator."
3. "The glory of his divine nature is transcendent to all creatures, and there were some breakings forth of this glory in his incarnate state, observed by the evangelist and his companions, who saw plainly that Christ was possessed of divine perfections such as omniscience and omnipotence." (123 words)

### John Wesley:
1. "Flesh sometimes signifies corrupt nature; sometimes the body; sometimes, as here, the whole man."
2. "And in order to raise us to this dignity and happiness, the eternal Word, by a most amazing condescension, was made flesh, united himself to our miserable nature, with all its innocent infirmities."
3. "And we who are now recording these things beheld his glory with so strict an attention, that we can testify, it was in every respect such a glory as became the only begotten of the Father."
