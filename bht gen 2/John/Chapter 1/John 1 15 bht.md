The witness of John abides, a clear and bold cry that exalts Christ and debases the creature. This testimony echoes through the years, resonating in the hearts of believers.

2. "The voice is still sounding."
3. "He existed, was in being, before me."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "My Successor is my Superior, for He was my Predecessor."
2. "This enigmatic play upon the different senses of the words 'before' and 'after' was doubtless employed by the Baptist to arrest attention, and rivet the thought."
3. "The Evangelist introduces it just to clinch his own statements."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He that cometh after me - He of whom I am the forerunner, or whose way I am come to prepare."
2. "He was before me - This can refer to nothing but his pre-existence, and can be explained only on the supposition that he existed before John, or, as the evangelist had before shown, from the beginning."
3. "We may learn here that it is one mark of the true spirit of a minister of Christ to desire and feel that Christ is always to be preferred to ourselves."

### John Calvin:
1. "By using the verb testifieth in the present tense, he denotes a continued act, and certainly this doctrine must be continually in force, as if the voice of John were continually resounding in the ears of men."
2. "He means that his intention was, from the beginning, to make Christ known, and that this was the design of his public discourses; as, indeed, there was no other way in which he could discharge his office as ambassador than by calling his disciples to Christ."
3. "But as he arose later in the order of time, John reminds his hearers that this is no reason why he should not be preferred to himself, as his rank deserved.

1. "And with the nature of his ministry, which was clear, open, and public; and performed with vigor, and in a powerful manner, with much assurance and certainty, with boldness and intrepidity, and with great zeal and fervency, and in an evangelical way; for it was such a cry as debased the creature, and exalted Christ." 
2. "And by all Gospel ministers, and every true believer; and good reason there is for it: for he was before me." 
3. "But of his eternal existence, as the word, and Son of God, who was before John, or any of the prophets; before Abraham, and Noah, and Adam, or any creature whatever."
