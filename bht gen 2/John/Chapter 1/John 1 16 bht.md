## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Joh 1:15 is not parenthetical, but confirmatory of John 1:14, and this verse grounds itself on the fact of John 1:14, corroborated by the testimony of John 1:15, that He dwelt among us, and that we saw His glory, full of grace and truth."
2. "τὸ πλήρωμα is that of which He was πλήρης, John 1:14, and is not connected with the Gnostic pleroma at all."
3. "The prep. ἀντί is properly used of any thing which supersedes another, or occupies its place. This is in fact its ordinary usage when exchange is spoken of: the possession of the thing gotten succeeds to, supersedes, the possession of the thing given in exchange, and I possess τοῦτο ἀντὶ ἐκείνου. Thus also we have received χάριν ἀντὶ χάριτος continual accessions of grace; new grace coining upon and superseding the former."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Grace for grace—that is, grace upon grace...in successive communications and larger measures." 
2. "Grace being the chosen New Testament word for the whole fulness of the new covenant, all that dwells in Christ for men."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Of his fulness - In John 1:14 the evangelist has said that Christ was 'full of grace and truth.' Of that 'fullness' he now says that all the disciples had received; that is, they derived from his abundant truth and mercy grace to understand the plan of salvation, to preach the gospel, to live lives of holiness." 
2. "The declaration had not exclusive reference, probably, to the apostles, but it is extended to all Christians, for all believers have received of the 'fulness of grace and truth' that is in Christ."
3. "Our Saviour is represented as the fulness of God - as 'abounding' in mercy, as exhibiting the divine attributes, and as possessing in himself all that is necessary to fill his people with truth, and grace, and love."

### John Calvin:
1. "True, indeed, the fountain of life, righteousness, virtue, and wisdom, is with God, but to us it is a hidden and inaccessible fountain."
2. "He declares in general, that out of Christ we ought not to seek any thing good, though this sentence consists of several clauses."
3. "The meaning would be more simple if you were to take the word for (ἀντὶ) comparatively, as meaning, that whatever graces God bestows on us, proceed equally from the same source."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In John 1:9 we have had the fact of what the Word bestows. Here we have more. We have the answer of Christian experience to the fact. We have not merely the light lightening, but the light appropriated, its value appreciated, its power felt." 
2. "The fulness spoken of is that of grace and truth, which so reside in the Incarnate Word that nothing more can be added. It is an absolute, not a comparative fulness, a proof again that no part of that fulness is to be won back in the progress of the Messianic work."
3. "Not exactly 'grace upon grace,' as if the meaning were successive measures of grace, one added to another; but grace given in fresh measure as each preceding measure has been improved, the 'fulness' constantly more and more made ours until we 'are fulfilled unto all the fulness of God' (Ephesians 3:19). It is Christian experience again."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Of his fulness...the attributes of God summed up in Christ"
2. "John appeals to all his own contemporaries as participants with him in the fulness of the Logos."
3. "Grace for grace...new grace for the new day and the new service."

### John Gill:
1. "His fulness of grace and truth is dispensatory, and is in him, on purpose to be communicated unto others: and 'of it', the evangelist says, 'have all we received'."
2. "Faith is the hand which receives Christ, and grace from him; and the act of receiving, being expressed in the past tense, seems to regard first conversion, when faith is first wrought, and along with it abundance of grace is received."
3. "Grace for grace, is the same with grace upon grace, heaps of grace; and that the phraseology is the same with this Jewish one, 'goodness upon that goodness', an additional goodness; so here, grace upon grace, an abundance of it, an addition to it, and an increase of it."

### John Wesley:
1. "He is indeed preferred before thee: so we have experienced."
2. "We all - That believe: have received - All that we enjoy out of his fulness."
3. "Grace upon grace - One blessing upon another, immeasurable grace and love."
