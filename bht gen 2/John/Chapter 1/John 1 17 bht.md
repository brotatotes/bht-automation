# John 1:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The law given by Moses was preparatory, a shadow of the reality and power that came through Jesus Christ. While the law revealed the consciousness of sin and the need for redemption, it could not provide the fullness of grace and truth that Jesus brought. The law pointed to the obligations of man towards God and others, whereas the Gospel exhibited the love and favor of God towards humanity. St. John carefully chose words to accurately express the superiority of Christ's grace over the limitations of the law.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We received from His fulness continual additions of grace, because that fulness is not, like the law, a positive enactment, finite and circumscribed, of which it could be said that it ἐδόθη, but the bringing in of grace and truth, which ἐγένετο by Jesus Christ." 
2. "Certainly, the distinction must not be lost sight of, nor denied, as Lücke attempts to do: for Bengel truly observes: “Nullus philosophus tam accurate verba ponit, differentiamque eorum observat, quam Johannes, in hoc præsertim capite.”
3. "I must again caution the student against any such wholly inadequate explanations as that these words are put ‘per hendiadyn’ for χάρις ἀληθινή. It is in this way that the depths of Scripture have been covered over by the rubbish of expositors."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Law elicits the consciousness of sin and the need of redemption; it only typifies the reality." 
2. "The Gospel, on the contrary, actually communicates reality and power from above."
3. "Hence Paul terms the Old Testament 'shadow,' while he calls the New Testament 'substance'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The law worketh wrath...it was preparatory to another state of things. The gospel succeeded that and took its place." 
2. "Grace and truth came by Jesus Christ - A system of religion full of favors, and the 'true' system, was revealed by him."
3. "We may learn from these verses: 1. That all our mercies come from Jesus Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Evangelist therefore shows how far inferior the ministry of Moses was to the power of Christ."
2. "This at least is certain, that the Evangelist means, that in the Law there was nothing more than a shadowy image of spiritual blessings, but that they are actually found in Christ."
3. "And yet it must not be supposed that anything was exhibited by the Law in a manner fitted to deceive; for Christ is the soul which gives life to that which would otherwise have been dead under the law."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The law is not undervalued. It was divine. It was a gift of God. It was a gift through the great Lawgiver of whom Israel was proud."
2. "Now, however, there has ‘come’ (a far higher word than ‘was given’) a fulness of grace and truth, within which we stand, and which we are to appropriate more and more."
3. "And now comes in the great Name as yet unnamed, but named now in all the universality of its application, the Name which embraces historical Christianity in its whole extent as the religion both of Jew and Gentile, the religion of man."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "By Moses. 'Through Moses' as the intermediate agent of God." 
2. "By Jesus Christ. 'Through Jesus Christ,' the intermediate agent of God the Father."
3. "John's theology is here pictured by the words 'grace and truth,' each with the article and each supplementary to the other."

### John Gill:
1. "The moral law was given to Adam, in innocence...points out what is man's duty both to God and men; discovers sin, accuses of it, convicts of it, and condemns for it."
2. "The ceremonial law pointed out the pollution of human nature, the guilt and punishment of sin; was a type and shadow of deliverance by Christ."
3. "By grace and truth, is meant the Gospel, in opposition to the law; which is called grace, because it is a declaration of the love, and grace, of God to men; it ascribes salvation, in all the parts of it, to the free grace and favour of God."

### John Wesley:
1. "The law of Moses was not his own. The grace of Christ was. His grace was opposite to the wrath, his truth to the shadowy ceremonies of the law."
2. "No philosopher, poet, or orator, ever chose his words so accurately as St. John."
3. "The law, saith he, was given by Moses: grace was by Jesus Christ."
