## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Moses could not give out of the πλήρωμα of grace and truth, for he had no immediate sight of God, and no man can have: there is but One who can ἐξηγεῖσθαι θεόν, the μονογενὴς υἱός, who is no mere man, but abides in the bosom of the Father." 
2. "The expression signifies, as Chrysostom observes, συγγένεια καὶ ἑνότης τῆς οὐσίας: and is derived from the fond and intimate union of children and parents."
3. "'He, and none else:' an emphatic exclusive expression."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "No one has seen God - by immediate gaze, or direct intuition."
2. "In the bosom of the Father - expressing His immediate and most endeared access to, and absolute acquaintance with, Him."
3. "He and He only hath declared Him."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jesus 'had an intimate knowledge of God,' which neither Moses nor any of the ancient prophets had possessed."
2. "Jesus had a knowledge of God such as one friend has of another - knowledge of his character, designs, and nature which no other one possesses."
3. "This verse proves that Jesus had a knowledge of God above that which any of the ancient prophets had, and that the fullest revelations of his character are to be expected in the gospel."

### John Calvin:
1. "This passage is usually explained thus that as the naked majesty of God is concealed within himself, he never could be comprehended, except so far as he revealed himself in Christ; and therefore that it was only in Christ that God was formerly known to the fathers."
2. "He therefore magnifies the manifestation of God, which has been brought to us by the gospel, in which he distinguishes us from the fathers, and shows that we are superior to them."
3. "I maintain that that sight is not at all to be compared with ours; but as God was accustomed at that time to exhibit himself obscurely, and, as it were, from a distance, those to whom he was more clearly revealed say that they saw him face to face."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "No one hath seen God at any time... The Evangelist answers, No. One has ‘declared’ Him, has, as the Word, unfolded and explained Him."
2. "He is ‘only begotten,’ Son among all other sons in His own peculiar sense, who is fully able to represent the Father, to whom all the perfections of the Father flow."
3. "He is ‘in the bosom of the Father.’... In Him God is revealed as a Father; without Him He can be revealed only as God... Out of that element of love, or of grace and truth, the Son comes; into it He returns."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "God no one has ever seen." 
2. "The Logos is plainly called θεος in verse John 1:1."

### John Gill:
1. "God is seen in the works of creation and providence, in the promises, and in his ordinances; but above all, in Christ the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person."
2. "The phrase, which is in the bosom of the Father, denotes unity of nature, and essence, in the Father and Son; their distinct personality; strong love, and affection between them; the Son's acquaintance with his Father's secrets; his being at that time, as the Son of God, in the bosom of his Father, when here on earth, as the son of man; and which qualified him to make the declaration of him."
3. "He has made, and delivered a fuller revelation of these things, than ever was yet; and to which no other revelation in the present state of things will be added."

### John Wesley:
1. "No man hath seen God — With bodily eyes: yet believers see him with the eye of faith."
