## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "αὕτη is the predicate, ἡ μαρτυρία the subject, in the present form of the sentence. So very frequently in St. John, where commonly the mistake is made of supposing the demonstrative pronoun to be the subject, whereas it is ever the predicate of identification."
2. "John alone of the Evangelists uses this expression; principally as designating the chiefs of the Jewish people, the members of the Sanhedrim."
3. "This was a formal deputation; priests and Levites, constituting the two classes of persons employed about the service of the temple, are sent officially to enquire into the pretensions of the new Teacher."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "record—testimony."
2. "the Jews—that is, the heads of the nation, the members of the Sanhedrim."
3. "In this peculiar sense our Evangelist seems always to use the term."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'record' here means 'testimony,' in whatever way given."
2. "John’s testimony was given without writing."
3. "These were probably members of the Sanhedrin."

### John Calvin:
1. "John openly confessed for what purpose he was sent by God." 
2. "The minds of all were aroused to expect the Messiah."
3. "It is evident, therefore, that a report about John was widely spread and aroused the minds of all; and this was arranged by the wonderful Providence of God, that this testimony might be more strikingly complete."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The words ‘this is the witness of John’ do not necessarily mean ‘this witness which follows is the witness of John;’ the Evangelist’s ordinary usage in similar cases suggests that the sense intended is rather, ‘And of this kind confirmatory of the preceding statements is the witness,’ etc."
2. "In this mention of ‘the Jews’ we meet for the first time with one of the most characteristic terms of the Fourth Gospel."
3. "The question, ‘Who art thou?’ has reference to the supposed personal claims of the Baptist. Might it not be that one who had so suddenly appeared in the wilderness, and who had produced so profound an effect upon all classes, was the very Messiah anxiously waited for at this time?"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He had twice already alluded to it and now he proceeds to give it as the most important item to add after the Prologue."
2. "The story in John proceeds along the same lines as in the Synoptics. There is increasing unfolding of Christ to the disciples with increasing hostility on the part of the Jews till the final consummation in Jerusalem."
3. "The committee from the Sanhedrin put the question sharply up to John to define his claims concerning the Messiah."

### John Gill:
1. "John appearing as a prophet, and being so esteemed by the people, they deputed messengers to him to interrogate him, and know who he was."
2. "A message from so august an assembly, at so great a distance, was doing John a great deal of honour, and serves to make his testimony of Christ the more public and remarkable."
3. "The question they put by their messengers might not be, as some have thought, to ensnare John, nor out of disrespect to Jesus, who, as yet, was not made manifest; but might be in good earnest, having, from many circumstances, reason to think there might be something in the people's opinion of him."

### John Wesley:
1. The Jews — Probably the great council sent.
