## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "John recalls the reader's attention to the two first clauses of John 1:1, in order to direct the mind to the difference (in unity) between this ŒªœåŒ≥ŒøœÇ and ·ΩÅ Œ∏ŒµœåœÇ."
2. "Thus also this verse fixes the reference of Œ±·ΩêœÑŒø·ø¶ in John 1:3, which might otherwise, after the mention of Œ∏ŒµœåœÇ, have seemed ambiguous."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
2. The stress is laid upon the eternal distinctness of the Word from God the Father.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Word, or the ŒªŒøÃÅŒ≥ŒøœÇ Logos, was in the beginning with God - ...and assures us that that union was not one which was commenced in time, and which might be, therefore, a mere union of feeling, or a compact, like that between any other beings, but was one which existed in eternity, and which was therefore a union of nature or essence."
2. "He now expresses that idea, and assures us that that union was not one which was commenced in time."
3. "John had said that he existed before the creation, and that he was 'with God;' but he had not said in the first verse 'that the union with God existed in the beginning.'"

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "The connection between creation and redemption is closer than is commonly apprehended."
3. "Because God made man, He loves him, educates him, bears with him, carries on the race on the line of His infinite patience, is burdened with its perverseness and blindness, and expresses and effectuates all this in the incarnation and redemptive work of Jesus Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Speech always was, and he was with God."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "The elements of the thought have been given in John 1:1, but in their combination they acquire new force."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "John clearly states of the Logos Pre-existence before Incarnation, Personality, Deity."
