# John 1:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This confession, made openly and formally, demonstrates the honesty and authenticity of John the Baptist. He did not entertain or give any ground to the notion that he was the expected Messiah, even though many believed he could be. Instead, he humbly depreciated his own status and emphasized the coming of the One who was greater than him. John's steadfast denial that he was the Christ serves as a powerful example of the true spirit of a minister of the gospel, faithfully pointing others to Jesus.
