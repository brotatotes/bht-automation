# John 1:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jews were expecting the literal return of Elijah before the coming of the Messiah, but John the Baptist clarifies that he is not the same Elijah they were anticipating. Instead, he is the Elijah mentioned by the prophet Malachi, someone who prepares the way for the Messiah. Although the deputation may have asked John the Baptist if he was the prophet mentioned by Moses, John does not deny being that prophet. Rather, he affirms that he is a prophet, even greater than those of the Old Testament.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The whole appearance of John reminded them of Elias."
2. "The right explanation of this answer seems to be the usual one, that the deputation asked the question in a mistaken and superstitious sense."
3. "From the prophecy of Moses, Deuteronomy 18:15; Deuteronomy 18:18, the Jews expected some particular prophet to arise, distinct from the Messiah."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Elias - in His own proper person."
2. "That prophet - announced in Deuteronomy 18:15, &c."
3. "About whom they seem not to have been agreed whether he were the same with the Messiah or no."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Jews expected that Elijah would appear before the Messiah came."
2. "In this sense John denied that he was Elijah; but he did not deny that he was the Elias or Elijah which the prophet intended, for he immediately proceeds to state that he was sent, as it was predicted that Elijah would be, to prepare the way of the Lord."
3. "It is possible that the Jews supposed that not only 'Elijah' would reappear before the coming of the Messiah, but also 'Jeremiah'."

### John Calvin:
1. "It was because they learned from the prediction of Malachi 4:2, that when the Messiah, the Sun of Righteousness, should arise, Elijah would be the morning star to announce his approach."
2. "Rather do they by this term point out the office of John, and ask if God had appointed him to be a prophet."
3. "Such was the case with John the Baptist, to whom God had given no other injunction than to prepare the Jews for listening to Christ, and becoming his disciples."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The question was a natural one, for the thought of the coming of Elijah was intimately associated with that of the coming of Messiah." 
2. "It is possible that even the Baptist himself did not know that he was 'Elijah' in this latter sense."
3. "The main point with the Baptist is to show that, strictly speaking, he is simply the herald of that era. He is only to prepare the way for Him in whom it both begins and is completed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Why then does John here flatly deny it? Because the expectation was that Elijah would return in person. This John denies. Jesus only asserts that John was Elijah in spirit."
2. "I am not. Short and blunt denial."
3. "No. Shortest possible denial."

### John Gill:
1. "The Jews had a notion that that prophet would come in person a little before the coming of the Messiah."
2. "John's answer is to the intention of their question, and their own meaning in it, and is no contradiction to what Christ says of him."
3. "He was not like one of the prophets of the Old Testament; he was a prophet, and more than a prophet."
