# John 1:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The question of who John the Baptist is kept persisting, as the people were eager to know his true identity. They wanted a positive account from him regarding his person, instead of him simply denying being the Christ, Elijah, or the prophet. The purpose behind their inquiry was to provide a proper answer to those who had sent them, ensuring that their efforts were not in vain. They insisted on John declaring openly and honestly who he was and what his role and purpose entailed.
