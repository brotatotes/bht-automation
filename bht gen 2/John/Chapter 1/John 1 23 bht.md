# John 1:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
I am the voice, the forerunner of Christ, just as Isaiah prophesied, John confidently declares. He acknowledges that his role is merely that of a voice, a temporary proclamation that fades away once its message is delivered. This humble admission emphasizes his position as a herald, not the Messiah himself. In quoting Isaiah 40:3, John reinforces his significant role in preparing the way for the coming of the Lord.
