# John 1:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Pharisees, being the strictest sect of religion among the Jews, were very zealous in upholding the traditions of the elders. They were known for their knowledge, learning, devotion, and sanctity. Therefore, when they sent a delegation to question John the Baptist, it was because they were deeply concerned about any potential changes to religious customs, unless such changes were backed by clear Divine authority.
