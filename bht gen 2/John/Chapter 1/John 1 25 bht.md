# John 1:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The individuals questioning the one baptizing in this passage seem to be puzzled by his authority to baptize without being a forerunner of the Messiah. They may be questioning why he is baptizing if he is not claiming to be a prophet or the Messiah himself. These questioners may not have considered that the practice of baptism had changed, as previously it was common to baptize gentile converts, but not Jews. They may also have expected such a significant ordinance to be introduced by someone with a greater reputation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This question shews probably that they did not interpret Isa 40:3 of any herald of the Messiah."
2. "They regarded baptism as a significant token of the approach of the Messianic Kingdom."
3. "They asked, ‘Why baptizest thou, if thou art no forerunner of the Messiah?’"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Thinking he disclaimed any special connection with Messiah's kingdom..."
2. "They demand his right to gather disciples by baptism."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Baptism on receiving a proselyte from 'paganism' was common before the time of John, but it was not customary to baptize a 'Jew.' John had changed the custom." 
2. "They presumed, from the fact that he introduced that change, that he claimed to be a prophet or the Christ. They supposed that no one would attempt it without 'pretending,' at least, authority from heaven." 
3. "They were blind, and manifested, as all sinners do, a remarkable slowness in understanding the plainest truths in religion."

### John Calvin:
1. "If thou art not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor a prophet; for it does not belong to every man to institute the practice of baptism."
2. "The prophets of God, they readily grant, have a right to discharge the office committed to them."
3. "They conclude, therefore, that for John to baptize is an unlawful novelty, since he has received from God no public station."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The ‘Jews,’ the representatives of the theocratic spirit of the people, had been mainly concerned about the position of the Baptist in relation to the national hopes."
2. "The Pharisees concern themselves more about the rite administered by the Baptist. It is the baptism of persons belonging to the chosen people that startles them."
3. "But that one who, by his own confession, was neither the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet, should thus administer a rite symbolical of cleansing to those who, as Jews, were already clean, this it was that threw them into perplexity."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They did not interpret his claim to be 'the voice' to be important enough to justify the ordinance of baptism."
2. "Abrahams shows that proselyte baptism was probably practiced before John's time, but its use by John was treating the Jews as if they were themselves Gentiles."

### John Gill:
1. "They demand...what commission he had from God to baptize."
2. "From hence it appears, that the Jews expected that baptism would be administered in the times of the Messiah and his forerunner."
3. "Likewise, it is clear from hence, that they expected that this ordinance would be first administered by some person of very great note."

### John Wesley:
1. "Why baptizest thou then?"
2. "Without any commission from the sanhedrim? And not only heathens (who were always baptized before they were admitted to circumcision) but Jews also?"
