# John 1:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
John the Baptist's statement I baptize is meant to signify his role in preparing people for the coming of the Messiah. By baptizing individuals, both Jews and Gentiles, John was demonstrating the need for all people to repent and be cleansed of their sins. This act of baptism served as a symbol of the need for all to become followers of Christ and be united with Him. The baptism performed by John emphasized the universality of salvation and the necessity for all people to embrace the message of Christ.
