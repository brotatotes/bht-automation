# John 1:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
John the Baptist recognizes that while he came before Christ in time and ministry, Jesus is superior in nature, office, and gifts. He humbly declares that he is unworthy to even perform the lowliest task of unloosing the latchet of Jesus' shoe, which was typically done by a servant. John's humility serves as an example for all believers to recognize the greatness and exalted status of Jesus, willingly submitting themselves as His humble servants.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "The 'latchet' of sandals was the string or thong by which they were fastened to the feet. To unloose them was the office of a servant, and John means, therefore, that he was unworthy to perform the lowest office for the Messiah."
2. "John was well known; he was highly honored; thousands came to hear him. Jesus was at that time unknown; but John says that he was unworthy to perform the humblest office for Jesus."
3. "So we all should be willing to lay all that we have at the feet of Christ, and feel that we are unworthy to be his lowest servants."

### John Calvin:

### John Gill:
