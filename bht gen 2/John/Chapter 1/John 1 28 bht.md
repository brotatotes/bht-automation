# John 1:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Bethabara, which means house of passage, was the place where John the Baptist used to baptize. This location is not to be confused with the Bethany near Jerusalem, as there were multiple places with the same name. John chose this specific place to continue his preaching and baptizing because of the multitude of people who went there to hear him and have the opportunity to be baptized. Even to this day, there is a deep reverence for this place as many believers desire to be baptized in the same vital stream where John first performed this holy sacrament.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The objection of Paulus, that πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου the Sanhedrim had no authority, appears not to be founded in fact."
2. "The whole series of transactions here recorded, from Joh 1:15 onwards, certainly happened after the baptism of our Lord; for before that event John did not know Him as ὁ ἐρχόμενος: and μέσος ὑμῶν στήκει Joh 1:26 shews that he had so recognized Him."
3. "Since the great end of John’s mission was to proclaim Him who was coming after him, it is not only probable, but absolutely necessary to suppose, that he should have delivered this testimony often, and under varying circumstances: before the baptism, in the form given by Luke, ἔρχεται ὁ ἰσχυρ. μου κ . τ . λ., and after it in this form, οὗτος ἦν ὃν εἶπον (Joh 1:15), where his former testimony is distinctly referred to."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Bethabara—Rather, 'Bethany' (according to nearly all the best
and most ancient manuscripts); not the Bethany of Lazarus, but another of the same name, and distinguished from it as lying 'beyond Jordan,' on the east."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'Bethabara' means 'house or place of a ford.'"
2. "The reading 'Bethabara,' instead of 'Bethany,' seems to have arisen from the conjecture of Origen."
3. "Beyond Jordan - On the east side of the Jordan River."

### John Calvin:
1. "The place is mentioned, not only to authenticate the narrative, but also to inform us that this answer was given amidst a numerous assembly of people."
2. "It is likewise supposed by some to be a passage across Jordan, and, from this circumstance, they derive the name, for they interpret it the house of passage."
3. "The situation of Bethabara, as laid down by those who have described the country, agrees best with the words of the Evangelist."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There can be no doubt that Bethabara is not the true reading in this verse."
2. "The existence of another Bethany, near Jerusalem, presents no difficulty, as it was not uncommon for two places to bear the same name."
3. "Of the situation of Bethany we know no more than we are told in this verse."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In Bethany beyond Jordan (εν Βηθανια περαν του Ιορδανου). Undoubtedly the correct text, not 'in Bethabara' as Origen suggested instead of 'in Bethany' of all the known Greek manuscripts under the mistaken notion that the only Bethany was that near Jerusalem." 
2. "Was baptizing (ην βαπτιζων). Periphrastic imperfect, common idiom in John."

### John Gill:
1. "Bethabara signifies 'the house of passage', and is thought to be the place where the Israelites passed over Jordan, to go into the land of Canaan."
2. "John pitched upon [Bethabara] to continue preaching and baptizing at; partly because of the number of people that went over, to whom he had the opportunity of preaching; and partly, for the sake of baptizing those who became proper subjects of that ordinance through his ministry."
3. "Here, says Jerom, 'to this day many of the brethren, that is, of the number of believers, desiring there to be born again, are baptized in the vital stream;' such veneration had they for the place where John first baptized."

### John Wesley:
1. Where John was baptizing — That is, used to baptize.
