# John 1:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Behold the Lamb of God, a title that carries significant weight, referring to Jesus as the innocent and sacrificial offering. Prophesied by Isaiah and typified by the paschal lamb, Jesus is the one approved and accepted by God, who takes away sin through his sacrificial death, extending his atoning work to the entire world. In this profound statement, John the Baptist points to the all-encompassing nature of sin and emphasizes that Jesus, as the Lamb of God, offers redemption and forgiveness to all mankind.

2. "It was a very wicked abuse of the institution of sacrifice, that they had their confidence fixed on the outward signs; and therefore John, holding out Christ, testifies that he is the Lamb of God; by which he means that all the sacrifices, which the Jews were accustomed to offer under the Law, had no power whatever to atone for sins, but that they were only figures, the truth of which was manifested in Christ himself."

3. "And Christ is styled the Lamb 'of God', in allusion to the same, whom the Cabalistic Jews call the secret of the mystery, and 'the Lambs of God'; because God has a special property in him; he is his own Son; and because he is of his providing and appointing, as a sacrifice for sin, and is acceptable to him as such."
