# John 1:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Word, who is God, is the creator of all things. He is not just an instrument, but the efficient cause of creation, working together with the Father and the Spirit. Every single thing in the entire creation was made by Him. This includes everything beside God and all things that were made. This act of creation occurred in the beginning and is a clear proof of the Word's divine nature.
