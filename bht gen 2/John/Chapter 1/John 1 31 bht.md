# John 1:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
John and Jesus were closely related, but it is surprising how little they knew each other. Their miraculous conceptions and births should have brought them together, but instead, there was a divine plan at work. Jesus grew up in Nazareth, while John lived as a hermit in the deserts of Judea. This intentional separation prevented any suspicion regarding John's testimony about Jesus. It was all part of God's providence, ensuring that John's testimony would be pure and authentic.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Both accounts are entirely consistent with the supposition that John had been from youth upwards acquainted with our Lord, and indeed may have in his own mind believed Him to be the Christ."
2. "This testimony does not rest upon my long personal acquaintance with Him, but on that which happened during my work of baptizing."
3. "But our narrative is not built upon any such Jewish belief, for it is evidently only as a spiritual preparation, through repentance, for the knowledge of Him, that John regarded his baptism."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But the sign which he was told to expect was the visible descent of the Spirit upon Him as He emerged out of the baptismal water."
2. "Then, catching up the voice from heaven, 'he saw and bare record that this is the Son of God.'"


### Albert Barnes:
1. "John had lived chiefly in the hill country of Judea. Jesus had been employed with Joseph at Nazareth."
2. "Until Jesus came to be baptized... John had no acquaintance with him."
3. "This proves that there could have been no collusion or agreement between them to impose on the people."

### John Calvin:
1. "I came baptizing with water; that is, I was called and appointed to this office, that I might manifest him to Israel." 
2. "Instead of what we find here, I came to baptize, he there states expressly (verse 33) that he was sent; for it is only the calling of God that makes lawful ministers."
3. "Now since it was necessary that John, in order that he might lawfully baptize, should be sent by God, let it be inferred from this, that it is not in the power of any man whatever to institute sacraments, but that this right belongs to God alone."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The meaning of the words is not, 'I baptize in water in order that Jesus may come to my baptism, and may there receive a testimony from on high;' but, 'I baptize that I may declare the necessity of that forsaking of sin without which no true manifestation of Jesus can be made to the heart.'" 
2. "The advance of thought from the unrecognised Jesus of John 1:26 to the 'made manifest' of John 1:31 is obvious." 
3. "It corresponds with the 'standeth' of John 1:26, and the 'coming unto' him of John 1:29; with the fact, also, that the one is the first, the other the second, testimony of the Baptist."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He had predicted the Messiah and described him before he met him and baptized him."
2. "Whether John knew Jesus personally before the baptism we do not know."
3. "The purpose of John's ministry was to manifest to Israel with their spiritual privileges the presence of the Messiah."

### John Gill:
1. "And I knew him not,.... by sight, as Nonnus paraphrases it..."
2. "...lest it should be thought, that the testimony he bore to Jesus, and the high commendation he gave of him, arose from the relation between them..."
3. "but that he should be made manifest to Israel... but that he might be known: therefore am I come baptizing with water."

### John Wesley:
1. "How surprising is this; considering how nearly they were related, and how remarkable the conception and birth of both had been."
2. "But there was a peculiar providence visible in our Saviour's living, from his infancy to his baptism, at Nazareth: John all the time living the life of a hermit in the deserts of Judea."
3. "Hereby that acquaintance was prevented which might have made John's testimony of Christ suspected."
