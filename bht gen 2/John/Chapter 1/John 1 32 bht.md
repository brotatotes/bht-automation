# John 1:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
John, the narrator of this passage, testifies to seeing the Spirit of God descending from heaven like a dove. The dove was not the Spirit itself, but rather a symbol of the Spirit's presence. This visible descent of the Spirit upon Jesus was significant because it remained with him, serving as a lasting proof of his divine nature. John's witness is essential because he had a prolonged and clear view of this event, allowing him to provide an accurate and certain testimony.

2. "We must always hold that there is a correspondence between the sign and the reality...In this passage God intended to make a public representation of that mildness of Christ."
3. "At that time, therefore, he received the Spirit not only for himself, but for his people; and on that account his descent was visible, that we may know that there dwells in him an abundance of all gifts of which we are empty and destitute."
