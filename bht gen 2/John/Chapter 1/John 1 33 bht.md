# John 1:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
John the Baptist acknowledged that his authority to baptize came from God, as he was sent by God to baptize with water. The important distinction between John's baptism in water and the Messiah's baptism in the Holy Spirit is highlighted here, emphasizing the divine nature and commission of John's mission. The baptism of the Holy Spirit is seen as a confirmation, not only for the credibility of John's ministry, but also for the benefit of mankind.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "No rank or excellence of man ought to prevent us from doing our duty, and therefore John would have shown disrespect to God and to his baptism, if he had spoken in this manner to any other person than the Son of God."
2. "Although he recognizes Christ whenever he sees him, still it does not cease to be true that they were not known to each other according to the ordinary custom of men, for the commencement of his knowledge proceeded from God."
3. "For my own part, I willingly embrace the opinion of those who think that this sign was added for confirmation, and that it was not so much for the sake of John as for the sake of us all."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Explicit and emphatic pronoun as in verse John 1:8, referring to God as the one who sent John."
2. "Here again one needs the background of the Synoptics for the contrast between John's baptism in water and that of the Messiah in the Holy Spirit."

### John Gill:
1. "But he that sent me to baptize with water; or 'in water'; that is, God; for John's mission was from God, as in John 1:6, and his baptism from heaven; he had a divine warrant and commission for what he did."
2. "Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost; that is, the Messiah."
