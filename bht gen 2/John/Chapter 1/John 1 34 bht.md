# John 1:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Baptist not only witnessed the descent of the Spirit upon Jesus but also heard the Father's voice affirming him as the Beloved Son of God. This declaration, made in the presence of a crowd, served as a testimony to Jesus' divine nature and unique relationship with the Father. It was a profound revelation that had a lasting impact on both the Baptist and those who witnessed it. From that moment onward, the identity of Jesus as the Son of God became the central message and belief of those who followed him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
