# John 1:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On the third day, John the Baptist stood with two of his disciples, one of whom was Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter. The repetition of this notice signifies that it was time for them to follow Jesus. John's testimony was crucial in establishing Jesus as the Messiah, and the evangelist specifically emphasizes this impartial evidence. John's standing position indicated his official role as the herald of the Messiah, and it was in this capacity that he bore witness to Jesus.
