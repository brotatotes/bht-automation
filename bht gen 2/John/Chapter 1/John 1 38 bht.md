# John 1:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Jesus heard their footsteps approaching, he recognized their desire to follow him. Just as Jesus compassionately tends to those who are broken and weak, he welcomed these disciples who showed early signs of seeking him. Curious to know more about Jesus and looking for an opportunity to learn from him, they inquired about where he was staying, eager to spend time with him and receive his teachings.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "What seek ye—gentle,
   winning question, remarkable as the Redeemer's first public
   utterance."
2. "Where dwellest thou—that
   is, 'That is a question we cannot answer in a moment; but had we
   Thy company for a calm hour in private, gladly should we open our
   burden.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "What seek ye? - This was not asked to obtain 'information.' It was a kind inquiry respecting their desires; an invitation to lay open their minds, to state their wishes, and to express all their feelings respecting the Messiah and their own salvation."
2. "Rabbi - This was a Jewish title conferred somewhat as literary degrees now are, and meaning literally 'a great one,' and was applied to a teacher or master in the Jewish schools. Our Saviour solemnly forbade his disciples to wear that title."
3. "Where dwellest thou? - This question they probably asked him in order to signify their wish to be with him and to be instructed by him. Religion teaches people true politeness, or a disposition to consult the convenience of others, and not improperly to molest them, or to break in upon them when engaged."

### John Calvin:
1. "Although, therefore, those two disciples do not yet recognize Christ as the only Teacher of the Church, yet, moved by the commendation bestowed on him by John the Baptist, they hold him to be a Prophet and teacher, which is the first step towards receiving instruction."
2. "By this example we are taught that from the first, rudiments of the Church we ought to draw such a relish for Christ as will excite our desire to profit; and next, that we ought not to be satisfied with a mere passing look, but that we ought to seek his dwelling, that he may receive us as guests."
3. "For there are very many who smell the gospel at a distance only, and thus allow Christ suddenly to disappear, and all that they have learned concerning him to pass away."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They who thus follow Jesus shall not do so in vain."
2. "‘Where is Thy permanent resting-place and home, that as pupils we may seek Thee there, and may abide with Thee till we have seen the glory of which we have heard?’"
3. "By the title Rabbi (which strictly meant my master or lord, but which in the time of Jesus had already come to be applied to teachers) they had been wont to address their own master...and they naturally give the same name of honour to Jesus."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Turned (στραφεις). Second aorist passive participle of στρεφω, vividly picturing the sudden act of Jesus on hearing their steps behind him."
2. "Rabbi (Ραββε). Aramaic title for 'Teacher' which John here translates by Διδασκαλε as he is writing late and for general readers."
3. "Being interpreted (μεθερμημευομενον). Present passive participle of μεθερμηνευω, late compound of μετα and ερμηνευω, to explain (John 1:42), old word from Hερμες, the god of speech (hermeneutics)."

### John Gill:
1. "he saw by their walk, and by their countenances, that they were following him..."
2. "...he who will not break the bruised reed, nor quench the smoking flax, but cherishes and encourages the first motions of grace, begins first with them..."
3. "...but should be glad to know where he lodged, that they might wait upon him there, either then, or on the morrow, or at any convenient time."
