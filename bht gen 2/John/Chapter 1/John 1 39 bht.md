# John 1:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Come and see, Jesus kindly invited the disciples, assuring them that they would not seek in vain. Eager for knowledge of Him, they followed Him without concern for lodging, demonstrating their deep desire to be in His presence. In choosing to remain with Jesus, they prioritized spiritual nourishment over temporary comforts. As witnesses to this interaction, we are reminded of our own response to Jesus' call: to promptly seek Him and engage in intimate fellowship with Him. May we be inspired by their example and not delay in our pursuit of Christ.
