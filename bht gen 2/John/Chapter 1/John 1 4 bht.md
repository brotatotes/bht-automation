# John 1:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Word, Jesus Christ, is the source of all life, not just physical life, but also spiritual life. In Him is the fountain from which all life flows, sustaining and preserving every living thing. Furthermore, He is the light of men, illuminating their path and guiding them towards wisdom, holiness, and true happiness. In our original state, we had a deep understanding and communion with God, knowing His being, His will, and His desire for us. Through Jesus, we can regain this knowledge and experience the abundant life and light He offers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ζωή is not merely 'spiritual life,' nor 'the recovery of blessedness': the λόγος is the source of all life to the creature."
2. "κ. ἡ ζωὴ ἦν τ. φῶς τ. ἀνθ: This is not to be understood of the teaching of the Incarnate Logos, but of the enlightening and life-sustaining influence of the eternal Son of God."
3. "All knowledge, all purity, all love, all happiness, spring up and grow from this life, which is the light to them all."

2. "Thus He is the Living Word, or, as He is called in 1 John 1:1, 1 John 1:2, 'the Word of Life.'"
3. "All that in men which is true light—knowledge, integrity, intelligent, willing subjection to God, love to Him and to their fellow creatures, wisdom, purity, holy joy, rational happiness—all this 'light of men' has its fountain in the essential original 'life' of 'the Word'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "God is declared to be 'life,' or the 'living' God, because he is the source or fountain of life. This attribute is here ascribed to Jesus Christ."
2. "The 'new creation,' or the renovation of man and his restoration from a state of sin, is often compared with the 'first creation;' and as the λόγος Logos was the source of 'life' then, so, in a similar but higher sense, he is the source of 'life' to the soul dead in trespasses and sins."
3. "The Messiah was predicted as the 'light' of the world. The meaning is, that the λόγος Logos or Word of God is the 'instructor or teacher' of mankind."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He was the fountain of life - physical, moral, and eternal - its principle and source."
2. "Animals have the vital principle in common with men, but men lead lives controlled by intellect and will, and directed to moral and intellectual ends."
3. "In the New Testament, biov means either living, i.e., means of subsistence (Mark 12:44; Luke 8:43), or course of life, life regarded as an economy (Luke 8:14; 1 Timothy 2:2; 2 Timothy 2:4)."

### John Calvin:
1. "He now attributes to him, in the same manner, the preservation of those things which had been created, as if he had said, that in the creation of the world there was not merely displayed a sudden exercise of his power, which soon passed away, but that it is manifested in the steady and regular order of nature."
2. "He speaks here, in my opinion, of that part of life in which men excel other animals; and informs us that the life which was bestowed on men was not of an ordinary description, but was united to the light of understanding."

2. "This is the idea in Hebrews 1:3 'bearing (upholding) the all things by the word of his power.' Once this language might have been termed unscientific, but not so now after the spiritual interpretation of the physical world by Eddington and Jeans."
3. "The light was the life of men...That statement is curiously like the view of some physicists who find in electricity (both light and power) the nearest equivalent to life in its ultimate physical form."

### John Gill:
1. "There was life in the word with respect to himself; a divine life, the same with the life of the Father and of the Spirit; and is in him, not by gift, nor by derivation or communication; but originally, and independently, and from all eternity."
2. "The fountain of natural life is in him, he is the efficient cause, and preserver of it; whether vegetative, animal, or rational; and proves him to be truly God, and that he existed before his incarnation."
3. "The life which was in, and by the word, was, with respect to men, a life of light, or a life attended with light...

### John Wesley:
1. "In him was life — He was the foundation of life to every living thing, as well as of being to all that is."
2. "And the life was the light of men — He who is essential life, and the giver of life to all that liveth, was also the light of men; the fountain of wisdom, holiness, and happiness, to man in his original state."
