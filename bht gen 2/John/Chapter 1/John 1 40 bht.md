# John 1:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The account of Jesus being heard by Andrew and another follower of John the Baptist, who then decided to follow Him, is a notable example of the power of Jesus' teachings and the impact they had on His early disciples. It is intriguing to consider that the other disciple who heard and followed Jesus alongside Andrew could potentially be the author of this Gospel, emphasizing the personal connection and first-hand experience that informed the writing. This passage serves as a reminder of the transformative influence of Jesus' words and the significance of being open to His teachings.
