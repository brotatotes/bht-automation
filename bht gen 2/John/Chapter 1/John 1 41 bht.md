# John 1:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Andrew eagerly sought out his own brother Simon, demonstrating the desire of those who have experienced grace to share it with others. The mention of the name Messiah in the context of the Jews' anticipation of a Savior and Redeemer adds depth to their recognition of Jesus. Finding Christ, in a spiritual sense, is a tremendous joy that involves not only seeing Him clearly through faith but also approaching Him and embracing Him as the only Savior and Redeemer.
