# John 1:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
You are Simon, the son of Jonah, Jesus said to Peter, emphasizing his identity. It is noteworthy that no one had revealed these names to Jesus, demonstrating his divine knowledge. And when Jesus declared that Peter would be called Cephas, which means rock in Syriac, it signified the same significance as the name Peter, which means a rock in Greek. This name symbolizes the firm and unshakable character that Peter would possess as a follower of Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἴδιον not merely “ for the possessive pronoun,” but referring to πρῶτον, and furnishing a reason for it."
2. "μεσσίαν = מָשִׁיחַ = not ὁ χριστός, but χριστός: being the identification simply of the two words, not here of the two titles."

3. "You shall be called by a name denoting firmness and constancy."

### John Calvin:
1. "He repeats the name of his father in an abridged form; which is common enough when names are translated into other languages; for it will plainly appear from the last chapter that he was the son of Johanna or John. But all this amounts to nothing more than that he will be a very different person from what he now is."
2. "I look upon it as a prediction, not only because Christ foresaw the future steadfastness of faith in Peter, but because he foretold what he would give to him."
3. "Yet the Papists act a ridiculous part, when they substitute him in the place of Christ; so as to be the foundation of the Church, as if he too were not founded on Christ along with the rest of the disciples; and they are doubly ridiculous when out of a stone they make him a head."

### Philip Schaff:
