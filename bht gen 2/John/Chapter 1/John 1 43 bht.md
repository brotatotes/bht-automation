# John 1:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, after being baptized by John and facing temptations in the wilderness, made the deliberate decision to begin his ministry in Galilee where he grew up. It was there that he called Andrew by his grace and invited him to be his disciple. The power of Jesus' words was so compelling that Andrew immediately left everything behind and began to follow him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This is evidently the first bestowal of the new name on Simon: and it is done from our Lord’s prophetic knowledge of his future character."
2. "The Greek name Peter became the prevalent one in the apostolic Church very soon: Paul uses both names indiscriminately."
3. "I own I cannot but think with Bengel, Paulus, and Strauss, that the knowledge of Simon shewn by the Lord is intended to be miraculous."

2. "Follow me - the first express call given, the former three having come to Him spontaneously."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This does not refer to his calling these disciples to be 'apostles,' for that took place at the Sea of Tiberias, but it refers to their being convinced that he was the Christ."
2. "This is the object of this evangelist, to show how and when they were convinced of this. Matthew states the time and occasion in which they were called to be 'apostles;' John, the time in which they first became acquainted with Jesus, and were convinced that he was the Messiah."
3. "There is, therefore, no contradiction in the evangelists."

### John Calvin:

2. "We are left to infer that the command was immediately obeyed." 
3. "The calling of Philip and of Nathanael is recorded by John alone; both Matthew and Mark relate that Jesus called to Him Andrew and Peter, James and John, but it will be remembered that this was a second summons, later than the events of which we are reading here."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He findeth Philip. Vivid dramatic present as in John 1:41, though ηθελησεν (was minded, wished) is aorist active indicative."
2. "Both Andrew and Philip have Greek names."
3. "Follow me. Present active imperative, a direct challenge to Philip. Often Jesus uses this verb to win disciples."

### John Gill:
1. "Jesus would go forth into Galilee; from whence he came to Jordan, to John, to be baptized by him; and which being done, and his temptations in the wilderness over, it was his will, resolution, and determination, to return to Galilee, the place of his education and conversation, till this time; and therefore chose to begin his ministry, and miracles, there..."
2. "...called him by his grace, and to be a disciple of his..."
