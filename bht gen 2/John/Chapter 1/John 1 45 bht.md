# John 1:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Nathanael, who is believed to be the same person as Bartholomew, was one of the apostles. He is mentioned alongside Thomas in the Gospel of John, and later, he is listed among the apostles in the book of Acts. When Philip tells Nathanael that they have found the Messiah, he refers to Jesus as Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph. However, Philip is not aware that Jesus was actually born in Bethlehem. Despite this initial misunderstanding, Nathanael's encounter with Jesus will soon reveal the true nature of his identity.
