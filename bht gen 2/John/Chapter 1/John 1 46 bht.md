# John 1:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Nathanael's initial reaction to hearing about Jesus from Philip reveals the prevailing contempt that Nazareth, and Galilee as a whole, held among the Jews. The low status of Nazareth and its wicked reputation led Nathanael to doubt that any good thing could come from there. However, Philip's response to Nathanael's skepticism was wise. Instead of arguing, he simply invited him to come and see for himself. This approach, which Philip had experienced firsthand from Jesus, was a powerful antidote against preconceived opinions and popular prejudices. It encouraged personal inquiry and the opportunity to witness the truth firsthand.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Nathanael is described as ὁ ἀπὸ Κανᾶ τῆς Γαλιλαίας, and it is probable the call may have taken place in its neighborhood."
2. "No stress can be laid, as has been most unfairly done by Lücke, De Wette, and others, on Jesus being called by Philip, the son of Joseph, as indicating that the history of His birth and childhood, as related by Matt. and Luke, was unknown to John. Philip expresses what was the prevailing belief, in the ordinary words."
3. "By combining the two declarations of John, that in Jesus the Eternal Word of God became flesh and that ‘that which is born of the flesh is flesh,’ we cannot escape the inference, that a supernatural working of God in the conception of the Man Christ Jesus is implied."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The question sprang from mere dread of mistake in a matter so vital."
2. "Come and see - Noble remedy against preconceived opinions."
3. "Philip, though he could not perhaps solve his difficulty, could show him how to get rid of it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To be a Galilean or a Nazarene was an expression of decided contempt."
2. "Many persons suffer their minds to be filled with prejudice against religion, and then pronounce at once without examination."
3. "He asked him to go and examine for himself, to see the Lord Jesus, to hear him converse, to lay aside his prejudice, and to judge from a fair and candid personal inquiry."

### John Calvin:
1. "Both of these points ought to be carefully observed by us... If then we are not carefully on our guard, we shall be liable to the same danger."
2. "Satan labors every day, by similar obstacles, to hinder us from coming to Christ... that we may not venture to taste it."
3. "Let us at least remember immediately this caution: Come and see... let us not shrink from inquiry, when Christ himself is ready to remove the doubts which harass us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The mind of Nathanael is... full... of that prophetic hope."
2. "To him all good was summed up in the thought of the coming King."
3. "Such considerations go far towards explaining his disparaging remark."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Out of Nazareth can anything good be." There is a tinge of scorn in the question as if Nazareth had a bad name.
2. The best thing in all the world came out of Nazareth, but Philip does not argue the point.
3. Wise is the one who knows how to deal with the skeptic.

### John Gill:
1. "The whole country of Galilee was had in contempt with the Jews; but Nazareth was so mean a place, that it seems it was even despised by its neighbors, by the Galileans themselves."
2. "It was so miserable a place that he could hardly think that any sort of good thing, even any worldly good thing, could come from thence; and it was so wicked, as appears from their murderous designs upon our Lord, that he thought no good man could arise from hence."
3. "Philip saith unto him, come and see; who though he might not be master of this point, and knew not how to solve this difficulty, and remove this prejudice from Nathanael's mind, yet persuades him to go with him to Jesus; who, he doubted not, would give him full satisfaction in this, and all other points."

### John Wesley:
1. "How cautiously should we guard against popular prejudices?"
2. "His integrity prevailed over that foolish bias, and laid him open to the force of evidence."
3. "Come and see - The same answer which he had received himself from our Lord the day before."
