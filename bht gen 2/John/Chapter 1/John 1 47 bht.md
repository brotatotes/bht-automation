# John 1:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Behold, a true Israelite! A son of Jacob who embodies the character of Israel at its best. He is not just an Israelite by birth, but his heart is aligned with the Spirit. In him, there is no deception or deceit. While he is not without sin, guile does not define his life and actions. This commendation from Christ affirms the value of integrity and sincerity in the sight of God. It also reveals Christ's knowledge of the deepest motives and thoughts of the heart.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is impossible that Nathanael, himself a Galilæan, could speak from any feeling of contempt for Galilee generally."
2. "He alluded therefore to the smallness and insignificance of the town in proportion to the great things which were now predicated of it."
3. "Nazareth is never named in the O.T. nor in Josephus."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "an Israelite indeed . . . no guile—not only no hypocrite, but with a guileless simplicity not always found even in God's own people, ready to follow wherever truth might lead him, saying, Samuel-like, 'Speak, Lord, for Thy servant heareth' (1 Samuel 3:10)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "An Israelite indeed - One who is really an Israelite - not by birth only, but one worthy of the name."
2. "No guile - No deceit, no fraud, no hypocrisy. He is really what he professes to be - a Jew, a descendant of the patriarch Jacob, fearing and serving God."
3. "He does not say that Nathanael was without guilt or sin, but that he had no disguise, no trick, no deceit - he was sincere and upright."

### John Calvin:
1. "For, since many who boast of being believers are very far from being actually believers, it is of great importance that some mark should be found for distinguishing the true and genuine from the false."
2. "To sum up the meaning of Christ in a few words, it ought to be observed that deceit is contrasted with uprightness and sincerity; so that he calls those persons sly and deceitful who are called in other parts of Scripture double in heart."
3. "In this passage, ἀληθῶς (truly) means something more than certainly. The Greek word, no doubt, is often used as a simple affirmation; but as we must here supply a contrast between the fact and the mere name, he is said to be truly, who is in reality what he is supposed to be."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile."
2. "He is ingenuous, willing to be taught, ready to receive what is shown to him to be truth, however strongly it may conflict with his prepossessions."
3. "Nathanael, in short, is ‘of God,’ is ‘of the truth,’ has no selfish impure aims, and therefore he shall be fully taught."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Behold (ιδε). Here an exclamation (see John 1:29) as often like ιδου."
2. "Truly an Israelite," one living up to the covenant name, Israel at its best (Romans 2:29), without the guile (δολος, deceit, bait for fish, from δελεαζω, to catch with bait) that Jacob once had of which Isaac complained (Genesis 27:35, δολος, here in LXX)."
3. "The servant of Jehovah was to be without guile (Isaiah 53:9)."

### John Gill:
1. "Behold an Israelite indeed! a son of Israel, as the Syriac and Persic versions read; a true son of Jacob's; an honest, plain-hearted man, like him; one that was an Israelite at heart; inwardly so; not one after the flesh only, but after the Spirit." 
2. "In whom there is no guile; not that he was without sin; nor is this said of him; nor was he in such sense without guile, as Christ himself was; but guile was not a governing sin in him: the course of his life and conversation was with great integrity and uprightness, and without any prevailing hypocrisy and deceit, either to God or men."
3. "This Christ said to show how much such a character is approved by him; and that he knew the secrets of men's hearts and the inward frames of their minds."
