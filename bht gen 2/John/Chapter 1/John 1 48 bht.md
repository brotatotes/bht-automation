# John 1:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is possible that Nathanael was engaged in prayer under the fig tree, as it was a common practice for people to study and pray under fig trees. Jesus, being omniscient, saw Nathanael in this very moment and recognized him as one of His own.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Evangelist certainly intends a supernatural insight by the Lord into Nathanael’s character to be here understood."
2. "‘An Israelite who truly answers to the inner and honourable meaning of the name.’"
3. "When we reflect what was contained in that name, and Who it is that speaks, we can hardly agree with De Wette that the words are spoken merely in the spirit in which every nation attaches some peculiar virtue."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Whence knowest thou me—conscious that his very heart had been read, and at this critical moment more than ever before."
2. "Before Philip called thee—showing He knew all that passed between Philip and him at a distance."
3. "Thither, probably—hearing that his master's Master had at length appeared, and heaving with mingled eagerness to behold Him and dread of deception—he had retired to pour out his guileless heart for light and guidance, ending with such a prayer as this, 'Show me a token for good!' (See on :-). Now he has it, 'Thou guileless one, that fig tree scene, with all its heaving anxieties, deep pleadings and tremulous hopes—I saw it all.' The first words of Jesus had astonished, but this quite overpowered and won him."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "His conscience testified to the truth of what Jesus said that he had no guile, and he was anxious to know whence he had learned his character." 
2. "It is evident that it was from something that had occurred under the fig-tree that Jesus judged of his character." 
3. "In that place of retirement it is not improbable that Nathanael was engaged in private devotion."

### John Calvin:
1. "The proof, therefore, is taken from things which are of the same class; for not less does it belong to God to see what lies beyond our view than to judge concerning purity of heart."
2. "We ought also to gather from this passage a useful doctrine, that when we are not thinking of Christ, we are observed by him; and it is necessary that it should be so, that he may bring us back, when we have wandered from the right path."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is enough for him that he sees that he is discerned by one whom he had not previously met, and what he asks is, Whence gettest Thou Thy knowledge of me? Who has told Thee anything about me?"
2. "Jesus replies by referring to a previous, probably recent, incident in his history. The heart of the guileless man had been so moved by the great thoughts stirring at that time with respect to the Saviour at hand, that he had retired under a fig tree to study the Scriptures, or meditate, or pray."
3. "Then Jesus had seen him, and had recognised in him one of His sheep, just as His sheep recognise Him (John 10:16)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Nathanael is astonished at this tribute, at any knowledge about himself by Jesus."
2. "Nathanael had overheard Christ's comment and longed to know its source."
3. "Jesus saw Nathanael's heart as well as his mere presence there. He saw him in his worship and so knew him."

### John Gill:
1. "This he said as one surprised, that he, who was a stranger to him, should hit upon his general character, and describe the internal state and frame of his soul."
2. "Christ gives two instances of his omniscience; the one is, that he knew Philip had called him... and the other is, that he saw him under the fig tree before that."
3. "It was usual with the doctors to read and study in the law, under fig trees, and sometimes, though rarely, to pray there."

### John Wesley:
1. Under the fig tree I saw thee — Perhaps at prayer.
