# John 1:49 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Nathanael's confession, Thou art the Son of God, reveals his swift recognition of Jesus' perfect knowledge and divine nature. The title Son of God signifies not only the Messiah's person, but also His office as the King of Israel. Nathanael's confession highlights the importance of faith in acknowledging Christ's power and purpose, for he is not just a teacher or prophet, but the one sent by the Father to fulfill His divine plan. As believers, we should go beyond limiting Christ's authority to earthly boundaries and embrace the extent of His kingdom.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The remark was overheard by Nathanael, and recognized as indicating perfect knowledge of his character."
2. "The whole form of our Lord’s answer seems to indicate that the place where Philip called Nathanael was not now in sight, nor had been."
3. "[The name 'the Son of God'] was certainly not so common a name as ‘the Son of David,’ for the Messiah."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Son of God . . . King of Israel—the one denoting His person, the other His office." 
2. "But just as the earth's vital powers, the longer they are frost-bound, take the greater spring when at length set free, so souls, like Nathanael and Thomas, the outgoings of whose faith are hindered for a time, take the start of their more easy-going brethren when loosed and let go."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Rabbi - Master. Applied appropriately to Jesus, and to no one else." 
2. "The Son of God - By this title he doubtless meant that he was the Messiah."
3. "The King of Israel - This was one of the titles by which the Messiah was expected, and this was the title which was affixed to his cross."

### John Calvin:
1. "Faith ought not to be fixed on the essence of Christ alone, but ought to attend to his power and office."
2. "It would be of little advantage to know who Christ is if this second point were not added, what he wishes to be towards us, and for what purpose the Father sent him."
3. "We to whom the wide extent of Christ's kingdom has been revealed ought to go beyond those narrow limits."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The confession is the highest that has yet been made, for it is impossible to understand ‘Son of God’ as the simple equivalent of Messiah."
2. "They had spoken not less of Jehovah Himself as coming, and as coming to be their Deliverer and their King."
3. "Nor is there any warrant for describing his feelings as vague. What he did was to rise to the height of Old Testament prophecy; what he saw was that this must be Jehovah that was to come, the universal King."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Nathanael was a student of the Old Testament as Philip implied and was quick to put together his knowledge, the statement of Philip, and the manifest supernatural knowledge of Jesus as just shown."
2. "There is no reason for toning down the noble confession of Nathanael in the light of Christ's claim."
3. "To us this seems an anti-climax, but not so to Nathanael for both are Messianic titles."

### John Gill:
1. "Thou art the Son of God; not by creation, nor by adoption, nor on account of his wonderful incarnation, nor because of his resurrection from the dead, nor because of his office as Mediator, but by nature, as being of the same essence, and possessed of the same perfections God is."
2. "Thou art the King of Israel; having in view the passage in Psalms 2:6, where the characters of Son of God and King of Zion meet in the same person."
3. "His kingdom is not of this world; nor with observation; but is spiritual; and he is a King over Israel in a spiritual sense, even of saints, whether Jews or Gentiles: whom he conquers by his power, and rules in their hearts by his Spirit, and grace; and protects, and defends them from all their enemies."

### John Wesley:
1. "Happy are they that are ready to believe, swift to receive the truth and grace of God."
2. "Thou art the Son of God - A confession both of the person and office of Christ."
