# John 1:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The light of truth and salvation shines even in the fallen and sinful world, but many fail to perceive it. In the midst of darkness, there are still remnants of God's revelation in nature and conscience, offering glimpses of His light. However, these glimpses are insufficient to bring about true knowledge of God and His salvation. It is only through Christ, the true Light, that the darkness of sin can be dispelled. We must look to Him to illuminate our hearts and guide us into the fullness of His grace and truth.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "When it is said that 'the light shineth in darkness,' it is meant that the Lord Jesus came to teach an ignorant, benighted, and wicked world."
2. "His efforts to enlighten and save men have been like light struggling to penetrate a thick, dense cloud; and though a few rays may pierce the gloom, yet the great mass is still an impenetrable shade."
3. "Sin always blinds the mind to the beauty and excellency of the character of the Lord Jesus. It indisposes the mind to receive his instructions, just as 'darkness' has no affinity for 'light'; and if the one exists, the other must be displaced."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Evangelist maintains that, in the midst of the darkness, there are still some remains of light, which show in some degree the divine power of Christ."
2. "The light which still dwells in corrupt nature consists chiefly of two parts; for, first, all men naturally possess some seed of religion; and, secondly, the distinction between good and evil is engraven on their consciences."
3. "But what are the fruits that ultimately spring from it, except that religion degenerates into a thousand monsters of superstition, and conscience perverts every decision, so as to confound vice with virtue?"

### John Gill:
1. "Man was created a knowing creature, but, not content with his knowledge, sins, and is banished from the presence of God, the fountain of light; which brought a darkness on him, and his posterity."
2. "Now amidst this darkness there were some remains of the light of nature: with respect to the being of God, which shines in the works of creation and providence and to the worship of God, though very dimly; and to the knowledge of moral good and evil."
3. "By the light of nature, and the remains of it, men could not come to any clear and distinct knowledge of the above things; and much less to any knowledge of the true way of salvation."
