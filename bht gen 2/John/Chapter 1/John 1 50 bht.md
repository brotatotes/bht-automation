# John 1:50 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Nathanael's immediate belief in Jesus' identity is not criticized as excessive but rather praised. Jesus acknowledges Nathanael's faith with admiration, promising even greater proofs of His Messiahship. These greater things will provide fuller evidence to confirm Christ's divinity, including miraculous deeds and divine revelations that will astonish Nathanael and exceed anything he has witnessed thus far.
