## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. Our Lord says this not in blame, rather in praise of the simple and honest expression of Nathanael’s conviction; but principally to show him, that if he believed by reason of this comparatively small proof of His divine power, his faith would increase from strength to strength at the greater proofs which should from that time forward be given.
2. The opening of heaven is a symbolical expression, signifying the imparting of divine grace, help, and revelation. 
3. [The term "Son of Man"] is never predicated of our Lord by any but Himself, except in Act 7:56 by Stephen, in allusion apparently to Matthew 26:64.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "To show the patriarch that though alone and friendless on earth his interests were busying all heaven, he was made to see 'heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon a' mystic 'ladder reaching from heaven to earth.'"
2. "By and by, ye shall see this communication between heaven and earth thrown wide open, and the Son of man the real Ladder of this intercourse."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Verily, verily - In the Greek, 'Amen, amen.' The word 'amen' means 'truly, certainly, so be it' - from the Hebrew verb to confirm, to establish, to be true."
2. "Heaven open - This is a figurative expression, denoting 'the conferring of favors.'"
3. "The Son of man - A term by which lie often describes himself. It shows his humility, his love for man, his willingness to be esteemed 'as a man', Philippians 2:6-7."

### John Calvin:
1. "But if we duly consider what took place at that time, it is of perpetual duration; for the kingdom of God, which was formerly closed against us, is actually opened in Christ."
2. "They are said to ascend and descend, so as to be ministers of God’s kindness towards us; and therefore this mode of expression points out the mutual intercourse which exists between God and men."
3. "In short, this passage teaches us, that though the whole human race was banished from the kingdom of God, the gate of heaven is now opened to us, so that we are fellow-citizens of the saints, and companions of the angels."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The figure is taken from Jacob’s dream (Genesis 28:12). A wanderer from his father’s house and country, he is encouraged by a vision which teaches him that earth is united with heaven, and that God’s messengers descend to minister to those who are the objects of God’s care."
2. "There is real and unceasing intercourse between earth and heaven. It is to Jesus that the angels descend; it is from Him that they return to heaven; through His presence on earth this union between earth and heaven exists."
3. "Jesus is the Son of man, connected with no special race, or class, or condition, equally associated with all, equally near to all, in whom all are equally interested, and may be equally blessed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The heaven opened (τον ουρανον ανεωιγοτα). Second perfect active participle of ανοιγω with double reduplication, standing open. The words remind one of what took place at the baptism of Jesus, but the immediate reference is to the opened heaven as the symbol of free intercourse between God and man."
2. "Jesus is himself the bond of fellowship between heaven and earth, between God and man."
3. "He is the true Jacob's Ladder. 'I am the Way,' Jesus will say. He is more than King of Israel, he is the Son of Man (the race). So quickly has this Gospel brought out in the witness of the Baptist, the faith of the first disciples, the claims of Jesus Christ, the fully developed picture of the Logos who is both God and man, moving among men and winning them to his service."

### John Gill:
1. "Not only to Nathanael, but to the rest of the disciples that were then with him; and to show himself to be the 'Amen', and faithful witness, as well as more strongly to asseverate what he was about to say, he doubles the expression."
2. "Meaning himself in human nature; the second Adam, and seed of the woman; and is expressive both of the truth, and infirmity of that nature."
3. "And it is observable, that some of the Jewish writers understand the ascent, and descent of the angels, in Genesis 28:12, to be, not upon the ladder, but upon Jacob; which makes the phrase there still more agreeable to this."

1. "Hereafter ye shall see me come in my glory, and all the angels of God with me."
2. "All of these, as well as thou, who believe on me now in my state of humiliation, shall hereafter see me."
3. "This seems the most natural sense of the words, though they may also refer to his ascension."
