# John 1:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The evangelist introduces us to someone who testified of the light, the same light that had been mentioned earlier. This person was not the Word, nor an angel, but a man with extraordinary qualities. His appearance, diet, and temperament were reminiscent of the prophet Elijah. He served as the forerunner of Christ and played a significant role in the administration of baptism, making him one of the greatest prophets. His testimony prepared the way for the manifestation of the Word. (84 words, 5 sentences)

### Henry Alford:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Many had supposed that he was the Christ, but this opinion he corrects; yet he admits that he was 'sent from God' - that he was divinely commissioned."
2. "Though he denied that he was 'the Messiah,' yet he did not deny that he was sent from or by heaven on an important errand to human beings."

2. "But it might at first sight appear ridiculous that Christ should receive testimony from another, as if he needed it; while, on the contrary, he declares that he does not seek testimony from man."
3. "So far was John from needing commendation, that the Evangelist gives this warning, lest his excessive brightness might obscure the glory of Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The immediate preparation for this new period is the testimony of the Baptist; and the words with which he is introduced to us stand in striking contrast to what we have been told of the Word in John 1:1." 
2. "He ‘arose,’ literally, he ‘came into being,’ as distinguished from the ‘was’ of that verse."
3. "The personal name needed for identification amongst men is placed in contrast with that name by which the eternal attributes of the Son are expressed, ‘the Word’."
