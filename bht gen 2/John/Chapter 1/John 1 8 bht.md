# John 1:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
John the Baptist was a significant figure in the Gospel, described as a light and a forerunner of the Messiah. He was not the actual Light that was to come, but rather a guiding light leading up to it. John's purpose was to bear witness concerning the true Light. He had a deep understanding of the Messiah's imminent arrival and declared it, and upon baptizing Jesus, he personally knew Him and revealed Him to others. John's role was akin to a burning and shining light, which brought joy to the Jews for a time.
