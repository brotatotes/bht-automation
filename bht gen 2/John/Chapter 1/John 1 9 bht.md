# John 1:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The true light, Christ, is the source of all light to every creature. He shines brightly, enlightening every person, guiding them through their conscience and revealing the general lines of good and evil. If only humanity did not hinder this light, it would continue to shine more and more, leading to a perfect day.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The word ἀληθινόν...imports original, ‘archetypal,’ and is used of the true genuine sources and patterns of those things which we find here below only in fragmentary imitations and derivations."
2. "The former construction can only be defended by a Rabbinical usage, by which כָּל בָּאֵי עוֹלָם means ‘all men’...But it is very questionable whether John ever speaks thus."
3. "We are driven then to the only legitimate rendering, which is to take ἦν ἐρχόμενον as equivalent to an imperfect came: this usage being frequent in the N.T.,...at the time when John bore this witness, the true light which lighteth every man, came was in process of manifesting Himself, into the world."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "which, coming into the world, enlighteneth every man" or, is "the Light of the world"
2. "Coming into the world" is a superfluous and quite unusual description of "every man"
3. it is of all descriptions of Christ amongst the most familiar, especially in the writings of this Evangelist

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That was the true Light - Not John, but the Messiah."
2. "A false light is one that leads to danger or error, as a false beacon on the shores of the ocean may lead ships to quicksands or rocks; or an 'ignis fatuus' to fens, and precipices, and death."
3. "Christ does not lead astray. All false teachers do."

### John Calvin:
1. "The distinction is, that whatever is luminous in heaven and in earth borrows its splendor from some other object; but Christ is the light, shining from itself and by itself, and enlightening the whole world by its radiance."
2. "For as Christ makes us all partakers of his brightness, it must be acknowledged that to him alone belongs strictly this honor of being called light."
3. "There is no man, therefore, whom some perception of the eternal light does not reach. But as there are fanatics who rashly strain and torture this passage, so as to infer from it that the grace of illumination is equally offered to all..."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To this thought the word ‘coming’ exactly corresponds. But still more important in guiding to the right interpretation of the verse is the Evangelist’s use of the last phrase elsewhere."
2. "If, then, we would allow the Evangelist to be his own interpreter, we seem bound to believe that he here speaks of the light as ‘coming into the world.’"
3. "This true Light was coming into the ‘world.’ Originally signifying the universe created and ordered by the hand of God, ‘the world’ came successively to mean the world of men, and the world of men as opposed to God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The true light (το φως το αληθινον). 'The light the genuine,' not a false light of wreckers of ships, but the dependable light that guides to the harbor of safety."
2. "This true light had been on hand all the time in the darkness (ην imperfect, linear action) before John came."
3. "Lighteth every man (φωτιζε παντα ανθρωπον). Old verb (from φως) to give light as in Revelation 22:5; Luke 11:35. The Quakers appeal to this phrase for their belief that to every man there is given an inner light that is a sufficient guide, the Quaker's text it is called. But it may only mean that all the real light that men receive comes from Christ, not necessarily that each one receives a special revelation."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ is that light, that famous and excellent light, the fountain of all light to all creatures."
2. "He is the true light, in distinction from typical lights... and in opposition to all false lights."
3. "The phrase, 'every man that cometh into the world', is Jewish, and often to be met with in Rabbinical writings, and signifies all men that are born into the world."

### John Wesley:
1. "Who lighteth every man — By what is vulgarly termed natural conscience, pointing out at least the general lines of good and evil."
2. "And this light, if man did not hinder, would shine more and more to the perfect day."
