# John 10:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ is the true and only shepherd appointed, called, and sent by God. The sheepfold refers to the church of God, where the people of God are united, nourished, and find rest. Those who try to enter the church by deceit are the thieves and robbers, contrasting with the Good Shepherd who cares for and leads His sheep.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This fold is the visible Church of God, primarily, as His people Israel were His peculiar fold; the possibility of there being other folds has been supposed to be alluded to in John 10:16: but see note there."
2. "The terms in this first part are general, and apply to all leaders of God’s people; in John 10:1, to those who enter that office without having come in by the door...and in John 10:2 to those who do enter this way; and whosoever does is the shepherd of the sheep."
3. "The sheep throughout this parable are not the mingled multitude of good and bad; but the real sheep, the faithful, who are, what all in the fold should be."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He that entereth not by the door—the legitimate way (without saying what that was, as yet). into the sheepfold—the sacred enclosure of God's true people."
2. "climbeth up some other way—not referring to the assumption of ecclesiastical office without an external call, for those Jewish rulers, specially aimed at, had this (Matthew 23:2), but to the want of a true spiritual commission, the seal of heaven going along with the outward authority; it is the assumption of the spiritual guidance of the people without this that is meant."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Messiah was predicted under the image of a shepherd."
2. "The only way of entering the church of God is by believing on him and obeying his commandments."
3. "Alas! in all churches there have been many - many who for no better ends have sought the pastoral office."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Verily, verily [αμην, αμην] . The formula never begins anything quite new, but connects what follows with what precedes."
2. "The thief does not, like the shepherd, come from some well-known direction, as from his dwelling or from the pasture, but from an unknown quarter and by a road of his own."
3. "Thief - robber [κλεπτης - ληστης] . For the distinction see on Mark 11:17. There is a climax in the order of the words; one who will gain his end by craft, and, if that will not suffice, by violence."

### John Calvin:
1. "No plague is more destructive to the Church than when wolves ravage under the garb of shepherds."
2. "We must therefore, above all things, guard against being deceived by pretended shepherds or counterfeit sheep, if we do not choose, of our own accord, to expose ourselves to wolves and thieves."
3. "He who turns aside from [Christ] to go elsewhere neither keeps the road nor enters by the door."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus has a direct word for them."
2. "It really is an allegory of the Good Shepherd and self-explanatory."
3. "Here the man jumping over the wall comes to steal and to do it by violence like a bandit. He is both thief and robber."

### John Gill:
1. "The design of [the parable] is to show that Christ is the true and only shepherd, who was appointed, called, and sent of God, whose the sheep are, whose voice they hear, and know, and whom they follow."
2. "By the 'sheepfold' is meant the church of God... a good fold it is... where the people of God, and sheep of Christ are gathered together; where there is a strict union between them; have society with each other; keep one another warm and comfortable; and where they are fed and nourished, and are preserved; and where they lie down and have rest."
3. "Now he that does not come into the church of God, whether as a member of it, or officer in it, at this door, but climbeth up some other way; by hypocrisy and deceit... the same is a thief and a robber."
