# John 10:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The thief seeks to deceive and steal the hearts of Christ's sheep, trying to carry them away from Him. But they lack the power to accomplish it. In contrast, Christ entered this world, offering His entire human nature, soul, and body, so that His people could have spiritual and eternal life. His purpose was to provide an abundant evidence of eternal life, strengthening their faith and kindling a more vibrant hope.
