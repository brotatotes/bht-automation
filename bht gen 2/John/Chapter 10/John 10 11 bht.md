# John 10:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The good shepherd is one who is appointed and sent by his Father to care for his chosen ones. He fulfills his role as a good shepherd by providing nourishment, protection, healing, and guidance for the sheep. His love for the sheep is demonstrated in his willingness to lay down his own life for them, offering himself as a ransom so that they may have eternal life. Just as a faithful shepherd puts the well-being of his flock above his own, this shepherd's sacrificial love for his sheep is worthy of admiration and gratitude.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I am the good shepherd—emphatically, and, in the sense intended, exclusively so."
2. "The good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep—Though this may be said of literal shepherds... yet here, beyond doubt, it points to the struggle which was to issue in the willing surrender of the Redeemer's own life, to save His sheep from destruction."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The good shepherd - The faithful and true shepherd, willing to do all that is necessary to defend and save the flock."
2. "Giveth his life - A shepherd that regarded his flock would hazard his own life to defend them."
3. "To give his life, here, means the same as not to fly, or to forsake his flock; to be willing to expose his life, if necessary, to defend them."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In the fulfillment of His work, the Good Shepherd claims the admiration of all that is generous in man."
2. "The epithet kalov, applied here to the shepherd, points to the essential goodness as nobly realized, and appealing to admiring respect and affection."
3. "The phrase 'layeth down His life' is explained in two ways: either as laying down as a pledge, paying as a price, or as laying aside his life like a garment. The latter seems preferable."

### John Calvin:
1. "The good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep. From the extraordinary affection which he bears towards the sheep, he shows how truly he acts towards them as a shepherd; for he is so anxious about their salvation, that he does not even spare his own life." 
2. "Hence it follows, that they who reject the guardianship of so kind and amiable a shepherd are exceedingly ungrateful, and deserve a hundred deaths, and are exposed to every kind of harm."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd layeth down his life for the sheep." The highest point which the Shepherd’s faithfulness can reach is His laying down His life for the sheep: when the wolf assaults the flock, the Good Shepherd repels him, although He die in the attempt.
2. "Is there a shepherd whose work is not only faithful but all fair, without spot or defect, such a Shepherd of the flock is the Lord Jesus."
3. "Our Lord’s hearers at the time would understand no more than this, that at the peril of His life He would defend His flock; but it is impossible to read chap. John 11:51 without seeing in the words a reference to the truth declared in chap. John 3:14-15, John 12:32, the atoning death of the Redeemer which brings life to the world."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "καλος calls attention to the beauty in character and service like 'good stewards' (1 Peter 4:10), 'a good minister of Christ Jesus' (1 Timothy 4:6). Often both adjectives appear together in the ancient Greek as once in the New Testament." 
2. "Layeth down his life for his sheep... The true physician does this for his patient as the shepherd for his sheep." 
3. "This shepherd gives his life for the sin of the world (John 1:29; 1 John 2:2)."

### John Gill:

2. "And discharging his office aright, he is the good shepherd; as appears in his providing good pasture, and a good fold for his sheep; in protecting them from their enemies; in healing all their diseases; in restoring their souls when strayed from him; in watching over them in the night seasons."
3. "the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep: not only exposes it to danger, as David did his, for the sake of his father's flock, but gives it away freely and voluntarily, for the sake of the sheep; in their room and stead, as a ransom for them, that they may be delivered from death, and might have eternal life."
