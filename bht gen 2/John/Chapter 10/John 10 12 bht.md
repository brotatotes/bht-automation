# John 10:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The false shepherds, compared to hirelings, serve for gain rather than out of genuine love and commitment. They are motivated by their own self-interest instead of caring for the flock. These hirelings do not have a true ownership or shepherding relationship with the sheep. They would abandon the flock and leave them vulnerable to the attacks of wild beasts. However, Jesus, the true Shepherd, emphasizes His special relationship with the sheep, just like His Father is the great Proprietor and Lord of the flock.
