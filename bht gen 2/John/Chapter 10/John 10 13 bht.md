# John 10:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The hireling flees because he is driven by his own self-interest, focusing on his wages rather than caring for the sheep. He lacks the shepherd's heart, which is committed to protecting and providing for the flock. In contrast, the good shepherd demonstrates genuine care and concern for the sheep, tending to their needs and ensuring their well-being. The hireling's lack of genuine care is revealed when faced with danger or difficulty, as he abandons the sheep and flees.
