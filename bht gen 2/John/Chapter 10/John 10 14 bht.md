## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep—in the peculiar sense of am known of mine—the soul's response to the voice that has inwardly and efficaciously called it; for of this mutual loving acquaintance ours is the effect of His."
2. "The Redeemer's knowledge of us is the active element, penetrating us with His power and life; that of believers is the passive principle, the reception of His life and light."
3. "In this reception, however, an assimilation of the soul to the sublime object of its knowledge and love takes place; and thus an activity, though a derived one, is unfolded, which shows itself in obedience to His commands."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Know my sheep - Know my people, or my church. The word 'know' here is used in the sense of affectionate regard or love."
2. "Jesus knows the hearts, the dangers, and the wants of his people, and his kindness as their shepherd prompts him to defend and aid them."
3. "They have seen their sins, and dangers: and wants; they have felt their need of a Saviour; they have come to him, and they have found him and his doctrines to be such as they need, and they have loved him."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
