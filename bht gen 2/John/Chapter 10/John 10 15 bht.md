# John 10:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The knowledge that Christ and his sheep have of each other is characterized by an extraordinary bond. It reflects the deep love and affection that the Father has for Christ as his own Son, and also the profound understanding that Christ has of the Father's nature and will. Such knowledge implies an inexpressible union, as Christ came down from heaven in complete submission to do the Father's will. This knowledge and union continue to exist in the present time, even as Christ's whole life was ultimately leading him to the sacrificial death he willingly embraced.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "What claim to absolute equality with the Father could exceed this?"
2. "How sublime this, immediately following the lofty claim of the preceding clause! It is the riches and the poverty of 'the Word made flesh'—one glorious Person reaching at once up to the Throne and down even to the dust of death, 'that we might live through Him.'"
3. "A candid interpretation of the words, 'for the sheep,' ought to go far to establish the special relation of the vicarious death of Christ to the Church."
