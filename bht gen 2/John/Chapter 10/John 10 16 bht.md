# John 10:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus speaks of having other sheep, not of this fold, referring to the Gentiles whom he will also bring into his Church. These sheep, though uncalled, belong to Christ and are under his care. This signifies the union of Jews and Gentiles, forming one church with one Shepherd. Jesus, who laid down his life for all, will ensure that there is no division or corruption among his flock.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "By these wonderful words, as by those in Acts 18:10, and by the conclusion of Matthew 25:0, our Lord shews that, dark and miserable as the Gentile world was, He had sheep even there." 
2. "The Lord speaks of His bringing them, and their hearing His voice: meaning that His servants in His name and by His power would accomplish this work." 
3. "The μία ποίμνη is remarkable not μία αὐλή, as characteristically, but erroneously rendered in E. V.: not ONE FOLD, but ONE FLOCK; no one exclusive enclosure of an outward church, but one flock, all knowing the one Shepherd and known of Him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "them also I must bring—He means the perishing Gentiles, already His 'sheep' in the love of His heart and the purpose of His grace to 'bring them' in due time."
2. "This is not the language of mere foresight that they would believe, but the expression of a purpose to draw them to Himself by an inward and efficacious call, which would infallibly issue in their spontaneous accession to Him."
3. "there shall be one flock—rather 'one flock' (for the word for 'fold,' as in the foregoing verses, is quite different)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There were others whom it was his purpose and intention to call to the blessings of the gospel and salvation."
2. "This certainty could have existed only in consequence of the intention of God that it should be so."

### Marvin Vincent:

3. "Nor, moreover, does Jesus mean that the Gentiles are to be incorporated into the Jewish fold, but that the unity of the two is to consist in their common relation to Himself."

### John Calvin:
1. "For this reason he calls those sheep which had not the same mark, but belonged to a different class, other sheep... the meaning is, that the pastoral office of Christ is not confined within the limits of Judea, but is far more extensive."
2. "But this is not applicable, in every respect, to the present passage, which relates to the outward aspect of the Church, because the Gentiles, who had been strangers for a time, were afterwards invited into the kingdom of God, along with the Jews."
3. "We must observe the way in which the flock of God is gathered. It is, when all have one shepherd, and when his voice alone is heard... If Papists can show us that there is any thing of this sort among them, let them enjoy the title of The Church, of which they vaunt so much."

### Philip Schaff:

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Clearly 'his flock is not confined to those enclosed in the Jewish fold, whether in Palestine or elsewhere' (Westcott). Christ's horizon takes in all men of all races and times."
