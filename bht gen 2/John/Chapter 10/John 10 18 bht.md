# John 10:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
No man could take it away from me without his Father's will and plan, as Jesus willingly surrendered himself and freely went to the cross. Christ, the Prince of life, had the power to lay down his life as a ransom for his sheep, and the power to take it again after satisfying the sins of the whole world. These actions were all according to the commission he received from his Father, willingly and faithfully executed by Jesus.
