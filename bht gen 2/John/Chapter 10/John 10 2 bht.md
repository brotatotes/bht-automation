# John 10:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He that entereth in by the door, with a divine commission and authority, is the shepherd of the sheep. This refers to those who are called and sent by God to minister to His people. It applies to Christ Himself, who takes care of His sheep and feeds them as a shepherd does his flock. This truth also holds true for any under shepherd who has a mission and authority derived from Christ. It is a stark contrast to the conduct of the Pharisees, emphasizing the divine recognition and authenticity of those who enter through the door.
