# John 10:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jews resorted to the most offensive reproach in slandering Christ, claiming that he had a demon and was mad. They sought to discount Jesus by associating his teachings with madness and incoherence. Their intention was to rouse contempt and rage, preventing his words from being heard in silence. However, the doctrine of Christ possesses inherent power to defend itself against such slanders. Their irrational accusations only reveal their desperation to resist the truth.
