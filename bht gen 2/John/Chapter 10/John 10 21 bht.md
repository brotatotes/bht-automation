# John 10:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This is not the words or actions of a madman or demoniac, someone possessed by the devil. In fact, the truth of these words is strong enough to maintain itself and has a powerful effect, either making enemies or gaining devoted friends. Divisions caused by unbelief and the passions of men should not be blamed on the gospel itself, but rather on the wickedness and unbelief of individuals. The power, wisdom, and goodness of God will always shine through the gospel, regardless of attempts by wicked men or demons to hinder it.
