# John 10:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During the feast of dedication in Jerusalem, our Lord observed a festival that was instituted by Judas Maccabeus. This feast, known as lights, celebrated the unexpected prosperity and hope. Although originally held in Jerusalem, it could be observed throughout the land. Some suggest there was another Judith who performed a similar heroic act, but the time difference makes this unlikely. Our Lord's participation in this festival reveals that he honored human-appointed festivals, prompting us to consider the innocence of doing the same.

### John Calvin:
1. "The Greek word (·ºêŒ≥Œ∫Œ±·Ω∑ŒΩŒπŒ±) which we have translated dedication, properly signifies renovations; because the temple, which had been polluted, was again consecrated by the command of Judas Maccabaeus."
