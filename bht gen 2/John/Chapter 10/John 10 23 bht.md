# John 10:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus found shelter from the weather by walking in Solomon's porch, a covered colonnade on the eastern side of the outer court of the temple. This portico was not the original one built by Solomon, which had been destroyed, but a reconstruction that the Jews built to honor the ancient porch. It is important to note that when John wrote his gospel, this structure no longer existed, having been destroyed. Nonetheless, it is worthy of mention that the original porch was a magnificent structure, with a wall that stood four hundred cubits high.
