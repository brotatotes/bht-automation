# John 10:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people demanded Jesus to be open and clear about his identity as the Messiah. They accused him of causing doubt and confusion by not plainly declaring himself. They were seeking a straightforward statement from him, as they believed his miracles and teachings were not enough evidence. Their request was influenced by their expectations of a powerful and triumphant Messiah, rather than the humble figure that Jesus presented himself to be.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly—But when the plainest evidence of it was resisted, what weight could a mere assertion of it have?"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Tell us plainly - The Messiah was predicted as a shepherd. Jesus had applied that prediction to himself. They supposed that that was an evidence that he claimed to be the Messiah."
2. "He also performed miracles, which they considered as evidence that he was the Christ."
3. "He was poor and despised. He came contrary to the common expectation. A splendid prince and conqueror had been expected."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "For the common people might, without any fraud, desire that Christ would openly declare that God had sent him to be a deliverer..."
2. "By complaining of being kept in suspense, they pretend that they are so ardently desirous of the promised redemption, that their minds are eagerly and incessantly occupied by the expectation of Christ."
3. "But they are wrong in accusing Christ, as if he had not hitherto confirmed their faith; for it was entirely their own fault that they had not a full and perfect knowledge of him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Taking advantage, perhaps, of the fact that Jesus was in the cloisters of the temple-courts, and not now in the midst of a listening ‘multitude,’ His enemies encompass Him, determined to gain from Him such an avowal of His Messiahship as shall enable them to carry out their designs against His life."
2. "They were stirring up their enmity against Him to a pitch which was to lead them to take away His life; and by their words they confess that He is taking away theirs."
3. "They meant only, How long dost thou excite us or keep us in suspense? Put an end to this by speaking plainly, or (more literally) by speaking out, telling all Thou hast to tell."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Evidently the hostile Jews cherished the memory of the stinging rebuke given them by Jesus when here last, particularly the allegory of the Good Shepherd (John 10:1-19), in which he drew so sharply their own picture."
2. "What do they mean by this metaphor? Αιρω is common enough to lift up the eyes (John 11:41), the voice (Luke 17:13), and in Psalms 25:1; Psalms 86:4 (Josephus, Ant. III. ii. 3) we have 'to lift up the soul.' We are left to the context to judge the precise meaning."
3. "The demand seemed fair enough on the surface. They had made it before when here at the feast of tabernacles (John 8:25). Jesus declined to use the word Χριστος (Messiah) then as now because of the political bearing of the word in their minds."

### John Gill:
1. "How long dost thou make us doubt?...how long dost thou take away our soul?" 
2. "Wherefore dost thou steal away our minds with words?" 
3. "If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly; freely, boldly, openly, in express words."
