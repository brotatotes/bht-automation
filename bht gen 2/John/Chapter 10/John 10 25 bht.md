# John 10:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus repeatedly made it clear that he was the Christ, using various descriptions and teachings. Despite this, his audience remained skeptical and resistant. They failed to recognize the significance of his works and the testimonies they bore about him. By rejecting both his words and miracles, they remained in unbelief and faced the consequences of dying in their sins. Jesus had provided more than sufficient evidence for them to believe in him, and their doubt and uncertainty were without justification.
