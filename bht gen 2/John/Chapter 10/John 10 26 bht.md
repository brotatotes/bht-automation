# John 10:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus explains that the reason the unbelievers do not believe is because they are not among His sheep. They do not possess the character or disposition of His true followers. They lack the obedience of faith that comes from being subjugated by the Spirit of God. In contrast, those who are His sheep hear His voice, are known by Him, and wholeheartedly follow Him. Their faith cannot be shaken or taken away by any force.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I believe it to refer more to the whole allegory, than to any explicit saying of this kind; and this is shown to my mind by the following words in John 10:27: the minor proposition, 'but ye hear not my voice,' being understood."
2. "This was a corollary from the allegory, and thus it might be said καθὼς εἶπον ὑμῖν."
3. "This reference to the allegory some two months after it was spoken, has been used by the rationalists as an argument against the authenticity of the narrative. But, as Meyer observes, it in reality implies that the conflict with the Jewish authorities is here again taken up after that interval, during which it had not broken out."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep"
2. "referring to the whole strain of the Parable of the Sheep"
3. "(John 10:1, &c.)"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Are not my people, my followers. You do not possess the spirit of meek and humble disciples."
2. "Were it not for pride, and prejudice, and vainglory for your false notions of the Messiah, and from a determination not to believe, you would have learned from my declarations and works that I am the Christ."
3. "As I said unto you - Compare John 8:47."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. As I said unto you. The best texts omit.

### John Calvin:
1. "He affirms that the gift of believing is a special gift."
2. "It is not wonderful, if there are few who obey his Gospel, because all whom the Spirit of God does not subdue to the obedience of faith are wild and fierce beasts."
3. "Believers ought rather to consider, that they are the more strongly bound to God, because, while others remain in a state of blindness, they are drawn to Christ by the illumination of the Spirit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They have not the character, the disposition, of His sheep; through this moral defect (for which they are themselves responsible, see chap. John 3:19, etc.) they will not believe."
2. "There is no reference to an essential or necessary state, to any 'decree' through the operation of which they were incapable of faith."
3. "They will not believe... This is brought out more fully in the next verse."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "they were not the chosen of God, predestinated unto eternal life; for as many as are ordained of God to eternal happiness, do believe in God's own time"
3. "Christ, as the omniscient God, knew this, that they were not the chosen of God"

### John Wesley:
