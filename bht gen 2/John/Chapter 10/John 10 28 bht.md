# John 10:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ offers the gift of eternal life to his followers, a present and continuous gift that grants them security and assurance. His sheep, those who have faith in him, can rest in the certainty of their salvation, knowing that no external force can pluck them from his hand. This promise extends to anyone who is in Christ's possession, under his guidance, care, and protection. Thus, through faith in Christ, believers are granted a life of grace that leads to everlasting life and safeguards them from eternal destruction.
