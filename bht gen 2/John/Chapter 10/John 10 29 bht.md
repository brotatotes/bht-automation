# John 10:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God, in His supreme power, has given believers to Jesus and entrusted them to His care. As the church, which is founded on Jesus, is stronger than any opposition it may face, so are those whom the Father has given to Jesus. Not only are they secure in Jesus' hands, but they are also held firmly by the hands of God the Father Himself. Their safety and salvation are assured, for no one can snatch them away from the loving grip of God the Father and Jesus.
