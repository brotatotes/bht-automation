# John 10:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Holy Spirit opens the door to shepherds, allowing them access to the people of God. The shepherd's voice is heard by those who listen to his teachings and love the church. A minister should establish a personal connection with the members of their congregation and address their individual needs. The shepherd calls each sheep by name, showing a close bond between them. The sheep recognize and respond to their shepherd's voice, following him out of love and trust. This bond is formed through the Gospel, which proclaims love, grace, mercy, peace, and salvation.
