# John 10:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He and his Father are one, not only by the consent of will, but also by the unity of power and nature, refuting the views of both Sabellius and Arius. This declaration stands out in its uniqueness among all the words of the prophets, unequivocally pointing to Jesus' divine sonship and his equality with God. If he was not God, his words would have been the most misleading and deceptive spoken by any human being.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Are" is in the masculine gender—"we (two persons) are"; while "one" is neuter—"one thing." Perhaps "one interest" expresses, as nearly as may be, the purport of the saying.
2. Though oneness of essence is not the precise thing here affirmed, that truth is the basis of what is affirmed, without which it would not be true.
3. The "We are" condemns the Sabellians, while the "one" (as explained) condemns the Arians.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word translated 'one' is not in the masculine, but in the neuter gender. It expresses union, but not the precise nature of the union."
2. "Many interpreters have understood this as referring to union of design and of plan."
3. "Most of the Christian fathers understood them, however, as referring to the oneness or unity of nature between the Father and the Son; and that this was the design of Christ appears probable from the following considerations."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "One [εν]. The neuter, not the masculine eiv, one person." 
2. "It implies unity of essence, not merely of will or of power."

### John Calvin:
1. "He intended to meet the jeers of the wicked; for they might allege that the power of God did not at all belong to him, so that he could promise to his disciples that it would assuredly protect them."
2. "He therefore testifies that his affairs are so closely united to those of the Father, that the Father’s assistance will never be withheld from himself and his sheep."
3. "The ancients made a wrong use of this passage to prove that Christ is (ὁμοούσιος) of the same essence with the Father. For Christ does not argue about the unity of substance, but about the agreement which he has with the Father, so that whatever is done by Christ will be confirmed by the power of his Father."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Not one person, but one essence or nature."
2. "Jesus is not referring, of course, to either Sabellius or Arius."
3. "This crisp statement is the climax of Christ's claims concerning the relation between the Father and himself (the Son)."

### John Gill:
1. "Not in person, for the Father must be a distinct person from the Son, and the Son a distinct person from the Father."
2. "Their unity of nature, and equality of power; so that it must be as impracticable to pluck them out of his hands, as out of his Father's, because he is equal with God the Father, and the one God with him."
3. "Christ is both the Son of God, and the son of man...  He is here treating of his divine sonship, and almighty power; wherefore considered in the relation of the Son of God, and as possessed of the same perfections with God, he and his Father are one."

### John Wesley:
1. "I and the Father are one — Not by consent of will only, but by unity of power, and consequently of nature." 
2. "Are — This word confutes Sabellius, proving the plurality of persons: one - This word confutes Arius, proving the unity of nature in God."
3. "Never did any prophet before, from the beginning of the world, use any one expression of himself, which could possibly be so interpreted as this and other expressions were, by all that heard our Lord speak. Therefore if he was not God he must have been the vilest of men."
