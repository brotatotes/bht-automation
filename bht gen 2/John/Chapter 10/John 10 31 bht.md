# John 10:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jews' attempt to stone Jesus again is a manifestation of their persistent opposition towards Him. Their anger stems from the belief that Jesus is guilty of blasphemy, as He has claimed equality with God. The use of a different verb here, indicating that they fetched stones from a distance, highlights their determination to carry out the punishment prescribed in the Law. This deliberate act of stoning reflects the intensity of their hostility towards Jesus and their unyielding desire to eliminate Him as a perceived threat to their religious beliefs and traditions.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Again refers to John 8:59. It seems as though a different verb is purposely chosen here since the interview took place in Solomon's porch, where stones would not be at hand."
2. "The verb here may mean to take up. So Ajax says: 'Send some one as a messenger to bear the evil news...that he first may lift my corpse by this sharp sword transfixed.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "As true religion, in maintaining the glory of God, burns with its own zeal which the Spirit of God directs, so unbelief is the mother of rage, and the devil hurries on the wicked in such a manner, that they breathe nothing but slaughter."
2. "This result shows with what intention they put the question to Christ; for the open confession, of which they pretended to be desirous, instantly drives them to madness."
3. "And yet, though they are hurried along, with such violence, to oppress Christ, there can be no doubt that they assigned some plausible reason for their judgment, as if they were acting according to the injunction of the Law, by which God commands that false prophets shall be stoned, (Deuteronomy 13:5)."

### Philip Schaff:

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The œÄŒ±ŒªŒπŒΩ refers to John 8:59 where Œ∑œÅŒ±ŒΩ was used. They wanted to kill him also when he made himself equal to God in John 5:18." 
2. "Perhaps here ŒµŒ≤Œ±œÉœÑŒ±œÉŒ±ŒΩ means 'they fetched stones from a distance.'"
3. "To stone him (ŒπŒΩŒ± ŒªŒπŒ∏Œ±œÉœâœÉŒπŒΩ Œ±œÖœÑŒøŒΩ).
