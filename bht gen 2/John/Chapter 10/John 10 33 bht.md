# John 10:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jews recognized that Jesus was claiming to be equal to God when he said that he and the Father are one, accusing him of blasphemy and sacrilege. However, they failed to understand that Jesus, being the Son of God, had the authority to make such a claim. Their accusations were based on a flawed understanding of Jesus' divine nature and the evidence of his good works. It is this claim of oneness with God that led to their rejection and persecution of Jesus, even though his works bore witness to his divine identity.
