# John 10:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
What is written in the law? In Psalm 82:6, it is written about the judges or magistrates. The psalm speaks against the injustice of judges in Israel, highlighting their abuse of power and tyranny. It refers back to Exodus 21:6, Exodus 22:9, and Exodus 22:28, where judges are also referred to as 'gods.' Jesus uses this scripture to emphasize that they should not be offended by His claim of being the Son of God, as even the judges themselves were called gods in the Old Testament. He clarifies that he does not deny being the Son of God, rather he justly affirms this truth.
