# John 10:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, as the Son of God, was sanctified and separated by the Father for a unique purpose and mission. This sanctification goes beyond the common sanctification experienced by believers and points to a deeper separation and consecration in the divine will and plan. By referring to himself as the Son of God, Jesus is not only asserting his divine nature, but also highlighting the contrast between his supreme identity and the judges mentioned in the Scriptures. This distinction emphasizes Jesus' unparalleled authority and power as the true Son of God.

### John Calvin:
1. "Whom the Father hath sanctified. There is a sanctification that is common to all believers. But here Christ claims for himself something far more excellent, namely, that he alone was separated from all others, that the power of the Spirit and the majesty of God might be displayed in him."
2. "But we must also understand for what reason and on what condition he was sent It was to bring salvation from God, and to prove and exhibit himself, in every possible way, to be the Son of God."

2. "to save them from sin, Satan, the world, law, hell and death, which none but God could do"
3. "surely it cannot be blasphemy in Christ, to assert himself to be the Son of God, who existed as a divine person from all eternity; and was so early set apart to the office of prophet, priest, and king; and in the fulness of time was sent into this world, to be the author of eternal salvation to the sons of men."
