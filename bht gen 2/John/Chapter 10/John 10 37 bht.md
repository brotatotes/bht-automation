# John 10:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus not only did the works that the Father had given him to finish, but he also did works that were as great as the Father's. These works were only possible by someone who is equal with the Father. Christ, in appealing to his miracles, provides evidence of his deity, sonship, and Messiahship. He does not seek any other validation than what these miracles require.
