# John 10:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ, the great shepherd, provides not only for his flock but also sets an example for them. As the sheep know and recognize his voice, they follow his teachings and guidance. The true pastor should likewise lead their congregation with love, words, and deeds, following in the footsteps of Christ's example. As a shepherd of souls, it is essential to examine oneself and ensure that one is faithfully shepherding their flock, just as Christ does for his own.
