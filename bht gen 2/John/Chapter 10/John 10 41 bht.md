# John 10:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
John, the forerunner of Jesus, did not perform miracles like Jesus did. Instead, his role was to bear witness to the coming of the true Messiah. Although he did not have miraculous signs to validate his message, everything that John spoke about Jesus was true. This highlights the importance of both miracles and prophecies in confirming a divine mission. The people who heard John's testimony were prepared to receive the preaching of Jesus and were able to recognize the authenticity of his words and the power of his miracles.
