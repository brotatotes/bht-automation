# John 10:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, Jesus went back to the place where John initially baptized. Many believed in him there, as seen in John 1:12 and 2:11. This is a strong testimony to the image of the Messiah portrayed by John, as when Jesus arrived, people recognized his true identity. It's interesting to consider what impact our sermons would have if Jesus were to physically walk among us, as imagined by A.J. Gordon in his dream.
