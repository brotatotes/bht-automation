# John 10:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The true people of God will not follow false teachers and strangers who have not been sent by Christ. Instead, they will flee from them, avoiding their harmful influence like the plague. These well-trained sheep have been taught to recognize the voice of their true Shepherd and to discern the difference between His voice and the voice of strangers. They find nothing of God in the words of those who are not sent by Him, and as a result, they reject and flee from them.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The ἀλλότριος is not the shepherd of another section of the flock, but an alien." 
2. "The λῃστής of John 10:1; and τῶν ἀλλ. is generic, as in E. V. Meyer takes it as merely meaning a stranger, one who is not their Shepherd."
3. "This hardly seems strong enough for the context."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jesus by this indicates that the true people of God will not follow false teachers - those who are proud, haughty, and self-seeking, as were the Pharisees."
2. "A church learns to put confidence in a pastor; he knows the wants of his people, sees their danger, and can adapt his instructions to them."
3. "The shepherd goes before, not merely to point out the way, but to see that it is practicable and safe. He is armed in order to defend his charge, and in this he is very courageous."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The ‘stranger’ is not one to whom the porter has opened (for the voice of every one who is thus admitted is familiar to all the sheep); he must therefore have entered by some other way, and he is in the fold as ‘a thief and a robber.’"
2. "No mark of a true shepherd is found in him. He has not entered by the door, and he has not been recognised by the keeper of the door; the sheep do not know his voice; he cannot call them by their names; his object is not their good, but his own spoil and gain."
3. "Lead a flock forth he cannot; the sheep flee from him."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A stranger (αλλοτριω). Literally, 'One belonging to another'...not necessarily the thief and robber"
2. "They simply will not follow such a man or woman, these well-trained sheep will not"
3. "Alas and alas, if only our modern pastors had the sheep (old and young) so trained that they would run away from and not run after the strange voices that call them to false philosophy, false psychology, false ethics, false religion, false life."

### John Gill:
1. "And a stranger will they not follow....but will flee from him."
2. "For they know not the voice of strangers."
3. "Neither will the lambs ever go after strange sheep, and if they see [them], they will flee [from them]."

### John Wesley:
1. "They will not follow a stranger — One whom Christ hath not sent, who doth not answer the preceding description."
2. "But will flee from him - As from the plague."
3. "For they know not the voice of strangers — They cannot relish it; it is harsh and grating to them. They find nothing of God therein."
