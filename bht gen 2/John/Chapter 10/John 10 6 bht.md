# John 10:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Pharisees, to whom our Lord more immediately spoke, did not understand the things He spoke to them, as mentioned at the close of the foregoing chapter. Their misunderstanding was due to the blindness of their minds, the hardness of their hearts, and their prejudices in favor of themselves and against Christ. The things spoken by Him were delivered in a parabolical way, in lively figures, yet plain and easy to be understood. Unfortunately, the Pharisees could not grasp the true meaning behind His words.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This is not properly a parable: but rather a parabolic allegory."
2. "The parable requires narrative to set it forth; and John relates no such."
3. "The right word for παροιμία would be allegory: etymologically it is, any saying diverging from the common way of speech."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This parable" - See the notes at Matthew 13:3.
2. "They understood not ..." - They did not understand the meaning or design of the illustration.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word occurs but once outside of John's writings (2 Peter 2:22)."
2. "The usual word for parable is parabolh, which is once rendered proverb in the A. V. (Luke 4:23, changed to parable by Rev.)."
3. "For the distinction see on Matthew 13:3."

### John Calvin:
1. "This parable. This is the reason why, proudly vaunting of their wisdom, they rejected the light of Christ; for in a matter not very obscure they are exceedingly dull of apprehension."
2. "They did not understand what things they were which he spoke to them. In this clause the Greek manuscripts differ. Some copies might be literally rendered, they did not understand what he said."
3. "Another reading, which I have followed, is more full, though it amounts to the same meaning."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The derivation of the word suggests that the primary meaning was a saying beside or out of the common way which had not the direct plain bearing of an ordinary saying, but either was intended to have many applications or was in some degree circuitous in the method by which it effected its purpose, enigmatical or difficult."
2. "In this latter sense John seems to use the word, which does not therefore differ essentially from the ‘parable,’ as that word is used by the other Evangelists."
3. "On the present occasion it cannot be said that the language of Jesus was in itself difficult to understand; His description was faithful in all its parts; but His words, as said ‘to them,’ the Pharisees could not comprehend."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "As a proverb in N.T. in 2 Peter 2:22, as a symbolic or figurative saying in John 16:25; John 16:29, as an allegory in John 10:6." 
2. "Here clearly παροιμια means an allegory which is one form of the parable."
3. "Jesus spoke this παροιμια to the Pharisees, 'but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.'"

### John Gill:
1. "The things spoken by him being delivered in a parabolical way, though in lively figures, and in terms plain and easy to be understood."
2. "Yet what through the blindness of their minds, and the hardness of their hearts, and their prejudices in favour of themselves, and against Christ."
3. "They did not understand what were meant by them."

### John Wesley:
1. "The Pharisees, to whom our Lord more immediately spake..."
