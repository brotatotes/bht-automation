# John 10:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ is the door that serves as the entrance to the fold, symbolizing the true Church. He is not only the Door, but also the Shepherd. Through Him, both the sheep (the believers) and the shepherds (ministers) are able to enter into the fold and partake in the privileges and blessings of the Church. Additionally, Christ is not just the door to the visible church state, but also the door to heaven itself. He is the only way to the Father, providing the means for believers to have abundant entrance into eternal life.
