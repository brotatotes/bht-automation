# John 10:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Many false prophets and self-proclaimed leaders have tried to infiltrate God's flock, claiming authority and promoting their own traditions as the way of salvation. These impostors are thieves and robbers, seeking personal gain and causing harm to the sheep. However, the true sheep, the elect of God, do not listen to these false teachers or follow their practices. They remain faithful to the true Shepherd, who alone provides the way to salvation and guides His sheep through the door into the pastures of abundant life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He was 'the first thief who clomb into God’s fold;' and all his followers are here spoken of inclusively in the language of the allegory, as coming in by and with him."
2. "However the sheep may for a while listen to these false shepherds, they do not hear them, so as to follow them. Those who do, belong not to the true flock."
3. "This verse forms the transition from Him as ἡ θύρα, to Him as ὁ ποιμήν. He is here set in opposition to ὁ κλέπτης and thus insensibly passes into the place of a ποιμήν, who has been hitherto thus opposed."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "All that ever came before me—the false prophets; not as claiming the prerogatives of Messiah, but as perverters of the people from the way of life, all pointing to Him."
2. "The sheep did not hear them—the instinct of their divinely taught hearts preserving them from seducers, and attaching them to the heaven-sent prophets, of whom it is said that 'the Spirit of Christ was in them'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is probable that he rather refers to the scribes and Pharisees, who claimed to be instructors of the people, who claimed the right to regulate the affairs of religion, and whose only aim was to aggrandize themselves and to oppress the people."
2. "When the Saviour says that 'all' were thieves, he speaks in a popular sense, using the word 'all' as it is often used in the New Testament, to denote the great mass or the majority."
3. "The sheep - The people of God - the pious and humble portion of the Jewish nation. Though the great mass of the people were corrupted, yet there were always some who were the humble and devoted people of God."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ testifies that all the doctrines, by which the world has been led away from him, are so many deadly plagues; because, apart from him, there is nothing but destruction and horrible confusion."
2. "When we see a great multitude of persons going astray, we may not resolve to perish through their example; and, next, that we may not waver, when God permits impostors to deceive many."
3. "Christ declares that they who are called into the order of believers are so firmly bound together, that they cannot stray or wander, or be carried about by any wind of new doctrine."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In the similitude of the door, Jesus had declared that it was through Him alone that the flocks could come out of the Jewish fold into the pastures into which they had longed to enter..."
2. "But some had forgotten this, and had falsely claimed the place that belonged to Jesus, each deceiver pretending that he himself was the medium through which God’s people were to be led to the satisfaction of their hopes."
3. "The meaning of the words must extend much farther, and must embrace all who had sought to turn the people from waiting for the promise which God had given, or had substituted other principles of national life for the hope of the Messiah."

### John Wesley:

2. "all those prophets and expounders of God's word, that enter not by the door of the sheepfold, but run before I have sent them by my Spirit."
3. "Our Lord seems in particular to speak of those that had undertaken this office since he began his ministry, are thieves - Stealing temporal profit to themselves, and robbers - Plundering and murdering the sheep."
