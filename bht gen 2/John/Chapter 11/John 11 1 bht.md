# John 11:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha, is the setting where the remarkable resurrection of Lazarus takes place. This event not only demonstrates the Divine power of Christ but also foreshadows our future resurrection. The mention of Mary and Martha being well-known indicates that they were already familiar figures in apostolic teaching. By providing specific details about Bethany's location and distinguishing it from the other Bethany, the Gospel writer ensures accuracy and clarity. The significance of Lazarus' name, a Hebrew name with a Greek ending, suggests the intersection of different cultures in the narrative.
