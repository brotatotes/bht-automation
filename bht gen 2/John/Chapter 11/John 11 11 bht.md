# John 11:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our friend Lazarus has passed away, though Jesus refers to it as sleeping to convey a deeper meaning. This metaphorical language is often used in Scripture to describe the death of righteous individuals. However, the disciples did not immediately grasp this figurative language, highlighting the challenge of comprehending spiritual truths. The use of metaphor allows for a level of gentleness and modesty in communicating the reality of Lazarus' death and Jesus' power to raise him from the dead.

### Henry Alford:
1. "Quanta humanitate Jesus amicitiam suam cum discipulis communicat!" Bengel.
2. "And the ἡμῶν gives a reason why they should go too."
3. "ἐξ υπνισθῆναι οὐ χρὴ λέγειν, ἀλλʼ ἀφ υπνισθῆναι." Phryn. ed. Lobeck, p. 224.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Our friend Lazarus." To Abraham only is it
accorded in the Old Testament, and not till after his death,
(2 Chronicles 20:7; Isaiah 41:8),
to which our attention is called in the New Testament (Isaiah 41:8- :).
2. "The phrase here employed, "our friend
Lazarus," means more than 'he whom Thou lovest'
in John 11:3, for it implies
that Christ's affection was reciprocated by Lazarus."
3. The symbol of "sleep" for death is common to all
languages, and familiar to us in the Old Testament. In the New
Testament, however, a higher meaning is put into it, in relation to
believers in Jesus.

### Albert Barnes:
1. Lazarus sleepeth - Is dead. The word “sleep” is applied to death,

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Sleepeth [κεκοιμηται] . More correctly, as Rev., hath fallen asleep."
2. "Awake him out of sleep [εξυπνισω αυτον] . Only here in the New Testament."

### John Calvin:
1. "Our friend Lazarus sleepeth. Having formerly asserted that the disease was not deadly, that his disciples may not be too much distressed at seeing what they did not expect, he now informs them also that Lazarus is dead, and excites a hope of his resurrection."
2. "It is a proof of amazing ignorance, that they believe that Christ spoke about sleep; for, though it is a metaphorical form of expression, still it is so frequent and common in Scripture, that it ought to have been familiarly known to all the Jews."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Our friend Lazarus hath fallen asleep; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep."
2. "No second message has been sent to Him; by His own Divine knowledge He speaks of the death of His friend."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Is fallen asleep (κεκοιμητα). Perfect passive indicative of κοιμαω, old verb to put to sleep. Common as a metaphor for death like our cemetery."
2. "I go (πορευομα). Futuristic use of the present tense as in John 14:2."
3. "That I may awake him out of sleep (ινα εξυπνισω αυτον). Purpose clause with ινα and the first aorist active subjunctive of εξυπνιζω, a late compound (εξ, υπνος, sleep) for the older αφυπνιζω, here only in the N.T. See Job 14:12 where also it occurs along with κοιμαομα."

### John Gill:
1. "our friend Lazarus sleepeth; meaning, that he was dead; in which sense the word is often used in the Old Testament, and in the common dialect of the Jews, and frequently in their writings; and especially it is so used of good men"
2. "to raise him from the dead, for the resurrection of the dead is expressed by awaking"
3. "these words respecting Lazarus's sleeping and awaking, express both the omniscience and omnipotence of Christ; his omniscience, that he should know that Lazarus was dead; when at such a distance from him; and his omnipotence, that he could raise him from the dead; and yet his great modesty to signify it in, such covert language, though not difficult to be understood."

### John Wesley:
1. "Our friend Lazarus sleepeth — This he spoke, just when he died."
2. "Sleepeth — Such is the death of good men in the language of heaven."
3. "But the disciples did not yet understand this language. And the slowness of our understanding makes the Scripture often descend to our barbarous manner of speaking."
