# John 11:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If someone is in deep sleep, they will recover, as it is an indication of the easing of a sickness and a sign that health is being restored. This assurance of recovery is emphasized in the statement that sleep signifies being saved and becoming well again. These words of reassurance were meant to dissuade Jesus from traveling to Judea, highlighting the concern for His safety in that region.
