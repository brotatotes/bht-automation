# John 11:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus spoke of Lazarus's death figuratively, using the metaphor of sleeping. The disciples, however, misunderstood his meaning and thought he was referring to natural sleep. This confusion may have been caused by Christ's previous words about Lazarus's sickness and His delay in going to Bethany. The term sleep was commonly used to signify death, and it held a higher spiritual meaning for believers in Jesus. The disciples' initial misinterpretation highlights their lack of understanding of Christ's true message.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Our friend Lazarus." To Abraham only is it accorded in the Old Testament, and not till after his death, to which our attention is called in the New Testament.
2. The phrase here employed, "our friend Lazarus," means more than "he whom Thou lovest" in John 11:3, for it implies that Christ's affection was reciprocated by Lazarus.
3. The symbol of "sleep" for death is common to all languages, and familiar to us in the Old Testament. In the New Testament, however, a higher meaning is put into it, in relation to believers in Jesus.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Taking rest [κοιμησεως]. Akin to the verb in ver. 11 Wyc., the sleeping of sleep."
2. "Tyndale's Version of the New Testament, the natural sleep."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The figure can hardly have been here used by Jesus for the first time."
2. "The misconception of His meaning would seem to have arisen from His words in John 11:4, and from His delay in setting out for Bethany."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The disciples had misunderstood Christ's metaphor for death."
2. "Only use of κοιμησις (from κοιμαω) in the N.T., but it also was used of death (Sirach 46:19)."
3. "Hυπνου (in sleep) is objective genitive of υπνος (sleep, Matthew 1:24)."

### John Gill:
