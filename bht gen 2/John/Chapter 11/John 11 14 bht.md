# John 11:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples were perplexed by Jesus' statements, not comprehending the true meaning. Their slowness to understand was evident, as they failed to grasp the figurative language. The patience of Christ was remarkable, as he tolerated their lack of understanding. Even when speaking plainly, the disciples struggled to comprehend. Jesus straightforwardly told them that Lazarus had died, but their minds were too clouded to fully grasp his words.
