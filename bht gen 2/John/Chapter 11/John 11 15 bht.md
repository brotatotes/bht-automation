# John 11:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus abstained from being present when Lazarus was sick so that the disciples' faith could be strengthened by witnessing not only a restoration to health but the awe-inspiring miracle of raising him from the dead. This intentional delay allowed Jesus to display his power in a more remarkable way, for miracles that resemble natural occurrences are often deemed less remarkable and their glory less understood. Therefore, even though the death of his friend was grievous to him, it was ultimately for the disciples' benefit, as it served to promote their belief that Jesus is the Messiah.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

1. "Jesus rejoices not over the sad event itself, but that He was not there, which might prove salutary to the disciples' faith."
2. "The ἵνα πιστ. is not to be taken as the great end of the miracle, but the end as regarded them."
3. "Beware of the imaginary ecbatic ἵνα, which does not exist."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "It is beautifully congruous to the divine decorum that in the presence of the Prince of Life no one is ever said to have died."
3. "His friend's death, as such, could not have been to Him 'joyous'; the sequel shows it was 'grievous'; but for them it was safe."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If I had been there during his sickness, the entreaties of his sisters and friends would have prevailed with me to restore him to health."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
