# John 11:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Thomas, also known as Didymus, is called the twin because he was a twin. When he suggests going with Jesus, he is aware of the danger Jesus faces in Judea. Thomas's words may seem like a cry of despair, but they also show his deep love and devotion to Jesus, willing to go and even die with him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Let us also go (with our Master, implied in the καί), that we may die with Him." 
2. "This is in exact accord with the character of Thomas, as shewn in ch. John 14:5; John 20:25; ever ready to take the dark view, but deeply attached to his Lord."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Lovely spirit, though tinged with some sadness, such as reappears at John 14:5, showing the tendency of this disciple to take the dark view of things."
2. "He perceives clearly how this journey to Judea will end, as respects his Master, and not only sees in it peril to themselves, as they all did, but feels as if he could not and cared not to survive his Master's sacrifice to the fury of His enemies."
3. "It was that kind of affection which, living only in the light of its Object, cannot contemplate, or has no heart for life, without it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They who refer it to Lazarus suppose this to be the meaning: 'Let us go and die, for what have we to hope for if Jesus returns into Judea? Lately they attempted to stone him, and now they will put him to death, and we also, like Lazarus, shall be dead.'"
2. "Others suppose, probably more correctly, that it refers to Jesus: 'He is about to throw himself into danger. The Jews lately sought his life, and will again. They will put him to death. But let us not forsake him. Let us attend him and die with him.'"


### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Didymus [διδυμος]. Not a surname of Thomas, but the Greek equivalent of the Aramaic name, twin."
2. "Fellow-disciples [συμμαθηταις]. Only here in the New Testament."
3. "We may die. 'He will die for the love which he has, but he will not affect the faith which he has not' (Westcott)."

### John Calvin:
1. "Thomas is now prepared to follow, but it is without confidence; or, at least, he does not fortify himself by the promise of Christ, so as to follow hint with cheerfulness and composure."
2. "Let us go, that we may die with him. This is the language of despair, for they ought to have entertained no fears about their own life."
3. "Thomas does not refuse to die with Christ. But this, as I have said, proceeds from inconsiderate zeal; for he ought rather to have taken courage from faith in the promise."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "That is, with Jesus (not with Lazarus). It is plain that Jesus cannot be turned aside by their counsels or prayers; He is certainly about to return to Judea, at the peril of His life."
2. "The language is undoubtedly that of fervent love to Jesus, but it is also the language of despair and vanished hope. This is the end of all, death; not the Messianic kingdom, not life."
3. "It is remarkable that at every mention of this apostle John adds the Greek interpretation (Didymus, that is Twin) of the Aramaic name. It has been supposed that Didymus is the name with which Gentile Christians became most familiar; but if so it is singular that no other name than Thomas is found in the Synoptic Gospels and the Acts."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Aramaic word for Thomas means Twin and Didymus is just the Greek equivalent of Thomas." 
2. "Die with Jesus, Thomas means. Lazarus is already dead and they will kill Jesus."

### John Gill:
1. "perhaps he may be so called because he was one"
2. "he, and the rest of the disciples, imagined that Christ, by returning to Judea, would be in great danger of losing his life"
3. "Thomas stirs up his fellow disciples to go along with him, and die altogether"

### John Wesley:
1. "Thomas in Hebrew, as Didymus in Greek, signifies a twin."
2. "With him — With Jesus, whom he supposed the Jews would kill."
3. "It seems to be the language of despair."
