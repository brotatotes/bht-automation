# John 11:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus heard about Lazarus' illness, he stayed where he was for two days before setting out for Bethany. It seems that he did not go directly to the town itself, but somewhere close to it. By the time Jesus arrived, Lazarus had already been in the grave for four days, most likely dying on the same day that Mary and Martha sent word to Jesus. After receiving the news, Jesus decided to stay two more days before making his way to Judea.
