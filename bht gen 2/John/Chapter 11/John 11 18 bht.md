# John 11:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Bethany was located about two miles from Jerusalem, making it easily accessible to many Jews who wanted to offer their condolences to the sisters upon the death of their brother. This proximity also allowed news of the upcoming miracle to spread quickly among the people. Additionally, a furlong, which is mentioned in relation to the distance, was a unit of measurement that equated to about two-thirds of a mile or 266 cubits.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The geographical notice is given, to account for the occurrence detailed in the next verse."
2. "But seeing that John alone uses this form of designation...and that he probably wrote after the destruction of Jerusalem, it is more natural...to explain the past tense by his regarding Jerusalem and its neighbourhood as laid waste at the time when he published his Gospel."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Bethany was nigh Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs—rather less than two miles; mentioned to explain the visits of sympathy noticed in the following words, which the proximity of the two places facilitated."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Nigh unto Jerusalem - This is added to show that it was easy for many of the Jews to come to the place. The news that Jesus was there, and the account of the miracle, would also be easily carried to the Sanhedrin."
2. "Fifteen furlongs - Nearly two miles. It was directly east from Jerusalem."
3. "By the dim light of a taper we also descended very cautiously, by 25 slippery steps, to the reputed sepulchre of Lazarus, or El Azariyeh, as both tomb and village are now called. But I have no description of it to give, and no questions about it to ask. It is a wretched cavern, every way unsatisfactory, and almost disgusting."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Fifteen furlongs. About two miles.

### John Calvin:

3. "Nor is it a new or uncommon occurrence, that men who, with excessive eagerness, continually gape for miracles, are altogether dull and stupid in the consideration of them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This verse is of importance, not merely as preparing for John 11:19, but also as showing that Jesus in visiting Bethany was coming into the immediate presence of His enemies."
2. "They had pronounced Him a blasphemer, and they were determined to bring Him to the blasphemer's death (John 10:31; John 10:39)."


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The idiom of απο with the ablative for distance is like the Latin a millibus passum duobus (Caesar, Bell. Gall. ii. 7), but it (προ also, John 12:1) occurs already in the Doric and in the Koine often."
2. "The idiom of απο with the ablative for distance is like the Latin a millibus passum duobus."
