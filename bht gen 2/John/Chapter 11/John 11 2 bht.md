# John 11:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Mary of Bethany is mentioned in the Bible as the one who anointed the Lord with ointment. This act of anointing was significant, as it was done in preparation for His burial. It is important to note that Mary of Bethany is not the same person as the woman mentioned in Luke 7:36-50, as some have erroneously suggested. Mary of Bethany's close relationship with Jesus is highlighted in the Gospel accounts, and her actions demonstrate her deep love and reverence for Him. The mention of her name along with her brother Lazarus indicates the close bond they shared with Jesus.
