# John 11:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If only you had been here, my brother would not have died. These words, spoken by Mary, reveal a mix of faith and doubt. While showing trust in Jesus' healing power, she also implies that his physical presence was necessary for the miracle. However, it is important to note that Jesus had the ability to heal even from a distance, as he did with the centurion's servant and the nobleman's son in Capernaum.

### John Calvin:

### Philip Schaff:

2. "In His presence her brother could not have died."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died" - Condition of the second class with ε and the imperfect ης (no aorist of ειμ, to be) in the condition and αν with the second aorist active indicative of αποθνησκω.
