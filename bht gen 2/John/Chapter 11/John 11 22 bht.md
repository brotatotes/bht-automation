# John 11:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Martha's faith in Jesus is evident through her expectation that He could perform a great miracle, possibly even raising her dead brother. Although she may not have fully realized His divinity at that moment, she recognized His ability to intercede with God and obtain whatever was needed. Her words demonstrate a combination of both hopeful anticipation and a recognition of Jesus' power and connection to God. Martha believed that with Jesus present, help and blessings were not far away.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "She seems to express some expectation of the raising of her brother; but it is too great a thing for her to venture to mention: possibly she had not dared to form the thought fully, but had some vague feeling after help, such as she knew He would give."
2. "I can hardly see, as some have done, a 'verbum minus dignum' in the form of her expression, ὅσα ἂν αἰτήσῃ τὸν θ . κ . τ . λ. It was said in the simplicity of her faith, which, it is true, was not yet a fully ripened faith: but it differs little from our Lord’s own words."
3. "The repetition of ὁ θεός after τὸν θεόν is to be noticed, as expressive of her faith in the unity of purpose and action between Jesus and God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Energetic characters are usually sanguine, the rainbow of hope peering through the drenching cloud."
2. "Whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee, that is 'even to the restoration of my dead brother to life,' for that plainly is her meaning, as the sequel shows."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Whatever is necessary to our consolation that thou wilt ask, thou canst obtain."
2. "It is possible that she meant gently to intimate that he could raise him up and restore him again to them."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Martha, as Trench observes, 'plainly reveals her poor, unworthy conception of His person, that she recognizes in Him no more than a prophet, when she ascribes that asking [αιτεισθαι] to Him which He never ascribes to Himself'." 
2. "Bengel says: 'Martha did not speak in Greek, yet John expresses her inaccurate remark, which the Lord kindly tolerated.'"
3. "The verb aijtew is used of the asking of an inferior from a superior. Erwtaw is to ask on equal terms, and hence is always used by Christ of His own asking from the Father, in the consciousness of His equal dignity."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The presence of the great Friend and Helper seems to give a sudden quickening to Martha’s faith." 
2. "And yet, though truly expressive of the firmest confidence in Jesus, her words are vague; and the later narrative seems to prove that no definite expectation was present to her mind." 
3. "The language is rather that of one who so believes in Jesus as to be assured that, where He is, help and blessing cannot be absent."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Even now I know."
2. "As many things as thou dost ask of God."
3. "God will give."

### John Gill:
1. "At this distance of time, though her brother had been in the grave four days."
2. "Whether Martha had such a clear notion of the deity of Christ, as yet, as she afterwards had, is not so certain: however, she was persuaded that he had great interest with God."
3. "Whatever he desired of him was granted to him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Whatsoever thou wilt ask, God will give it thee"
2. "So that she already believed he could raise him from the dead."
