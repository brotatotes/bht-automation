# John 11:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The words Jesus spoke to Martha were intentionally ambiguous to test her faith. Like a parable, they held the potential for faith to grasp and ascend, while unbelief or a dull heart would misunderstand. Jesus, fully aware of Martha's unspoken request, answered her with an assurance that her brother would indeed rise again. His response left room for interpretation, whether Lazarus would rise in that moment or at the general resurrection.
