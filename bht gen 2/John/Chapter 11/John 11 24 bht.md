# John 11:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the face of her brother's death, Martha clings to her belief in the resurrection at the last day. This conviction, deeply rooted in the Jewish understanding, provided comfort and hope for those who suffered loss. However, Martha's true desire goes beyond this belief. She longs for something greater, a tangible reunion with her brother in the present, a hope that only a divine intervention can fulfill. Jesus, fully aware of Martha's unspoken plea, stands ready to reveal himself in the midst of her darkest hour, offering a comfort that surpasses all human understanding.
