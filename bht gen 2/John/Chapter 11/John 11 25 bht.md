Jesus declares that he himself is the source and cause of resurrection and life. By stating I am the resurrection, Jesus emphasizes that he has the power to restore life, and it is through him that the dead will rise. Not only does he grant resurrection, but he is also the very essence of life. Those who place their faith in Jesus will experience everlasting life, even if they physically die. Through belief in Christ, they receive a new spiritual life and are filled with a desire for the things of God.
