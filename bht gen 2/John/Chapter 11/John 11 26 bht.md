# John 11:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Whoever will be found alive at Christ's second coming, and is a believer in him, shall never die, but shall be changed, and shall be forever with Christ, for grace may be very low in its exercise, and seem ready to die, but the principle of life will never be extinct in believers. So when faced with doubts or afflictions, we should ask ourselves, Believest thou this? and believe every tittle of the power of Christ and the privileges of believers.
