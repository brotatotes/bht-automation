# John 11:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Mary's response to the call of the Master revealed her deep faith in Christ, paralleling the expressions of faith by the apostles themselves. The secrecy of the interaction between Mary and Jesus was necessary to prevent the Jews, who were hostile towards Christ, from overhearing. By referring to Jesus as the Master, Mary showed her reverence for Him and her submission as one of His disciples.
