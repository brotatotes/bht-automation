# John 11:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Mary, having an equal affection for her Lord as her sister Martha, arose quickly and went unto him. It is evident that both Martha and Mary, driven by their great love for Christ, disregarded the customary mourning practices of not leaving the house during the first week. Mary's swift action not only demonstrates her hope of finding solace in Jesus but also reflects her desire for His interposition, putting a spring into her distressed spirit.
