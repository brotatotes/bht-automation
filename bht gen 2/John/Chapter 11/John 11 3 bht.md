# John 11:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Their message conveyed their trust and reliance on Jesus, the one who loved as a friend, and the one with the power to heal. Just like Lazarus, who was loved by Christ, they knew that it was right to seek Jesus' help in their time of need, for he is the physician of both body and soul. The illnesses and trials faced by those loved by Christ are not meant as punishments, but rather as opportunities for growth and transformation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The message evidently was to request the Lord to come and heal him."
2. "Implies that the sickness was of a dangerous kind."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "A most womanly appeal, yet how reverential, to the known affection of her Lord for the patient."
2. "Those whom Christ loves are no more exempt than others from their share of earthly trouble and anguish: rather are they bound over to it more surely."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This shows that special attachments are lawful for Christians, and that those friendships are especially lovely which are tempered and sweetened with the spirit of Christ."
2. "Friendships should always be cemented by religion, and one main end of those attachments should be to aid one another in the great business of preparing to die."
3. "In sickness, we should implore the aid and presence of Jesus. He only can restore us and our friends; he only can perform for us the office of a friend when all other friends fail; and he only can cheer us with the hope of a blessed resurrection."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "They do not say, come. He who loves needs but know" (Bengel).

### John Calvin:
1. "The message is short, but Christ might easily learn from it what the two sisters wished; for, under this complaint, they modestly state their request that he would be pleased to grant them relief."
2. "We are not forbidden, indeed, to use a longer form of prayer; but our principal object ought to be, to pour into the bosom of God all our cares, and everything that distresses us, that he may afford deliverance."
3. "We ought also to observe that, from Christ’s love, they are led to entertain a confident hope of obtaining assistance, he whom thou lovest; and this is the invariable rule of praying aright; for, where the love of God is, there deliverance is certain and at hand, because God cannot forsake him whom he loveth."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Their confidence in the love and in the power of Jesus is shown by the absence of any request: the message is a tender and delicate expression of their need."
2. "With the description of Lazarus compare chap. John 20:2 (where the same verb for ‘love’ is used), ‘the disciple whom Jesus loved.’"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Thou lovest (φιλεις). Φιλεω means to love as a friend (see φιλος in verse John 11:11) and so warmly, while αγαπαω (akin to αγαμα, to admire, and αγαθος, good) means high regard."
2. "Here both terms occur of the love of Jesus for Lazarus (ηγαπα in verse John 11:5). Both occur of the Father's love for the Son (αγαπα in John 3:35, φιλε in John 5:20)."
3. "Hence the distinction is not always observed."

### John Gill:
1. "For it seems that Lazarus was in a very singular manner loved by Christ, as man, as John the beloved disciple was."
2. "They were very right in applying to Christ in this time of need, who is the physician, both of the bodies and souls of men."
3. "Such who are the peculiar objects of Christ's love, are attended in this life with bodily sickness, disorders, and diseases, which are sent unto them, not in a way of vindictive wrath, but in love, and as fatherly chastisements."
