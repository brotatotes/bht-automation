# John 11:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus had not yet entered the town of Bethany, but had stayed outside, closer to Lazarus' grave, where he planned to perform the miraculous resurrection. He remained in the place where Martha had met him, patiently waiting for Mary to join them. This location was chosen deliberately, as Jesus deemed it more suitable for their conversation, avoiding the crowded and overwhelming environment of their home, which was filled with Jews.
