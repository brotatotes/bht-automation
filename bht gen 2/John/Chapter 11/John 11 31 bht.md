# John 11:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jews had a custom of visiting graves for various reasons, such as to confirm the death of individuals and to seek mercy and blessings for themselves and others. They would prostrate themselves on the graves of prophets, wise men, and the righteous, demonstrating their faith in the resurrection. Additionally, some disciples of the wise men would gather at gravesites to study the law, showing respect to the deceased. This cultural context helps us understand why the crowd, assuming Mary was going to the tomb, decided not to accompany her.
