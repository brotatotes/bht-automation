# John 11:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Mary heard that the Master had come and was calling for her, she immediately fell down at his feet, just as her sister Martha had not done before. She expressed her deep sorrow by saying the same words that Martha had spoken earlier, acknowledging that if Jesus had been there, their brother would not have died. Mary's immediate response showed her recognition of Christ's authority and her trust in his power to bring about restoration.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The words of Mary are fewer, and her action more impassioned, than those of her sister."
2. "She was perhaps interrupted by the arrival of the Jews."
3. "When the genitive of the enclitic personal pronoun is prefixed to its substantive, a slight sense of the dativus commodi is given: 'non mihi frater mortuus esset.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Master is come and calleth for thee."

2. "Though she appears to speak of Christ respectfully, yet we have lately pointed out what is faulty in these words; for the power of Christ, which filled heaven and earth, ought not to have been limited to his bodily presence."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Her first words are nearly the same as her sister’s: there is only in the Greek a slight difference in the place of ‘my’ which gives a touching emphasis to the expression of personal loss."
2. "Mary’s absorbing grief makes other words impossible: she falls at the feet of Jesus weeping."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Fell down at his feet (επεσεν αυτου προς τους ποδας). Second aorist active of πιπτω, to fall. Note unusual position of αυτου."
2. "This impulsive act like Mary. She said precisely what Martha had said to Jesus (verse John 11:21)."
3. "But she said no more, only wept (verse John 11:33)."

### John Gill:
1. "It is blessed meeting Christ any where; and where he is preached, and his ordinances administered, let it be in what place it will, there may the presence of Christ be expected." 
2. "Martha had been here before, and had had some conversation with Christ to her great satisfaction, and she goes and calls her sister, that she might enjoy the same: so souls that have met with Jesus under such a ministry, in such a place, invite others to go thither also."
3. "Saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died; which were the same words Martha uttered upon her first meeting Jesus, John 11:21; and it is very likely that they had often expressed themselves in such language one to another, saying to each other, if our Lord Jesus had been but here, our dear brother Lazarus would not have died."

### John Wesley:
1. "She fell at his feet — This Martha had not done."
2. "So she makes amends for her slowness in coming."
