# John 11:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, deeply moved by the sorrow of others, restrained his tears and groaned inwardly. His groaning was not a sign of grief, but rather an expression of deep emotion and inner turmoil. It is likely that his groaning was a response to the insincere mourning of the Jews and the excessive sorrow of Mary. Though Jesus was fully human and capable of experiencing emotions, his reactions were not mere passions, but purposeful and controlled expressions of compassion and empathy.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Jesus, with the tears of sympathy already rising and overcoming His speech, checked them, so as to be able to speak the words following."
2. "I would thus divest the self-restraint of all stoical and unworthy character, and consider it as merely physical, requiring indeed an act of the will, and a self-troubling, a complication of feeling, but implying no deliberate disapproval of the rising emotion."
3. "Indignation over unbelief and sin, and death the fruit of sin, doubtless lay in the background; but to see it in the words seems unnatural."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The tears of Mary and her friends acting sympathetically upon Jesus, and drawing forth His emotions. What a vivid and beautiful outcoming of His 'real' humanity!"
2. "The word here rendered 'groaned' does not mean 'sighed' or 'grieved,' but rather 'powerfully checked his emotion'—made a visible effort to restrain those tears which were ready to gush from His eyes."
3. "Referring probably to this visible difficulty of repressing His emotions."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He saw the sorrow of others, and he was also moved with sympathy and love."
2. "The word 'groan' usually, with us, denotes an expression of internal sorrow by a special sound. The word here, however, does not mean that utterance was given to the internal emotion, but that it was deep and agitating, though internal."
3. "Perhaps this expression denotes that his countenance was troubled, or gave indications of sorrow."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word for groaned occurs three times elsewhere: Matthew 9:30; Mark 1:43; Mark 14:5. In every case it expresses a charge, or remonstrance, accompanied with a feeling of displeasure."
2. "Tw pneu. mati, the spirit, is regarded as the object of Jesus' inward charge or remonstrance. This is explained variously: as that Jesus sternly rebuked the natural shrinking of His human spirit, and summoned it to the decisive conflict with death; or that He checked its impulse to put forth His divine energy at once."
3. "The interpretation which explains tw pneumati as the sphere of feeling is to be preferred."

### John Calvin:
1. "When, of his own accord, he conforms to those mourners, he gives proof that he has sympathy."
2. "Before granting deliverance or aid, by the groaning of his spirit, by a strong feeling of grief, and by tears, he shows that he is as much affected by our distresses as if he had endured them in his own person."
3. "Christ, though otherwise tranquil and free from all passion, brought groaning and grief upon himself of his own accord...so that he did not differ at all from his brethren, sin only excepted."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There is little doubt that the first word describing the emotion of Jesus denotes rather anger than sorrow."
2. "The only other passage in the New Testament in which we find the word is John 11:38 of this chapter."
3. "This explanation appears upon the whole to be the most probable."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Mary's weeping was genuine, that of the Jews was partly perfunctory and professional and probably actual 'wailing. It was an incongruous combination."
2. "He groaned in the spirit...to snort with anger like a horse...So it seems best to see that sense here and in verse John 11:38. The presence of these Jews, the grief of Mary, Christ's own concern, the problem of the raising of Lazarus--all greatly agitated the spirit of Jesus."
3. "His sympathy with the weeping sister and the wailing crowd caused this deep emotion...Some indignation at the loud wailing would only add to the agitation of Jesus."

### John Gill:
1. "He groaned in the spirit; in his human soul; and which shows, that he had a real human soul, subject to passions, though sinless ones."
2. "The word signifies an inward motion of the mind, through indignation and anger; and it may be partly at the weakness of Mary's faith, and at her immoderate sorrow; and partly at the hypocrisy of the Jews."
3. "Or else this inward groaning was through grief, sympathizing with Mary, and her friends, his human soul being touched with a fellow feeling of their griefs and sorrows."

### John Wesley:
1. "He groaned — So he restrained his tears. So he stopped them soon after, John 11:38."
2. "He troubled himself — An expression amazingly elegant, and full of the highest propriety."
3. "For the affections of Jesus were not properly passions, but voluntary emotions, which were wholly in his own power. And this tender trouble which he now voluntarily sustained, was full of the highest order and reason."
