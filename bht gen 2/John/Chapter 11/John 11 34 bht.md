# John 11:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The question Jesus asked was a simple inquiry for information, although he already knew where the dead man was buried. By asking this question, Jesus was able to demonstrate his deep compassion for the family of the deceased. Furthermore, Jesus intentionally asked this question to draw the attention of the people, including the Jews, to the burial site. This allowed them to witness the upcoming miracle that Jesus was about to perform. The people invited Jesus to come and see, indicating that the grave was close by.
