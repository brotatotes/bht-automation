# John 11:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ's love for all people, even when they are spiritually dead, is truly remarkable and goes beyond human understanding. It is even more astonishing when we consider that the one who loves us in this way is the eternal Son of God, who is infinitely blessed and divine. His love is not only everlasting and predates our existence, but it is also a love of deep affection and delight. Furthermore, this love is freely given and not based on anything we have done to deserve it. Therefore, we can rightly exclaim, Behold, how he loved us!
