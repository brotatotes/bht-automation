# John 11:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The questioning and skepticism expressed by some of the Jews in this passage reveals a certain level of suspicion and doubt. They were quick to cast doubt on Jesus' ability to prevent Lazarus' death, despite witnessing the miracle of the blind man's sight being restored. Their lack of understanding is evident in their astonishment that Jesus could not only heal the blind, but also raise someone from the dead. It is a curious combination of faith and unbelief, as they acknowledge the incredible power Jesus displayed, yet fail to fully grasp the extent of his capabilities.
