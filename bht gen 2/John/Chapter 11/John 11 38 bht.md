# John 11:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Jesus reaches the tomb, a mixture of sadness and righteous indignation wells up within him. Like the cave where Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were buried, this tomb was a natural or artificially-carved cavity in a rock. It was sealed with a large stone, perhaps even with a memorial inscription. These details emphasize the power of Christ in raising Lazarus and highlight the family's well-being.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Jesus again groaning in himself...checked or repressed His rising feelings, in the former instance, of sorrow, here of righteous indignation at their unreasonable unbelief."
2. "Struggling emotion was deeper, now that His eye was about to rest on the spot where lay, in the still horrors of death, His 'friend.'"
3. "A cave—the cavity, natural or artificial, of a rock. This, with the number of condoling visitors from Jerusalem, and the costly ointment with which Mary afterwards anointed Jesus at Bethany, all go to show that the family was in good circumstances."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was a cave - This was a common mode of burial. See the notes at Matthew 8:28."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The stone was placed over the entrance mainly to guard against wild beasts, and could easily be removed."
2. "The sister of him that was dead. An apparently superfluous detail, but added in order to give point to her remonstrance at the removal of the stone, by emphasizing the natural reluctance of a sister to have the corrupted body of her brother exposed."
3. "Not indicating an experience of her sense, which has been maintained by some expositors, and sometimes expressed in the pictorial treatment of the subject, but merely her inference from the fact that he had been dead four days."

1. "Christ does not approach the sepulcher as an idle spectator, but as a champion who prepares for a contest."
2. "The violent tyranny of death, which he had to conquer, is placed before his eyes."
3. "Next follow various circumstances, which tend to display more fully the power of Christ in raising Lazarus."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The indignation was again excited either by the malicious comment just made by some of the Jews, or by the renewed recollection of the power of evil in the world."
2. "Like Jewish tombs in general, this was a natural cave or, more probably, a vault artificially excavated in the limestone rock."
3. "This verse again furnishes an indication that the family was not poor."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The speculation concerning his power stirred the depths of his nature again." 
2. "Cometh to the tomb (ερχετα εις το μνημειον). Vivid historical present." 
3. "Either the body was let down through a horizontal opening (hardly so here) or put in a tomb cut in the face of the rock (if so, επ can mean 'against')."

### John Gill:
1. "Jesus therefore groaning in himself,.... Not only through grief, just coming up to the grave, where his dear friend lay, but through an holy anger and indignation at the malice and wickedness of the Jews."
2. "It would be better rendered here, and 'a stone was laid to it'; not 'upon it', for it had no opening above, but to it, at the side of it."
3. "The sepulchre of Lazarus is pretended to be shown to travelers to this day, over which is built a chapel of marble, very decent, and comely, and stands close by a church built in honor of Martha and Mary, the two sisters of Lazarus, in the place where their house stood."

### John Wesley:
1. "Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob... were buried in the cave of Machpelah."
