# John 11:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Martha, the sister of the deceased, expressed her concerns to Jesus, saying, Lord, by this time he stinketh. Her words demonstrate the struggle between reason and faith. While she acknowledged the reality of death and the decomposition of the body, she failed to fully grasp the power and authority of Jesus. This tension highlights the constant battle between our worldly understanding and the truth of God's miraculous work.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The corpse had not been embalmed, but merely 'wrapped in linen clothes with spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury'"
2. "The very act of death is the beginning of decomposition."
3. "I have no hesitation, with almost all the ancient, and many of the best modern Commentators, in assuming ἤδη ὄζει as a fact."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is wrong to suppose from this (as LAMPE and others do) that, like the by-standers, she had not thought of his restoration to life."
2. "But the glimmerings of hope which she cherished from the first, and which had been brightened by what Jesus said to her, had suffered a momentary eclipse on the proposal to expose the now sightless corpse."
3. "To such fluctuations all real faith is subject in dark hours."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "All these circumstances are mentioned to show that there was no imposture."
3. "Every part of this narrative bears the marks of truth."

### John Calvin:
1. "Lord, he already stinketh. This is an indication of distrust, for she promises herself less from the power of Christ than she ought to have done."
2. "Thus, when our minds are preoccupied by foolish thoughts, we banish God from us, if we may be allowed the expression, so that he cannot accomplish in us his own work."
3. "That the grace of God may have access to us, let us learn to ascribe to it far greater power than our senses can comprehend; and, if the first and single promise of God has not sufficient weight with us, let us, at least, follow the example of Martha by giving our acquiescence, when he confirms us a second and third time."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "No expectation of some great blessing which God will give in answer to the prayer of Jesus is now in Martha’s mind."
2. "Nothing could more vividly illustrate the power which at this moment death wielded alike over the body of the departed and his sister’s spirit."
3. "How differently does the Evangelist himself feel! It is instructive to observe that in the words ‘him that was dead’ he changes the term for death, using not that of John 11:26, but another which expresses simply coming to the end of life."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Take ye away the stone." It was a startling command to them.
2. "By this time he stinketh." It means to give out an odor, either good or bad.
3. "For he is a fourth-day man." The Greek simply says, "For he is a fourth-day man."

### John Gill:
1. "he chose to have it removed this way, that the corpse might be seen, and even smelt; and that it might be manifest, there was no fallacy, nor any intrigue between him, and the sisters of the deceased in this matter"
2. "Martha the sister of him that was dead...saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh; or smells...she concluded it from the time he had been dead, and had lain in the grave"

### John Wesley:
1. Lord, by this time he stinketh — Thus did reason and faith struggle together.
