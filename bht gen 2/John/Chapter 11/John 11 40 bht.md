Jesus reminds her of His promise to raise Lazarus and encourages her to have faith in order to witness the glorious work of God and see His power and goodness displayed. In believing, Martha would not only see the glory of God, but also see Christ, who is the brightness of His Father's glory. The resurrection of Lazarus serves as a manifestation of Christ's divinity and the power of God, ultimately revealing Jesus as the Son of God.
