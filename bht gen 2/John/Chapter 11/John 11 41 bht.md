1. "Jesus lifted up his eyes—an expression marking His calm solemnity."

3. "He prayed not for what He wanted, but for the manifestation of what He had; and having the bright consciousness of the answer in the felt liberty to ask it, and the assurance that it was at hand, He gives thanks for this with a grand simplicity before performing the act."

### Albert Barnes:
