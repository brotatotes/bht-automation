# John 11:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, with a loud voice, commanded Lazarus to come forth from the tomb. This cry was not for the sake of Lazarus, but for the benefit of those standing nearby so they could witness the astounding power of Jesus. As Jesus called Lazarus by name, he demonstrated his authority and distinction from any other corpse. Lazarus, hearing and obeying this summons, emerged from the tomb alive, as if he had been awake the entire time. Through this miraculous act, Jesus displayed his divinity, showing that he possessed both the omniscience and omnipotence necessary to bring life to the dead.
