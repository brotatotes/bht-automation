# John 11:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
And as he emerged from the tomb, it was clear that he had been brought to life, for he was still bound by the grave clothes that had encased his body. These cloths had been carefully wound around each hand and foot, and his face had been covered with a napkin. But Jesus, showing his divine power, commanded those around him to set Lazarus free from his bindings and allow him to go back to his own home. It is amazing to see how this miracle, which displayed the resurrection power of Jesus, led many to believe in him.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "It is interesting to compare this Gospel picture of sisterly affection under the shadow of death, with the same sentiment as exhibited in Greek tragedy, especially in Sophocles, by whom it is developed with wonderful power."
2. "In the household of Bethany, the grief of the two sisters, unlike that of the Greek maidens, is unmixed with any other sentiment, save perhaps a tinge of a feeling bordering on reproach that Jesus had not been there to avert their calamity."
3. "The imagination alone follows the sisters with their brother, perchance with Christ, behind the closed door, and hears the sacred interchanges of that wonderful communing."
