# John 11:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The great works of God often evoke contrasting responses among people. Some are drawn to the faith, recognizing Jesus as the true Messiah. Others may admire and revere Him, but fall short of true faith. The miracles of Jesus serve a twofold purpose - to produce faith in those who witness them and to further glorify the Son of God. The impact of these miracles cannot be understated, as eyewitnesses become believers and the fame of Jesus spreads. The miracles of Jesus leave a lasting impression and lead many to encounter Him in a real and transformative way.
