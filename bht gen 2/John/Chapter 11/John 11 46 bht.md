# John 11:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Even though this miracle was intended to be a sign of Jesus' divine power, there were some who, instead of being convinced and believing in Him, became even more hardened in their hearts. This serves as a reminder that not everyone will be persuaded by signs and wonders, as their disposition and attitude towards God plays a significant role in their faith. As Jesus Himself said, If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "All these ἐπίστευσαν εἰς αὐτόν (see a similar case in ch. John 8:30 ff.)."
2. "The  δέ (see on Joh 11:37 ) certainly shews that this was done with a hostile intent: not in  doubt as to the miracle, any more than in the case of the blind man, ch. 9, but with a view to stir up the rulers yet more against Him."
3. "This Evangelist is very simple, and at the same time very consistent, in his use of  particles: almost throughout his Gospel the great subject, the manifestation of the Glory of Christ, is carried onward by  οὖν  , whereas  δέ as generally prefaces the development of the antagonist manifestation of hatred and rejection of Him."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We see here the different effect which the word and works of God will have on different individuals."
2. "Some are converted and others are hardened; yet the evidence of this miracle was as clear to the one as the other."
3. "But they would not be convinced."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "Thus you will see in the present day many enemies of the Gospel, like fanatics, fighting with the open and visible hand of God."
3. "They were indeed a part of the priests, but are specially named by the Evangelist, because they served the purpose of bellows to kindle the rage of the whole council."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The analogy of many passages in which John similarly records diverging opinions makes it plain that the giving of this information to the Pharisees was an act of hostility to Jesus."
2. "If so, the word 'them' at the beginning of the verse must refer to 'the Jews' in general, not to those who are described in the preceding verse."
3. "At this period of our Lord's history the Pharisees have as a body declared against Him; to this large and powerful sect, therefore, the news of the event is brought."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Went away to the Pharisees" (απηλθον προς τους Φαρισαιους).

### John Gill:

2. "Thus even miracles, as well as the doctrines of the Gospel, are to some the savour of death unto death, whilst to others the savour of life unto life."
