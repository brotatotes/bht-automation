# John 11:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
What do we? Why are we so dilatory in our response to the undeniable miracles that this man is performing? Instead of embracing him as the Messiah, we use his miracles as a reason to hinder and put a stop to the belief in him. However, it is important to remember that death yields to the power of Christ sooner than infidelity ever could.
