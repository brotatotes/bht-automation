# John 11:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus is left alone, all men will believe in him and receive him as the Messiah, proclaiming him as their king and obeying his commands. The Romans, interpreting this as an act of rebellion against Caesar, will come with their powerful armies. As a result, they will destroy the temple, the place of Jewish religion and worship, and lay waste to the city and country, stripping the Jewish people of their civil and religious privileges. The Jews should have recognized that Jesus, who had the power to raise the dead, was more than capable of conquering the Romans.
