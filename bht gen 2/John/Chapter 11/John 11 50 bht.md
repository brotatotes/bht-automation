# John 11:50 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Caiaphas, in declaring that it is expedient for one man to die for the people, had no idea that he was speaking under the influence of the Holy Spirit. His words carried a deeper meaning, for God was working through him to reveal a prophetic truth. Caiaphas unknowingly gave testimony to Jesus' sacrificial role as the High Priest, just as Pilate unintentionally affirmed His kingship. It is remarkable how even those who opposed Jesus played a part in fulfilling God's plan.

2. "That one man should die - Jesus they regarded as promoting sedition... If he was put to death they supposed the people would be safe."
3. "In the sense in which he intended it there was no truth in the observation, nor occasion for it, but in the sense which the words might convey there was real and most important truth.

### John Gill:
1. "Priests, Levites, Pharisees, the sanhedrim, and ecclesiastical rulers of the people; who, as Caiaphas apprehended, must suffer in their characters and revenues, must quit their honourable and gainful posts and places, if Jesus went on and succeeded at this rate..."
2. "He proceeded entirely upon this political principle, that a public good ought to be preferred to a private one; that it was no matter what the man was, whether innocent or not..."
3. "Common prudence, and the public safety of the nation, required him to fall a sacrifice, rather than the Romans should be exasperated and provoked to such a degree, as to threaten the utter ruin and destruction of the whole nation."

### John Wesley:
1. "It is expedient that one man should die for the people" - So God overruled his tongue, for he spake not of himself, by his own spirit only, but by the spirit of prophecy.
2. "And thus he gave unawares as clear a testimony to the priestly, as Pilate did to the kingly office of Christ."
