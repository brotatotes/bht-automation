# John 11:51 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The high priest, guided by divine influence, inadvertently conveyed a significant truth - that to prevent the nation's destruction, they must make a sacrifice of the one causing disturbance. Although Caiaphas likely didn't comprehend the full meaning of his words, John records this as remarkable since it bears truth about Jesus' death. The words of the high priest, functioning as God's oracle, hold deep significance as a prophetic utterance. It is through the communion of saints, gathered by Christ, that individuals are prepared for eternal life, and all who are not gathered remain in death.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He meant nothing more than that the way to prevent the apprehended ruin of the nation was to make a sacrifice of the Disturber of their peace." 
2. "But in giving utterance to this suggestion of political expediency, he was so guided as to give forth a divine prediction of deep significance."
3. "God so ordered it that it should come from the lips of the high priest for that memorable year, the recognized head of God's visible people, whose ancient office, symbolized by the Urim and Thummim, was to decide in the last resort, all vital questions as the oracle of the divine will."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Remark:Being high priest that year - It is not to be supposed that Caiaphas was a true prophet, or was conscious of the meaning which John has affixed to his words; but his words express the truth about the atonement of Jesus, and John records it as a remarkable circumstance that the high priest of the nation should unwittingly deliver a sentiment which turned out to be the truth about the death of Jesus."
2. "He prophesied - He uttered words which proved to be prophetic; or he expressed at that time a sentiment which turned out to be true."
3. "That Jesus should die - Die in the place of men, or as an atonement for sinners. This is evidently the meaning which John attaches to the words."

### John Calvin:
1. "God intended that the heavenly oracle should proceed from the high priest’s seat, that the Jews might have less excuse."
2. "Nor did the wickedness of Caiaphas prevent his tongue from being the organ of the Holy Spirit, for God looked at the priesthood which he had instituted rather than at the person of the man."
3. "The communion of saints is a preparation for eternal life, because all whom Christ does not gather to the Father remain in death."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Not wholly of himself, John means. There was more in what Caiaphas said than he understood."
2. "His language is repeated in John 18:14."
3. "But certainly unconscious prophecy on his part and purely accidental."

### John Gill:
1. "Not of his own devising and dictating, but by the Spirit of God." 
2. "Being high priest that year; by his office he was the oracle of God." 
3. "Jesus should die for that nation; these words, with what follows in the next verse, are the words of the evangelist, interpreting the prophecy of Caiaphas, according to the sense of the Holy Ghost."
