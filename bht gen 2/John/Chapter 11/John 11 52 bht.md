# John 11:52 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ died not only for a specific nation, but for all people, both Jews and Gentiles. The purpose of his death was to bring together all the chosen ones of God, who were scattered throughout different nations. He desired to unite them into one body, which is the Church. This gathering of the children of God includes not only those who were believers at the time, but also those who would come to believe in him in future generations.
