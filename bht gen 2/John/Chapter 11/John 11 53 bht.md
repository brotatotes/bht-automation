# John 11:53 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The decision to put Him to death had been secretly desired, and Caiaphas's reasoning was so convincing that it was generally accepted, aside from a few dissenters. They plotted to slay Him, not only discussing the act, but also considering the best time and method. They resolved to kill Him even before any charges were made or any legal process had taken place. Their goal was to execute Him in a way that would bring them credit and shame Him, while ensuring the support of the people.
