# John 11:54 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, aware of the Sanhedrin's plan to kill him and their efforts to capture him, made the decision to withdraw from the public eye. He refrained from teaching and performing miracles publicly, avoiding any unnecessary risk to his life. Instead, he chose to spend time in secluded places, engaging in private conversations with his disciples, imparting to them teachings about the kingdom of God. This retreat allowed Jesus to shield himself from the escalating danger posed by his enemies, while continuing to guide and instruct his close followers.
