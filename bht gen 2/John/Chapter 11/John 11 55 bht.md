# John 11:55 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jews' passover was approaching, and many went up to Jerusalem to purify themselves. This purification was necessary for them to participate in the Passover feast and ensure that they were not hindered by any legal uncleanness. It was a voluntary act undertaken by those from the country who gathered in Jerusalem beforehand to seek the required preparation.
