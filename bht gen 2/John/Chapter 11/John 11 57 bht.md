# John 11:57 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The chief priests and Pharisees, who were part of the Jewish council, had given a strict commandment. They ordered that if anyone knew the whereabouts of Jesus, they were to reveal it, so that Jesus could be captured by them. This caused uncertainty among some people about whether Jesus would indeed come to the feast. Meanwhile, there were others who actively sought Jesus and inquired about him, with the intention of exposing his location to the chief priests and Pharisees. They were hoping to receive the promised reward for this information.
