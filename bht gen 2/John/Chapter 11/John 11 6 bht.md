# John 11:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Though Christ had heard that Lazarus was sick, and received a message from his sisters, he did not immediately go to assist him. Instead, he stayed in the same place for two days. This delay served to test the faith and patience of Lazarus' sisters, and to make the miracle of his resurrection even more evident. Through this, Jesus displayed both his divine glory and his deep love for his friends.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Having then said this, although He loved, He abode."
2. "In all probability Lazarus was dead when He spoke the words."
3. "Or at all events before the messenger returned."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But how trying, meantime, to the faith of his friends, and how unlike the way in which love to a dying friend usually shows itself, on which it is plain that Mary reckoned."
2. "Often they are the reverse. When His people are sick, in body or spirit; when their case is waxing more and more desperate every day; when all hope of recovery is about to expire—just then and there it is that 'He abides two days still in the same place where He is.'"
3. "For it is His chosen style of acting. We have been well taught it, and should not now have the lesson to learn."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He abode two days - Probably Lazarus died soon after the messengers left him [...] so that when he came there he had been dead four days." 
2. "This shows, moreover, that he intended to raise him up. If he had not, it could hardly be reconciled with friendship thus to remain, without any reason, away from an afflicted family."
3. "Where he was - At Bethabara John 1:28; John 10:40, about 30 miles from Bethany. This was about a day’s journey, and it renders it probable that Lazarus died soon after the message was sent. One day would be occupied before the message came to him; two days he remained; one day would be occupied by him in going to Bethany; so that Lazarus had been dead four days when he arrived."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He cannot accept the moment suggested by man...He will go to assuage their grief, but only at the moment appointed by the Father's will."
2. "'Therefore' is explained by the two verses which precede...He cannot follow at once the prompting of His affection for disciples."
3. "He abode in the place where he was two days...He will go to assuage their grief, but only at the moment appointed by the Father's will."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In the place where he was (εν ω ην τοπω). Incorporation of the antecedent τοπω into the relative clause, 'in which place he was.'"
2. "Two days (δυο ημερας). Accusative of extent of time."
3. "It was long enough for Lazarus to die and seemed unlike Jesus to the sisters."

### John Gill:
1. "Though Christ had heard that Lazarus was sick, and by such good hands, a message being sent him by his sisters, to acquaint him with it..."
2. "...he did not go directly to him, and to his assistance: but he abode two days still in the same place where he was; at Bethabara, beyond Jordan..."
3. "...this he did to try the faith and patience of the sisters of Lazarus, and that the miracle of raising him from the dead might be the more manifest, and his own glory might be the more illustrious, and yet equal, if not greater tenderness and love be shown to his friends."
