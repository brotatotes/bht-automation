# John 11:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After receiving the message, our Lord did not immediately go, but instead chose to wait for the glory of God to be revealed in a miraculous way. The disciples, thinking He had forgotten about Lazarus, were concerned about the pressing matters of His ministry. However, Jesus cared deeply about Lazarus and His plan was to bring glory to God. He instructed His disciples to go back to Judea, showing His willingness to face His enemies and the growing hatred that would eventually lead to His death.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The question, why our Lord did not go at once on receiving the message, is not to be answered by any secondary reasons, such as the trial of the faith of those concerned, or the pressing nature of His own ministry in Peræa, but by referring back to John 11:4 because, for the glory of God, He would have the miracle happen as it did and no otherwise."
 
2. "If the οὖν in Joh 11:6 referred to this verse, the connexion must have been made by καὶ μετὰ τ .: the ἔπειτα cuts off all connexion (Gal 1:18), and throws back the οὖν as explained above."

### Philip Schaff:
