# John 11:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples, addressing their Master with great concern, expressed their anxiety about his safety, for not long ago the Jews were seeking to harm him. They questioned his decision to return to the place where he had faced dangers before, fearing that it would lead to certain death. It seemed to them like suicidal madness to go back, as it would expose him to numerous enemies and put him in great danger, with little hope of accomplishing much good. They reminded him that here, among his friends and in safety, he was very useful.
