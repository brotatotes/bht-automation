# John 11:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our time on earth is compared to a day consisting of twelve hours, and just as walking in the day prevents stumbling, so does walking in the light of Christ. By embracing His teachings and following His path, we can navigate our lives with clarity and purpose, avoiding the pitfalls that darkness brings. The invitation to walk in the day is an invitation to walk in the truth and live out our calling, knowing that with His guiding light, we can confidently overcome any challenges that may arise.
