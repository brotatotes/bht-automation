# John 12:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus arrived in Bethany, a place of danger after the miracle he performed on Lazarus and the rage it caused among the Sanhedrin. This was six days before the Passover, which also happened to be the Jewish Sabbath. On the evening of the Sabbath, a supper was made for Jesus, which was a plentiful one according to Jewish tradition. This timing coincided with the separation of the high priest from his own house that occurred seven days before the Day of Atonement.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is an expression frequent in later Greek; so μετὰ τριάκοντα ἡμ . τῶν γάμων , Dio lix. 20; μετὰ δέκα ἔτη τοῦ οἰκῆσαι Ἀβραὰμ ἐν γῇ Χαναάν , Philo de Congressu, 14, vol. i. p. 529."
2. "Thus the arrival, and anointing, at Bethany, will be on the eighth of Nisan, if the passover was on the fourteenth."
3. "That day was a Sabbath; but this makes no difficulty, as we know not from what point our Lord came, or whether He arrived at the commencement of the Sabbath, i.e. sunset, or a little after, on Friday evening, from Jericho."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "six days before the passover—that is, on the sixth day before it"
2. "probably after sunset on Friday evening, or the commencement of the Jewish sabbath preceding the passover."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jesus came to Bethany...from this place that he made his triumphant entry into the city." 
2. "This was near to Jerusalem." 
3. "See the notes at Matthew 21:1."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Which had been dead. (Omit.) He raised. For He, read Jesus.

### John Calvin:
1. "Jesus came first to Bethany, that thence he might go three days afterwards to Jerusalem. Meanwhile, he intended to give Judas a fit time and place for betraying him, that he might present himself, ready to be sacrificed, at the appointed time; for he is not ignorant of what is to take place, but willingly comes forward to be sacrificed."
2. "The two Evangelists, before relating that Christ was anointed, speak of two days as having elapsed. But the solution is easy, and may be given in two ways. For John does not say that Christ was anointed on the first day after his arrival; so that this might happen even when he was preparing to depart."
3. "There is thus a perfect agreement in the account of his having been anointed at Bethany."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word therefore marks a close connection with the preceding chapter...The 56th and 57th verses of chap. 11, describing how the thought of both friends and foes was intently fixed on Jesus and His possible presence at the festival, form a very natural introduction to the narrative of this chapter." 
2. "Starting then from the 14th of Nisan, the ‘six days’ will most probably bring us to the 8th; and if, as is generally believed, the 15th of Nisan fell on Friday in this year, the 8th will coincide with the same day in the preceding week."
3. "This day, as we learn from Josephus, was often chosen by the bands of pilgrims for their arrival in Jerusalem: those referred to in John 11:55 had come earlier than others to the holy city for a special reason."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Here ουν is not causal, but simply copulative and transitional, 'and so' (Bernard), as often in John (John 1:22, etc.)."
2. "If the crucifixion was on Friday, as seems certain from both John and the Synoptics, then six days before would be the Jewish Sabbath preceding or more probably the Friday afternoon before, since Jesus would most likely arrive before the Sabbath."
3. "There is no reason for thinking this a gloss as Bernard does. It was a place of danger now after that great miracle and the consequent rage of the Sanhedrin (John 12:9-11). The crowd of eager spectators to see both Lazarus and Jesus would only intensify this rage."

### John Gill:
1. "If there were six complete days between this and the passover, as this way of speaking seems to imply; then this must be the day before the Jewish sabbath."
2. "But if this was the sixth day before it, it was their sabbath day, and so at the going out of it in the evening, a supper was made for him, which with the Jews on that night, was a plentiful one."
3. "Particularly it may be observed, that seven days before the day of atonement, the high priest was separated from his own house, and had to the chamber Palhedrin."
