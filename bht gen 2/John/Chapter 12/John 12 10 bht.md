# John 12:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The chief priests, driven by their disbelief and envy, not only plotted to put Jesus to death but also sought to kill Lazarus, who had been raised from the dead by Him. This malicious intent demonstrated the wickedness of their hearts and their determination to eliminate any evidence of God's power. It is no wonder that the other gospel writers did not include the story of Lazarus, as it became clear that the chief priests' agenda was not merely to silence Jesus, but to eradicate any trace of His miracles.
