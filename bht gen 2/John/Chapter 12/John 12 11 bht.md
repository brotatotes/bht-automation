# John 12:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Many of the Jews went away, not just from Jerusalem but also from the chief priests, Pharisees, and the rest who had been against Christ; they withdrew themselves and deserted their party. They believed in Jesus as the Messiah, causing their interest to decrease and weaken while those on Christ's side increased. This decrease in support was unbearable for them, so they even planned to take the life of Lazarus, fearing that as long as he lived, he would continue to convince people to believe in Jesus.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ὑπῆγον, went away (to Bethany); there is something in the ὑπ- which almost always implies away, out from under, the persons or the place in the narrative."
2. "And so here, the ἀρχιερεῖς being the main subject of the sentence, the word gets the sense of 'fell away:’ scil. from under their hand or power."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Went away [υπηγον] . Withdrew from their company. 12 - 19. Compare Matthew 21:1-11; Mark 11:1-11; Luke 19:29-44.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Because of him" (δι' αυτον). "Because of him," regular idiom, accusative case with δια.
2. "Began to withdraw" (υπηγον). "Began to withdraw" as happened at the time of the raising of Lazarus (John 11:45) and the secession was still going on.
3. "Believed on Jesus" (κα επιστευον εις τον Ιησουν). There was danger of a mass movement of the people to Jesus.

### John Gill:
1. "many of the Jews went away; not from Jerusalem only, but from the chief priests and Pharisees, and the rest of the Jews, that combined against Christ; they withdrew themselves from their party, and deserted them." 
2. "and believed on Jesus; as the Messiah; so that they found their interest was decreasing and weakening every day, and that those on the side of Christ were increasing; and this they could not bear"
3. "and therefore consulted to take away the life of Lazarus, as well as Jesus; who they imagined, as long as he lived, would be a means of inducing persons to believe in Jesus as the Messiah"
