# John 12:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As the people greeted Jesus with palm branches in their hands, it symbolized a triumphant homage to Him as the victor or king. This act of carrying palms, along with the shouts of Hosannah meaning Save now, represented the recognition of Jesus as the Coming One, the Messiah. The use of palm branches was significant as it signified joy, victory, and the fulfillment of ancient promises. This imagery of palms and shouts of praise was not only a declaration of their acknowledgment of Jesus but also a fulfillment of the ancient Psalms and a testament to His overcoming power.
