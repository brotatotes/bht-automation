# John 12:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus sent his disciples to find a young ass [οναριον] in a neighbouring village, which fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah. There is a slight discrepancy in the accounts, with Matthew mentioning an ass and a colt, while Mark and Luke mention only a colt. However, this can be easily resolved, as the disciples would have brought both animals for Jesus to ride upon. Thus, through the disciples, Jesus fulfilled the prophecy and demonstrated his power and authority as the Messiah.
