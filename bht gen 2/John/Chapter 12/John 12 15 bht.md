# John 12:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Fear not, for the prophecy of Zechariah 9:9 reveals that Jesus, the Prince of Peace, would come in peace, riding on a donkey. This imagery of riding on an ass symbolizes peace, as the ass was an animal ridden during peaceful times. Moreover, this message of fear not is particularly relevant to the readers of John's Gospel, who lived during a time when Jerusalem had fallen and faced great turmoil. Just as Jesus lamented over Jerusalem, he offers comfort and reassurance to the people, urging them to let go of fear and rejoice.
