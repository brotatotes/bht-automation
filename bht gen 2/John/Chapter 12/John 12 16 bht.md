# John 12:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples initially did not grasp the significance of the events unfolding before them, but later on, with the help of the Holy Spirit, they came to understand the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies in Jesus. Through this realization, they recalled that these prophetic words were indeed written about Him and that these events were part of God's divine plan. This reminds us to trust in God's providence, even when we do not immediately comprehend His ways, and to have faith in the unfolding of His purposes.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Important, as shewing that this, and probably other prophetic citations under similar circumstances, were the effect of the light poured into the minds of the Apostles by the Holy Spirit after the Ascension."
2. "ἐπ ʼ αὐτῷ] So Æsch. Eum. 343, γιγνομέναισι λάχη τάδ ʼ ἐφ ʼ ἁμῖν ἐκράνθη : Soph. Trach. 997, οἵαν ἐπί μοι χάριν ἠνύσω ; Plato, Euthyd. 278 A, ὄνομα ἐπ ʼ ἀνθρώποις ἐναντίως ἔχουσι κείμενον."
3. "ταῦτα ἐποίησαν αὐτῷ viz. the going out to meet Him, strewing clothes and branches in the way, and shouting ‘Hosanna’ before Him: also perhaps, the setting Him on the ass, implied in the concise narrative. Notice the thrice-repeated ταῦτα , each time signifying ‘ this which was written by the Prophet ,’ ‘ the above citation .’"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

3. "[The Spirit] showed them that they, and all the actors in these scenes, had been unconsciously fulfilling those predictions."

### John Calvin:
1. "As the seed does not spring up as soon as it is thrown into the earth, so the result of the works of God is not immediately seen."
2. "It was because they had not the Scripture at that time as their guide and instructor, to direct their minds to just and accurate views; for we are blind, unless the word of God go before our steps."
3. "Taught by this example, let us learn to form our judgment of everything that relates to Christ, not by our own carnal feelings, but by the Scripture."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They were not seen in their true light as a magnifying, as a prefigurative glorifying, of a suffering Messiah, were not seen to contain within them the great mystery of exaltation through and in the midst of suffering."
2. "The ignorance of the disciples was corrected by experience. What they did not understand now, they understood when the resurrection and ascension had taken place."
3. "The light of that glorification shed light alike upon the sufferings and the partial glorifications of Jesus that had gone before."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Another comment by John concerning the failure of the disciples to know what was happening."
2. "It was easier to understand then and they had the Holy Spirit to help them."
3. "The use of επ' αυτω for 'of him' rather than περ αυτου is unusual, but occurs in Revelation 10:11; Revelation 22:16."

3. "When he had been glorified — At his ascension."
