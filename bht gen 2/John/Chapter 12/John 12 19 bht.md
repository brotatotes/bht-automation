# John 12:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The predicament of the Pharisees is depicted as they stand off and observe the enthusiastic crowds passing by, their clever schemes and cunning plans proving futile. They do not suggest that every person in the world became followers of Jesus or his disciples, but rather depict the sense of those phrases the world and the whole world when applied to the redemption through Jesus Christ. These commentaries shed light on the exaggerated claims of the Pharisees and highlight the limitations of their strategies in the face of the growing movement following Jesus.
