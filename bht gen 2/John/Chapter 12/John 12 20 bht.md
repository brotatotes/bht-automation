# John 12:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These Greeks who came to worship at the feast were not Jewish Greeks, but Gentiles. They may have been either devout and religious Gentiles, or proselytes of the gate who had embraced the Jewish faith. They joined the crowds who had come from the countryside to attend the feast and worship the God of Israel. Their presence served as a foreshadowing of the future Gentile Church, as they were among the first to show interest in Jesus and his message.
