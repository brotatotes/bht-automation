# John 12:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Many believe that the Greeks who came to see Jesus were familiar with his works and teachings, and therefore desired a personal encounter with him. It is likely that they approached Philip because they had heard of his connections with Hellenistic Jews in the area. Their request to see Jesus shows their reverence and desire for instruction, as well as their faith in seeking a spiritual sight of Christ and communion with him. Their polite and modest request demonstrates their humility and longing to personally witness the glory and grace of Jesus.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For what reason Philip was selected, it is impossible to say."
2. "The Greek form of his name may imply some connection with Hellenistic Jews, who may have been friends or relatives of these Greeks."
3. "If they were from the neighborhood of Bethsaida, they would indeed have been familiar with the person of Jesus: but what they here requested was evidently a private interview."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is probable that the word 'see,' here, implies also a desire to converse with him, or to hear his doctrine about the nature of his kingdom."
2. "They had seen or heard of his triumphal entry into Jerusalem, and, either by curiosity or a desire to be instructed, they came and interceded with his disciples that they might be permitted to see him."
3. "If we wish to find the Saviour, we must seek for him and take the proper means."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is an indication of reverence, that they do not address Christ, but are desirous to obtain access through Philip; for reverence always begets modesty."
2. "The inference which the Papists draw from this, that we ought to call on departed saints, that they may be our advocates with Christ and with the Father, is so ridiculous that it does not need refutation."
3. "Invocation of the saints has been rashly fabricated by the Papists out of their own brain; and now, in order to shelter themselves under a false pretense borrowed from the word of God, they corrupt the Scripture, and tear it to pieces, and do not scruple to expose it to shameful taunts."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "Asked. Imperfect active, probably inchoative, 'began to ask,' in contrast with the aorist tense just before, came to."
3. "Sir. Most respectfully and courteously. We would see Jesus. 'We desire to see Jesus.' This is not abrupt like our 'we wish' or 'we want,' but perfectly polite."

### John Gill:
1. "Since this was in Galilee, of which Herod Antipas was tetrarch, and where Philip could have no power to rebuild places, and change their names."
2. "And it may be observed, that sensible sinners are very desirous of having a spiritual sight of Christ, of the glories of his person, and the fulness of his grace, and to see their interest in him, and to have communion and fellowship with him."
