# John 12:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The hour is come, the predestined hour that Jesus spoke of from the beginning. It is the hour of His glorification, the manifestation of His power and victory through His death. The request of the Greeks signifies a significant turning point, as it shows that interest in Jesus extends beyond Jewish circles. However, Jesus acknowledges that He must first suffer before His ultimate glory is revealed.
