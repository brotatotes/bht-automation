# John 12:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Unless a grain of wheat dies, Jesus emphasizes the necessity of his own death by using the familiar example of a seed being sown into the ground. Just as a seed must die in order to bring forth new life and bear fruit, so Jesus knows that his death is required for the salvation of humanity. In using this analogy, Jesus shows his deep understanding of the natural world and purposefully chooses an example that would resonate with his audience. This unique nature of the wheat grain's death makes it a powerful symbol for the sacrificial death of Jesus.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The grain of wheat perishes, and is not apparent (as the seeds of dicotyledonous plants are) in the new plant: see 1 Corinthians 15:36."
2. "The divine Will, which has fixed the law of the springing up of the wheat-corn, has also determined the law of the glorification of the Son of Man, and the one in analogy with the other: i.e. both through Death."
3. "The symbolism here lies at the root of that in ch. 6, where Christ is ὁ ἄρτος τῆς ζωῆς."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit—The necessity of His death is here brightly expressed, and its proper operation and fruit—life springing forth out of death—imaged forth by a beautiful and deeply significant law of the vegetable kingdom."
2. "For a double reason, no doubt, this was uttered—to explain what he had said of His death, as the hour of His own glorification, and to sustain His own Spirit under the agitation which was mysteriously coming over it in the view of that death."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If it had not died it would never have germinated or produced the glory of the yellow harvest."
2. "In this, God has shown his wisdom and goodness."
3. "Jesus intimates that it was only by his death that he would be glorified in the salvation of men."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Jesus is citing the wheat - grain as a familiar type of that which contains in itself the germ of life."
2. "The selection of the corn of wheat as an illustration acquires a peculiar interest from the fact of its being addressed to Greeks, familiar with the Eleusinian mysteries celebrated in their own country."
3. "These features of the mysteries set forth, and with the same symbol as that employed by Christ here, the crude pagan conception of life rising out of death."

### John Calvin:
1. "Unless a grain of wheat having fallen into the ground, die, it remaineth alone. If a grain of wheat do not die or putrefy, it continues to be dry and unfruitful; but the death of the seed has the beneficial effect of quickening it, that it may yield fruit."
2. "That dreadful appearance of disgrace and cursing, which appears in the death of Christ, not only obscures his glory, but removes it altogether from our view... We must not, therefore, confine our attention to his death alone, but must likewise consider the fruit which has been yielded by his glorious resurrection."
3. "When, therefore, the godly are distressed by various afflictions, when they are pressed hard by the difficulties of their situation... let them unceasingly consider that this is a sowing which, in due time, will yield fruit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There is a general principle lying at the root of the glorification of the 'Son of man,' This is now to be explained and illustrated."
2. "Absolute death, destruction of the principle of life, is not implied. The seed does not actually die: its old covering dies that the germ of life within may spring up in higher forms of beauty, and with many grains instead of one."
3. "Such is the law of nature, and to this great law Jesus as 'Son of man' must conform: He does not simply lay down a rule for others; as representative of our humanity the rule must first find its application in Himself."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus shows here the paradox that life comes through death."
2. "Jesus had already spoken of himself as the bread of life."
3. "Grains of wheat have been found in Egyptian tombs three or four thousand years old, but they are now dead. They bore no fruit."

### John Gill:
1. "except a corn of wheat fall into the ground; or is sown in the earth; for sowing with the Jews is expressed by the falling of the seed into the earth; and is a very fit phrase to set forth the death of Christ by, who fell a sacrifice to justice by the hands of men."
2. "and a corn of wheat is almost the only seed, that being cast into the earth, does die; and therefore is very aptly used by Christ"
3. "Christ must have been without them in heaven; wherefore he chose rather to die for them, that they might be for ever with him, than be alone in the human nature."

### John Wesley:
1. "Unless a grain of wheat die"
2. "The late resurrection of Lazarus gave our Lord a natural occasion of speaking on this subject."
3. "And agreeable to his infinite knowledge, he singles out, from among so many thousands of seeds, almost the only one that dies in the earth: and which therefore was an exceeding proper similitude, peculiarly adapted to the purpose for which he uses it."
4. "The like is not to be found in any other grain, except millet, and the large bean."
