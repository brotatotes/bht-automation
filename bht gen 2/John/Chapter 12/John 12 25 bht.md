# John 12:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who prioritize their own desires and cling to the temporal joys and comforts of this life will ultimately lose their souls for eternity. On the other hand, those who are willing to surrender their own desires, detaching themselves from the pleasures of this world, for the sake of following God's will, will find true life and preservation for all eternity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And this same divine Law prevails for the disciples, as well as for their Master."
2. "ψυχή is not really in a double sense: as the wheat-corn retains its identity, though it die, so the ψυχή: so that the two senses are, in their depth, but one."
3. "ψυχή is the life in both cases; not the soul, in the present acceptation of that term."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal." 
2. "Did our Lord mean to exclude Himself from the operation of the great principle here expressed—self-renunciation, the law of self-preservation; and its converse, self-preservation, the law of self-destruction?"
3. "On the contrary, as He became Man to exemplify this fundamental law of the Kingdom of God in its most sublime form, so the very utterance of it on this occasion served to sustain His own Spirit in the double prospect to which He had just alluded."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He that loveth his life ... - This was a favorite principle, a sort of “axiom” with the Lord Jesus, which he applied to himself as well as to his followers."
2. "See the Matthew 10:39 note; Luke 9:24 note."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Life [ψυχην]. See on Mark 12:30; Luke 1:46."
2. "Shall lose [απολεσει]. The best texts read ajpolluei, loseth. See on Luke 9:25."
3. "Shall keep [φυλαξει]. See on 1 Peter 1:4."

### John Calvin:
1. "He who, under the influence of immoderate desire of the present life, cannot leave the world but by constraint, is said to love life; but he who, despising life, advances courageously to death, is said to hate life."
2. "For the true limit of loving life, is, when we continue in it as long as it pleases God, and when we are prepared to leave it as soon as he shall order us, or — to express it in a single word — when we carry it, as it were, in our hands, and offer it to God as a sacrifice."
3. "They do not take the proper method of preserving their life who love it in this world, but, on the other hand, they truly know how to preserve their life who despise it in this world."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He that loveth his soul loseth it; and he that hateth his soul in this world shall keep it unto life eternal." 
2. "By simply living for himself and without thought of others, he ‘loses’ that very thing which he desires to preserve and make happy."
3. "He that in this world ‘hateth his soul,’ his soul not brought into subjection to that law of love which is the law of God, and, so hating, denies and crucifies it in order that love may gain the mastery in him, that man shall ‘keep’ it, shall keep it too unto the higher life which is not merely future, but which is even now filled with the Divine and deathless."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "he that hateth his life" (ο μισων την ψυχην αυτου) see the sharp contrasts in Luke John 14:26-35 where μισεω is used of father, mother, wife, children, brothers, sisters, as well as one's own life.
2. Clearly μισεω means "hate" when the issue is between Christ and the dearest things of life as happens when the choice is between martyrdom and apostasy.
3. In that case one keeps his soul for eternal life by losing his life (ψυχη, each time) here. That is the way to "guard" (φυλαξε) life by being true to Christ.

### John Gill:
1. "Whoever is so in love with this present temporal life, as to be anxiously careful of it, and takes all precautions to secure it...shall come short of an eternal one."
2. "Whoever seems careless about [life], and not to consult the safety of it, but is unconcerned about it...shall keep it unto life eternal."
3. "[Christ said this] to let his disciples and followers know, that they must suffer and die...and that their sufferings and death in his cause, and for his Gospel, would turn to their advantage."

### John Wesley:
1. "He that loveth his life — More than the will of God; shall lose it eternally: and he that hateth his life - In comparison of the will of God, shall preserve it."
