# John 12:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we see that Jesus' soul was troubled. This trouble stemmed from the hardness and unbelief of the Jews, as well as from the thoughts of his impending death, which was his Father's will. Jesus found himself in a moment where his soul was troubled, and he had various foretastes of his coming passion. In this hour of suffering, he pondered on the possibility of being saved from it, yet he recognized that his purpose for coming into the world was to endure this very hour.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And to express both these together in human speech was impossible: therefore τί εἴπω?"
2. "The prayer is a veritable prayer; and answers to the prophetic Messianic prayers in the Psalms, which thus run 'My soul is troubled; Lord, help me.'"
3. "'I came to this hour for this very purpose, that I might be saved from this hour: i.e. the going into, and exhausting this hour, this cup, is the very appointed way of my glorification.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Strange view of the Cross this, immediately after representing it as the hour of His glory!"
2. "In asking Himself, 'What shall I say?' He seems as if thinking aloud, feeling His way between two dread alternatives, looking both of them sternly in the face, measuring, weighing them."
3. "The sentiment conveyed, then, by the prayer, in both cases, is twofold: (1) that only one thing could reconcile Him to the death of the cross—its being His Father's will He should endure it—and (2) that in this view of it He yielded Himself freely to it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The mention of his death brought before him its approaching horrors, its pains, its darkness, its unparalleled woes."
2. "On the decision of that moment - the fixed and unwavering purpose of the Son of God depended man’s salvation. If Jesus had forsaken his purpose then, all would have been lost."
3. "That it might have been done, see Matthew 26:53. But for this cause - That is, to suffer and die. As this was the design of his coming as he did it deliberately - -as the salvation of the world depended on it, he felt that it would not be proper to pray to be delivered from it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The soul, yuch, is the seat of the human affections; the spirit [πνευμα] of the religious affections."
2. "His inward agitation did not arise from personal sorrow or sympathy, but from some shock to His moral and spiritual sense."
3. "The prayer, save me from this hour, is not for deliverance from suffering, but for victory in the approaching trial."

### John Calvin:
1. "If scornful men laugh at it, we need not wonder; for it cannot be understood but by practice. Besides, it was highly useful, and even necessary for our salvation, that the Son of God should have experience of such feelings."
2. "In him, no doubt, those feelings were voluntary; for he feared, not through constraint, but because he had, of his own accord, subjected himself to fear. And yet we ought to believe, that it was not in pretense, but in reality, that he feared."
3. "Christ himself was clothed, not only with our flesh, but with human feelings. There is also another advantage which it yields to us. If the dread of death had occasioned no uneasiness to the Son of God, which of us would have thought that his example was applicable to our case?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Because this is the moment of highest exaltation in the contemplation of the universal triumph symbolized in the coming of the Greeks, it is also that when all the intensity of suffering by which the triumph is procured is most present to the mind of Jesus."
2. "How shall I find utterance for the emotions that now fill my heart?"
3. "Such a prayer is as consistent with His knowledge of ‘the glory that should follow’ as is Matthew 26:39 with Matthew 16:21."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The soul here is synonymous with spirit in John 13:21."
2. "While John proves the deity of Jesus in his Gospel, he assumes throughout his real humanity."
3. "Here as in Gethsemane the soul of Jesus instinctively and naturally shrinks from the Cross, but he instantly surrenders to the will of God in both experiences."

### John Gill:
1. "Now is my soul troubled... at the hardness and unbelief of the Jews"
2. "he was in his human soul troubled at the thoughts of his death, though it was his Father's will"
3. "shall I say, father, save me from this hour? as requesting his Father, that he might be strengthened under his sufferings and death, and carried through them, and out of them; or rather as deprecating them, desiring the cup might pass from him"

### John Wesley:
1. "Now is my soul troubled — He had various foretastes of his passion."
2. "The two following clauses, Save me from this hour - For this cause I came - Into the world; for the sake of this hour (of suffering) seem to have glanced through his mind in one moment."
