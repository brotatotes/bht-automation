# John 12:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus prays, Father, glorify thy name, expressing his willingness to bear any trials and sufferings to manifest and promote the character, wisdom, goodness, and plans of mercy of God. The voice from heaven that responds to Jesus signifies the Father's present testimony and future scenes of deeper necessity, ministering grace to us in the prospect of suffering. Everything done by Christ aims to honor the name of God, and God never leaves His work imperfect, supporting Jesus in His sufferings and death and raising Him from the dead to glorify the name of the Father.
