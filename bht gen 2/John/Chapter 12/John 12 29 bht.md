# John 12:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of a divine revelation, there may be parts that are difficult for us to comprehend, prompting us to exercise our faith. The mention of thunder in relation to the voice from heaven could suggest that this was a common occurrence.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Some heard words, but did not apprehend their meaning."
2. "Others a sound, but no words."
3. "I should rather believe this difference to have been proportioned to each man’s inner relation to Christ, than fortuitous."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The people therefore that stood by, said, It thundered; others, An angel spake to him—some hearing only a sound, others an articulate, but to them unintelligible voice." 


### Albert Barnes:
1. "The unexpected sound of the voice would confound and amaze them."
2. "Some of the people... would suppose that this was a mere natural phenomenon."
3. "It was the opinion of many of the Jews that God did not speak to men except by the ministry of angels."

### John Calvin:
1. "Some are so deaf, that they hear as a confused sound what God had distinctly pronounced."
2. "But the same thing is practiced every day; for God speaks plainly enough in the Gospel, in which is also displayed the power and energy of the Spirit, which ought to shake heaven and earth; but many are as little affected by the doctrine, as if it only proceeded from a mortal man."
3. "Many consider the word of God to be confused and barbarous, as if it were nothing else than thunder."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "That a real voice had been heard is obvious from the fact that the words are actually given by the Evangelist." 
2. "John’s object in stating this appears to be his desire to bring still more clearly out the mysterious nature of the voice."
3. "The apprehension of which belonged to the higher regions of the spiritual life, and which was necessarily dark to those who had not entered into the Father's plans."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "That it had thundered (βροντην γεγονενα). Perfect active infinitive of γινομα in indirect discourse after ελεγεν and the accusative of general reference (βροντην, thunder, as in Mark 3:17), 'that thunder came to pass.'"
2. "So the crowd 'standing by' (εστως, second perfect active participle of ιστημ), but Jesus understood his Father's voice."
3. "An angel hath spoken to him (Αγγελος αυτω λελαληκεν). Perfect active indicative of λαλεω. So, when Jesus spoke to Saul on the way to Damascus, those with Saul heard the voice, but did not understand (Acts 9:7; Acts 22:9)."

### John Gill:
1. "Some took this for thunder, and others for the voice of an angel out of the thunder."
2. "These being nearer, perceived it was an articulate voice, which expressed certain distinct words, which they thought were delivered by an angel."
3. "The Jews had a mighty notion of the discourse and conversation of angels with men, which their doctors pretended to understand."

### John Wesley:
1. "In the most glorious revelations there may remain something obscure, to exercise our faith."
2. "Thunder did frequently attend a voice from heaven. Perhaps it did so now."
