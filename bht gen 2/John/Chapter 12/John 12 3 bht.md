# John 12:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Mary took a pound of costly ointment, an act that mirrored the love and devotion of others who poured ointment on Christ at different times during his ministry. The fragrance of the ointment permeated the house, reminiscent of the sweet savour of Christ's ministry spreading throughout the world. This significant event took place in Bethany, just days before Jesus' last passover, as recorded not only in John's gospel but also in the accounts of Matthew and Mark.
