# John 12:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This voice was not solely for my benefit, but rather it served a greater purpose. It was not merely to comfort me in my impending suffering, but to provide a convincing proof to you that I am the Messiah. This way, you would have no excuse for disbelief, as you not only witnessed miracles but also heard God speaking to me. This aligns with your own rule, as you require the Lord to speak directly to someone like he did with Moses.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The voice had been heard by those, who did not apprehend its meaning, as thunder."
2. "Our Lord does not say that the assurance was not made for His sake; He had prayed, and His prayer had been answered: but that it had not been thus outwardly expressed for His, but for their sake."
3. "ὑμᾶς is the whole multitude, not merely the disciples. All heard, and all might have understood the voice: see ch. John 11:42."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes—that is, probably, to correct the unfavorable impressions which His momentary agitation and mysterious prayer for deliverance may have produced on the by-standers." 


### Albert Barnes:
1. "Came not because of me - Not to strengthen or confirm me; not that I had any doubts about my course, or any apprehension that God would not approve me and glorify his name."
2. "For your sakes - To give you a striking and indubitable proof that I am the Messiah."
3. "That you may remember it when I am departed, and be yourselves comforted, supported, and saved."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "It is not for my sake that this voice hath come."

### John Calvin:
1. "Had Christ no need of being strengthened, or did the Father care less for him than for us?"
2. "As it was on our account that Christ clothed himself with flesh, so all the blessings which he received from the Father were bestowed on our account."
3. "There is here an indirect reproof, that the Jews are deaf like stones to the voice of God; for since God speaks for their sake, there can be no excuse for their ingratitude, when they do not lend their ears."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He needed not the voice, for he knew that He was one with the Father, and that He was carrying out the Father’s will."
2. "To show them that in all this there was no defeat on His part, but only the carrying out of the eternal purpose of the Father, the words were spoken."
3. "Jesus rises to the thought of that victory which, at this the very moment of His deepest humiliation and suffering, He beheld accomplished."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Not for my sake, but for your sakes" - These words seem to contradict verses John 12:28; John 12:29.
2. "Bernard suggests an interpolation into the words of Jesus."
3. "But why not take it to be the figure of exaggerated contrast, 'not merely for my sake, but also for yours'?"

### John Gill:
1. "This voice came not because of me; at least not only and chiefly; it was not so much in answer to his prayer, or in order to comfort him under the apprehensions he had of his sufferings and death, or to assure him of his future glorification, though all this was true."
2. "But for your sakes; to convince them that he was the Messiah, and engage them to believe in him, or to leave them without excuse; since not only miracles were wrought before their eyes, but with their ears they heard God speaking to him..."
3. "...and which is the rule that they themselves prescribe; for according to them, no man is to be hearkened to, though he should do as many signs and wonders as Moses, the son of Amram unless they hear with their ears, that the Lord speaks to him as he did to Moses."
