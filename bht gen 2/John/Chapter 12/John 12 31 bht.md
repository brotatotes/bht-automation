# John 12:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a very short time, there will be a judgment of the world. This judgment will reveal who will rule over it and determine the fate of both the Jewish and Gentile worlds. The prince of this world, Satan, will be cast out and stripped of his power, as the hour of his defeat approaches. His reign will come to an end, and he will be excommunicated from the holy dominion of God. This impending judgment signifies the victory of Christ over the forces of darkness and the establishment of his righteous rule.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He speaks of Himself as having actually entered the hour of His passion, and views the result as already come."
2. "judgment, properly so called, the work of the Spirit who was to come, on the world."
3. "The casting out (ἔξω, ἐκ τῆς ἀρχῆς, Euthym, Grot., or better perhaps, out of ὁ κόσμος οὗτος, his former place) shall be gradual, as the drawing in the next verse."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Now is the judgment of this world—the world that 'crucified the Lord of glory', considered as a vast and complicated kingdom of Satan, breathing his spirit, doing his work, and involved in his doom, which Christ's death by its hands irrevocably sealed."
2. "How differently is that fast-approaching 'hour' regarded in the kingdoms of darkness and of light! 'The hour of relief; from the dread Troubler of our peace—how near it is! Yet a little moment, and the day is ours!' So it was calculated and felt in the one region. 'Now shall the prince of this world be cast out,' is a somewhat different view of the same event."
3. "We know who was right. Though yet under a veil, He sees the triumphs of the Cross in unclouded and transporting light."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Now is approaching the decisive scene, the eventful period - the crisis - when it shall be determined who shall rule this world."
2. "The death of Jesus was the determining cause, the grand crisis, the concentration of all that God had ever done, or ever will do, to break down the kingdom of Satan, and set up his power over man."
3. "His kingdom shall be destroyed; his empire shall come to an end. It does not mean that his reign over all men would entirely cease then, but that then would be the crisis, the grand conflict in which he would be vanquished."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The phrase occurs only in the Gospel; here, John 14:30; John 16:11."
2. "Shall be cast out [εκβληθησεται εξω] . In every case but one where the word ejkballw occurs in John, it is used of casting out from a holy place or society."
3. "See John 2:15; John 9:34, John 9:3; 3 John 1:10; Revelation 12:2. Compare John 10:4."

### John Calvin:
1. "Now we know, that out of Christ there is nothing but confusion in the world; and though Christ had already begun to erect the kingdom of God, yet his death was the commencement of a well-regulated condition, and the full restoration of the world."
2. "Yet it must also be observed, that this proper arrangement cannot be established in the world, until the kingdom of Satan be first destroyed, until the flesh, and everything opposed to the righteousness of God, be reduced to nothing."
3. "When Satan has been cast out, therefore, the world is brought back from its revolt, and placed under obedience to the government of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "the 'now' of John 12:27, the 'hour' of John 12:23; and the primary thought to be taken into it is that of the suffering and death in the midst of which Jesus stood" 
2. "'This world' culminates in its prince...the 'world' is again used in the widest sense of the term. In its prince are concentrated the powers that come between man and God."
3. "he 'shall be cast out,' that is, out of the world which he has ruled, so that ideally he shall have no more power in it. The expression 'cast out' is very remarkable...excommunication from a holy community, or scene, or synagogue, or world, which is, and is to be, God's alone."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The judgement (κρισις). No article, 'A judgement.' The next few days will test this world."
2. "The prince of this world (ο αρχων του κοσμου τουτου). This phrase here, descriptive of Satan as in possession of the evil world, occurs again in John 14:30; John 16:11."
3. "Jesus did not deny Satan's power then, but here proclaims final victory over him."

### John Gill:
1. "In a very short time will be the judgment either of the Jewish world, when that shall be reproved, convinced, and condemned for their sin of rejecting Christ, and crucifying him, by the Spirit, in the ministration of the Gospel."
2. "Or of the Gentile world, when there shall be a discrimination, and separation made in it, of the chosen of God, who shall be called by special grace, and with the converted and believing Jews, shall form a Gospel church state, separate from the world of the ungodly."
3. "Now the time was at hand, when he should be cast out of the empire of the world he had assumed, and out of the temples of the Gentiles, and out of the hearts of God's elect among them."

### John Wesley:
1. "Now is the judgment given concerning it, whose it shall be."
2. "Now shall the prince of this world be cast out - judged, condemned, cast out of his possession, and out of the bounds of Christ's kingdom."
