# John 12:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The evangelist explains that when Jesus says, These are the words of the evangelist, interpreting the design of Christ in the above words, he is referring to what kind of death he would experience. The phrase being lifted up from the earth signifies not only his death, but the specific manner in which it would occur, through crucifixion. This indicates that the cross would be the instrument used in his sacrificial death, thus fulfilling the divine purpose of redemption.
