# John 12:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The crowd's misunderstanding of the phrase lifted up caused them to question Jesus' identity as the Son of Man and the fulfillment of Messianic prophecies. Their limited perspective led them to reject the idea of the Messiah suffering and dying. However, the Scriptures clearly indicate that the Christ's priesthood and kingdom would endure forever. The lifting up of the Son of Man refers to both his suffering and his eternal glory. The ancient Jews recognized these passages as referring to the Messiah, therefore revealing their ignorance and rejection of Jesus as the Son of Man.
