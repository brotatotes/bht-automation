# John 12:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Heeding their inquiry, Jesus does not directly respond, but rather encourages them to make the most of the time they have left with him. The light, which refers to Jesus and his teachings, is only present for a short while. Therefore, it is crucial for them to walk in the light, embracing and living out his teachings. Failure to do so would result in being overcome by darkness, ignorance, and unbelief. It is vital that they recognize the dangers and uncertainties of walking in darkness, rather than following the path illuminated by the light of Christ.

3. "The light is an easy transition from their question, if, as above supposed, Psa 89:36 was alluded to: 'His (David’s) seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before Me.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, &c.—Instead of answering their question, He warns them, with mingled majesty and tenderness, against trifling with their last brief opportunity, and entreats them to let in the Light while they have it in the midst of them."
2. "that they themselves might be 'light in the Lord.' In this case, all the clouds which hung around His Person and Mission would speedily be dispelled."
3. "while if they continued to hate the light, bootless were all His answers to their merely speculative or captious questions."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He tells them, therefore, that the light would be with them a little while, and that they ought to improve the opportunity while they had it to listen to his instructions, to require with candor, and thus to forsake their false notions respecting the Messiah."
2. "Make good use of your privileges before they are removed. That is, while the Messiah is with you, avail yourselves of his instructions and learn the way to life."
3. "Lest God should take away all your mercies, remove all light and instruction from you, and leave you to ignorance, blindness, and woe."

2. "This statement, that the light does not continue to shine on them but for a little while, applies equally to all unbelievers; for Scripture promises that to the children of God the Sun of righteousness will rise, and will never go down."
3. "But all ought to walk cautiously, because contempt of the light is followed by darkness. This, too, is the reason why night so thick and dark sat down on the world for many centuries."

3. "The ancients did not have our electric street lights. The dark streets were a terror to travellers."

### John Gill:
