# John 12:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage highlights the power of God, represented by the arm of the Lord, which is manifested through Christ in his teachings, miracles, and redemptive work. Isaiah 53:1 sheds light on the prophecy, acknowledging that many may not receive the message of salvation due to their lack of faith and the selective bestowal of God's grace. Despite human disbelief, the fulfillment of these prophecies in Christ underscores God's design and purpose.

### John Calvin:
1. "Indeed, it must have happened, though the prophet had not spoken of it; but as men would not have known what should take place, if God had not testified by the mouth of the prophet, the Evangelist places before our eyes in the prediction, as in a mirror, what would otherwise have appeared to men obscure and almost incredible."
2. "In this second clause he [Isaiah] assigns the reason why they are few; and that reason is, that men do not attain it by their own strength, and God does not illuminate all without distinction, but bestows the grace of his Holy Spirit on very few."
3. "Hence it follows, that many are left in their blindness destitute of inward light, because hearing they do not hear."

2. "That is probable as God's design, but it is by no means certain since ŒπŒΩŒ± is used in the N.T. with the idea of result."
3. "The next verse adds strength to the idea of design."

### John Gill:
