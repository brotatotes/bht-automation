# John 12:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The scripture reveals that, for a specific reason, they were unable to believe. This points to the fact that their inability was connected to their resistance against the truth and their hardening of hearts. It is important to note that their inability does not absolve them of moral responsibility, but rather highlights the divine act of shutting them up in their unbelief. This is in line with the decrees and predictions of God, which ultimately rendered it morally impossible for them to believe.
