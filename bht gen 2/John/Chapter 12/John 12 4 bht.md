# John 12:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Mary's devoted act inadvertently honors the deceased, serving as a stark contrast to Judas, who harbored hidden treachery in his heart. The rebuke of the Lord may have prompted Judas to act upon his long-held traitorous intentions. The Apostles' credulity, reprimanded by the Spirit of God, cautions against easy acceptance of slanderous statements. Judas, known by the disgraceful name Iscariot, lacked genuine love for his master and instead embodied hypocrisy and greed. God's foreknowledge predetermined Judas' betrayal, underscoring his true character. Mary's selflessness and Judas' deceit emphasize the importance of discernment and sincerity in our actions.
