# John 12:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's judgment is often manifested through the blinding and hardening of hearts, not by any direct act on His part, but rather by allowing people to succumb to their own stubbornness and resistance to the truth. This is a solemn reminder that those who reject God's message risk becoming spiritually blind, unable to understand or perceive His word. Isaiah's words of warning, repeated in different contexts throughout the New Testament, serve as a prophecy of the consequences that await those who refuse to humble themselves and turn to God.

### Albert Barnes:
