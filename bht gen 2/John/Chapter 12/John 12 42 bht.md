# John 12:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Many believed that Jesus was the Messiah but their faith was merely a mental acknowledgment of his miracles rather than a spiritual and saving belief in him as their Redeemer. They failed to confess their faith due to fear of being expelled from the synagogue, as the rulers had decreed that anyone who confessed Jesus as the Messiah would be cast out. This lack of confession reveals their preference for the praise of men over the glory and praise of God, highlighting the importance of openly proclaiming one's faith in Christ despite potential opposition.
