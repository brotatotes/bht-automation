# John 12:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The foolishness of preferring the empty applause of men over the judgment of God is evident in this passage. These individuals loved the praise of men, seeking to be esteemed and honored by them, rather than valuing the praise of God. In their refusal to confess Christ, they prioritized their own reputation and worldly honor over glorifying God and receiving His commendation. Their choice not to confess Christ revealed their love for the glory and praise of men, rather than the glory and praise that comes from God alone.
