# John 12:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus proclaimed passionately, emphasizing the consequences of believing in Him and rejecting His message. He urged the people to trust in Him and His teachings. When we believe in Jesus, we are not only believing in Him alone, but also in the One who sent Him. This strong belief in the Father and the Son is a crucial aspect of our faith.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Jesus cried—in a loud tone, and with peculiar solemnity." 
2. "This seems to be a supplementary record of some weighty proclamations, for which there had been found no natural place before, and introduced here as a sort of summary and winding up of His whole testimony."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jesus saw their unbelief, and proceeded to state the consequence of believing on him, and of rejecting him and his message."
2. "Believeth not on me - That is, not on me alone, or his faith does not terminate on me. It involves, also, belief in him that sent me."
3. "Jesus uniformly represents the union between himself and God as so intimate that there could not be faith in him unless there was also faith in God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Cried [εκραξεν]. This is not meant to relate a reappearance of Jesus in public. The close of His public ministry is noted at ver. 36. It is in continuation of the Evangelist's own remarks, and introduces a summary of Jesus' past teaching to the Jews."
2. "Believeth - on Him that sent Me [πιστευει - εις τον πεμψαντα με]. This is the first and almost the only place in the Gospel where the words believe on are used with reference to the Father. This rendering in John 5:24 is an error. See John 14:1."
3. "The phrase is constantly associated with our Lord. At the same time, it is to be noted that it contemplates the Father as the source of the special revelation of Christ, and therefore is not absolutely an exception to the habitual usage. The same is true of John 14:1."

### John Calvin:
1. "The cry is expressive of vehemence; for it is not a simple doctrine, but an exhortation intended to excite them more powerfully."
2. "Hence he infers, that it is foolish and unreasonable for faith to be wavering or doubtful; for it is impossible to offer a greater insult to God, than not to rely on his truth."
3. "He that believeth on me believeth not on me, but on him that sent me. Believers are said not to believe on Christ, when they do not fix their whole attention on his human countenance."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The words ‘cried and said’ are therefore equivalent to, This was the teaching of Jesus when He spake openly to the world."
2. "He that believeth in me, believeth not in me, but in him that sent me."
3. "No words could more strikingly express what Jesus had accomplished for those who received Him: He had led them to the Father, and through Jesus they are now believers in God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This is probably a summary of what Jesus had already said as in verse John 12:36." 
2. "Not on me only, but also on," another example of exaggerated contrast like that in verse John 12:30. 
3. "The idea of Jesus here is a frequent one (believing on Jesus whom the Father has sent) as in John 3:17; John 5:23; John 5:30; John 5:43; John 7:16; John 8:42; John 13:20; John 14:1; Matthew 10:40; Luke 9:48."

### John Gill:
1. "He cried with a loud voice, that he might be heard, and his audience left inexcusable."
2. "Christ is the object of faith...and it is his Father's will, and his own advice, that his people should believe in him."
3. "He that believes on Christ, believes on him that sent him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Jesus said with a loud voice — This which follows to the end of the chapter, is with St. John the epilogue of our Lord's public discourses, and a kind of recapitulation of them." 
2. "Believeth not on me — Not on me alone, but also on him that sent me: because the Father hath sent the Son, and because he and the Father are one."
