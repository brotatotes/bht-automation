# John 12:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Not with bodily eyes, but with the eye of faith, one can truly see and behold the glory of Christ. This goes beyond the perception of His mere human appearance, allowing us to see the divine and glorious nature of the Father manifested through him. In seeing Christ, we see the Father, as they are inseparable and share the same perfections. When we truly behold the Son with faith, we also behold the eternal and magnificent glory of the Father.

### John Gill:
1. "Not with bodily eyes, for there were many that saw Christ, who never saw the Father: they saw Christ as a mere man, and were offended at the meanness of his outward appearance; they saw nothing divine in him, nor the glory of the Father through him."
2. "Whoever saw or perceived the glory of Christ in his miracles, saw the glory of God in them also, for the Father that dwelt in him did the works, John 2:11."
3. "Whoever truly sees Christ with an eye of faith, sees his glory, as the glory of the only begotten of the Father, as the brightness of his Father's glory, as having the fulness of the Godhead dwelling in him, the same perfections as in the Father; so that he that hath seen the one, hath seen the other also, John 14:9."
