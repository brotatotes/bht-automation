# John 12:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
I am come a light into the world, declares Jesus, shining as the sun of righteousness, enlightening men with the light of the living. In their unregenerate and unbelieving state, God's elect reside in darkness. But when Christ illuminates them with the light of faith, the darkness is overcome, and the true light shines. They no longer remain in the darkness of sin, ignorance, and unbelief, but walk in the light of truth, faith, and holiness, anticipating the day when all remnants of darkness will vanish completely.
