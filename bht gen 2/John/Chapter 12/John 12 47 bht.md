# John 12:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Men may hear and understand the Gospel of Christ without truly believing and embracing it. Jesus states, I judge him not; I am not come to judge the world, but to save the world. His primary purpose is to offer salvation rather than condemnation. Even those who reject or despise Jesus are not immediately condemned, but are given an opportunity to repent and be saved. Christ's intention is to save, not to judge, and he extends his offer of salvation to all, including those who may eventually reject it.
