# John 12:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who reject the teachings of Christ will not escape righteous judgment. While Christ may not judge them immediately, there is another who judges them even now. The very words spoken by Christ will serve as the judge on the last day, when the actions of individuals will be evaluated. The judge will consider the present declaration made by the words of Christ and act accordingly.
