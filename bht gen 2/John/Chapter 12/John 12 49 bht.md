## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There does not appear to be any real difference here, though many have been suggested, between εἴπω and λαλήσω." 
2. "Both are summed up in λαλῶ in the next verse: compare Matthew 10:19."

### Albert Barnes:
1. Of myself - John 7:16-18.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Of myself [εξ εμαυτου] . Out of myself. This formula occurs only here. The usual expression is ajp' ejmautou. Apo, from, as distinguished from ejk, out of, marks rather the point of departure, while ejk, including this idea, emphasizes the point of departure as the living and impelling source of that which issues forth."
2. "In John 7:17, we read, 'whether it be out of God [εκ του θεου], or whether I speak from myself [απ εμαυτου].' "
3. "Gave [εδωκεν]. The best texts read dedeken, the perfect tense, hath given, the result of the gift still abiding. So Rev."

### John Calvin:
1. "That the outward appearance of man may not lessen the majesty of God, Christ frequently sends us to the Father."
2. "Now Christ here distinguishes himself from the Father, not simply as to his Divine Person, but rather as to his flesh; lest the doctrine should be judged after the manner of men, and, therefore, should have less weight."
3. "We may likewise infer from it, how monstrous is the sacrilege of the Pope in daring to bind souls by his inventions; for in this way he claims more for himself than the Son of God does, who declares that he does not speak but by the commandment of his Father."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Because I spake not of myself; but the Father which sent me, he hath given me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak."
2. "This commandment is the expression of the Divine plan for the salvation of the world."
3. "The combination of ‘say’ and ‘speak’ in the last clause is remarkable: see the note on chap. John 8:43."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He hath given (δεδωκεν). Perfect active indicative. Christ has permanent commission." 
2. "What I should say and what I should speak (τ ειπω κα τ λαλησω). Indirect question retaining the deliberative subjunctive (second aorist active ειπω, first aorist active λαλησω)." 
3. "Meyer and Westcott take ειπω to refer to the content and λαλησω more to the varying manner of delivery. Possibly so."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ, as man, had his mission, and commission, and his instructions from his Father to preach the Gospel unto men."
