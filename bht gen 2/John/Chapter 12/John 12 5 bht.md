# John 12:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Care for the poor is often used as an excuse to conceal other motives. In this case, Judas used the pretext of selling the expensive ointment for the benefit of the poor, but his true concern was the potential loss of money that he could have misappropriated. Judas' focus on the financial value of the ointment, estimated at around nine pounds, exposes his greed and disregard for the genuine act of worship and adoration shown by Mary.
