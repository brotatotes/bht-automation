# John 12:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Judas, entrusted with the money, showed no concern for the poor. He had no affection or care for them and was even willing to betray Jesus over the loss of an opportunity to steal. It is worth noting that Jesus intentionally chose someone he knew to be a thief as a steward, perhaps as a means for Judas to bring about his own downfall. This cautionary example should not be taken as a rule to entrust the care of the poor or anything sacred to the wicked and ungodly.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "to keep the reeds, or tongues, of wind instruments: thus, generally, any kind of pouch, or money-chest."
2. "It seems hardly possible, with St. John’s use of βαστάζειν in ch. Joh 20:15 before us, altogether to deny that the sense of carrying off, i.e. purloining, may be here intended."
3. "And we have examples in Josephus somewhat analogous: e.g. Antt. vii. 15. 3, where Hyrcanus the High Priest, wishing to give Antiochus Eusebes money to raise the siege, καὶ ἀλλαχόθεν οὐκ εὐπορῶν, ἀνοίξας ἕνα οἶκον τῶν ἐν τῷ Δαυίδου μνήματι, καὶ βαστάσας τρισχίλια τάλαντα, μέρος ἔδωκεν Ἀντιόχῳ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "How worthy of notice is this arrangement, by which an avaricious and dishonest person was not only taken into the number of the Twelve, but entrusted with the custody of their little property!"
2. "The purposes which this served are obvious enough; but it is further noticeable, that the remotest hint was never given to the eleven of His true character."
3. "Nor did the disciples most favored with the intimacy of Jesus ever suspect him, till a few minutes before he voluntarily separated himself from their company—for ever!"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "And having the bag bare, etc."
2. "Originally a box for keeping the mouth-pieces of wind instruments."
3. "Bare [εβασταζεν]. Carried away or purloined. This meaning is rather imparted by the context than residing in the verb itself."


### John Calvin:
1. "We are taught by this instance what a frightful beast the desire of possessing is; the loss which Judas thinks that he has sustained, by the loss of an opportunity for stealing, excites him to such rage that he does not hesitate to betray Christ."
2. "It is wonderful that Christ should have chosen, as a steward, a person of this description, whom he knew to be a thief. For what else was it than to put into his hands a rope for strangling himself?"
3. "Yet the action of Christ ought not to be viewed as an ordinary rule, that we should commit the care of the poor, or any thing sacred, to a wicked and ungodly man."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The plausible remonstrance of Judas led more honest and guileless minds than his to share in the wonder which his words expressed."
2. "Though Matthew says nothing at this point of Judas or his covetousness, it is very significant that, immediately after relating the answer of Jesus, he tells us that Judas went to the rulers and said, ‘What will ye give me?’"
3. "As in the only passages of the Old Testament in which the word occurs it denotes a receptacle for offerings made to the temple, it is perhaps more than a coincidence that it is here chosen by John when he would speak of the small store of money possessed by Jesus (the True temple) and His disciples."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Not because it was a care to him concerning the poor."
2. "Temptation commonly comes through that for which we are naturally fitted."
3. "This compound for the earlier 'money-box' was originally a receptacle for the tongues or mouth-pieces of wind instruments. It occurs also in Josephus, Plutarch, etc."

### John Gill:
1. "He had no affection for them, and was unconcerned about them, and took no care of them to feed and clothe them."
2. "He was no ways solicitous for their support, refreshment, and more comfortable living."
3. "Judas had the purse, into which was put whatsoever was ministered to Christ, for the common supply of him and his disciples, and for the relief of the poor."
