# John 12:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Mary had prepared the ointment against the day of Christ's preparation for the tomb. Jesus instructs his disciples to let her keep it, as her action holds a deeper meaning. The anointing of bodies was not a meaningless ceremony, but a spiritual symbol of the hope of resurrection. Jesus recognizes the significance of Mary's act as an unconscious prophecy of the impending event that would glorify His name. Let us not disturb or hinder those who express their reverence and love for Christ, for their actions may hold a deeper significance than we initially realize.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The rec. reading...seems to be an adaptation to Mark 14:8, in order to escape from the difficulty of understanding how she could keep for His burial, what she poured out now." 
2. "Meyer understands the text of the remnant: but Luthardt rightly observes that the history clearly excludes the idea of a remnant."
3. "I understand the words...of her whole act, not regarded as a thing past, but spoken of in the abstract as to be allowed or disallowed: Let her keep it for the day of my burial: not meaning a future day or act, but the present one, as one to be allowed."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "Mary, then, has kept the ointment in order to embalm Jesus with it on this day, as though He were already dead."
3. "The old rendering, as A. V., is the simplest, and gives a perfectly intelligible and consistent sense. If, however, this must be rejected, it seems, on the whole, best to adopt the marginal reading of the Rev., with the elliptical ina: let her alone: it was that she might keep it."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ’s reply... shows that they act improperly and unjustly who disturb their neighbors without a good reason, and raise a disturbance about nothing."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Our Lord was not distinctly affirming that this day was, so to speak, the day on which He was prepared for entombment: it was His wont to use language which but partially revealed the approaching event, which seemed to unenlightened hearers to contain only some dark hint of trouble impending, but which stood forth in luminous significance when the implied prophecy was ready to be fulfilled."
2. "At the feet of Him whom ‘the Jews’ are seeking to kill, and whom false friends are betraying, faith pours her richest treasures. Mary thought only of showing her reverence and love: Jesus sees in it a prophetic recognition of the impending event which crowned His humiliation and became His exaltation."
3. "The Evangelist relates an unconscious prophecy on the part of a disciple, as he has related a prophecy by an enemy who ‘spake not of himself’."
