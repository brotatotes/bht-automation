# John 12:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is important to remember that Jesus does not discredit gifts to the poor at all. He always recommended showing a regard to them and took care of them. However, there is relativity in one's duties. Jesus' words seem to be a sort of prophecy, acknowledging that there will always be poor persons in the churches of Christ who need to be taken care of and provided for. This is in reference to His corporeal presence, which would be quickly withdrawn from them, eliminating the opportunity to show Him personal respect in such a way.
