# John 12:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Many of the Jews that lived in Jerusalem knew that Jesus was in Bethany, just two miles away, and word quickly spread there. They came from Jerusalem to Bethany to see Jesus, hear him, and observe his actions. Not only did they come for Jesus's sake, but also to see Lazarus, whom Jesus had raised from the dead. They were curious to see both the one who had been dead and the one who had raised him.

2. "The Ἰουδαῖοι are the representatives of the Jewish opposition to Jesus."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Crowds of the Jerusalem Jews hastened to Bethany, not so much to see Jesus, whom they knew to be there, as to see dead Lazarus alive; and this, issuing in their accession to Christ, led to a plot against the life of Lazarus also, as the only means of arresting the triumphs of Jesus." 
2. "To such a pitch had these chief priests come of diabolical determination to shut out the light from themselves, and quench it from the earth!" 
3. "Christ's triumphal entry into Jerusalem."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "The more nearly the time of the death of Christ approached, it became the more necessary that his name should be universally celebrated, in order that it might be a preparation for stronger faith after his death." 
2. "More especially, the Evangelist relates that the recent miracle of the resurrection of Lazarus had acquired great celebrity: and as Christ showed in it a remarkable proof of his Divinity, God intended that it should have many witnesses." 
3. "When he says that they came not on account of Jesus only, but also for the sake of Lazarus, he does not mean that they came out of regard to Lazarus, as if they bestowed this mark of honor on him in particular, but that they might behold the astonishing display of the power of Christ in Lazarus."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Faith and unbelief have revealed themselves in the case of the friends and the enemies of Jesus, and especially in the deed of Mary and the words of Judas."
