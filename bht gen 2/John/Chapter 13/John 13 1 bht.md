# John 13:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This feast symbolizes the deliverance of the Israelites and serves as a foreshadowing of Christ. Jesus, aware of His impending death, showed His love for His disciples by washing their feet, a proof of His self-humiliating love. His love for them was unwavering, extending to the very end. Throughout the narrative, Jesus' love is depicted as reaching its highest point, a love that encompasses His chosen ones, whom He refers to as His own. These are the elect of God, chosen, given to Him, and redeemed by His blood.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Jesus loved His own even to the end (of His life in the flesh), and gave them in the washing of their feet a proof of His love; and to this act He was induced by the knowledge that He must soon leave this world."
2. "Although this knowledge was united with the highest consciousness of His divine mission and speedy glorification, yet this latter did not prevent Him from giving this proof of His self-humiliating love."
3. "The words belong to the whole narrative following, not to εἰδώς or ἀγαπήσας."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "On these beautiful euphemisms, see on  :-;  :-."
2. "The meaning is, that on the very edge of His last sufferings, when it might have been supposed that He would be absorbed in His own awful prospects, He was so far from forgetting 'His own,' who were to be left struggling 'in the world' after He had 'departed out of it to the Father' ( :-), that in His care for them He seemed scarce to think of Himself save in connection with them."
3. "Herein is love, not only enduring to the end, but most affectingly manifested when, judging by a human standard, least to be expected."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Having loved his own - Having given to them decisive and constant proofs of his love."
2. "He loved them unto the end - That is, he continued the proofs of his love until he was taken away from them by death."
3. "Jesus is the same yesterday, today, and forever. He does not change; he always loves the same traits of character."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "It is not the Passover of the Jews which Jesus is about to celebrate, which had degenerated into an empty form, but the national ordinance, according to its true spirit, and with a development of its higher meaning."
2. "Unto the end [εις τελος]. Interpretations differ. The rendering of the A. V. and Rev. is of doubtful authority."
3. "This is the most probable rendering in Luke 18:5, on which see note. It may also mean to the uttermost, completely."

### John Calvin:
1. "John intentionally passes by many things which, he knew, had been related by Matthew and others."
2. "The Lord testified, by this visible sign, that the love with which he embraced them was firm and lasting; that, though they were deprived of his presence, they might still be convinced that death itself would not quench this love."
3. "This phrase is worthy of notice; for it refers to the knowledge of Christ, that he knew that his death was a passage to the heavenly kingdom of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Jesus will partake of ‘the Passover,’ but not of ‘the Passover of the Jews;’ of the great national ordinance of Israel, but not of an ordinance the true spirit and meaning of which had perished."
2. "Certainly not ‘although He knew,’ as if His consciousness of the glory awaiting Him might have proved an obstacle to His present manifestation of Himself, had it not been overcome by love; but because He knew that He was about to be delivered from the toil and suffering of the world, and to be reunited to the Father in the blessedness of the most intimate communion with Him."
3. "His love now gains additional intensity; He loved them ‘to the full.’ The expression does not mean ‘to the end,’ for which another phrase is always used. It is best explained by 1 Thessalonians 2:16, ‘to the uttermost:’ the love of Jesus now reaches its highest point."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Just before, John means, not twenty-four hours before, that is our Thursday evening (beginning of 15th of Nisan, sunset to sunset Jewish day), since Jesus was crucified on Friday 15th of Nisan."
2. "There seems no real doubt that this meal in John 13:1-30 is the real passover meal described by the Synoptics also (Mark 14:18-21; Matthew 26:21-25; Luke 22:21-23), followed by the institution of the Lord's Supper."
3. "John pictures here the outgoing of Christ's very heart's love (chs. John 13:13-17) towards these men whom he had chosen and whom he loved 'unto the end' (εις τελος) as in Matthew 10:22; Luke 18:15, but here as in 1 Thessalonians 2:16 rather 'to the uttermost'."

### John Gill:
1. "This feast was instituted as a memorial of the deliverance of the children of Israel out of Egypt, and was an eminent type of Christ."
2. "The death of Christ is here signified by a departing out of this world, a way of speaking frequently used by the Jews as expressive of death."
3. "The objects of his love are described by his property in them, 'his own';... all the elect of God, who are his own, by his choice of them, by the Father's gift of them to him, by the purchase he made of them with his blood, and by his effectual call of them by his grace."
