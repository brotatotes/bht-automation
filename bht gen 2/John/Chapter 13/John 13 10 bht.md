# John 13:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers, having been washed and purified by the blood of Christ, are considered clean in the sight of God. While their past sins are forgiven, they are encouraged to continually cleanse themselves by walking in holiness and striving to remain undefiled. Just as one who has bathed only needs to wash their feet to maintain cleanliness, so too should believers continue to wash themselves through a life of righteousness and obedience.
