# John 13:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus knew from the beginning, not only from the beginning of his ministry, when he chose his apostles, but from the beginning of time, that Judas would betray him. He was aware of the preparations being made and how things were working to bring about this betrayal. Jesus did not mention Judas by name, choosing not to fully reveal him to the disciples until the time was right. This knowledge of Judas' treachery prompted Jesus to treat him with his usual courtesy, despite the evil in his heart.
