# John 13:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do you understand the significance of my action? Jesus asks his disciples after performing a humble act of service towards them. He is not seeking their response, but rather drawing their attention to what follows. Jesus, as the Master and Lord, set an example for all of his followers to willingly serve one another, regardless of how lowly the task may seem. By asking this question, Jesus reveals that the disciples did not fully comprehend the deep meaning and purpose behind his service.
