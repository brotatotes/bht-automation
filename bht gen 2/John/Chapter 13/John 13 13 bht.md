## BHT:
Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye do well; for so I am. It is not surprising that the disciples addressed Jesus with these honorable titles, as they were commonly used for learned and respected individuals among the Jews. However, their use of these names was not mere flattery, but a genuine expression of reverence and esteem for Jesus. Despite his humble act of washing their feet, Jesus confirms his role as their true Master and Lord, indicating that he still possesses the authority to teach, instruct, rule, and govern them.
