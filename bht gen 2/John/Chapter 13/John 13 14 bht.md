# John 13:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As the Lord and Master, Jesus washed the feet of his disciples and exhorts them to do the same for one another. The disciples' recognition of Jesus' titles and their understanding of his actions underscore the duty they have towards each other. While the act of washing feet may not be meant to be taken literally, it serves as a symbol of humility and love. By washing one another's feet, they are to actively assist each other in attaining purity and perform acts of service, even the lowest, when needed.
