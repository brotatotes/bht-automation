# John 13:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ's actions were symbolic, serving as an example for his followers. They should strive to restore those who have fallen, with a spirit of meekness. When considering Christ as an example, it is important to distinguish which actions are meant for imitation. Washing the disciples' feet was not meant as an ceremonial act but rather a lesson in humility. Through this act, Jesus rebuked their jealousy, pride, and strife. It serves as a reminder for believers to exercise grace, meekness, humility, love, patience, and other virtues in their relationships with one another and with all fellow Christians.
