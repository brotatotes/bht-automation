# John 13:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus emphasizes the importance of knowing and doing the duties required of his disciples. It is not enough to simply have knowledge or to occasionally perform these duties. True happiness comes from actively practicing humility, love, and respect towards one another. The happiness that comes from doing these things is not earned through merit, but rather is a natural result of living out the principles and example that Christ has set. Conversely, those who know but do not act upon these teachings are left feeling unhappy.
