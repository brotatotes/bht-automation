# John 13:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The psalm referenced here is speaking of Jesus Christ, the true Messiah. It refers to his period of great humiliation when he willingly became poor for the sake of his people. However, it also speaks of his ultimate vindication and exaltation as he was raised up again. This is seen as a prayer for the destruction of the city, temple, and nation, as a consequence of rejecting the Messiah.
