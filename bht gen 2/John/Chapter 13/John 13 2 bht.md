# John 13:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The act of washing the disciples' feet was a unique and significant action that Jesus performed. It was not a common Jewish practice during a meal. The influence of Satan was specifically directed towards Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon. This introductory account highlights Jesus' calmness and humility as he willingly washes the feet of someone whom Satan had already influenced to betray him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The devil having by this time suggested (to Judas) that Judas Iscariot the son of Simon (i.e. that he) should betray Him."
2. "Judas had before this covenanted with the Sanhedrim to betray Him, which must here be meant by the devil having put it into his heart: the thorough self-abandonment to Satan which led to the actual deed, being designated."
3. "Luke expresses the steps of his treasonable purpose otherwise, meaning the same. The fact is here stated, to enhance the love which Jesus shewed in the following action."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
2. "supper being ended—rather,
	"being prepared," "being served," or, "going
	on"; for that it was not "ended" is plain from
	John 13:1.
	the devil having now—or,
	"already."
	put into the heart of Judas...
	to betray him—referring to the agreement he had already
	made with the chief priests (John 13:2)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Supper being ended - This translation expresses too much. The original means while they were at supper; and that this is the meaning is clear from the fact that we find them still eating after this." 
2. "The devil - The leader or prince of evil spirits."
3. "Having now put it into the heart - Literally, having cast it into the heart. The meaning of this passage is that Satan inclined the mind of Judas to do this, or he tempted him to betray his Master. We know not precisely how this was done, but we know that it was by means of his avarice."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The A. V. is wrong, even if the reading of the Received Text be retained; for in ver. 12 Jesus reclined again, and in ver. 26, the supper is still in progress. It should be, supper having begun, or having been served." 
2. "It is important to note the absence of the definite article: a supper, as distinguished from the feast, which also is designated by a different word." 
3. "Meyer, strangely, refers the heart, not to Judas, but to the Devil himself; rendering, the Devil having already formed the design that Judas should deliver Him up. Godet does not speak too strongly when he says that 'this meaning is insufferable.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "We shall afterwards take into consideration, at the proper place, the whole of Christ’s design in washing the feet of his disciples, and the advantage to be derived from this narrative."
2. "The Evangelist says that this was done, while Judas already resolved to betray Christ, not only to show the wonderful patience of Christ, who could endure to wash the feet of such a wicked and detestable traitor; but also that he purposely selected the time when he was near death, for performing what may be regarded as the last act of his life."
3. "When the Evangelist says that Judas had been impelled by the devil to form the design of betraying Christ, this tends to show the enormity of the crime; for it was dreadful and most atrocious wickedness, in which the efficacy of Satan was openly displayed."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The chronological notice, ‘a supper being begun.’ It was during the course of the supper, not after it was ended, that the events to be spoken of took place."
2. "The three particulars are in the sharpest contrast with those in John 13:1, the devil with Jesus, Judas with ‘His own,’ treachery with love."
3. "What has been said ought to remove the objection felt by many to the translation which we have given of this verse. None will deny that it is the correct translation of the best established Greek text, but it is thought to be impossible to speak of the heart of Satan."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Correct text, present middle participle of γινομα (not γενομενου, second aorist middle participle, 'being ended') genitive absolute." 
2. "Luke (Luke 22:3) says that Satan entered Judas when he offered to betray Jesus. Hence John's 'already' (ηδη) is pertinent."
3. "Satan had an open door by now into the heart of Judas."

### John Gill:
1. "The washing of the disciples' feet was a peculiar action of our Lord's, and had no manner of regard to any usage among the Jews at such a time."
2. "The person Satan influenced and acted upon, for his purpose, was Judas Iscariot, Simon's son."
3. "This account is prefaced to Christ's washing the feet of his disciples, to show the great composure of mind Christ was in, though he knew what was doing; and his wonderful condescension in washing the feet of so vile a creature, into whose heart Satan had already put it to betray him."

### John Wesley:
1. Having now — Probably now first.
