# John 13:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As ambassadors of Christ, those who receive us receive Christ Himself, and in turn, receive God the Father. We carry the honor and authority that Christ has entrusted to us as His representatives in this world. Those who welcome and accept us as messengers of the Gospel are ultimately honoring Christ and God the Father. Therefore, let us remember the significance of our role and conduct ourselves in a manner worthy of this honor.
