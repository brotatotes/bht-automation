# John 13:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
One of you - By this method He made it more difficult for Judas to conceal his sin, and more easy for the other disciples to cherish brotherly love, and continued watchfulness over themselves. The effects of this statement were beneficial for all the disciples.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "One of those mysterious troublings of spirit, which passed over our Lord." 
2. "ἐμαρτ implies the delivery of some solemn and important announcement."
3. "This was the first time He had ever spoken so plainly."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The announcement of [betrayal] seems not to have been plain enough to be quite apprehended, save by the traitor himself."
2. "But how much it cost Him to do this, appears from the 'trouble' that came over His 'spirit' - visible emotion, no doubt - before He got it uttered."
3. "What wounded susceptibility does this disclose, and what exquisite delicacy in His social intercourse with the Twelve, to whom He cannot, without an effort, break the subject!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The reason of his trouble here was that Judas, a professed friend, was about to betray him. He doubtless foresaw the deep and dreadful sorrows of his approaching death, and was also deeply affected with the ingratitude and wickedness of a professed friend."
2. "Jesus was man as well as God, and he felt like other men. His human nature shrank from suffering, and his tender sensibilities were affected not less deeply than would be those of other men by baseness and treason."
3. "He bore witness to the truth; openly declared what he had before intimated - that one of them would betray him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The agitation was in the highest region of the spiritual life."
2. "One of you shall betray me."
3. "The hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table."

### John Calvin:
1. "The more sacred the apostolic office is, and the higher its dignity, the more base and detestable was the treachery of Judas."
2. "A crime so monstrous and detestable struck Christ himself with horror, when he saw how the incredible wickedness of one man had polluted that sacred order in which the majesty of God ought to have shone with brightness."
3. "The action was so monstrous that the bare mention of it could not be immediately believed. He was troubled in spirit, in order to inform us that he did not merely, in countenance and language, assume the appearance of a man who was troubled, but that he was deeply moved in his mind."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "All the expressions of the verse indicate how deeply the spirit of Jesus was moved, the ‘troubled in spirit,’ the ‘bare witness,’ the ‘Verily, verily.’ Compassion, however, is not the leading feature of His mind at present."
2. "Therefore He was ‘troubled’ and troubled ‘in spirit,’ in the highest region of the spiritual life."
3. "And therefore also He said ‘Verily, verily;’ so solemn, so awful, so full of deep and far-reaching meaning, was the fact about to be realized."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He was troubled in the spirit" - First aorist passive indicative of ταρασσω and the locative case of πνευμα. See already John 11:33; John 12:27 for this use of ταρασσω for the agitation of Christ's spirit. In John 14:1; John 14:27 it is used of the disciples.
 
2. "Testified" - First aorist active indicative of μαρτυρεω, definite witness as in John 4:44; John 18:37.
3. "One of you shall betray me" - Future active of παραδιδωμ, to betray, the word so often used of Judas. This very language occurs in Mark 14:18; Matthew 26:21 and the idea in Luke 22:21. Jesus had said a year ago that "one of you is a devil" (John 6:70), but it made no such stir then. Now it was a bolt from the blue sky as Jesus swept his eyes around and looked at the disciples.

### John Gill:
1. "He was troubled in spirit; in his soul, which shows him to be truly and really man, and to have a human soul, which some have denied."
2. "He was troubled, not at what he had said, but at what he was about to say concerning the betrayer; and that not so much on his own account, because of the danger, the sorrows, and sufferings he should be exposed to, as on account of the horrible blackness of the crime, and the vengeance that would fall upon the criminal."
3. "Verily, verily, I say unto you; it is truth, it may be believed, however unexpected and strange it may seem to be: that one of you shall betray me; to the chief priests and elders, in order to be put to death."

### John Wesley:
1. One of you — The speaking thus indefinitely at first was profitable to them all.
