# John 13:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
At the table, one of Jesus' disciples was reclining, next to him, in a position of honor. This disciple, whom Jesus loved, had a special closeness to Jesus and was even leaning on his bosom. The tradition of the Church confirms that this beloved disciple was none other than John himself. The posture of lying or sitting at table was customary during that time, and John, humbly not naming himself directly, bestowed this privileged position next to Jesus.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Since the captivity, the Jews lay at table in the Persian manner, on divans or couches, each on his left side, with his face towards the table, his left elbow resting on a pillow and supporting his head. Thus the second guest to the right hand lay with his head near the breast of the first, and so on."
2. "The disciple meant is John himself, see ch. John 21:20 ; also designated thus, ch. John 19:26 ; John 21:7 (see Prolegomena to John, § i. 6)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "There was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved—Thus modestly does our Evangelist denote himself, as reclining next to Jesus at the table."
2. "Peter...beckoned to him to ask who it should be of whom he spake—reclining probably at the corresponding place on the other side of Jesus."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Leaning on Jesus’ bosom - This does not mean that he was at that time actually lying on his bosom, but that he occupied a situation next to him at the table, so that his head naturally fell back on his bosom when he spoke to him."
2. "Whom Jesus loved - This was doubtless John himself. The evangelists are not accustomed to mention their own names when any mark of favor or any good deed is recorded."
3. "The highest honor that can be conferred on any man is to say that Jesus loved him. Yet this is an honor which all may possess, but which none can inherit without his spirit and without loving him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Rev. renders, 'there was at the table reclining,' etc. At the table is added because the verb is the general term equivalent to sitting at table."
2. "In Jesus' bosom," defines John's position relatively to the other guests."
3. "As the guests reclined upon the left arm, the feet being stretched out behind, the head of each would be near the breast of his companion on the left."

### John Calvin:
1. "The peculiar love with which Christ loved John plainly testifies that, if we love some more than others, this is not always inconsistent with brotherly love."
2. "All lies in this, that our love shall be directed towards God, and that every man, in proportion as he excels in the gifts of God, shall share in it the more largely."
3. "The love of men towards each other will never be properly regulated, unless it be directed to God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It had been permitted to fall aside; and our Lord recognised the propriety of the change."
2. "The altitude of reclining would not be changed when it did so."
3. "The universal tradition of the Church... leave no doubt that this disciple was John himself."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "No word for 'table' in the text." 
2. "Periphrastic imperfect of ανακειμα, to lie back, to recline."
3. "At the table John was on the right of Jesus lying obliquely so that his head lay on the bosom of Jesus."

### John Gill:
1. "The posture of the Jews at table, was either 'sitting' or 'lying', and a difference they make between these two."
2. "For John to lie next to Jesus, and as it were to lean on his bosom, showed how much he was respected and honored by him."
3. "Christ, as the Son of God, and surety of his people, loved his true disciples, as he does all his elect, alike; not one more than the other; but as man, he had a particular affection for this disciple, and therefore admitted him near his person, and was very familiar with him."

### John Wesley:
1. "There was lying in the bosom of Jesus — That is, sitting next to him at table."
2. "This phrase only expresses the then customary posture at meals, where the guests all leaned sidewise on couches."
3. "One of the disciples whom Jesus loved — St. John avoids with great care the expressly naming himself."
