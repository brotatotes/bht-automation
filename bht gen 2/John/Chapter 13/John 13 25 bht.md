# John 13:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
John, in his intimate position closest to Jesus, leans back onto His breast, making use of his familiarity and closeness to ask Him a private question. This action goes unnoticed by the others at the table, who are likely unaware of the significance of John's movement. Perhaps John's motive for leaning back and speaking to Jesus discreetly was not only to inquire about the identity of the person in question but also to establish his own unique bond with Christ.
