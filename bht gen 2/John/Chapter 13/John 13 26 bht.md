# John 13:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ, in an intimate act of affection, whispered a sign to John to identify the treacherous person. This sign involved a sop, or a piece of bread, that Christ dipped into the dish. He gave this sop to Judas, the son of Simon, making a clear distinction between him and the other apostles. Jesus demonstrated remarkable care not to offend Judas, even offering him a gesture of love. However, despite this display of tenderness, Judas remained unmoved, allowing Satan to take complete control.

### Albert Barnes:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The giving of the sop then is more than an index to the traitor. It is a final appeal to Judas which may yet soften his heart, but which, if it do not soften him, will only make him more hardened than before."
2. "The second question, Does Judas partake of the feast? is not distinctly answered by the Evangelist. We must probably answer in the negative, because (1) The ‘feast’ was only now beginning. (2) The drift of the passage, and indeed of the whole of this section of the gospel, leads to the conclusion that he did not."
