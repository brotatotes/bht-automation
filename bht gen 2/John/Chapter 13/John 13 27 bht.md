# John 13:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As the events unfold, Judas takes the sop, a sign of friendly affection, realizing that Jesus knows of his treacherous plan. Possessed by Satan, his will is firmly set on carrying out the betrayal, driven by an evil spirit that had been pushing him towards this horrid iniquity. Jesus, aware of what is about to transpire, tells Judas to carry out his plan quickly, not as an approval, but rather to expose him and demonstrate Jesus' willingness to suffer and die for the sake of salvation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This giving the sop was one of the closest testimonies of friendly affection."
2. "Satan entered fully into him, took full possession of him, so that his will was not only bent upon doing the deed of treachery, but fixed and determined to do it then and there."
3. "The command to go on is but the echo of that mysterious appointment by which the sinner in the exercise of his own corrupted will becomes the instrument of the purposes of God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Very solemn are these brief hints of the successive steps by which Judas reached the climax of his guilt."
2. "But that word of the Psalm, about 'one that ate of his bread who would lift up his heel against Him,' probably all but turned the dread scale."
3. "'Satan has entered into him,' and though the Saviour's act might seem enough to recall him even yet, hell is now in his bosom, and he says within himself, 'The die is cast; now let me go through with it'; fear, begone!'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "After the sop - After he had taken and probably eaten it. By this Judas saw that Jesus knew his design, and that he could not conceal his plan."
2. "Satan entered into him - The devil had before this put it into his heart to betray Jesus John 13:2, but he now excited him to a more decided purpose."
3. "God adopts all means to bring men to a decision. He calls upon them to act decisively, firmly, immediately. He does not allow them the privilege to deliberate about wicked deeds, but calls on them to act at once, and to show whether they will obey or disobey him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "With a peculiar emphasis, marking the decisive point at which Judas was finally committed to his dark deed."
2. "The token of goodwill which Jesus had offered, if it did not soften his heart would harden it."

### John Calvin:
1. "But as they who are more fully confirmed in The faith which they formerly possessed are often said to believe, and thus an increase of their faith is called faith, so now that Judas is utterly given up to Satan, so as to be hurried on, by vehement impetuosity, to every extremity of evil, Satan is said to have entered into him."
2. "This is a dreadful vengeance of God, when men are given up to a reprobate mind, so that they scarcely differ at all from the brutes, and — what is worse — fall into horrid crimes from which the brutes themselves would shrink."
3. "The exhortation addressed by Christ to Judas is not of such a nature that he can be regarded as exciting him to do the action: it is rather the language of one who views the crime with horror and detestation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "After the sop had been given, Satan took such full possession of the traitor, that he is no longer only Judas, but one possessed by Satan."
2. "Judas may now be addressed as ‘doing ‘what he was to do. It was too late to expect any change. Mercy, grace, offered to the last, have been to the last rejected. The sin must be committed now."
3. "Let him be even more active than he is inclined to be; Jesus not only desires to be alone with His true disciples, but He is eager to take that last step which is now at hand; He is ‘straitened’ until His ‘baptism is accomplished’."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

### John Wesley:
