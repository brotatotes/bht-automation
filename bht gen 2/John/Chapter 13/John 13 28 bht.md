# John 13:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples were unaware of the true meaning behind Jesus' words, except for John and Judas. John, who already knew that Judas was the traitor, may have been devastated by the realization that the betrayal was imminent. The rest of the disciples, however, remained oblivious to the nearing act of treachery.
