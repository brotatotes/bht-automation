# John 13:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Some of the disciples had the thought that Jesus was instructing Judas, who had the responsibility of managing their finances, to buy provisions for the upcoming feast, the Passover. This thought suggests that the meal they were currently partaking in was not the Passover itself, but a preliminary meal. Another possibility that crossed their minds was that Jesus wanted Judas to give something to the poor, as Jesus had shown a deep concern for the less fortunate. These different interpretations showcase the disciples' uncertainty and their attempts to understand Jesus' words and actions.
