# John 13:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Judas, aware of Jesus' meaning while the other disciples remained in ignorance, immediately left the company, knowing that if he delayed any longer, he might be thwarted from carrying out his plan. Ignited by Satan's influence, who entered him right after he took the bread, Judas was driven to complete his treacherous act. Even though it was nighttime, Judas was undeterred, embarking on his journey to meet with the chief priests, eventually rejoining the disciples later, although not present during the Lord's Supper.
