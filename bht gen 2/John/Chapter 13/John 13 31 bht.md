## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It was not that the presence of Judas, as some have thought, hindered the great consummation imported by ἐδοξάσθη, but that the work on which he was gone out, was the ACTUAL COMMENCEMENT of that consummation."
2. "The glorifying spoken of here, and in δοξάσει, John 13:32, is not the same. This is the glorifying of God by Christ on earth, in His course of obedience as the Son of Man, which was completed by His death."
3. "ἐν ἑαυτῷ is in God (the Father), not in Christ. ἑαυτῷ reflects back on the subject of the sentence: and ἐν is not 'by means of,' but in, by the resurrection of Him into that glory, which He had indeed before, but now has as the Son of Man, with the risen Manhood."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "These remarkable words plainly imply that up to this moment our Lord had spoken under a painful restraint, the presence of a traitor within the little circle of His holiest fellowship on earth preventing the free and full outpouring of His heart."
2. "Now the restraint is removed, and the embankment which kept in the mighty volume of living waters having broken down, they burst forth in a torrent which only ceases on His leaving the supper room and entering on the next stage of His great work—the scene in the Garden."
3. "And what is very remarkable, in five brief clauses He repeats this word 'glorify' five times, as if to His view a coruscation of glories played at that moment about the Cross."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Now is the Son of man glorified" - The last deed is done that was necessary to secure the death of the Son of man, the glory that shall result to him from that death.
2. "The wonderful success of the gospel, the exaltation of the Messiah, and the public and striking attestation of God to him in the view of the universe."
3. "See the notes at John 12:32."

### Marvin Vincent:
