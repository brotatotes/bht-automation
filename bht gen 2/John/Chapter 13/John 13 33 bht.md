# John 13:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
While Jesus is preparing to depart from his disciples, he explains to them that they are not yet ready to come with him. He refers to their current state, recognizing that they still have more to learn and experience before they can follow him. This understanding aligns with the sentiment expressed in John 7:34, where Jesus similarly notes that his time has not yet come.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "τεκνία here only used by Christ affectingly expresses His not only brotherly, but fatherly love (Isa 9:6) for His own, and at the same time their immature and weak state, now about to be left without Him."
2. "But naturally the two clauses, 'Ye shall seek Me and not find Me, and shall die in your sins,' also spoken to the Jews (ch. John 7:33; Joh 8:21), are here omitted: and by this omission the connexion with Joh 13:34 is supplied; 'Ye shall be left here: but, unlike the Jews, ye shall seek Me and shall find Me, and the way is that of Love, to Me, and to one another (so Stier, ver. 140 ff. edn. 2) forming (Joh 13:35) an united Body, the Church, in which all shall recognize My presence among you as My disciples.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Little children—From the height of His own glory He now descends, with sweet pity, to His 'little children,' all now His own."
2. "Ye shall seek me—feel the want of Me."
3. "But oh in what a different sense!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Little children - An expression of great tenderness, denoting his deep interest in their welfare."
2. "Yet a little while I am with you - He did not conceal the fact that he was soon to leave them. ... A parting scene at death is always one of tenderness; and it is well when, like this, there is the presence of the Savior to break the agony of the parting pang, and to console us with the words of his grace."
3. "So now I say to you - That is, they could not follow him then... He was about to die and return to God, and for a time they must be willing to be separated from him. But he consoled them with the assurance that the separation would be only temporary, and that they should afterward follow him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Little children [τεκνια] . Diminutive, occurring only here in the Gospel, but repeatedly in the First Epistle. Nowhere else in the New Testament." 
2. "Arti marks the point of time as related to the past or to the future. Thus, 'from the days of John the Baptist until now' (arti, Matthew 11:12). 'Thinkest thou that I cannot now [αρτι] pray to my Father?' though succor has been delayed all along till now (Matthew 26:53)." 
3. "Here the word implies that the sorrowful announcement of Jesus' departure from His disciples had been withheld until the present. The time was now come."

### John Calvin:
1. "...he gives them early warning that he will no longer be with them, and, at the same time, exhorts them to patience."
2. "In calling them little children, he shows... the ardor of his love."
3. "...he declares that they cannot follow him, in order that they may endure patiently his temporary absence... only bids them wait patiently, till he bring them, along with himself, into the heavenly kingdom."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For them there is separation from Him, and the thought of its nearness lends more than ordinary tenderness to the words of Jesus."
2. "He calls them ‘little children,’ a term found nowhere in the New Testament, except here and in the First Epistle of John."
3. "The desolate state in which the disciples would thus be left, and, not less than this, the greater responsibility that would then rest upon them to carry out the work of Jesus, prepare the way for the words that follow."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Little children (τεκνια). Diminutive of τεκνα and affectionate address as Jesus turns to the effect of his going on these disciples." 
2. "Yet a little while (ετ μικρον). Accusative of extent of time. See also John 7:33; John 8:21 (to which Jesus here refers); John 16:16-19."
3. "So now I say unto you (κα υμιν λεγω αρτ). This juncture point (αρτ) of time relatively to the past and the future."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ having removed the scandal of his death, by observing, that both he and his Father would be glorified by it, begins more freely to open his mind to his disciples, and acquaint them with it..."
2. "His great affection for them, his consideration of their weakness, and sympathy with them on that account; who were very ill able to bear his departure..."
3. "...though they could not come now, yet they should hereafter, all of them..."

### John Wesley:
1. Ye cannot come — Not yet; being not yet ripe for it. John 7:34.
