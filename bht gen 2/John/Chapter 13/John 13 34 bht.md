# John 13:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, in his parting words to his disciples, gave them a new commandment: to love one another. This commandment was not new in the sense of being completely unheard of, but it was new in the way that Jesus explicitly taught it to them. It was to be a different kind of love than they had experienced before, following Jesus' example of selfless and sacrificial love. They were to love one another not just as they loved themselves, but in the same way that Jesus had loved them.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The καινότης of this commandment consists in its simplicity and (so to speak) unicity."
2. "The same kind of love was prescribed in the O.T.: 'as thyself' is the highest measure of love."
3. "The new commandment differs from the old in being the commandment of the new covenant, the first-fruit of the Spirit in the new dispensation."


### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Christ's love to His people in giving His life a ransom for them was altogether new, and consequently as a Model and Standard for theirs to one another."
2. "It is not, however, something transcending the great moral law, which is 'the old commandment,' but that law in a new and peculiar form."
3. "Hence it is said to be both new and old."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Jew was known by his external rites, by his uniqueness of dress, etc.; the philosopher by some other mark of distinction; the military man by another, etc. In none of these cases had love for each other been the distinguishing and special badge by which they were known."
2. "They were to befriend each other in trials; be careful of each other’s feelings and reputation; deny themselves to promote each other’s welfare."
3. "His love for them was strong, continued, unremitting, and he was now about to show his love for them in death."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "This new commandment embodies the essential principle of the whole law."
2. "The love is to be of the same nature."
3. "I give you a new commandment, that ye love one another, even as up to this moment I loved you, in order that you may imitate my love one toward another."

### John Calvin:
1. "Yet while I am absent from you in body, testify, by mutual love, that I have not taught you in vain; let this be your constant study, your chief meditation."
2. "In order to impress more deeply, therefore, on the minds of his disciples the doctrine of brotherly love, Christ recommends it on the ground of novelty; as if he had said, 'I wish you continually to remember this commandment, as if it had been a law but lately made.'"
3. "In God brotherly love seeks its cause, from him it has its root, and to him it is directed. Thus, in proportion as it perceives any man to be a child of God, it embraces him with the greater warmth and affection."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The new commandment is love, such love as Jesus had Himself exhibited...and this love to one another they would need, that in an evil world they might be to one another sources of strength and comfort."
2. "By 'commandment' is meant not a definite precept, but rather a sphere of life in which the disciples are to walk...and it is this, rather than the character or quality of the love, that makes the commandment 'new.'"
3. "It was the very purpose of the love of Jesus that He might form a community all whose members, born again into His love, might love one another, 'Even as I loved you, that ye also may love one another.' Out of Him is selfishness; in Him, and in Him alone, we love."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The practice of it was new."
2. "Jesus does not hesitate, like the Father, to give commandments."
3. "The measure of our love for another is set by Christ's love for us."

### John Gill:
1. "As parents, when they take their leave of their children, in their dying moments, give them proper instructions and orders, and lay their dying injunctions on them, so Christ taking his leave of his disciples, gives them his; which were, that they love one another."
2. "by keeping and agreeing together, praying one for another, bearing one another's burdens, forbearing and forgiving one another, admonishing each other, and building up one another in faith and holiness"
3. "as Christ has loved his people freely, notwithstanding all their unworthiness and ungratefulness, so should they love one another, though there may be many things in them observable, which are disagreeable"

### John Wesley:
1. "A new commandment — Not new in itself; but new in the school of Christ: for he had never before taught it them expressly."
2. "Likewise new, as to the degree of it, as I have loved you."
