Through the display of genuine love for one another, not only will fellow believers recognize you as disciples of Christ, but even those outside the faith will also bear witness to your identity.

By exemplifying the love of Christ, you demonstrate your commitment to being true disciples, standing in stark contrast to those who harbor hatred and division.
