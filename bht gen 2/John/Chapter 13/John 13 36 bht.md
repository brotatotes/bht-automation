# John 13:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
St. Peter, in his limited understanding, believed that Jesus would go to establish His throne in another part of the earth away from the Jews. However, Jesus responded that Peter could not follow Him at that moment because he did not fully grasp the true nature of Jesus' kingdom. Peter would indeed follow Jesus, but not immediately. It would be in a way that involved sacrifice and would ultimately lead to his own death. Sadly, Peter's initial disbelief came with great consequences.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This announcement of Peter’s denial is probably the same with that in Luke 22:33 ff., where see notes..."
2. "ἀκ. δὲ ὕστ., alluding probably both to the future reception of His Apostle into His glory..."
3. "...and to the particular path by which he should come to that glory; as in ch. John 21:18-19."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Peter said—seeing plainly in these directions how to behave themselves, that He was indeed going from them."
2. "Lord, whither guest thou?—having hardly a glimmer of the real truth."
3. "Jesus answered, . . . thou canst not follow me now, but thou shalt follow me afterwards—How different from what He said to the Jews: 'Whither I go ye cannot come'" (John 8:21).

### John Calvin:
1. "From this it is evident how ignorant Peter was, who, after having been so frequently warned about Christ’s departure, was as greatly perplexed as if he had heard something new."
2. "We are taught by this passage to subject all our desires to God, that they may not go beyond their proper bounds; and if at any time they become extravagant and foolish, let us at least submit to be held in by this bridle."
3. "Now as Christ bears with us, while we are tender and delicate, so let us learn not to reject weak brethren, who are still very far from the goal."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Peter has not been able to apprehend aright the truths of which Jesus has been speaking. We need not wonder at it; and, had he understood them fully, there would have been less necessity either for the instructions that follow or for the discipline of his fall."
2. "Peter must have known his work and done it before he could have properly comprehended the answer, had it been given; for a disciple’s reward stands in such a relation to his work, that without a knowledge of the latter he can have no true knowledge of the former."
3. "Therefore it is that he is told that the time is not come for his following his Lord. He shall follow Him afterwards; follow Him in shame, in humiliation, to the cross, to the life beyond the grave: then shall he know."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Peter is puzzled just as the Pharisees were twice."
2. "Whither goest thou? (που υπαγεισ;)."

### John Gill:
1. "having observed some words which dropped from Christ's lips, 'whither I go ye cannot come', John 13:33; his mind was intent upon them, was uneasy about them, and very much wanted to know the meaning of them."
2. "Jesus answered him, whither I go thou canst not follow me now... he was going to his Father in heaven, to receive gifts for men, and to send the Comforter; to open the way to heaven, take possession of it, and prepare it for his saints; to plead the cause, and transact the business of his dear children; and to receive a kingdom for himself, and return."
3. "thou shall follow me afterwards; when thy time is come, and thou hast done the work allotted for thee, thou shalt follow me by dying for me; and thou shall follow me into my kingdom and glory, and be forever with me."

### John Wesley:
1. "St. Peter seems to have thought, that Christ, being rejected by the Jews, would go to some other part of the earth to erect his throne, where he might reign without disturbance, according to the gross notions he had of Christ's kingdom."
2. "Thou canst not follow me now — But Peter would not believe him. And he did follow him, John 18:15. But it was afar off."
3. "And not without great loss."
