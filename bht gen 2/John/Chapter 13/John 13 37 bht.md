# John 13:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter, in his limited understanding, fails to grasp the deeper meaning behind Jesus' response. He presses further, longing to know why he cannot follow Jesus immediately. His eagerness to be by Jesus' side, even in the face of danger, reveals both his impatience and his overestimation of his own abilities. Peter's determination to lay down his life for Jesus reflects his misguided self-reliance and a lack of awareness of his own weaknesses. In this moment, it becomes apparent that Peter's self-knowledge needs correction, a humbling lesson that will come in due time.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Peter sees that in the words, ‚ÄòThou canst not follow me now,' there lies the meaning that he is not yet morally prepared for following Jesus."
2. "His self-confidence is hurt by the suggestion; and not in devotion only, but in too high an estimate of his own readiness to meet every trial for the sake of the Master whom he loved, he cries out that he is ready to follow Him ‚Äòeven now,' nay, that he is ready to lay down his life for Him."
3. "Such want of self-knowledge must be corrected."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The use of Œ±œÅœÑ (right now, this minute) instead of ŒΩœÖŒΩ (at this time, verse John 13:36) illustrates the impatience of Peter."
2. "Peter, like the rest, had not yet grasped the idea of the death of Christ, but, like Thomas (John 11:16), he is not afraid of danger."
3. "He had heard Christ's words about the good shepherd (John 10:11) and knew that such loyalty was the mark of a good disciple."

### John Gill:

3. "I will lay down my life for thy sake; whatever enemies I should meet with in following thee, would not dismay me; I would readily hazard my life, and cheerfully lay it down in defense of thee."
