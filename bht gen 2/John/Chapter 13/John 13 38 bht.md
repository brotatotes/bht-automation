# John 13:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus confronts Peter's boastful claim, foretelling that he will deny Him three times before the rooster crows. These words carry a solemn significance, as Jesus looks beyond Peter's confident words and challenges him to confront his own weaknesses. The repetition of Peter's own words adds to the weight of Jesus' warning. It is a call for self-reflection, a reminder for all of us not to rely on our own strength but to humbly seek the support and guidance of the Lord in all circumstances.
