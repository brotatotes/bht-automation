# John 13:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, in an act of extraordinary humility and condescension, begins washing the feet of his disciples. This custom of footwashing was not practiced during the Jewish passover or at their regular meals, but rather reserved for the welcoming of strangers and travelers. As the Lord and master, it was the proper role of the disciples to have washed Jesus' feet, yet he reverses the roles and performs this humble act himself. This act symbolizes not only physical cleansing but also the purity of the lives and conduct of the saints and ministers of the Gospel.
