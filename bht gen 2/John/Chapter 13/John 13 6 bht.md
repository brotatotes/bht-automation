# John 13:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter was taken aback and amazed by the offer of Jesus to wash his feet. As the Son of the living God, it seemed beneath Jesus to perform such a humble task for a sinner like Peter. Peter saw this act as a clear contrast to his own sinful nature and felt it was beneath Jesus to lower himself to that level. He struggled to understand why Jesus would perform such a seemingly incongruous act of humility.
