# John 13:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We may not fully understand the significance of what God is doing or why He commands certain things. Just as Peter did not know the full meaning of Jesus washing his feet, we too may be in the dark about God's works and ways. However, we can still trust and obey Him in the present, knowing that in due time, we will come to know and understand more. In our temporary ignorance, let us continue to love and follow Him, knowing that it is enough for now and that greater understanding awaits us in the future.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He emphasizes the ἐγώ and σύ, but so as to set forth Himself as the Master, Peter as the disciple, not wholly cognizant of His will and purpose, and therefore more properly found in subjection to it."
2. "ὃ ἐγὼ ποιῶ, i.e. (1) this washing itself, as a lesson of humility and love, (2) its symbolical meaning, (3) the great Act of Love, the laying aside my glory, and becoming in the form of a servant, that the washing of the Holy Spirit may cleanse men."
3. "μετὰ ταῦτα (1) was known very soon, but (2) and (3) not till after the Spirit was given."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Such condescension does need explanation; it is fitted to astonish."
2. "Though viewed as a general maxim, applicable to all dark sayings in God's Word, and dark doings in God's providence, these words are full of consolation."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was a symbolical action, inculcating a lesson of humility, and intended to teach it to them in such a manner that it would be impossible for them ever to forget it."
2. "And we may remark here that God often does things which we do not fully understand now, but which we may hereafter... We ought also, in view of this, to submit ourselves to him; to hush every murmur, and to believe that he does all things well."
3. "It is one evidence of piety when we are willing to receive affliction at the hand of God, the reason of which we cannot see, content with the belief that we may see it hereafter; or, even if we never do, still having so much confidence in God as to believe that what He does is right."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Thou knowest not" [ουκ οιδας], of absolute and complete knowledge.
2. "Thou shalt learn or perceive" [γνωση], of knowledge gained by experience.
3. "Hereafter" [μετα ταυτα], literally, after these things.

### John Calvin:
1. "We ought simply to obey Christ, even though we should not perceive the reason why he wishes this or that thing to be done."
2. "That man, therefore, is too haughty, who refuses to obey the command of God, because he does not know the reason of it."
3. "We should not take it ill to be ignorant of those things which God wishes to be hidden from us for a time; for this kind of ignorance is more learned than any other kind of knowledge, when we permit God to be wise above us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Great Teacher now takes in hand the task of instructing the warmhearted but impulsive disciple in the true nature of the act performed by Him, and His reference to the future prepares the way for the revelation to be given."
2. "It is in the trying circumstances of the future, in the zealous discharge of the task that shall be his, and in the ripening of Christian experience, that Peter shall 'learn,' shall 'perceive,' the full meaning of what he at present feels to be so incomprehensible."
3. "He will not fully know what it is to have had his own feet washed by Jesus, until he shall have felt the need of constantly turning to Him in faith; and until, in the love ever renewed in the exercise of that faith, he too shall have washed the feet of others."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus repeats the pronouns used by Peter in similar contrast."
2. "Not now. Just now αρτ means."
3. "Thou shalt understand hereafter. 'Thou shalt learn after these things,' even if slowly."

### John Gill:
1. "What I do, thou knowest not now: Peter knew that he was about to wash his feet, but he did not know the meaning and mystery of it."
2. "This may teach us, under dark providences, the meaning of which is not yet known by us, to wait the Lord's own time, to make things clear and plain to us."
3. "In the mean time, patiently submit to the divine will."

### John Wesley:
1. "What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter" - We do not now know perfectly any of his works, either of creation, providence, or grace.
