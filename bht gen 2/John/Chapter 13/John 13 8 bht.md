# John 13:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus's response to Peter's resistance is a stern reminder that without allowing Him to wash us, we cannot truly share in His work and blessings. It is not just a matter of physical washing, but a symbolic representation of being washed by His blood and purified by His Spirit. If we do not submit to His will and receive this cleansing, we forfeit the opportunity to have true fellowship and communion with Him. Our partaking in His kingdom is dependent on our willingness to be washed and purified by Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The same well-meaning but false humility would prevent him (and does prevent many) from stooping to receive at the hands of the Lord that spiritual washing which is absolutely necessary in order to have any part in Him."
2. "If I wash thee not, thou hast no part in Me."
3. "Whoever is washed by Jesus, has part in Him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "But the whole saving work of Christ was one continued series of such services."
3. "It is not humility to refuse what the Lord deigns to do for us, or to deny what He has done, but it is self-willed presumption."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We should yield to all the plain and positive requirements of God, even if we cannot now see how obedience would promote his glory."
2. "If he was not willing to submit his will to that of Christ and implicitly obey him, he had no evidence of piety."
3. "If this was the sense in which Jesus used these words, it denotes that unless Christ should purify Peter, he could have no evidence that he was his disciple."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "Literally, thou shalt by no means wash my feet as long as the world stands."

### John Calvin:
1. "The true wisdom of faith, therefore, is to approve and embrace with reverence whatever proceeds from God, as done with propriety and in good order."
2. "If I wash thee not. This reply of Christ does not yet explain the reason why he resolved to wash the feet of his disciples; only by a comparison drawn from the soul to the body, he shows that, in washing the feet of his disciples, he does nothing that is unusual or inconsistent with his rank."
3. "There is also a general doctrine contained in this statement, that we are all filthy and abominable in the sight of God, until Christ wash away our stains."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "...unless Peter enters into the spirit of that self-sacrificing work of love which Jesus performs, makes that spirit his own spirit, sees the beauty and owns the glory of the Master’s becoming the servant for His people’s sake...then he is going his own way, not the way of Jesus; he is choosing his own portion, not the portion of his Lord..." 
2. "He must be content to separate from One whom he loved with all his heart, and to have no more a part with Him either in His sufferings or His reward."
3. "It is this thought, even though it may be as yet imperfectly apprehended by the apostle, that leads to the sudden revulsion of feeling in the following verse."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Peter's sudden humility should settle the issue, he felt."
2. "Jesus picks up the challenge of Peter whose act amounted to irreverence and want of confidence. 'The first condition of discipleship is self-surrender' (Westcott)."
3. "Jesus does not make foot-washing essential to spiritual fellowship, but simply tests Peter's real pride and mock-humility by this symbol of fellowship."

### John Gill:
1. "In order therefore to bring him to a compliance, Jesus answered him, if I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me; he does not say, if I wash not thy feet, but thee, meaning not with water, but with his blood, and by his Spirit."
2. "Moreover, he does not say, thou hast no part 'in' me, but thou hast no part 'with' me, that is, no fellowship and communion with me."
3. "Hence it may be observed, that unless a man is washed by Christ, he can have no part with him in this, or the other world."

### John Wesley:
1. "If I wash thee not — If thou dost not submit to my will, thou hast no part with me." 
2. "In a more general sense it may mean, If I do not wash thee in my blood, and purify thee by my Spirit, thou canst have no communion with me, nor any share in the blessings of my kingdom."
