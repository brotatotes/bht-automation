## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The warm-hearted Peter...can hardly have enough of a cleansing so precious."
2. "There surely is implied in this answer an incipient apprehension of the meaning of our Lord’s words."
3. "The ἐὰν μὴ νίψω σε has awakened in him, as the Lord’s presence did, a feeling of his own want of cleansing, his entire pollution."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "To be severed from Thee, Lord, is death to me: If that be the meaning of my speech, I tread upon it."
2. "If to be washed of Thee have such significance, then not my feet only, but hands, head, and all, be washed!"
3. "This artless expression of clinging, life-and-death attachment to Jesus, and felt dependence upon Him for his whole spiritual well-being, compared with the similar saying in John 6:68, furnishes such evidence of historic verity such as no thoroughly honest mind can resist."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If to refuse to have his feet washed was to be regarded as evidence that he had no part with Jesus, he was not only willing, but desirous that it should be done; not only anxious that his feet should be cleansed, but his hands and his head - that is, that he should be cleansed entirely, thoroughly."
2. "Perhaps he saw the spiritual meaning of the Saviour, and expressed his ardent wish that his whole soul might be made pure by the work of Christ."
3. "A true Christian is desirous of being cleansed from all sin. He has no reserve. He wishes not merely that one evil propensity should be removed, but all; that every thought should be brought into captivity to the obedience of Christ...and that his whole body, soul, and spirit should be sanctified wholly and be preserved blameless unto the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "When Peter heard that he was ruined, if he did not accept the cleansing which was offered to him by Christ, this necessity proved, at length, to be a sufficient instructor to tame him."
2. "He therefore lays aside opposition and yields, but wishes to be entirely washed, and, indeed, acknowledges that, for his own part, he is altogether covered with pollution."
3. "But here too he goes wrong through thoughtlessness, in treating, as a thing of no value, the benefit which he had already received; for he speaks as if he had not yet obtained any pardon of sins, or any sanctification by the Holy Spirit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Peter sees that in whatever way the result maybe produced, suffering Jesus to wash his feet will bring him nearer to his Master, will make him to be more ‘with Him.’"
2. "The thought of the hands and the head as the uncovered parts of the body naturally occurs to him; and his reasoning is that, if the washing of one part will give him a deeper interest in the Master whom he loved, much more will this be effected by the washing of more parts than one."
3. "To everything he will submit, so that it bring him nearer to Jesus and His reward."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A moment ago he told his Master He was doing too much: now he tells Him He is doing too little" (Dods).

### John Gill:
1. "Which shows the sense he had of the general pollution of his nature, and the need he stood in particularly of having his feet, hands, and head washed both as a minister, and a believer."
2. "By his 'feet' may be meant, either the grace of faith... or the affections of the mind... or the outward life and conversation..."
3. "His 'hands' may design all his actions, works, services, duties, and performances..."
4. "By his 'head' may be meant doctrines and principles imbibed in the mind, and expressed by the lips..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Lord, not my feet only — How fain would man be wiser than God!"
2. "This was well meant, though ignorant earnestness."
