# John 14:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of their distress and sorrow, Jesus consoles his disciples, urging them to have faith and trust in God and himself. He understands the weight of their troubles and reminds them of the unity between him and the Father, encouraging them to believe in him as they have believed in God. Though he will soon depart from them, his words are reliable and will surely come to pass. Just as they have trusted in the promises of God, they should also trust in him, even in his absence.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "A pause has intervened; 'Peter is humbled and silent' (Lücke); the rest are ταρασσόμενοι τῇ καρδίᾳ on account of the sad things of which they had been hearing; Judas’s treachery, Peter’s denial, the Lord’s departure from them." 
2. "πιστεύετε both times is imperative. So Cyr, Nonn., Thl., Euth., Aug, Hil, Lampe, Lücke, De Wette, Stier, Tholuck (edn. 6), and A.V.R. Many...take the first as indic., the second as imper., 'Ye believe in God: believe also in me.' But this is inconsistent with the whole tenour of the discourse, which presupposes a want of belief in God in its full and true sense, as begetting trust in Him."
3. "The command is intimately connected with ch. Joh 13:31-32 faith in the glorification of Christ in the Father, and of the Father in Him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Let not your heart be troubled, c. - What myriads of souls have not these opening words cheered, in deepest gloom, since first they were uttered!"
2. "ye believe in God - absolutely. believe also in me - that is, Have the same trust in Me. What less, and what else, can these words mean?"
3. "But it is no transfer of our trust from its proper Object it is but the concentration of our trust in the Unseen and Impalpable One upon His Own Incarnate Son, by which that trust, instead of the distant, unsteady, and too often cold and scarce real thing it otherwise is, acquires a conscious reality, warmth, and power, which makes all things new."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The discourse in this chapter was delivered, doubtless, while they were sitting at the table partaking of the Lord’s Supper... It is the consolatory part of our religion, where Christ brings to bear on the mind full of anxiety, and perplexity, and care, the tender and inimitably beautiful truths of his gospel."
2. "In the case of the disciples there was much to trouble them... And it is not improbable that they felt that his death would demolish all their schemes, for they had not yet fully learned the doctrine that the Messiah must suffer and die."
3. "Believe in - Put confidence in, rely on for support and consolation."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Generally, the center of our complex being - physical, moral, spiritual, and intellectual."
2. "Strictly, kardia is the immediate organ of yuch, occupying a mediating position between it and pneuma."
3. "The heart is the focus of the religious life... It is the sphere of the operation of grace."

### John Calvin:
1. "Not without good reason does Christ confirm his disciples by so many words, since a contest so arduous and so terrible awaited them; for it was no ordinary temptation, that soon afterwards they would see him hanging on the cross; a spectacle in which nothing was to be seen but ground for the lowest despair."
2. "Thus it is said of believers, that they are not troubled, because, relying on the word of God, though very great difficulties press hard upon them, still they remain steadfast and upright."
3. "It is one of the leading articles of our faith, that our faith ought to be directed to Christ alone, that it may not wander through long windings; and that it ought to be fixed on him, that it may not waver in the midst of temptations."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The dominating thought of all is that of chap. John 13:31, that the time is come when a full revelation is to be made of the ‘glory’ of the Son of man in the Father, and of the Father in Him."
2. "The ‘trouble’ spoken of in the words now before us is not that of mere sorrow; it is rather that which Jesus had Himself experienced (see chap. John 12:27) when the prospect of His sufferings rose immediately before Him."
3. "The foundation of all peace comes first, and the word ‘believe’ must be taken in the same way in both clauses of the statement. To understand it differently in the two would give, either to faith in God or to faith in Jesus, an independent existence inconsistent with the general teaching of this Gospel."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Not here the physical organ of life, but the seat of spiritual life, the centre of feeling and faith, 'the focus of the religious life' as in Matthew 22:37."
2. "Jesus knew what it was to have a 'troubled' heart...where ταρασσω is used of him."
3. "Both may be indicative (ye believe ... and ye believe), both may be imperative (believe ... and believe or believe also), the first may be indicative and the second imperative, the first may be imperative and the second indicative. Probably both are imperatives, 'keep on believing in God and in me.'"

### John Gill:
1. "In the multitude of these thoughts within them, Christ comforts them, bids them be of good heart, and exhorts them to all exercise of faith on God, and on himself, as the best way to be rid of heart troubles, and to have peace."
2. "Put your trust in God, and you will also trust in me, for I am of the same nature and essence with him; I and my Father are one; so that if you believe in one, you must believe in the other."
3. "You have believed in God as faithful and true in all his promises, though you have not seen him; believe in me also, though I am going from you, and shall be absent for a while; this you may be assured of, that whatever I have said shall be accomplished."
