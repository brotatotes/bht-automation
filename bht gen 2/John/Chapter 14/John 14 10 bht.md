# John 14:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus is emphasizing his intimate union with the Father in these words. He is not merely a vessel for the Father's works, but the Father is actually dwelling in him, and they are united in essence, speech, and action. This truth is supported by both Jesus' teachings, which reveal the Father, and his miraculous works, which are evidence of the Father's presence in him. It is a profound and foundational belief in the Christian faith that Jesus and the Father are inseparable, existing in perfect unity and oneness.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The statement is that of one great truth with two sides, each of which has its appropriate proof - the first, in the 'words' of Jesus; the second, in the Father's 'works'." 
2. "The distinction between 'words' and 'works' in this verse thus springs from a point of view wholly different from that which refers the one to the teaching, the other to the miracles, of Jesus; it is connected with the essential qualities of that Son who is the Word, of that God who is the Father."
3. "'The words that I say unto you' are equivalent to 'My words.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:

1. "This surely is, as it must needs be, and ought to be, an article of your faith, 'that I am in the Father', and the Father in me; phrases which are expressive of the sameness of nature in the Father and the Son."
2. "The doctrines which I preach among you are a proof of what I assert, and to them I appeal; for these are not of myself, as man, but the Father that dwelleth in me; and so prove that I am truly God, of the same nature with my Father."
3. "Likewise, the works which I do, as man, I do not of myself; but he doth the works: for so this passage must be understood and supplied, in which Christ proceeds to another argument, taken from his works, proving the Father to be in him, and that he is in the Father."
