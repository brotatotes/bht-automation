# John 14:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believe me, for I am in the Father, and the Father is in me. Take my word as the ultimate truth, as nothing is more certain than this divine union. And if my testimony is not enough, then believe for the sake of the doctrines I have preached, which surpass the teachings of any mere man, delivered with such authority that could only come from God Himself. If still in doubt, believe for the very work's sake, not just the miracles, but the way in which I, in my sovereignty as God, have performed them.
