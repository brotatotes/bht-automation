# John 14:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The promise that believers will do greater works than Jesus is not to be understood as referring to miraculous feats, as the power of the apostles' miracles did not surpass that of Jesus himself. Rather, the term greater works encompasses the wider scope of the apostolic ministry, including their preaching of the Gospel and the conversion of sinners. Jesus assures his disciples that even though he will physically depart from them, his departure is necessary in order to send the Holy Spirit to empower them for this great work.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "It cannot be understood of all his followers, for the circumstances of the promise do not require us to understand it thus, and it has not been a matter of fact that All Christians have possessed power to do greater works than the Lord Jesus."
2. "The most probable meaning of the passage is the following: The word 'greater' cannot refer to the miracles themselves, for the works of the apostles did not exceed those of Jesus in power. No higher exertion of power was put forth, or could be, than raising the dead. But, though not greater in themselves considered, yet they were greater in their effects."
3. "The word 'works' here probably denotes not merely miracles, but all things that the apostles did that made an impression on mankind, including their travels, their labors, their doctrine, etc."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Greater works. Not more remarkable miracles, but referring to the wider work of the apostolic ministry under the dispensation of the Spirit."
2. "This work was of a higher nature than mere bodily cures."
3. "Jesus' personal ministry in the flesh must be a local ministry. Only under the dispensation of the Spirit could it be universal."

### John Calvin:
1. "All that he had hitherto told his disciples about himself, so far as it regarded them, was temporal; and, therefore, if he had not added this clause, the consolation would not have been complete."
2. "This is the reason why Christ not only mentions his present power, which the Apostles, at that time, beheld with their eyes, but promises an uninterrupted conviction of it for the future."
3. "First, we must understand what Christ means; namely, that the power by which he proves himself to be the Son of God, is so far from being confined to his bodily presence, that it must be clearly demonstrated by many and striking proofs, when he is absent."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "By ‘works’ we are obviously to understand something wider than miracles, for the promise is to all believers, and it cannot be said that they in any age have wrought greater miracles than their Lord."
2. "What Jesus speaks of is the general power of the spiritual life, not only as it exists in the breast of the believer, but as it shows itself in all life and action corresponding to its nature."
3. "They are the organs not of a humbled only but of an ascended Lord; and through what He is at the right hand of the Father they shall do ‘greater works’ than He did in the world."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Shall he do also (κακεινος ποιησε). Emphatic pronoun εκεινος, 'that one also.'"
2. "Greater works than these (μειζονα τουτων). Comparative adjective neuter plural from μεγας with ablative case τουτων. Not necessarily greater miracles and not greater spiritual works in quality, but greater in quantity."
3. "Because I go (οτ εγω πορευομαι). Reason for this expansion made possible by the Holy Spirit as Paraclete."

### John Gill:
1. "He assures his disciples, in order to comfort them under the loss of his bodily presence, that they should do the same, and greater works."
2. "The apostles... went about preaching the Gospel... wherever they went."
3. "The conversion of a sinner is a greater work than any of the miracles... for this includes in it all miracles."

### John Wesley:
1. "But the converting one sinner is a greater work than all these."
2. "Because I go to my Father — To send you the Holy Ghost."
