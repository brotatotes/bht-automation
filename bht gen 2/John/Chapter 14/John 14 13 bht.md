# John 14:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Whatever you ask in my name, whether it be for the success of the Gospel, the performance of miracles, or any other blessing, Jesus declares that he himself will do it. This is not only a demonstration of his divine nature, but also his limitless power. The purpose of this is twofold: to bring glory to the Father through the petitions made in the name of the Son, and for the Son himself to seek the good and glory of his people and his heavenly Father.
