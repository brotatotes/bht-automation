# John 14:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus says if ye shall ask anything, it reveals how individuals often approach God despite feeling unworthy. Many people boldly and arrogantly address God, ignorant of His power and goodness in Christ. However, Christ emphasizes the need to pray to the Father in His name, ensuring that we do not seek other intercessors. These words, sometimes seen as a repetition to strengthen the disciples' faith, assure believers that whatever they ask in Jesus' name, in line with God's will and for His glory, will be done for them, both in His presence and absence.
