# John 14:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If you truly love me, your love will be demonstrated through your obedience to my commandments. Love is not just a feeling or profession, but an active response. In order to maintain a relationship with Christ, we must continue to keep his commandments, for they are his alone and he has the authority to issue them. It is through our love and obedience that we show our devotion to him and bring glory to the Father. Therefore, let our faith be accompanied by love and good works, as evidence of our genuine love for Christ.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Do not show your love by grief at my departure merely; or by profession, but by obedience."
2. "The only proper evidence of love to Jesus, for mere profession is no proof of love; but that love for him which leads us to do all his will, to love each other, to deny ourselves, to take up our cross, and to follow him through evil report and through good report, is true attachment."
3. "The disciples of Christ are required to show that they are attached to him supremely by yielding to all his requirements, and by patiently doing his will in the face of ridicule and opposition."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Keep [τηρησατε]. Lay up in your hearts and preserve by careful watching."

### John Calvin:
1. "To correct this fault, he bids them direct their love to another end; and that is, to employ themselves in keeping the commandments which he had given them."
2. "This is undoubtedly a useful doctrine, for of those who think that they love Christ, there are very few who honor him as they ought to do; but, on the contrary, after having performed small and trivial services, they give themselves no farther concern."
3. "The true love of Christ, on the other hand, is regulated by the observation of his doctrine as the only rule."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "An abiding communion between the glorified Redeemer and His disciples on earth has been spoken of as established, a communion, as we have already seen, not to be broken by the ‘going away’ of Jesus to the Father."
2. "The object of the present verse... is to point out the condition by which alone this communion can be preserved and its greatest blessing, the presence of the Advocate, enjoyed love."
3. "This love, too, consists in a loving self-surrender of ourselves to the sole object of glorifying the Father, analogous to the loving self-surrender of Jesus."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "If ye love me... if ye keep on loving me."

3. "...these are peculiarly 'his', as distinct from, though not in opposition to, or to the exclusion of, his Father's commands."
