# John 14:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus promises his disciples that he will intercede for them with the Father, encouraging them to ask for what they need in his name and finding comfort in his advocacy. The connection between the verses in John 14:21 shows that Jesus will ask the Father and the Father will give the disciples another Comforter, an advocate, instructor, and encourager. This Comforter, the Spirit, will remain with the disciples forever, along with all those who believe in Jesus until the end of the world.

### Henry Alford:
1. "ἐρωτήσω 'familiaris petendi modus,' Bengel: rather perhaps, a manner of asking implying actual presence and nearness, and here used of the mediatorial office in Christ’s ascended state."
2. "The etymology of the word requires the latter [advocate] as its strict meaning, and in this strict meaning it satisfies 1 John 2:1, but not so all the places where it is used of the Holy Spirit, nor this verse, where of the Son and Spirit both."
3. "Thus the idea of help and strength is conveyed by it, as well as of consolation. It was this office (comfortari) which Jesus had filled to His disciples while with them: and which the Holy Spirit was to fill even more abundantly on the removal of Jesus from them."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In what way he makes intercession in heaven for his people we do not know...It is as the result of his intercession in heaven that we obtain all our blessings."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Holy Spirit is, therefore, by the word paraklhtov, of which Paraclete is a transcription, represented as our Advocate or Counsel, 'who suggests true reasonings to our minds, and true courses of action for our lives, who convicts our adversary, the world, of wrong, and pleads our cause before God our Father.'" 
2. "It is to be noted that Jesus as well as the Holy Spirit is represented as Paraclete. The Holy Spirit is to be another Paraclete, and this falls in with the statement in the First Epistle, 'we have an advocate with God, even Jesus Christ.'"
3. "Notice the three prepositions used in this verse to describe the Spirit's relation to the believer. With you [μετα], in fellowship; by you [παρα], in His personal presence; in you [εν], as an indwelling personal energy, at the springs of the life."

### John Calvin:
1. "He therefore loses no time in informing them that, though he be absent from them in body, yet he will never allow them to remain destitute of assistance; for he will be present with them by his Spirit."
2. "The word Comforter is here applied both to Christ and to the Spirit, and justly; for it is an office which belongs equally to both of them, to comfort and exhort us, and to guard us by their protection."
3. "The peculiar office of Christ was, to appease the wrath of God by atoning for the sins of the world, to redeem men from death, to procure righteousness and life; and the peculiar office of the Spirit is, to make us partakers not only of Christ himself, but of all his blessings."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word here translated in our English Version ‘Comforter,’ and partially introduced into the English language as ‘Paraclete,’ means properly, One called to stand by us for our help, our Advocate, Helper, Representative. ‘Comforter’ is not its meaning."

3. "For ever (εις τον αιωνα). This the purpose (ινα) in view and thus Jesus is to be with his people here forever."

### John Gill:
1. "Here Christ speaks as Mediator, and promises his disciples, that he would intercede for them with the Father; which is designed as an encouragement to them to ask for what they want, in his name, and to comfort their hearts."
2. "This is no inconsiderable proof of a trinity of persons in the Godhead; here is the Father prayed unto, the Son in human nature praying, and the Holy Ghost the Comforter prayed for."
