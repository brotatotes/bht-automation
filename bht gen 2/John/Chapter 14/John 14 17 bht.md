# John 14:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Spirit of truth is the source of all truth and guides believers into the fullness of truth. The world, consisting of those who are governed by worldly desires and thoughts, cannot receive the Spirit or understand the things of God. However, as disciples of Jesus, we have the privilege of knowing and receiving the Spirit of truth, who not only dwells among us but also within us. Through His presence, He instructs, guides, and comforts us, deepening our understanding of God's truth and empowering us to live faithfully.
