## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The office of the παράκλ . is to connect the disciples with the Father: if therefore they had Him not, they would be fatherless." 
2. "This makes ἔρχομαι, I am coming, plain, as applying to the coming by the Spirit, who is one with Christ; not only the ultimate personal coming, which is but the last step of the ἔρχομαι, nor only the bodily coming again to them and not to the world at the Resurrection, which was but a pledge of His lasting presence in the Spirit."
3. "ἔρχομαι is (as there) the complex of these the great Revisitation, in all its blessed progress. The absence of any connecting particle as γάρ, with ἔρχομαι, arises (Meyer) from the depth of affection in the Lord’s heart."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I will not leave you comfortless—in a bereaved and desolate condition; or (as in Margin) 'orphans.'" 
2. "I will come to you—'I come' or 'am coming' to you; that is, plainly by the Spirit, since it was to make His departure to be no bereavement."

3. "I will come [ερχομαι] . Present tense, I come. See on ver. 3."

### John Calvin:
