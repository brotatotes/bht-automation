# John 14:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The world, unable to see Christ with their physical eyes, will no longer have his bodily presence to behold. However, for those who have the eyes of faith, they will continue to see him. Even though Christ was about to die, he would be raised from the dead, and his life would continue. Believers will also live through him, not only in this earthly life, but in the eternal future, enjoying the ongoing presence and fellowship with the risen Lord.
