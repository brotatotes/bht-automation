# John 14:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In my Father's house, which is heaven, there are numerous dwellings. These mansions serve as a place for the holy angels, the saints who have gone before us, as well as all believers throughout history. It is important to note that the sheer multitude of these dwellings is beyond human comprehension. God's promise to prepare a place for us in His house is a testimony of His faithfulness and love.
