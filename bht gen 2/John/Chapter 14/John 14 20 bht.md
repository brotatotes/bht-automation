# John 14:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the disciples see Jesus after his resurrection, their knowledge and understanding of their unity with him in the Father will be greatly increased. This unity is made possible through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, which is symbolized by the day of Pentecost. Through this spiritual union, the disciples will come to know that Jesus is not absent or distant, but rather in the very presence of the Father. It is through the work of the Spirit that this knowledge is made known, revealing the profound and unbreakable bond between the Son and his followers.
