# John 14:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The one who holds and cherishes the commandments, not only externally, but with a living faith, is the true disciple. Such a disciple demonstrates their love for Christ by obeying his commandments. This love and obedience bring about a reciprocal manifestation of love from the Father and the Son. This manifestation is not a visible appearance, but a spiritual presence and communion with Christ, which is graciously granted to those who love and follow him.
