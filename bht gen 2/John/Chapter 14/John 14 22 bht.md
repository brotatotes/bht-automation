# John 14:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Judas, a different person from the traitor, asked Jesus why he would reveal himself to them and not to the world. This question, asked with amazement and astonishment, shows Judas's ignorance and lack of understanding. He probably thought Jesus was referring to a visible manifestation of himself after death, visible only to the disciples. Judas couldn't comprehend how this could be possible. His question revealed his limited understanding and inability to fathom the great grace and sovereign will of Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Ἰούδας Ἰακώβου of Luke 6:16 ; see note on Matthew 10:2 ff. Meyer remarks that the οὐχ ὁ Ἰσκαριώτης is pragmatically superfluous, after ch. John 13:30, but is added by St. John from his deep horror of the Traitor who bore the same name."
2. "The question seems to be put with the Jewish idea, that the Messiah, the King and Judge of the nations, must necessarily manifest himself to the world."
3. "[καί preceding an interrogation, expresses astonishment at what has just been said, and, assuming it, connects to it a conclusion which appears to refute or cast doubt on it. So Eur. Med. 1388, ὦ τέκνα φίλτατα ! “μητρί γε, σοὶ δʼ οὔ...” κἄπειτʼ ἔκτας? See more examples in Hartung, i. p. 146, and cf. Kühner on Xen. Mem. p. 117.]"
4. "τί γέγ. ὅτι] What has happened, that …? i.e. how is it, that …?"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "A very different Judas from the traitor, and a very different question from any that he would have put."
2. "Indeed [as one in STIER says], we never read of Iscariot that he entered in any way into his Master's words, or ever put a question even of rash curiosity (though it may be he did, but that nothing from him was deemed fit for immortality in the Gospels but his name and treason)."
3. "A most natural and proper question, founded on John 14:19, though interpreters speak against it as Jewish."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Judas saith unto him - This was the same as Lebbeus or Thaddeus. See Matthew 10:3. He was the brother of James, and the author of the Epistle of Jude."
2. "How is it ... - Probably Judas thought that he spake only of his resurrection, and he did not readily see how it could be that he could show himself to them, and not be seen also by others."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He distinguishes the godly Judas, not by his own surname, but by the negation of the other's."
2. "Marking at the same time the traitor as present again after his negotiation with the adversaries, but as having no sympathy with such a question."
3. "Implying that Judas thought that some change had taken place in Jesus' plans."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is not without reason that he asks why Christ does not cause his light to be imparted to more than a few persons; since he is the Sun of Righteousness, by whom the whole world ought to be enlightened."
2. "Certainly he finds all men at first alike, that is, entirely alienated from him; and, therefore, he cannot choose any person who loves him, but he chooses from among his enemies those whose hearts he bends to the love of him."
3. "By these words, Christ shows in what manner the Gospel is properly obeyed. It is when our services and outward actions proceed from the love of Christ; for in vain do the arms, and the feet, and the whole body toil, if the love of God does not reign in the heart, to govern the outward members."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Judas is distinguished from the traitor, that we may have kept distinctly before us that the latter had gone out." 
2. "His error consists in not seeing that the spiritual can only be apprehended by the spiritual."
3. "Filled with the thought of the external kingdom, he cannot understand why the glorious revelation of Christ to be made to himself and his fellow-disciples should not be made to all, so that all may believe and be blessed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "John is anxious to make it clear that this Judas (common name, two apostles also named James) was not the infamous traitor."
2. "Judas caught at the word εμφανιζω in verse John 14:21 as perhaps a Messianic theophany visible to all the world as at the judgment."
3. "He seems to suspect a change of plan on the part of Jesus (τ γεγονεν οτ=how has it happened that)."

### John Gill:
1. "The question put by him, Lord, how is it, τι γεγονεν, which answers to מאי דא, or מאי האי, or מהו, with the Talmudists, 'what is this thou sayest'; what is the meaning of it? how can it be? or what is the reason of it, that thou wilt manifest thyself to us, and not unto the world?" 
2. "The question arises either from ignorance of what Christ was speaking, imagining he meant a spectre, or some apparition of himself after his death, which should be visible to his disciples, and not to others; and how this could be, he wanted to know."
3. "The question is put by him with admiration and astonishment; and as not being able to give, or think of any other reason of such a procedure, but the amazing grace of Christ, his free favour and sovereign will and pleasure."
