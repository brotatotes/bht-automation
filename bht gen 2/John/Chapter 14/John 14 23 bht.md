# John 14:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If you love and obey me, I will reveal myself to you and not to those who do not. God will love you in return, and the more you love and obey, the more His love will abound towards you. There will be a profound manifestation of the Divine presence and love, surpassing the experience of justification. This is a testament to the trinity of persons in the Godhead, with each one of us coming to you and making our abode.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If any one love me, he will keep my word; and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him." The manifestation referred to must be limited, because it can only be made where there is that communion of love which proves itself by the spirit of self-denial and submission to the charge of Jesus.
2. "The climax: no longer 'I' but 'We,' a fuller presentation of the truth."
3. "The beginning of the discourse is taken up again, and thus its parts are more closely united: 'In my Father’s house are many places of abode'; 'We will make our abode with him.'"

1. "By his 'words' are meant not his doctrines, but his ordinances;...which are observed by such who truly love him, and that from a principle of love to him."
2. "And for the encouragement of such persons as before, he says, 'and my Father will love him':...larger measures of grace, more communion with him here, and eternal honour and glory hereafter."
3. "Hence a proof of a plurality of persons in the Godhead, of a trinity of persons, of there being neither more nor fewer than three...and of their distinct personality, or it could not be said with any propriety, 'we' each of us 'will come unto him'."

### John Wesley:
1. "Jesus answered — Because ye love and obey me, and they do not, therefore I will reveal myself to you, and not to them."
2. "My Father will love him — The more any man loves and obeys, the more God will love him."
3. "And we will come to him, and make our abode with him — Which implies such a large manifestation of the Divine presence and love, that the former in justification is as nothing in comparison of it."
