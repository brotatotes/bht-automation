# John 14:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Holy Spirit, referred to as the Advocate, is sent by both the Father and the Son, acting as a personal guide and acting on behalf of believers. The Spirit's role is to teach and explain all things, ensuring that the disciples understand and remember Jesus' teachings. This promise extends to the apostles and their successors, assuring them that the Spirit will reveal all necessary truths for salvation. The Spirit's mission is grounded in the Father's revelation through the Son, and it is through the Spirit's guidance that the authenticity of the Gospel narrative is established.
