# John 14:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ's farewell message to his disciples includes a profound gift - peace. This peace is not the shallow and empty peace that the world offers, but a deep and abiding peace. It is the peace of reconciliation with God and harmony with one's own conscience. This peace is not simply a wish or a greeting, but a tangible reality that Jesus imparts to his followers. Unlike the temporary and unsatisfying peace that the world offers, this peace is lasting and unwavering, bringing a constant and even tranquility to the soul.
