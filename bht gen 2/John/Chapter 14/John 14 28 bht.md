# John 14:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If you truly loved me and believed in my divine nature, you would understand that it is for your benefit that I am going to the Father. My departure will bring about the descent of the Holy Spirit and the preaching of the gospel will be met with great success. Do not be troubled by my leaving, for the Father is greater than I, not in essence but in rank within the Trinity. Let us rejoice in the prospect of my return to the Father, where I will be re-established in the glory of his presence.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "These words, which Arians and Socinians perpetually quote as triumphant evidence against the proper Divinity of Christ, really yield no intelligible sense on their principles."
2. "Does not this strange speech from Christ's lips, then, presuppose such teaching on His part as would make it extremely difficult for them to think He could gain anything by departing to the Father, and make it necessary for Him to say expressly that there was a sense in which He could do so?"
3. "Thus, this startling explanation seems plainly intended to correct such misapprehensions as might arise from the emphatic and reiterated teaching of His proper equality with the Father."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If you had proper love for me; if you had the highest views of my character and work; if you would lay aside your Jewish prejudices, and put entire, implicit confidence in what I say."
2. "You would rejoice in the completion of the plan which requires me to return to heaven, that greater blessings may descend on you by the influences of the Holy Spirit."
3. "The object of this expression is to console the disciples in view of his absence. This he does by saying that if he goes away, the Holy Spirit will descend, and great success will attend the preaching of the gospel."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. I said. Omit, and read, ye would have rejoiced because I go unto the Father.

### John Calvin:
1. "For the Father is greater than I. This passage has been tortured in various ways... Jesus is not making a comparison between his own Divinity and the Father's Divinity, but rather between his present state and the heavenly glory to which he would soon be received."
2. "Christ does not now speak either of his human nature, or of his eternal Divinity, but, accommodating himself to our weakness, places himself between God and us... Christ descended to us, that he might raise us to it."
3. "You wish to detain me in the world, but it is better that I should ascend to heaven... Let us therefore learn to behold Christ humbled in the flesh, so that he may conduct us to the fountain of a blessed immortality."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The ‘going away’ of Jesus is really a ‘going unto the Father,’ a re-establishment in all the glory of the Father’s immediate presence."
2. "The Son, while of the same nature as the Father, is subordinate to Him, inferior economically, as Mediator."
3. "The departure of Jesus to His Father was an arrangement fraught with far higher blessings, both to His believing people and to the world, than His remaining among them would have been."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I go away, and I come" - both futuristic presents.
2. "Ye would have rejoiced" - implying that the disciples are not loving Jesus as they should.
3. "Greater than I" - not a distinction in nature or essence, but in rank in the Trinity.

### John Gill:
1. "Christ assured his disciples that in a little time they should see him again, to their unspeakable joy and comfort."
2. "Had they considered things aright, since it was to his greater advantage to remove, they should rather have discovered a willingness to it, and have rejoiced at it; this would have shown pure love and unbiased affection to him."
3. "They should have rejoiced at his departure... for my Father is greater than I."
