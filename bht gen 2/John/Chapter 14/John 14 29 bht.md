# John 14:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This passage shows the power of Jesus' words, as he accurately predicted his own death, resurrection, and ascension. The fulfillment of these prophecies served as a confirmation of their faith for the disciples. Jesus understood that they may not fully comprehend the depth of his teachings at the time, but he patiently bore with them until these events occurred, which would serve as an interpreter to explain his doctrine. The combination of these events with his teachings is meant to produce faith in us, as we understand and believe in the divine nature of Christ.
