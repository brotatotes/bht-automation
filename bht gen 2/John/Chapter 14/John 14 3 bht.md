# John 14:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus promises to go to the Father to prepare a place for his followers. This preparation is not an abstract concept, but a concrete reality that can be fully assured. He assures his disciples that he will come again, either through death or in person for a second time. The purpose of his departure and return is so that believers can be where he is, in glory, for eternity.
