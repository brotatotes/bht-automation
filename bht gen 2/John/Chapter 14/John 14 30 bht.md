# John 14:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The prince of this world is coming, ready to make his grand assault, warns Jesus, indicating the powerful adversary he is about to face. Yet, the devil has no foothold in Jesus, as there is no guilt or corruption within him. Christ's purity is unmatched, for though He bore the weight of sin, He himself was sinless. He had more to say to His disciples, but the approach of the adversary would cut short His words at John 14:31.
