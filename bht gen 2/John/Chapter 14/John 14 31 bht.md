# John 14:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus willingly submitted to the assault of the prince of this world, not because Satan had any hold on him, but because it was part of the Father's plan for him to offer himself as a ransom for many. Through his voluntary obedience, Jesus sought to demonstrate his deep love and devotion to the Father, showing the world the extent of his commitment. And so, with a sense of purpose and urgency, Jesus urged his disciples to arise and follow him as they entered the city for the Passover.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But my Death is an act of voluntary obedience, that it may be known that I love and obey the Father that the glory of the Father in and by Me may be manifested."
2. "We may nonetheless safely believe that the ἐγ . ἄγ . ἐντ ., without this connexion, does undoubtedly express the holy boldness of the Lord in going to meet that which was to come upon Him, and is for that reason inserted by St. John."
3. "The place is clearly the same, see ch. John 18:1, ταῦτα εἰπὼν ὁ Ἰησοῦς ἐξῆλθεν: besides which, we can hardly suppose (Grot., &c.) discourses of a character like those in ch. 15, 16 to have been delivered to as many as eleven persons, while walking by the way, and in a time of such publicity as that of the Paschal Feast."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But to the Prince of the world, though he has nothing in Me, I shall yield Myself up even unto death, that the world may know that I love and obey the Father, whose commandment it is that I give My life a ransom for many."
2. "Arise, let us go hence... We think it was the dictate of that saying of earlier date, 'I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!'—a spontaneous and irrepressible expression of the deep eagerness of His spirit to get into the conflict."
3. "[This] disciple, whose pen was dipped in a love to his Master... would record this little outburst of the Lamb hastening to the slaughter, in the very midst of His lofty discourse."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "In all things he obeyed; and he showed that, in the face of calamities, persecutions, and temptations, he was still disposed to obey his Father. This he did that the world might know that he loved the Father."
3. "Jesus, with a little band, was himself about to die, and he went forth in the stillness of the night, counseling his little company in regard to their duties and dangers, and invoking the protection and blessing of God his Father to attend, to sanctify, and guide them in the arduous labors, the toils, and the persecutions they were yet to endure."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "But that the world may know, etc. The connection in this verse is much disputed."
2. "The phrase ajll' ina, but in order that, with an ellipsis, is common in John."
3. "Assuming that the figure of the vine was suggested by some external object, that object is explained according to the different views of the scene of the discourses."

### John Calvin:
1. "What chiefly deserves our attention is, that the decree of God is here placed in the highest rank; that we may not suppose that Christ was dragged to death by the violence of Satan, in such a manner that anything happened contrary to the purpose of God."
2. "Christ, therefore, does not resist Satan, in order that he may obey the decree of his Father, and may thus offer his obedience as the ransom of our righteousness."
3. "Christ intended to exhort the disciples to render the same obedience to God, of which they beheld in him so illustrious an example."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The true interpretation seems to be that there is an absolute barrier between the ‘prince of this world’ and Jesus. Neither in the Person (in whom is no sin) nor in the work of the Redeemer has he any interest; there is absolutely no point of connection (the expression of the original is strong) between him and these."
2. "The words in short express, although far more pointedly than elsewhere, the great truth so often stated in Scripture, that those who reject the salvation shall meet the judgment of Jesus, and that, when they meet it, they shall acknowledge that it is just."
3. "The possibility of the individual’s passing from the power of the world into the blessed region of faith in Jesus is always presupposed. The description applies to the world as it hardens itself in impenitence against its rightful Lord, and rushes on its fate."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "But that the world may know."
2. "Arise, let us go hence."
3. "the rest of the talk (chs. 15 and 16) and prayer (ch. 17) was in the shadows on the way to Gethsemane."

### John Gill:
1. "Not the wicked and unbelieving world, but the world of God's elect, such as are brought to believe in Christ."
2. "Christ must needs love the Father, as being of the same nature and essence with him, and as standing in the relation of a son to him."
3. "He loved all that the Father loves, and approved of all his purposes, counsels, and determinations, concerning himself and the salvation of his people."

### John Wesley:
1. "But I suffer him thus to assault me, because it is the Father's commission to me" (Commentary).
2. "To convince the world of my love to the Father, in being obedient unto death" (Commentary).
