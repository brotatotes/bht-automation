# John 14:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Thomas represents a doubting mindset, as he speaks on behalf of the apostles who lack understanding and disbelief. He fails to grasp the truth that Jesus had just revealed about going to prepare a place for them in his Father's house. Consequently, Thomas questions not only the destination but also the path to reach it, highlighting his lack of knowledge. Thomas's limited understanding symbolizes a materialistic conception that persists both then and now.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Thomas is slow of belief and apprehension."
2. "The answer to ποῦ ὑπάγεις; ch. John 13:37, which Peter seems to have apprehended, was not sufficient for him."
3. "ᾤετο γάρ, says Euthym, αἰσθητὸν εἶναί τινα τόπον ὅπου ὑπάγει, καὶ ὁδὸν ὁμοίως τοιαύτην."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They entertained the common notions of a temporal kingdom; they supposed still that he was to be an earthly prince and leader, and they did not comprehend the reason why he should die."
2. "All this shows the difficulty of believing when the mind is full of prejudice and of contrary opinions."
3. "If Thomas had laid aside his previous opinions - had he been willing to receive the truth as Jesus plainly spoke it, there would have been no difficulty."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The best texts substitute oidamen, know we, for dunameqa, can we; reading, how know we the way." 
2. "So Rev. Some also omit and before how."

### John Calvin:
1. "The knowledge possessed by the saints is sometimes confused, because they do not understand the manner or the reason of those things which are certain, and which have been explained to them."
2. "When the Apostles believed that Christ was departing to the Father, and yet did not know in what way he would obtain the kingdom, Thomas justly replies, that they do not know whither he is going."

1. "Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest away: how do we know the way?"
2. "In John 14:4, Jesus had spoken of ‘going away,’ not of ‘going,’ as in John 14:3. The idea of separation is thus again brought prominently forward, and Thomas is overborne by the thought of it (comp. chap. John 11:16)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "We know not whither thou goest; though he had but just told them of his Father's house, and of his going to prepare a place for them."
3. "And how can we know the way? for if we do not know the place, it is not reasonable to think we should know the way to it."

### John Wesley:
