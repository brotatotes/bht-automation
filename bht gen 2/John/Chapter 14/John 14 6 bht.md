# John 14:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus declares himself to be the way, the truth, and the life. He is not just a way for his followers to connect with God, but the very way itself. By obeying his teachings and relying on his merits, we have access to God. Christ embodies the knowledge and purity of God, and his teachings reveal the truths of the eternal world. In him alone can we find true life, as he is the source and giver of life, the only way to come to the living Father. Without him, there is no going, no knowing, and no living.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He is THE WAY; not merely the Forerunner; which would imply on our part only an outward connexion with Him as His followers: but the way, in and on which we must go, having an inner union with and in Him."
2. "Christ is THE TRUTH, in Whom only that Knowledge of Him is gained, which is eternal life."
3. "ἡ ζωή not merely because οὐδὲ ὁ θάνατος διαστήσει ὑμᾶς ἐμοῦ, but as being THE LIFE of all His, in Whom only they who live can come to the living Father."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "By this is meant, doubtless, that they and all others were to have access to God only by obeying the instructions, imitating the example, and depending on the merits of the Lord Jesus Christ."
2. "The life, the purity, and the teaching of Jesus Christ was the most complete and perfect representation of the things of the eternal world that has been or can be presented to man."
3. "No man can obtain any of these things except by the merits of the Lord Jesus Christ. By coming by him is meant coming in his name and depending on his merits."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Therefore, with loving condescension the figure is taken up, and they are assured that He is Himself, if we may so speak, this distance to be traversed."
2. "He embodies what men ought to know and believe of God; what they should do as children of God, and what they should be."
3. "Without the way there is no going; without the truth there is no knowing; without the life there is no living."

### John Calvin:
1. "The statement amounts to this, that whoever obtains Christ is ill want of nothing; and, therefore, that whoever is not satisfied with Christ alone, strives after something beyond absolute perfection."
2. "He declares, that we ought not to seek it anywhere else, and, at the same time, reminds us, that he is the way, by which alone we can arrive at it."
3. "For Christ proves that he is the life, because God, with whom is the fountain of life, (Psalms 36:9,) cannot be enjoyed in any other way than in Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no one cometh unto the Father but through me." - The three terms here used must not be taken as expressing three independent thoughts...It is evident, both from what precedes and from what follows, that the emphasis is on ‘way,’ and that the two other terms are in some sense additional and explicative.
2. "The Father is ‘the truth,’ ‘the life:’ Jesus is the revelation of these to men: because He is so He is ‘the way;’ and because He only is so, He is the only way to the Father."
3. "In the present ‘way’ we have present ‘truth’ and present ‘life;’ and each fresh appropriation of the truth deepens that communion by which the life is conditioned."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Either of these statements is profound enough to stagger any one, but here all three together overwhelm Thomas."
2. "He is the way to God and the only way, the personification of truth, the centre of life."
3. "There is no use for the Christian to wince at these words of Jesus. If he is really the Incarnate Son of God, they are necessarily true."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ is not merely the way, as he goes before his people as an example; or merely as a prophet, pointing out unto them by his doctrine the way of salvation; but he is the way of salvation itself by his obedience and sacrifice."
2. "He is the way to all the blessings of the covenant of grace; and he is the right way into a Gospel church state here; no one comes rightly into a church of Christ but by faith in him; and he is the way to heaven."
3. "Christ is the author and giver of life, natural, spiritual, and eternal; or he is the way of life, or 'the living way'; in opposition to the law, which was so far from being the way of life, that it was the ministration of condemnation and death."

### John Wesley:
1. "To the question concerning the way, he answers, I am the way."
2. "To the question concerning knowledge, he answers, I am the truth."
3. "To the question whither, I am the life."
