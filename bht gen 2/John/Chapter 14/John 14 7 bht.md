# John 14:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Ignorance is no excuse. The disciples had to know that by knowing Christ, they also knew the Father. It is through this knowledge that eternal life is granted. Their initial understanding may have been limited, but they were on a journey of growing in their knowledge of the Father and the Son. The key is to acknowledge the Father in all that Christ has done, recognizing the Father's presence and works through the Son.
