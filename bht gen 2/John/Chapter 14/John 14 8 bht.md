# John 14:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Philip's request, Show us the Father, reveals his desire for a physical manifestation of God, similar to what Moses and the elders of Israel experienced at Mount Sinai. However, Jesus had already explained that seeing Him was equivalent to seeing the Father. Philip's response indicates that if they were to truly understand this, they would no longer be troubled by doubts or questions about God's heavenly dwelling and their own path to it. Ultimately, Jesus' presence alone should have been enough to satisfy their longing for the Father.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
