# John 14:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After spending so much time with Jesus, Philip should have known him better. Jesus gently reminds Philip of this, asking if he still does not recognize him. It is astonishing that after witnessing the miracles and hearing the teachings of Jesus, Philip would still question his divinity. Jesus assures Philip that seeing him is equivalent to seeing the Father, as the same divine perfections are manifested in both.
