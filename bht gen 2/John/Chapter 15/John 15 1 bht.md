# John 15:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ is the true vine, representing the genuine Messianic vine. In contrast to the wild and unfruitful plant, Christ is the noble vine, the most excellent of vines, embodying the vine of truth. The comparison to a vine was common in Palestine, and the Jewish church saw the Messiah as a vine as well. God, serving as the husbandman, planted the vine of Christ's human nature and filled it with the graces of the Spirit, demonstrating His care for the branches.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Vine and branches stand in a much nearer connexion than the Shepherd and the sheep, or the lord of the vineyard and the vines; and answer to the Head and members in Ephesians 5:23; Ephesians 5:30; Colossians 2:19, linked together by a common organization, and informed by one and the same life."
2. "ἡ ἀληθινή, not only, ‘by which prophecy is fulfilled:’ not only, 'in which the organism and qualities of the vine are most nobly realized,' but as in ch. John 1:9, true, i.e. original, archetypal."
3. "ὁ γεωργός, not only the tiller of the land, but the vine-planter and dresser; He who has originated the relation between the vine and branches by planting the Vine in this earth (the nature of man), and who looks for and ensures the bringing forth of fruit."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The spiritual oneness of Christ and His people, and His relation to them as the Source of all their spiritual life and fruitfulness, are here beautifully set forth by a figure familiar to Jewish ears."
2. "I am the true vine—of whom the vine of nature is but a shadow."
3. "My Father is the husbandman—the great Proprietor of the vineyard, the Lord of the spiritual kingdom." (It is surely unnecessary to point out the claim to supreme divinity involved in this).

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The point of the comparison or the meaning of the figure is this: A vine yields proper juice and nourishment to all the branches, whether these are large or small. All the nourishment of each branch and tendril passes through the main stalk, or the vine, that springs from the earth. So Jesus is the source of all real strength and grace to his disciples."
2. "He is their leader and teacher, and imparts to them, as they need, grace and strength to bear the fruits of holiness."
3. "The figure means that God gave, or appointed his Son to be, the source of blessings to man; that all grace descends through him; and that God takes care of all the branches of this vine - that is, of all who are by faith united to the Lord Jesus Christ."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "[η αμπελος η αληθινη]...True, genuine, answering to the perfect ideal."
2. "The vine was a symbol of the ancient church...Hosea 10:1; Matthew 21:33; Luke 13:6."
3. "The office of the vine - dresser is a subordinate one...while gewrgov may indicate the proprietor...The gewrgoi represent the chiefs and leaders of the Jews."

### John Calvin:
1. "The general meaning of this comparison is, that we are, by nature, barren and dry, except in so far as we have been engrafted into Christ, and draw from him a power which is new, and which does not proceed from ourselves."
2. "Hence it follows, that the nature of man is unfruitful and destitute of everything good; because no man has the nature of a vine, till he be implanted in him. But this is given to the elect alone by special grace."
3. "When he calls himself the true vine the meaning is, I am truly the vine, and therefore men toil to no purpose in seeking strength anywhere else, for from none will useful fruit proceed but from the branches which shall be produced by me."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Jesus, therefore, is here the ‘true vine,’ because He is the true Israel of God, in whom is fulfilled all that is demanded of the true vine..."
2. "He is not merely the stem: He is ‘the vine,’ including in Himself all its parts."
3. "That Theocracy had been no more than a shadow of the true; now the ‘true’ was come, and God Himself had planted it."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus is the genuine Messianic vine."
2. "The vine was common in Palestine."
3. "The husbandman, as in Mark 12:1; James 5:7; 2 Timothy 2:6, cf. 1 Corinthians 3:9, God's field."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ is the 'true' vine; not that he is really and literally so, without a figure; but he is, as the Syriac renders it, נפתא דשררא, 'the vine of truth'...Christ is the noble vine, the most excellent of vines, wholly a right seed, in opposition to, and distinction from, the wild and unfruitful, or degenerate plant of a strange vine."
2. "The Jewish church is often compared to a vine, but the Messiah too, according to them...The Cabalistic doctors say that the Shekinah is called, גפן, 'a vine'...where the Jews observe, the King Messiah is so called."
3. "[God] was the husbandman to him; he planted the vine of his human nature, and filled it with all the graces of the Spirit...The concern this husbandman has with the branches, is expressed in the following verse."
