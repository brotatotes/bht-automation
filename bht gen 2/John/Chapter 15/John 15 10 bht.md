# John 15:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Keeping the commandments of Christ is not the cause of His love towards us, but rather the effect of His love. By faithfully observing His commandments, we show our love for Him and continue in our affection towards Him. This is the way prescribed to us, the way of simple obedience to His will, which He Himself followed to the will of the Father. In doing so, we remain in His love, experiencing the continued manifestations of His love and the joy that comes with abiding in Him.
