# John 15:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As believers, we have the privilege of experiencing the joy of Christ Himself. This joy is not temporary or fleeting, but it remains and continues within us. It is a joy that finds its source in the love that Christ has for the Father, and it is a joy that is cultivated as we obediently follow His commandments. This joy is not limited to our present circumstances but extends to all aspects of our lives, even in the midst of trials. Ultimately, this joy will be fully realized in the glory of eternity.
