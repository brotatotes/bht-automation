# John 15:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By loving one another, you fulfill the principal commandment of Christ, demonstrating mutual love as the essence of Christianity. This commandment is not simply about keeping a rigid code or following legalistic rules, but about sincerely and selflessly loving one another as Christ loved us. He set the example of love through His self-sacrifice, and it is through imitating His love that we experience fullness of joy.

1. "Christ had been before speaking of his commandments; and he mentions this as the principal one, and to which all the rest may be reduced; for as the precepts of the second table of the moral law may be briefly comprehended in this one duty, love to our neighbour, so all the duties of Christianity, relative to one another, are reducible to this, by love to serve each other."
2. "This was the commandment which lay uppermost on Christ's heart, and which he knew, if attended to, the rest could not fail of being observed."
