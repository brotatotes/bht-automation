### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Greater love hath no man than this, that [ŒπŒΩŒ±]. Some of the more subtle phases of John's thought cannot be apprehended without a careful study of this often-recurring conjunction."
2. "Hence that, as representing ina, is to be taken in the sense of to the end or intent that; in order that. Here the use of the word is very subtle and suggestive, as well as beautiful."

2. "God might have redeemed us by a single word, or by a mere act of his will, if he had not thought it better to do otherwise for our own benefit, that, by not sparing his own well-beloved Son, he might testify in his person how much he cares for our salvation."

3. "He laid down his life for his enemies, without any sinister selfish views, and that freely and voluntarily; whereas among men, when one man has laid down his life for others, either they have been very deserving, or he has been forced to it, or it has been done with the view of popular applause and vain glory."

### John Wesley:
1. Greater love ‚Äî To his friends. He here speaks of them only.
