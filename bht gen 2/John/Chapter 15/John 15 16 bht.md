# John 15:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus humbly reminds His chosen apostles that it was not they who had chosen Him, but rather He who had chosen them. This truth highlights the pure and undeserved nature of His love for them. He appointed them to go and bear lasting fruit, not only for the growth of the Church but also for their own spiritual growth. This calling to bear fruit is a greater purpose that brings glory to God. By remaining connected to Him and abiding in His love, their fruitfulness will be a testimony that endures.

### Albert Barnes:

### John Calvin:
1. "He declares still more clearly that it must not be ascribed to their own merit, but to his grace, that they have arrived at so great an honor."
2. "The apostleship was not a place of honor without toil, but they had to contend with very great difficulties; and therefore Christ encourages them not to shrink from labors, and annoyances, and dangers."
3. "That the apostles may not be discouraged, Christ meets them with the most valuable aid; as if he had said, 'If the work assigned to you be so great that you are unable to fulfill the duties of your office, my Father will not forsake you; for I have appointed you to be ministers of the Gospel on this condition, that my Father will have his hand stretched out to assist you, whenever you pray to him, in my name, to grant you assistance.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He had 'chosen' them a choice having here nothing to do with eternal predestination, but only with choosing them out of the world after they were in it."

This is added, to encourage their perseverance in the work he chose and called them to, which would be attended with many difficulties and discouragements; wherefore as they would stand in need of divine assistance, they might assure themselves of it."
