# John 15:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The purpose of Jesus teaching his disciples about the vine and branches, his sacrificial love for them, and his choice to send them out was to foster a deep sense of brotherly love among them. Jesus emphasized this message multiple times, underscoring the significance of their love for one another. Truly, there is nothing that strengthens the bond of love among believers more than the realization of their shared stake in the unchanging love of the Lord. May this understanding inspire us to love one another fervently and selflessly.
