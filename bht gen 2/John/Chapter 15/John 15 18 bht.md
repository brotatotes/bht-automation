# John 15:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Seeing the world hate them, the apostles could anticipate more opposition in the absence of their Master. They were well aware that Jesus had experienced hatred before they did, as he appealed to his disciples regarding the treatment he received from the unbelieving world. Furthermore, the phrase before you can be understood as meaning the first or chief of you, pointing to the preeminence and superiority of Christ as their Lord and head.
