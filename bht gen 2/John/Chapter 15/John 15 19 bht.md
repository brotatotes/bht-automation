# John 15:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The reason why the world opposes and hates believers is because they have been separated from it and are now influenced by different principles. As Christians, they are no longer a part of the world, but are born of a new and higher birth. Their very existence is a reproach to the sinful world, and the world hates them for bearing witness to its evil works. The world loves its own, but because believers are not of the world, the world hates them. This has been the case throughout history, as Christians stand apart from the world and its ways.
