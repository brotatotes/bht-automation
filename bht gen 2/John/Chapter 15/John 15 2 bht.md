# John 15:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Every branch that is not fruitful will be cut off from the vine. There are those who may seem to be connected to Christ, but lack a true, spiritual union with Him. They will be taken away and their apparent fruit will wither. To ensure the fruitfulness and purity of the branches, God cleanses and purges His children through various means, including afflictions. This process of purification is gradual and aims to produce genuine, lasting fruit. It is through obedience to God's truth that believers bear fruit and experience increased holiness, preparing them for greater service in His kingdom.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Vine is the visible Church here, of which Christ is the inclusive Head: the Vine contains the branches; hence the unfruitful, as well as the fruitful, are ἐν ἐμοί." 
2. "Every such unfruitful branch the Father αἴρει, pulls off and casts away: and every one that beareth fruit He καθαίρει, prunes, by cleansing it of its worthless parts, and shortening its rank growth, that it may ripen and enlarge its fruit better."
3. "The two, πᾶν κλ., καὶ πᾶν., are pendent nominatives, a construction usual with John in connexion with πᾶν."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "As in a fruit tree, some branches may be fruitful, others quite barren, according as there is a vital connection between the branch and the stock, or no vital connection."
2. "The disciples of Christ may be spiritually fruitful or the reverse, according as they are vitally and spiritually connected with Christ, or but externally and mechanically attached to Him."
3. "The fruitful He 'purgeth' (cleanseth), stripping it, as the husbandman does, of what is rank, 'that it may bring forth more fruit'; a process often painful, but no less needful and beneficial than in the natural husbandry."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is a union formed by believing on him; resulting from our feeling our dependence on him and our need of him; from embracing him as our Saviour, Redeemer, and Friend."
2. "He here refers to such cases as that of Judas, the apostatizing disciples, and all false and merely nominal Christians."
3. "God purifies all true Christians so that they may be more useful. He takes away that which hindered their usefulness; teaches them; quickens them; revives them; makes them more pure in motive and in life."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Branch [κλημα] . Occurring only in this chapter. Both this and kladov, branch (see on Matthew 24:32; Mark 11:8) are derived from klaw, to break. The word emphasizes the ideas of tenderness and flexibility."
2. "Purgeth [καθαιρει] . Cleanseth, Rev."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ intends by these words to awaken anxious inquiry, by declaring that all the branches which shall be unfruitful will be cut off from the vine."
2. "But here comes a question. Can anyone who is engrafted into Christ be without fruit? I answer, many are supposed to be in the vine, according to the opinion of men, who actually have no root in the vine."
3. "By these words, he shows that believers need incessant culture that they may be prevented from degenerating; and that they produce nothing good, unless God continually apply his hand."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Any branch of the vine that is found, and as soon as it is found, to be not fruit-bearing is cut off... They are branches of the vine; but, as only outward and carnal not inward and spiritual, they are taken away."
2. "The object of the Father is the inward, spiritual, cleansing of His children... The means are afflictions, not of any kind but for the sake of Jesus... The attaining of this perfection is, however, a gradual process."
3. "It is possible that the 'fruit' to be borne may include all Christian graces, although it would seem as if the general growth of the Christian life were rather set forth in the growth and strengthening of the 'branch'."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Branch (κλημα). Old word from κλαω, to break, common in LXX for offshoots of the vine, in N.T. only here (verses John 15:2-6), elsewhere in N.T. κλαδος (Mark 4:32, etc.), also from κλαω, both words meaning tender and easily broken parts."
2. "In me (εν εμο). Two kinds of connexion with Christ as the vine (the merely cosmic which bears no fruit, the spiritual and vital which bears fruit)."
3. "Cleanseth (καθαιρε). Present active indicative of old verb καθαιρω (clean) as in verse John 15:3, only use in N.T., common in the inscriptions for ceremonial cleansing, though καθαριζω is more frequent (Hebrews 10:2)."

### John Gill:
1. "There are two sorts of branches in Christ the vine; the one sort are such who have only an historical faith in him, believe but for a time, and are removed."
2. "These branches are unfruitful ones; what fruit they seemed to have, withers away, and proves not to be genuine fruit."
3. "These different acts of the vinedresser 'taking away' some branches, and 'purging' others, are expressed by the Misnic doctors by פיסולה, and זירודה."

### John Wesley:
1. "Every one that beareth fruit, he purifieth — by obeying the truth."
2. "Purity and fruitfulness help each other."
3. "For this is one of the noblest rewards God can bestow on former acts of obedience, to make us yet more holy, and fit for farther and more eminent service."
