# John 15:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For their encouragement in the face of opposition, Jesus reminds his disciples of a saying he had previously spoken. This serves to encourage them to endure patiently the hatred, insults, and mistreatment they would face from the world on account of their association with him. Jesus emphasizes their role as servants and followers of their Lord and Master, which means they should expect no better treatment from people than he himself received.
