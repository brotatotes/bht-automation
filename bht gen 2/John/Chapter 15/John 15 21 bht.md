# John 15:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The world's hostility towards believers is not because of any wrongdoing on their part, but because they are followers of Christ. By professing and confessing his name, they are seen as a threat to the prevailing ignorance and opposition to God. The hatred and persecution directed towards them stem from the world's lack of knowledge and understanding of the Father who sent Jesus. Throughout history, those who do not know God have always harbored animosity towards those who do.
