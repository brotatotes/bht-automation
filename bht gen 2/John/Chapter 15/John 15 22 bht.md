# John 15:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jews are held accountable for their sin because Jesus had come and preached to them, leaving them no excuse for their rejection of him. Their sin of rejecting and hating Jesus and his message carries far greater weight than any previous sins they may have committed. This rejection of the Son of God is a grave offense, and their guilt is heightened by the clear evidence and opportunity they had to believe in him. The rejection of the truth when it is presented and intentionally fought against is a sin that cannot be concealed or excused.

2. "The sin of hatred to Him and His, which might have been excused otherwise, but now that He had come and discoursed with them, had no excuse."
3. "ἀποστερεῖ τοὺς Ἰουδαίους πάσης συγγνώμης ἐθελοκακοῦντας." (Note: Euthymius Zigabenus, 1116)

### John Calvin:
1. "He replies, that he has performed the duty of a good and faithful Teacher, but without success, because their malice would not suffer them to acquire soundness of mind."
2. "In the person of those men he intended to strike terror into all who reject the truth of God, when it is offered to them, or intentionally fight against it, when it is known."
3. "But the whole of that reasoning is inapplicable to the present passage; for the words 'in is' not taken in a general sense, but as related to the subject which is now under consideration; as if Christ had said, that their ignorance is utterly inexcusable, because in his person they maliciously rejected God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If I had not come and spoken unto them, they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin."
