# John 15:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The world's hatred towards the followers of Christ is, in fact, directed towards Christ Himself and even to God the Father. Those who reject Christ dishonor God and thereby harbor enmity towards Him. This hatred is rooted in the natural enmity that resides in the hearts of the unregenerate. However, believers can find solace in knowing that it is not they who suffer but rather those who reject Christ and, in turn, reject God. Hatred towards Christ is a manifestation of unbelief and an indication of one's rejection of God.
