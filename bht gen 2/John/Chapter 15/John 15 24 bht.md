# John 15:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The works that Jesus performed were not only miracles, but also clear proofs of his deity and his role as the true Messiah. These miracles surpassed those done by Moses and the prophets, making Jesus more eminent in his authority and power. The enemies of Jesus, in their obstinacy and hatred, refused to acknowledge the divine nature evidenced by his works and the testimony of the Father. Through his words and works, Jesus left the world without excuse, leaving them with no escape from the rejection of his divine glory.
