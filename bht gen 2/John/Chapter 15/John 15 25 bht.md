# John 15:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Their hatred towards the Messiah, as stated in Psalm 69:4, was not an accidental hindrance, but a prediction fulfilled. Just as David's enemies persecuted him, the Jews displayed the same enmity towards Jesus. This animosity, though unjustified, served a mysterious purpose of God. Christians are called to bear patiently this unwarranted hostility aimed at Christ and his followers. It is vital to recognize that this unwarranted hatred is not limited to Jesus, but extends to his people and even reaches the Father. Thus, believers must endure these hardships with steadfastness and trust in divine providence.
