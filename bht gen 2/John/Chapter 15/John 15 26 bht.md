## BHT:
The assurance of Christ's testimony, even in the face of rejection and hatred by the world, continues through the work of the Spirit of Truth. This Spirit overcomes the resistance of the world, testifying to the truth of Christ's deity, incarnation, Messiahship, and redemptive work. The Spirit's testimony brings joy and comfort to believers, upholding them amidst persecution and hostility. The sending and procession of the Spirit from the Father and the Son establish his divine nature, distinguishing him as a separate person and affirming his role as the Spirit of Truth.

3. "Thus he [the Holy Spirit] testified of Christ, against the blaspheming Jews, and persecuting Gentiles, to the reproof and confusion of them; and he testified of him to the apostles, and all true believers, to their great joy and comfort, and to the support of them, under all the malice and hatred of the world."
