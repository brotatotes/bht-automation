# John 15:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
You shall also bear witness, for you have been eyewitnesses, ministers of the word, constantly attending upon him. As witnesses of his sufferings, death, resurrection, and ascension, you are qualified to share the evidences of his person, doctrines, and works. It is through your testimony that the Spirit will be diffused and the world will be urged to recognize the Lord Jesus as the Messiah. Do not underestimate the importance of this witness, for it is through this union of faith and proclamation that true belief is formed and sustained.
