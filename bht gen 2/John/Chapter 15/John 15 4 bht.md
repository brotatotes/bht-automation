# John 15:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The exhortation to abide in Christ is a call to continue in the exercise of faith and love upon him, holding to him with a full purpose of heart and deriving life, grace, strength, and nourishment from him. Just as a branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it remains connected to the vine, we too cannot bear fruit unless we abide in Christ, emphasizing the necessity of maintaining a close relationship with him through fresh acts of faith. When believers depart from Christ, even temporarily, they become withered and fruitless in both their inward disposition and outward duties.
