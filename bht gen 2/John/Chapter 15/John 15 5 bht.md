# John 15:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who abide in Christ and have a living faith are the ones referred to as branches in this passage. By emphasizing the union with Christ, it is clear that apart from Him, these branches can do nothing in terms of bearing fruit and living a fruitful Christian life. Our dependence on Christ for life, grace, and holiness is emphasized, as without Him, we are like withered and useless branches. It is through our ongoing union with Christ that we receive all that we need to bear much fruit and live in fellowship with Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is he, that..." 
2. "Union with Me is the sole efficient cause of fruit being produced, you having no power to do anything, to bring anything to perfection, to do any of the virtues of that which you are, separate from Me."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 5. without me—apart, or
	vitally disconnected from Me. 
	ye can do
	nothing—spiritually, acceptably.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The expression 'without me' denotes the same as separate from me. As the branches, if separated from the parent stock, could produce no fruit, but would immediately wither and die, so Christians, if separate from Christ, could do nothing."
2. "The Son of God was the original source of life, John 1:4. He also, by his work as Mediator, gives life to the world John 6:33, and it is by the same grace and agency that it is continued in the Christian."
3. "That to him is due all the praise for all the good works the Christian performs. That they will perform good works just in proportion as they feel their dependence on him and look to him. And, That the reason why others fail of being holy is because they are unwilling to look to him, and seek grace and strength from him who alone is able to give it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Without me [χωρις εμου] . Properly, apart from me. So Rev. Compare John 1:3; Ephesians 2:12.

### John Calvin:
1. "[...] for we are unable to do anything good. [...] we can do nothing of ourselves. [...] he not only extols the aid of his co-operating grace, but deprives us entirely of all power but what he imparts to us."
2. "Christ does not explain what the branch has naturally, before it become united to the vine, but rather means that we begin to become branches at the time when we are united to him."
3. "Scripture elsewhere shows that, before we are in him, we are dry and useless wood."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit; because apart from me ye can do nothing." 
2. "The words ‘ye can do nothing’ refer to the efforts of one already a believer. The state of faith is presupposed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus repeats and applies the metaphor of verse John 15:1." 
2. "Apart from me. See Ephesians 2:12 for χωρις Χριστου. There is nothing for a broken off branch to do but wither and die."
3. "For the cosmic relation of Christ see John 1:3 (χωρις αυτου)."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ here repeats what he said of himself, 'the vine', for the sake of the application of 'the branches' to his disciples: which expresses their sameness of nature with Christ; their strict and close union to him..."
2. "...and the communication of life and grace, holiness and fruitfulness, of support and strength, and of perseverance in grace and holiness to the end from him."
3. "Nothing is to be done 'without Christ'; without his Spirit, grace, strength, and presence; or as 'separate from' him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Our Lord in this whole passage speaks of no branches but such as are, or at least were once, united to him by living faith."
