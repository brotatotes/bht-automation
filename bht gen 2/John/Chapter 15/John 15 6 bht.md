# John 15:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who do not truly live in faith and dependence on Christ are like unfruitful branches that are cast forth and withered, ultimately being cast into the fire. This serves as a reminder to avoid the danger of presumption and to persevere in our relationship with Christ. External professions of religion may initially appear fruitful, but when those branches are cast out of the church, their true nature is revealed as they wither and become of no value. In such cases, those of the world gather them into their own company, standing in stark contrast to the true vine.
