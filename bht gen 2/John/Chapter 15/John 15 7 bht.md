1. "The thought that the 'sayings' of Jesus abide in us as the condition of blessedness is fundamentally the same as that expressed previously in John 15:3, 'because of the word.'"

### John Gill:
1. "Abiding in Christ is here explained by his words or doctrines abiding in his disciples; by which are meant his Gospel, and the truths of it."
2. "This abides when it comes in power, and becomes the engrafted word; and may be said to do so, when such, in whose hearts it has a place, and has taken deep root, continue to have a relish and savour of it, a true and hearty affection for it."
3. "The blessing and privilege that such shall enjoy is, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you; or, as some copies read it, 'it shall be given you': but this must be understood not of temporal things, but of things spiritual."

1. "Prayers themselves are a fruit of faith, and they produce more fruit."
