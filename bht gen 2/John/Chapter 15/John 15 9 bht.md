# John 15:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As believers, we are called to remain in Christ's love, to keep our place in His affection. This is a precious and invaluable blessing that we should not take for granted. Christ's love for us is unwavering, and He desires for us to believe in and treasure our position in His love. It is a caution worth heeding, reminding us that although it is possible for us to lose sight of His love, we have the ability to continue abiding in it.
