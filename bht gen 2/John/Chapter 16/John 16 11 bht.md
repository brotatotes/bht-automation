# John 16:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The judgment of the prince of this world marks his downfall and the end of his dominion over humanity. Through Christ's victory over him through death and resurrection, the forces of evil are defeated. However, those who choose to reject this deliverance will continue to remain under the influence and control of Satan. The work of the Holy Spirit is to bring individuals out of the kingdom of darkness and into the Kingdom of God, to liberate them from the bondage of sin and transform them into sons and daughters of the Lord Almighty.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This better judgment itself is that very truth of God manifested in the Lord Jesus, by which the Prince of this world is cast out; by which the follower of Christ is enabled to say, 'Get thee behind me, Satan;' by which the unbelieving world, and its Prince, are finally condemned in the judgment hereafter."
2. "The subjective and objective bearing of the three words are both to be kept in sight, and that the great convictive work of the Spirit is to bring man OUT OF HIMSELF INTO CHRIST, Who (in His objective manifestation) must be made unto him (subjectively), (1) ἀπολύτρωσις , (2) δικαιοσύνη , (3) σοφία..."
3. "And this convictive work of the Spirit is a complex and progressive work; including the ministry of the Apostles, and every step taken towards divine truth in the history of the Church, as well as the conversion of individuals, and condemnation of the unbelieving."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The death of Christ 'judged' or judicially overthrew him, and he was thereupon 'cast out' or expelled from his usurped dominion."
2. "Thus, then, the Spirit shall bring home to men's conscience: (1) the sense of sin, consummated in the rejection of Him who came to 'take away the sin of the world'; (2) the sense of perfect relief in the righteousness of the Father's Servant, now fetched from the earth that spurned Him to that bosom where from everlasting He had dwelt; and (3) the sense of emancipation from the fetters of Satan, whose judgment brings to men liberty to be holy, and transformation out of servants of the devil into sons and daughters of the Lord Almighty."
3. "To another class, however, this blessed teaching will have another issue—translating them out of the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of God's dear Son."
