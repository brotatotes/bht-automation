Christ reassures his disciples that there are still many important things to be revealed to them, particularly regarding his upcoming passion, death, resurrection, and the resulting outcomes.

However, Jesus acknowledges that his disciples are not yet able to fully grasp these teachings due to their limited faith and overwhelming grief. Nonetheless, as their understanding grows, they will eventually be able to comprehend and embrace these profound truths.
