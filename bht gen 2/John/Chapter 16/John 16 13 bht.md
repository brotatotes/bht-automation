## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Lord had ever told them the truth, and nothing but the truth, in spiritual things, but not yet the whole truth, because they could not bear it. This the Spirit should lead them into, open the way to it, and unfold it by degrees."
2. "No promise of universal knowledge, nor of infallibility, is hereby conveyed; but a promise to them and us, that the Holy Spirit shall teach and lead us, not as children, under the tutors and governors of legal and imperfect knowledge, but as sons, making known to us the whole truth of God."
3. "The Spirit does not, any more than the Son, work or speak of Himself: both are sent, the one from the Father, the other from the Father and Son: the one to testify of the Father, the other of the Father and the Son."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Spirit of truth - So called because he would teach them all necessary truth.Will guide you into all truth - That is, truth which pertained to the establishment of the Christian system, which they were not then prepared to hear."
2. "We may here remark that this is a full promise that they would be inspired and guided in founding the new church; and we may observe that the plan of the Saviour was replete with wisdom."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Spirit does not reveal all truth to men, but He leads them to the truth as it is in Christ."
