# John 16:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, Jesus speaks to his disciples about his impending death and resurrection. He tells them that in a little while, they will no longer see him, referring to his burial. However, he also promises that in another little while, they will see him again, alluding to his resurrection. This sequence of events is necessary because Jesus must go to his Father, a reference to his ascension and the completion of his work on earth. These words highlight the temporary nature of his absence and the ultimate victory over death that he would achieve through his resurrection.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The mode of expression is (purposely) enigmatical; the θεωρεῖτε and ὄψεσθε not being co-ordinate; the first referring merely to physical, the second also to spiritual sight."
2. "The ὄψεσθε began to be fulfilled at the Resurrection; then received its main fulfilment at the day of Pentecost; and shall have its final completion at the great return of the Lord hereafter."
3. "Remember again, that in all these prophecies we have a perspective of continually unfolding fulfilments presented to us."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The joy of the world at their not seeing Him seems to show that His removal from them by death was what He meant."
2. "Their joy at again seeing Him points to their transport at His reappearance amongst them on His Resurrection, when they could no longer doubt His identity."
3. "At the same time the sorrow of the widowed Church in the absence of her Lord in the heavens, and her transport at His personal return, are certainly here expressed."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A little while - His death would occur in a short time. It took place the next day." 
2. "Ye shall not see me - That is, he would be concealed from their view in the tomb."
3. "Because I go ... - Because it is a part of the plan that I should ascend to God, it is necessary that I should rise from the grave, and then you will see me, and have evidence that I am still your Friend."

### Marvin Vincent:

3. "Because I go unto the Father." The best texts omit.

### John Calvin:
1. "We must, therefore, guard against becoming weary of reading what Christ, not without cause, repeats so frequently."
2. "He mitigates and soothes their sorrow for his absence, by this consolation, that it will not last long; and thus he magnifies the grace of the Spirit, by which he will be continually present with them."
3. "The grace of the Spirit is a mirror, in which Christ wishes to be seen by us."
4. "He intended, therefore, in my opinion, to teach what would be his condition after his death, that they might rest satisfied with his spiritual presence, and might not think that it would be any loss to them that he no longer dwelt with them as a mortal man."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The time closing the first ‘little while’ is the death of Christ, when ‘not beholding’ begins; the time closing the second ‘little while’ dates from the resurrection, when the ‘seeing’ begins and continues for ever."
2. "After the death of their Lord the disciples shall be in the position of the world; under the saddening influence of that event their faith shall wane, and all the joy experienced in His presence shall disappear."
