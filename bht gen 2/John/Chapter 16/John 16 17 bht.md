The disciples were confused about Jesus' words regarding his going to the Father. Some of them may have had a better understanding than others, but overall they were ignorant of the meaning. They had a limited grasp of what Jesus was saying about his death and its purpose. Despite the clarity with which Jesus had spoken about his death, the disciples still did not fully comprehend his message.
