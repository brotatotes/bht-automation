# John 16:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jews had already made a law stating that anyone who confessed Jesus as the Messiah would be banished from their synagogues. This act of excommunication was not a minor punishment, but a severe form of exclusion from the entire Jewish community. Those who persecuted Christians, motivated by their misguided zeal, believed that they were doing God a service. It is alarming to think that some individuals considered such acts of violence as praiseworthy and pleasing to God.
