# John 16:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A woman in labor experiences sorrow and anguish because her time has come, but once she gives birth, she no longer remembers the pain. In the same way, Jesus uses this analogy to illustrate that the disciples will experience sorrow when He departs but will be filled with joy when He returns. This joy will surpass all their previous troubles and anxieties. It signifies a new beginning, just as the birth of a child brings peace and happiness into the world.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The ‘tertium comparationis’ is ἡ λύπη εἰς χαρὰν γενήσεται: but the comparison itself goes far beyond this mere similitude."
2. "The proper import of the figure seems to be, that the Death of Jesus Christ was as it were an anguish of birth belonging to all Humanity (ein schmerzvoller Geburtsact der ganzen Menschheit) in which the perfect Man was born into the world; and in this very birth of the new man lies the spring of eternal joy, never to be lost, for all, inasmuch as through Him and His power the renovation of the whole is rendered possible."
3. "His passing from sorrow to joy till 'Christ be formed in him,' is this birth of pain. And the whole Church, the Spouse of Christ, nay, even the whole Creation, συνωδίνει, till the number of the elect be accomplished, and the eternal joy brought in."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The anguish [της θλιψεως]. Commonly rendered affliction or tribulation in A.V."
2. "The woman in travail. A common Old Testament image of sorrow issuing in joy."
3. "The joy [την χαραν]. Properly, the joy which answers to the anguish."

### John Calvin:
1. "He expresses his meaning more clearly, that not only will their sorrow be turned into joy, but also that it contains in itself the ground and occasion of joy."
2. "The comparison would not apply if sorrow did not produce joy in the members of Christ, when they become partakers of his sufferings, just as the labor in the woman is the cause of the birth."
3. "We ought, I say, to resemble women in labor, on whom the mere sight of the child born produces such an impression, that their pain gives them pain no longer."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow because her hour is come; but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no longer the tribulation for her joy that a man is born into the world." 
2. "Yet there is more in the language than meets the eye at first sight, and its peculiarities form a valuable proof of the correctness of the interpretation given above by the twice repeated 'little while.'"
3. "And why (2) the use of the word 'man' instead of child, when it is said 'a man is born into the world,' but because that which is brought forth in tribulation is the new birth of regenerated humanity, and because that new life with which the Church springs into being is life in a risen Lord."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Her hour is come (ηλθεν η ωρα αυτης). Second aorist active indicative, timeless aorist, 'her hour' for giving birth which she knows is like a living death."
2. "But when she is delivered of the child (οταν δε γεννηση το παιδιον). Indefinite temporal clause with οταν and first aorist active subjunctive of γενναω. 'But whenever she bears the child.'"
3. "The anguish (της θλιψεως). Genitive case after μνημονευε of θλιψις, usual word for tribulation (Matthew 13:21)."

### John Gill:
1. "A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, as was said she should have... because her hour is come; is at hand... but as soon as she is delivered of the child... she remembereth no more the anguish; for joy that a man is born into the world." 
2. "Our Lord seems to have respect to a prevailing notion among them, as well as many others, of the felicity of male children... 'that a man child comes into the world', peace comes into the world."
3. "Now our Lord, by this instance, illustrates the sorrow his disciples should have by his departure, and the joy that they should be possessed of upon his return to them... all their trouble, concern, anxiety of mind, and fears, that attended them, would all vanish away, and they be distressed with them no more."
