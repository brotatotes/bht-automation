# John 16:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the disciples were with Jesus, they relied on Him for their needs and guidance. But a time would come when they would no longer need to question or inquire of Him, as the Holy Spirit would teach and enlighten them. They would have unhindered access to the deep mysteries of faith. Jesus assured them that He would still act as their mediator, interceding on their behalf to the Father, ensuring that their prayers would be answered abundantly, in His name and according to His purpose.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The way to οὐδὲν ἐρωτᾶν any more, is to ask and to pray the more diligently, till that day comes."
2. "It has been supposed wrongly that ἐμέ and τὸν πατέρα are in opposition in this verse, and thence gathered... that it is not lawful to address prayer to Christ. But such an opposition is contrary to the whole spirit of these discourses, and asking the Father in Christ’s name, is in fact asking HIM."
3. "In the latter clause, notice the right reading: He shall give it you in my name, He being, as Luthardt expresses it, the element, the region, of all communication between God and the Church."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Albert Barnes:

3. "They had not sought to God through him as the Mediator, but they had directly applied to the Saviour himself."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "Here the meaning is, ye shall ask me no question." 
3. "Not only is the prayer offered, but the answer is given in Christ's name."

### John Calvin:
1. "They were at that time so slow that the slightest difficulty of any kind made them hesitate...but soon afterwards, having been enlightened by the Holy Spirit, they no longer had any thing to prevent them from becoming familiarly acquainted with the wisdom of God." 
2. "As if Christ had said that their ignorance would be corrected, so that, instead of being stopped — as they now were — by the smallest obstructions, they would penetrate into the deepest mysteries without any difficulty."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Ye shall ask me nothing (εμε ουκ ερωτησετε). Either in the sense of question (original meaning of ερωταω) as in verses John 16:19; John 16:30 since he will be gone or in the sense of request or favours (like αιτεω in this verse) as in John 14:16; Acts 3:2. In verse John 16:26 both αιτεω and ερωταω occur in this sense. Either view makes sense here."
2. "If ye shall ask (αν τ αιτησητε). Third-class condition, αν like εαν with first aorist active subjunctive of αιτεω."
3. "Note John 14:26 for 'in my name.'"

### John Gill:

"But the time when Christ, and his apostles, should meet again, and see each other's faces with joy and pleasure, is meant; and the time following thereon, especially the day of Pentecost, when the Spirit was poured down upon them, and, according to his promise, came to them, taught them all things, and led them into all truth."
2. "Asking here signifies prayer, and a different word is here used than before."
3. "The medium of access to the Father is the name of Christ; he is the Mediator between God and man, the way of access unto him; whatever is asked, is to be asked on account of his blood, righteousness, and sacrifice, and then there is no doubt of success; whatever is asked will be given."

### John Wesley:
1. "Ye shall not question me about any thing — Which you do not now understand. You will not need to inquire of me; for you will know all things clearly."
2. "Whatsoever ye shall ask — Knowledge, love, or any thing else, he will give it - Our Lord here gives us a charte blanche."
3. "Believer, write down what thou wilt. He had said, John 14:13, I will do it, where the discourse was of glorifying the Father through the Son. Here, speaking of the love of the Father to believers, he saith, He will give it."
