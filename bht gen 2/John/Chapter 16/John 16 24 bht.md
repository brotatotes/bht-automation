# John 16:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Up until this point, the disciples had not yet prayed in the name of Jesus. Although they had prayed to Him before and asked for various things, they had not fully grasped the significance of praying in His name. They had not understood the need for His mediation, His blood, righteousness, and sacrifice. But now, Jesus teaches them that when they ask in His name, they will receive what they ask for. This instruction is crucial for their work and for achieving success in it.
