# John 16:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The teachings of Jesus often appeared mysterious and enigmatic to his disciples, who struggled to fully understand his message. However, Jesus promised that the Holy Spirit would come and teach them, bringing clarity to his teachings that previously seemed obscure. This inward teaching of the Spirit would not only enable them to grasp the meaning of his words, but also grant them a direct and intimate access to the Father. Through the work of the Spirit, the disciples would no longer be limited by the figurative language and would receive a clear understanding of the truths Jesus had been imparting to them.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This is true of the whole discourse and of the discourses of the Lord in general, as they must then have seemed to them, before the Holy Spirit furnished the key to their meaning."
2. "Olshausen finely remarks, that all human language is a παροιμία, only able to hint at, not to express fully, the things of God; and that the Lord contrasts the use of this weak and insufficient medium, with the inward teaching of the Holy Spirit."
3. "This inward teaching, because it is a real imparting of the divine Nature and Life, brings with it not only prayer in the name of Jesus, but a free access to the Father Himself."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In proverbs—in obscure language, opposed to 'showing plainly'—that is, by the Spirit's teaching."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The plainest declarations to them on the subject would appear to be involved in mystery."
2. "The time cometh... when he would send the Holy Spirit to teach them the great truths of religion."
3. "The teachings of the Holy Spirit were the teachings of Christ himself."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He had spoken under figures, as the vine, and the woman in travail." 
2. "The best texts read ajpaggelw, the original force of which is to bring tidings from [απο] something or someone." 
3. "Plainly [παρρησια]."

### John Calvin:
1. "The intention of Christ is to give courage to his disciples, that, entertaining good hopes of making better progress, they may not think that the instruction to which they now listen is useless, though there be but little of it that they comprehend."
2. "He declares, therefore, that they will soon perceive the fruit of this doctrine, which, by its obscurity, might produce disgust in their minds."
3. "That obscurity, therefore, did not lie so much in the doctrine as in their understandings; and, indeed, the same thing happens to us in the present day, for not without good reason does the word of God receive this commendation, that it is our light, but its brightness is so obscured by our darkness, that, what we hear we reckon to be pure allegories."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The contrast suggested is not between figurative and direct speech, or between enigmatical and clear sayings. Jesus had used few figures, and He had taught with the utmost simplicity and plainness of language. But the effect of His teaching had depended upon the authority of the Teacher, not on the spiritual insight of the pupil."
2. "Now, however, that stage of instruction was to come to a close, and the pupils, in ripened manhood, were themselves under the direct teaching of the Spirit to ‘see.’"
3. "The contrast, therefore, between ‘in proverbs’ and ‘plainly’ is to be sought in the difference between outward teaching of every kind and that internal teaching which comes from the illuminating influence of the Spirit of God, and which is the best, the only true, teaching."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Shall tell (απαγγελω). Future active of απαγγελλω, to report, correct text and not αναγγελω (verses John 16:13; John 16:14; John 16:15), as in 1 John 1:2."
2. "Plainly (παρρησια). See on John 7:13 for this word."

### John Gill:
1. "These all seemed as proverbs, parables, and dark sayings, which they did not clearly understand."
2. "When I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall show plainly of the Father."
3. "So as that they should have a clear understanding of them, as they were capable of; of the perfections of his nature, his distinct personality, his being the Father of Christ, and of all the elect in him; of his everlasting love to their persons; of his choice of them in Christ; of his covenant with them in him; of his mind and will concerning them, and his gracious designs towards them."
