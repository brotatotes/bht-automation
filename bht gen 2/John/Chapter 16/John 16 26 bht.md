# John 16:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When we have knowledge of Christ and His love, it leads us to pray in His name, knowing that He intercedes for us. The Father's love for us is not only because of Jesus' intercession, but also because of the faith and love that He has worked within us. We have the assurance that God is ready to bestow upon us all that we need when we approach Him in prayer, through the name of His Son.
