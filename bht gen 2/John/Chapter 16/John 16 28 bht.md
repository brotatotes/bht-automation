# John 16:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus's coming forth from the Father refers to his incarnation in the flesh, not just his eternal filiation or his role as Mediator. He entered the world to fulfill the will of God and to carry out the work for which he came. His departure from the world through death marked the completion of his mission. His coming and going are both significant events in the grand plan of redemption.
