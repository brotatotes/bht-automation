# John 16:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
No longer speaking in proverbs, Jesus's words became clear and easily understood by the apostles. They were enlightened by the truth that Jesus revealed to them, and their hearts were filled with satisfaction and clarity. Their simple hearts and budding faith allowed them to recognize that Jesus had come from God, even if they didn't fully comprehend the depth of his future significance. The time for confusion and ambiguity had passed, as Jesus spoke directly and plainly about his departure from the world and return to the Father.
