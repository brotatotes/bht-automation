# John 16:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Their belief in Christ was genuine, but they were unaware of the perils that awaited them. However, Christ reproves their self-confidence and boasting, as if their faith was unshakeable. He tacitly reprimands them for not being more established in their faith before this time. He asks them to consider what they will do when he is taken from them, apprehended by his enemies, delivered into the hands of the Gentiles, crucified, and laid in the grave.
