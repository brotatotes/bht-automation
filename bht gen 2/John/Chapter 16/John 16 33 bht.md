# John 16:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of tribulations, believers can find peace in Christ alone, for the world can neither give nor take away true peace. It is in Christ, through His person, blood, righteousness, and sacrifice, that our souls find solid peace, rest, comfort, and joy. As followers of Christ, we can be of good cheer, knowing that our sins are forgiven and the love of God is in us. We can take courage in the face of danger, for Christ has overcome the world, and in Him, we have the assurance of victory over all tribulations.
