# John 16:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These words from Jesus serve as a reminder that God does not allow his people to face trials without providing them with the necessary warning and grace to endure. Just as Jesus did not immediately disclose the full extent of the disciples' future hardships, he revealed them now to prepare them for what lies ahead. With Jesus no longer physically present, the disciples would soon experience a change in circumstances and would need to rely on the presence and aid of the Holy Spirit. Thus, the importance of these prophetic words and their implications should not be underestimated.
