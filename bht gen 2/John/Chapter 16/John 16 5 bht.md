# John 16:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples, in their grief over Jesus' departure, failed to inquire about the nature of His departure or the advantages that would come from it. Jesus had previously addressed Peter's question about where He was going, but Peter's understanding was limited, as he did not grasp that Jesus was going to His Father in heaven. Instead of seeking to understand the place, the way, and the happiness that awaited them, the disciples remained focused on their own sorrow.

3. "Nor did they ask what he meant by his Father's house, or what those mansions were he was going to prepare; and what the glory was he was going to possess for himself and them; they ask neither about the place he was going to, nor the way to it, nor the happiness to be enjoyed there."
