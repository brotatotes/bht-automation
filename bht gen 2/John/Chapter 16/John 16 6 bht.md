# John 16:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples' sorrow was all-consuming, overshadowing any consideration of Jesus' purpose for leaving them. The loss of Jesus filled their hearts, leaving no room to think about the persecution they would face. Their grief so consumed them that they did not even think to question where he was going or the state he would enter. If they had sought understanding in this, it could have eased their sorrow and brought them peace.

### Henry Alford:
1. "Your grief has filled, entirely occupied, your heart, to the exclusion of any regard of my object in leaving you." 
2. "These are the same disciples who afterwards when their risen Lord had ascended to heaven, without any pang at parting with Him, returned with great joy to Jerusalem."
3. "Subest huic blandæ increpationi tacita consolatio. Dum enim improbat, quod quæstionem, quo vaderet, negligant, sibi id optime perspectum esse docet. Dum negligentiæ incusat, ad excusationem tamen affert, quod ea ex tam vehementi affectu tristitiæ oriunda sit."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Sorrow had too much paralyzed them, and He would rouse their energies."

### John Gill:
1. "Of being hated and persecuted by the Jews, of being put out of their synagogues, and of losing their lives."
2. "Sorrow for his absence so possessed their minds, seized on all the powers and faculties of their souls, and engrossed all their thoughts."
3. "It never entered into the heart of any of them to inquire about the place he was going to, or the state he should enter upon; which had they had any right notions of, would have greatly contributed to have abated their sorrow, quieted their minds, made them easy under, and reconciled them unto, his departure from them."
