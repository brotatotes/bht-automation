# John 16:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Spirit's role is to convince the world, not just the disciples, of their sin, righteousness, and judgment. He will convict them of their sins and reveal to them the reality of their wrongdoings, urging them to repent and turn towards righteousness. Through his work, he will demonstrate to the world the morality and righteousness that they have been missing. Ultimately, he will bring forth a deep sense of conviction, leading them to acknowledge their need for a Savior and to understand the impending judgment that awaits them.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This is one of the passages most pregnant with thought in the profound discourses of Christ with a few great strokes depicting all and every part of the ministry of the Holy Ghost in the world."
2. "Reproof is indeed implied in the term employed, and doubtless the word begins with it. But convict or convince is the thing intended."


### Albert Barnes:
1. "He will convince or convict the world of sin. That is, he will so apply the truths of God to men’s own minds as to convince them by fair and sufficient arguments that they are sinners, and cause them to feel this."
2. "This is the nature of conviction always."
3. "The world - Sinners. The men of the world. All men are by nature sinners, and the term the world may be applied to them all."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He will convict the world of being sinful, unrighteous, and exposed to judgment."
2. "He will convict the world as respects these three; that is, will convict it of ignorance of their real nature."
3. "Righteousness. Only here and ver. 10 in the Gospel. It occurs in the First Epistle and in Revelation."

### John Calvin:
1. "He had promised his Spirit to the disciples; and now he praises the excellence of the gift from its effect, because this Spirit will not only guide, support, and protect them in private, but will extend more widely his power and efficacy."
2. "He will convince the world; that is, he will not remain shut up in you, but his power will go forth from you to be displayed to the whole world."
3. "It ought to be observed, that in this passage Christ does not speak of secret revelations, but of the power of the Spirit, which appears in the outward doctrine of the Gospel, and in the voice of men."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word ‘concerning’ also is not the same as ‘of.’ The inference to be drawn from these considerations is that in the conviction of the world here spoken of its conversion is not necessarily implied."
2. "The promise now given to the disciples is not that they shall convert the world, but that it shall be silenced, self-condemned, overwhelmed with shame and confusion of face."
3. "The Judge of all the earth is upon their side; He will judge for them."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Will convict the world...the most needed task today for our complacent age." 
2. "Concerning the reality of sin as missing the mark and as wronging God and man...some scientists and psychologists seem bent on destroying man's sense of sin." 
3. "The opposite of 'sin' and to be yearned for after conviction...for Christ's idea of righteousness."

### John Gill:
1. "The coming of the Spirit here, chiefly designs his descent upon the apostles, at the day of 'Pentecost': as the things ascribed to him, and which were then done by him, clearly show."
2. "He will reprove the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment: by 'the world' is principally meant, the Jews; the world among whom Christ personally was, who knew him not, disbelieved him, rejected him as the Messiah, hated and persecuted him, even unto death; though not to the exclusion of the Gentiles."
3. "Which 'reproving', as it may respect different persons, may intend both such reproofs and convictions, as are not attended with conversion, and issue in salvation; and such as are powerful, spiritual, and to saving purposes."

### John Wesley:
1. "He — Observe his twofold office; toward the world" 
2. "will convince - All of the world - Who do not obstinately resist"
