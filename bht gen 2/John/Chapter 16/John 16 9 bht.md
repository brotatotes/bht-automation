# John 16:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Spirit's conviction brings awareness of the sinfulness and corruption of our nature, the wickedness that dwells within our hearts, and the sins we have committed against God himself. It highlights the sin of unbelief, which is the root of all sin and a rejection of Christ as the Son of God. This sin, if unrepented of, leads to perdition and reflects the corruption and depravity of our human nature.
