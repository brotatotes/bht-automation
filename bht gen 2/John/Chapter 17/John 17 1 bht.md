2. "It is impossible to regard the following prayer otherwise than as the very words of our Lord Himself, faithfully rendered by the beloved Apostle in the power of the Holy Spirit."
3. "He prays first objectively, to set the great matter forth in all its majesty; then subjectively, putting Himself into the place of τὸν υἱόν here."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "John very seldom depicts the gestures or looks of our Lord, as here. But this was an occasion of which the impression was indelible, and the upward look could not be passed over."
2. "Father, the hour is come."
3. "Glorify thy Son—Put honor upon Thy Son, by countenancing, sustaining, and carrying Him through that 'hour'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It adds much to the interest of this prayer that it was offered in the stillness of the night, in the open air, and in the especially tender circumstances in which Jesus and his apostles were."
2. "This prayer is moreover a specimen of the manner of his intercession, and evinces the interest which he felt in behalf of all who should become his followers in all ages of the world."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "These words [ταυτα]. Literally, these things. So Rev. Said. John nowhere says that Jesus prayed, as the other Evangelists do."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "When we read of His ‘lifting up His eyes to heaven,’ we must think of them as full alike of holy devotion and of the consciousness of completed victory."
2. "'Father,' not 'our Father' as in the Lord's Prayer, sums up the peculiar revelation of this Gospel, and expresses the whole consciousness of that relation to God in which 'the only-begotten Son' stood, and would have us to stand."
3. "What Jesus prays for is, that the Father would now withdraw the veil which had hitherto obscured to some, and concealed from others, the 'glory' belonging to the Son's unity of relation to the Father, in order that that 'glory' of the Father Himself, which is the end of all existence, and which can be seen only in the Son, may thus shine forth in the sight of His creatures without any shadow to dim its brightness."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is inconceivable that this real Lord's Prayer is the free composition of a disciple put into the mouth of Jesus. It is rather 'the tenacious memory of an old man recalling the greatest days of his life' (Bernard), aided by the Holy Spirit promised for this very purpose."
2. "Jesus had the habit of prayer. He prayed here for himself, for the disciples, for all believers."
3. "The prayer is similar in spirit to the Model Prayer for us in Matthew 6:9-13. It is not merely for strength to meet the Cross, but for the power to glorify the Father by his death and resurrection and ascension, 'that the Son may glorify thee'."

3. "In the after discharge of other branches of his mediatorial office, in making intercession for his people, in the ministry of his word and ordinances, by his servants, attended with his Holy Spirit, and by the administration of his kingly office."
