# John 17:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
All things that belong to me also belong to you, and vice versa, Jesus declares. These words reflect the profound unity and shared ownership between the Father and the Son, extending not only to material possessions but also encompassing the divine nature and all its perfections. This remarkable relationship far surpasses anything that a mere creature could claim before God. It is this foundational connection that establishes the unique ownership that both the Father and the Son have in those who have been given to Christ as Mediator.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It were not so much if He had only said, ‘All Mine is Thine;’ for that we may all say, that all we have is God’s. But this is a far greater thing, that He inverts this and says, ‘All Thine is Mine.’ This can no creature say before God." (Luther, Stier, v. 418, edn. 2)
2. "The E. V., ‘All Mine are Thine,’ &c., gives the erroneous impression that persons only are meant, whereas it is all things, in the widest meaning, the Godhead itself included, of which this is asserted."
3. "ἐν αὐτοῖς, not ‘by their means,’ but in them; by that ἐγὼ ἐν αὐτοῖς of John 17:23, the life of the vine in the branches; so that the fruit of the branches is the glory of the vine, by the sap of the vine living in the branches. All this again is proleptic."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "All My things are Thine and Thy things are Mine."
2. "Absolute COMMUNITY OF PROPERTY between the Father and the Son is here expressed as nakedly as words can do it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. All mine [τα εμα παντα] . All things that are mine. So Rev.

### John Calvin:
1. "I do not plead with thee for any but those whom thou acknowledgest to be thine, for I have nothing separated from thee, and therefore I shall not meet with a refusal."
2. "We must not seek salvation anywhere else than in Christ."
3. "Christ never will cease to care for our salvation, since he is glorified in us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Jesus seems rather to be carried away, by the thought that disciples one with Him were as truly one with His Father, to another and a more glorious thought, that all that He possessed was His Father’s and all that was His Father’s was His, so real, so intimate, so deep is the unity between Them."
2. "In all things, then, though (it may be) especially in His disciples, He has been glorified. But His being glorified in them is really the Father’s being so, because the glory flows from their recognition of Him, and their fellowship with Him, as the Son."
3. "It is not, therefore, because they glorify Himself that He is to pray for their being kept by the Father, but because the promotion of His glory is the promotion of the Father’s glory."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This no creature can say in reference to God" (Luther).
2. "I stand glorified (perfect passive indicative of δοξαζω) in the disciples" (εν αυτοις), in spite of all their shortcomings and failings. There is comfort for us in this.

### John Gill:
1. "Christ is speaking not of things but of persons... the elect of God, particularly the apostles, who were his and his Father's."
2. "The same that belongs to the one belongs to the other: but persons are here meant, and these the elect of God."
3. "He [Jesus] will be glorified by them, and in them hereafter, and that to all eternity."

### John Wesley:
1. "All things that are mine are thine, and that are thine are mine — These are very high and strong expressions, too grand for any mere creature to use."
2. "implying that all things whatsoever, inclusive of the Divine nature, perfections, and operations, are the common property of the Father and the Son."
3. "And this is the original ground of that peculiar property, which both the Father and the Son have in the persons who were given to Christ as Mediator."
