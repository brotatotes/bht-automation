# John 17:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ emphasizes the faithful keeping and safeguarding He provided for His disciples, acknowledging that although all were preserved, Judas, known as the son of perdition, was lost. This event serves as a reminder that even within the context of God's sovereignty, human choice and responsibility remain essential. The designation son of perdition implies someone deserving of perishing, resonating with similar phrases used to denote individuals liable to death, hell, or wrath. Thus, this account underscores the fulfillment of Scriptural prophecies and illuminates the significance of individual accountability within God's overarching plan.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Lord here, as Cyril remarks, compares His keeping of His own, to that by the Father, in a way only accountable by both Persons being of equal Power and Dignity."
2. "...showing us (1) the sense in which those words must be understood (see above); and (2) that of such persons it is true that there is for them no ‘gratia irresistibilis,’ no ‘keeping in God’s Name’ independently of their ‘keeping God’s word,’ which Judas did not do."
3. "As the other disciples by true τήρησις of the divine ῥήματα given to them, rose from being natural men to be the children of God, so Judas, through want of the same, sank from the state of the natural man to that of the lost the children of the devil."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I kept—guarded them in thy name—acting as Thy Representative on earth."
2. "None of them is lost, but the son of perdition—It is not implied here that the son of perdition was one of those whom the Father had given to the Son, but rather the contrary."
3. "Son of perdition—doomed to it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "While I was with them in the world - While I was engaged with them among other men - surrounded by the people and the temptations of the world."
2. "I kept them - By my example, instructions, and miracles. I preserved them from apostasy."
3. "The term son was given by the Hebrews to those who possessed the character described by the word or name following. Thus, sons of Belial - those who possessed his character; children of wisdom those who were wise, Matthew 11:19. Thus Judas is called a son of perdition because he had the character of a destroyer."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "I kept [ετηρουν]. Imperfect tense. I continued to keep. The I is emphatic: I kept them, now do Thou keep them."
2. "The former word means, I preserved them; the latter, I guarded them as a means to their preservation."
3. "A play of words: 'None of them perished, but the son of perishing' (Westcott)."

### John Calvin:
1. "He means, therefore, that it were most unreasonable to suppose that they would now perish, as if by his departure the power of God had been extinguished or dead."
2. "Hence we infer that Christ keeps believers in the present day not less than he formerly did, but in a different manner, because Divine majesty is openly displayed in him."
3. "But it would be a most unfounded argument, if any one were to infer from this, that the revolt of Judas ought to be ascribed to God rather than to himself; because the prediction laid him under a necessity."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The sad change that is to take place in the condition of His disciples after He has 'gone away' presses on His mind; He recalls tenderly the care with which He had hitherto watched over them in an evil world."
2. "The word 'I' is very emphatic, 'I kept them: now do Thou.'"
3. "The wonderful fact itself, when rightly viewed, affords evidence that He has fulfilled His promise that He will keep His own. It was in carrying out the Father's will that not one of the Eleven had been lost: it was in carrying out the same will that Judas had met his fate."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Christ was the sentinel (φυλαξ, Acts 5:23) for them. Is he our sentinel now?"
2. "The very phrase for antichrist (2 Thessalonians 2:3)."
3. "It means the son marked by final loss, not annihilation, but meeting one's destiny (Acts 2:25)."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ is with his people whilst they are on earth, and they are with him when he is in heaven."
2. "Christ kept his apostles close to himself, and from the evil of the world, and from temporal and eternal ruin."
3. "The destruction of Judas fulfills the Scriptures that speak of it, particularly Psalms 109:8."

### John Wesley:
1. "Those whom thou hast given me I have guarded, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition — So one even of them whom God had given him is lost. So far was even that decree from being unchangeable!"
2. "The son of perdition signifies one that deservedly perishes..."
3. "Children of hell, Matthew 23:15, and children of wrath, Ephesians 2:3, signify persons justly obnoxious to death, hell, wrath."
