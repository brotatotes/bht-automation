## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "νῦν δέ; opposed to ὅτε ἤμην John 17:12, implying, 'But I shall be here to keep them no more. And therefore I pray this prayer in their hearing, that' &c."
2. "On ἡ χ. ἡ ἐμή see ch. John 15:11; John 16:24; also the reference to these words in 1 John 1:4."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Such a strain befits rather the upper sanctuary than the scene of conflict"
2. "My joy, the joy I experience in knowing that such intercessions are to be made for them by their absent Lord"
3. "that My joy... may be tasted by those who now hear them, and by all who shall hereafter read the record of them"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "My joy here probably refers to the joy of the apostles respecting the Saviour - the joy which would result from his resurrection, ascension, and intercession in heaven."


### John Calvin:
1. "Christ, therefore, prays to his Father in the presence of his disciples, not because he needed any words, but to remove from them all doubt." 
2. "I speak in the world, says he; that is, within their hearing, or, in their presence, that their minds may be calm; for their salvation already was in no danger, having been placed by Christ in the hands of God."
3. "He calls it HIS joy, because it was necessary that the disciples should obtain it from him; or, if you choose to express it more briefly, he calls it his, because he is the Author, Cause, and Pledge of it; for in us there is nothing but alarm and uneasiness, but in Christ alone there is peace and joy."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "These words are to be connected with what follows rather than with what precedes. The thought of His immediate departure leads Jesus to pray that His disciples may be filled with a joy independent of His personal presence, ‘in themselves.’"
2. "His ‘joy’ was fulfilled in this, that the name of His Father had been given Him, that He realised the unity with His Father in which He stood. He had led the disciples to the consciousness that they too were in that name of the Father, and by that means the joy that was His had become theirs, it was ‘fulfilled’ in them."
3. "In answering this His prayer the Father will only be accomplishing His own plan, and securing His own glory through the glorification of the disciples in the Son."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

### John Gill:
1. "And these things I speak in the world; which he had expressed in this prayer concerning the nature of eternal life, and his power to give it to all the Father had given him."
2. "Saints rejoice in the person of Christ; in the greatness and dignity of his person, as God over all; hence they know that what he did and suffered answered the purpose, that he must have great interest in heaven, and they must be safe in his hands."
3. "The offices Christ bears as prophet, priest, and King, the relations he stands in as father, husband, brother and friend; his Gospel and communion with him, the blessings of grace in him, as peace, pardon, righteousness and salvation, lay a foundation for solid joy in them that believe."

### John Wesley:
1. "In the world — That is, before I leave the world."
2. "My joy — The joy I feel at going to the Father."
