# John 17:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers, though in the world, are not to conform to its spirit, standards, and message, but instead, they are to be representatives of God's Word. However, this may lead to persecution from the world. The failure to live up to the ideals presented in John 17:14-19 explains why Christians struggle to bring the world to Christ. The world often fails to see the difference and impact that the Gospel and believers have on society. Despite this, believers must continue to preach the Gospel, relying on the grace of God and trusting that He will never forsake them.
