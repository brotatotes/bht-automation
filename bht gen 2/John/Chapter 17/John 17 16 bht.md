# John 17:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are not of this world, just as Jesus is not of this world. This truth is emphasized in both John 17:14 and reiterated here. This distinction from the world exposes believers to its evil. The repetition of this truth serves as an argument for God the Father, appealing for His protection and preservation against the hostility of the world. Understanding this separation from the world prepares for the prayer that follows.
