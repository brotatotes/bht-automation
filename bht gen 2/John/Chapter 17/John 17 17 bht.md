# John 17:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The sanctification and consecration of individuals can happen through an ongoing process of becoming more devoted to God and detached from worldly things. It involves a progressive transformation of the heart and a deepening attachment to things unseen and eternal. Ministers of the gospel will exhibit true devotion to God in proportion to their personal purity. This sanctification is achieved through the truth of God's word, which has the power to transform and sanctify the soul. By being set apart in the sphere of truth, individuals are dedicated to God and separated from the world.
