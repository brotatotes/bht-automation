# John 17:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus says that just as the Father sent him into the world, he has also sent his disciples into the world. This shows that his mission and the apostles' mission are interconnected and that they share the same divine authority and purpose. It is clear that their mission is to manifest the Father and bring about salvation, turning people from darkness to light and opening their eyes to the truth. This demonstrates the honor, authority, and qualifications bestowed upon them by Jesus, which ultimately led to their success in fulfilling their mission.
