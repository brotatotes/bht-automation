# John 17:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By sanctifying himself, Jesus set himself apart and devoted himself as a sinless sacrifice to be offered for humanity's salvation. Despite being falsely accused and treated like a sinner, Jesus remained holy and pure, taking on the appearance of a sinner without actually being one. His willingness to take on this sacrificial role should inspire us and remind us of the incredible love and commitment Jesus had for the Father's will and for the redemption of mankind.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is clear against all Socinian inferences from this verse, that all that part of ἁγιάζειν implied in ch. Joh 10:36 is here excluded: and only that intended which is expressed Heb 2:10 by διὰ παθημάτων τελειῶσαι."
2. "The confining the meaning to His sacrifice (Chrys., Euthym), and the ἵνα καὶ αὐτοὶ.… to their martyrdom, or their spiritual self-offering, Romans 12:1 (Euthym), is insufficient for the depth of the words."
3. "What truth, is evident from John 17:17, where, in the repetition, ὁ λόγ. ὁ σὸς ἀλήθειά ἐστιν, the article is also wanting: see also ch. John 1:14; John 4:24: 3 John 1:3, for ἀλήθ, without the article."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The only difference between the application of the same term to Christ and the disciples is, as applied to Christ, that it means only to 'consecrate'; whereas, in application to the disciples, it means to consecrate with the additional idea of previous sanctification, since nothing but what is holy can be presented as an offering."
2. "The whole self-sacrificing work of the disciples appears here as a mere result of the offering of Christ."
3. "Though the article is wanting in the original here, we are not to translate, as in the Margin, 'truly sanctified'; for the reference seems plainly to be 'the truth' mentioned in John 17:17."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I sanctify myself - I consecrate myself exclusively to the service of God."
2. "That they also might have an example of the proper manner of laboring in the ministry, and might learn of me how to discharge its duties."
3. "That they might be made pure by the effect of my sanctifying myself - that is, that they might be made pure by the shedding of that blood which cleanses from all sin."

### John Calvin:
1. "By these words he explains more clearly from what source that sanctification flows, which is completed in us by the doctrine of the Gospel."
2. "As the blessing on the first-fruits is spread over the whole harvest, so the Spirit of God cleanses us by the holiness of Christ and makes us partakers of it."
3. "He has, so to speak, presented us to his Father in his own person, that we may be renewed to true holiness by his Spirit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It was for the very purpose of bringing them to a consecration like His own that His whole work of love and sacrifice had been freely undertaken."
2. "The following words express, with special reference to the disciples, the end which Jesus had been desirous to attain...that all might be done ‘in truth,’ not simply truly, but in conformity with the real, the essential, the everlasting."
3. "Finally, let us notice that the consecration spoken of is, alike in the case of Jesus and of His disciples, not a process but an act completed at once."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I sanctify myself. To his holy ministry to which the Father 'sanctified' him... That they themselves also may be sanctified in truth." 
2. "The act of Christ helps us, but by no means takes the place of personal consecration on the part of the believer." 
3. "This high and holy prayer and act of Christ should shame anyone who uses the livery of heaven to serve the devil."

### John Gill:
1. "He was made like unto us, yet without sin; he looked like a sinner, but was not one; he was traduced, charged, and treated as such, but was perfectly holy, and free from all sin."
2. "He voluntarily devoted himself to this work, and cheerfully accepted of it... his sacrifice was an Holy One: what he sanctified or offered was 'himself'."
3. "He did not [offer himself] for his own sake, nor for the sake of angels, nor for all men, but for his disciples, as distinct from the world; and not for the apostles only, but for all that the Father had given to him; and that as their substitute and surety, in their room and stead."

### John Wesley:
1. I sanctify myself — I devote myself as a victim, to be sacrificed.
