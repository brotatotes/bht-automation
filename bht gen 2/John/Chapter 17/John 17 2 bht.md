# John 17:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, in praying to the Father, acknowledges that all authority over humanity has been given to him. He recognizes that his role is not only to bring eternal life to all, but to specifically give it to those who have been given to him by the Father. This gift of eternal life is not based on any merit or works of mankind, but is freely given through the grace of God. It is a gift that extends to all believers, as Christ's sacrifice was intended to avail for all.
