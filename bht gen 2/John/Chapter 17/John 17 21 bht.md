## BHT:
The unity among believers is founded on their union with God in Christ, resulting in one faith. This unity, demonstrated in love towards one another, is essential for the world to believe in the divine mission of Christ. The ultimate purpose of this unity is to bring the world to faith and for all believers to share in the glory of God. It is through this shared unity that Christianity is revealed as divine, convincing the world of its truth.
