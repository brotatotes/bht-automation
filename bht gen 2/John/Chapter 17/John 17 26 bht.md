# John 17:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the final moments before His crucifixion, Jesus delivered a profound discourse, disclosing the name of the Father to His disciples. Through the revelation of Himself and His teachings, Jesus made known the nature, perfections, and will of God. As the faithful witness and eternal companion of the Father, Jesus was uniquely qualified to reveal the depths of His love. By imparting this love to His disciples, Christ desired that they would experience the same intimate communion with God that He enjoyed. In this way, they would be empowered to love Jesus and others with the same divine love.
