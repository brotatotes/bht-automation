## BHT:
Eternal life is more than just existence; it is a life of knowing God and His Son Jesus Christ. This knowledge is not acquired through natural means or human effort, but through faith and a personal relationship with God. It is a progressive and transformative understanding that brings true joy and fulfillment. Jesus Christ serves as the mediator between God and humanity, enabling us to know and experience the true God. By knowing Him, we enter into a state of eternal life, a life that is marked by a deep awareness and communion with the divine.

1. "The knowledge spoken of is no mere head or heart knowledge, the mere information of the mind, or excitation of the feelings, but that living reality of knowledge and personal realization, that oneness in will with God, and partaking of His nature, which IS itself life eternal: the knowledge, love, enjoyment, of Him who is infinite, being themselves infinite."
