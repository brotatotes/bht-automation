# John 17:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The knowledge of God and of his Son Jesus Christ is not a mere intellectual understanding but a living reality of oneness with God, which is life eternal. This knowledge is an active pursuit of knowing and perceiving Him, and it is both the way to and the essence of everlasting happiness. It is through Jesus Christ that we can have this saving knowledge of God, as He is the revelation of the Father. This knowledge of God also refutes the false beliefs of Arians and Unitarians who deny the true deity and equality of Jesus with the Father.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The knowledge spoken of is no mere head or heart knowledge, the mere information of the mind, or excitation of the feelings, but that living reality of knowledge and personal realization, that oneness in will with God, and partaking of His nature, which IS itself life eternal."
2. "The very juxtaposition of Jesus Christ here with the Father, and the knowledge of both being defined to be eternal life, is a proof by implication of the Godhead of the former."
3. "He who said 'σου τὸν υἱόν' might well here, before the ἐγώ of John 17:4, use that prophetic Name [Ἰησοῦς] which had been divinely given Him as the Saviour of men, and its weighty adjunct χριστός (= υἱὸς τοῦ θεοῦ), in which Names are all the hidden treasures of that knowledge of which He here speaks."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This life eternal, then, is not mere conscious and unending existence, but a life of acquaintance with God in Christ."
2. "Thee, the only true God—the sole personal living God in glorious contrast equally with heathen polytheism, philosophic naturalism, and mystic pantheism."
3. "Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent—This is the only place where our Lord gives Himself this compound name, afterwards so current in apostolic preaching and writing."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "To know God as he is" is to know and regard him as a lawgiver, a sovereign, a parent, a friend.
3. "To know Jesus Christ is to have a practical impression of him as he is - that is, to suffer his character and work to make their due impression on the heart and life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Those, then, who receive 'eternal life' enter into a condition in which they learn to know the Father and the Son as They really are, learn to know Them in Their love and saving mercy, and are thus enabled to 'glorify' Them."
2. "The knowledge of the Father and the Son is neither the condition of the 'life,' nor the same thing as the 'life.' It is rather that far-off goal which is constantly before us, and to which we come ever nearer, in proportion as we enter more deeply into the life which Christ bestows."
