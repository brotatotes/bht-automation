# John 17:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus prays to be glorified with the Father, desiring a magnificent display of his greatness and power. This glory is not a newly contrived attribute, but one that he has always possessed. It refers to the eternal glory of his divine sonship, veiled during his time on earth. Through his prayer, Jesus seeks full restoration and manifestation of the pre-incarnate glory and fellowship he enjoyed with the Father before the world began. This prayer demonstrates the unity of the Father and Son and serves as a decisive proof of the deity of Christ.
