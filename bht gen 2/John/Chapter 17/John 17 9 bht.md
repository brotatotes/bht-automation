# John 17:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ's prayer in this passage should be understood in the context of his earthly ministry. It is evident that he prayed for his own flock, who were given to him by the Father. However, it is important to note that he does pray for the world in other instances, such as in John 17:21,23, where he prays for the world to believe and know that God had sent him. Therefore, while these specific petitions are for believers, it does not negate the fact that Christ also intercedes for the world.

2. "He cannot therefore mean here that He does not pray (absolutely) for the world, but that He is not now asking for the world, does not pray this thing for the world."
3. "ὅτι σοί εἰσιν in a fuller sense than σοὶ ἦσαν. That was their preparation for Christ; this is their abiding in Him, which is abiding in the Father."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### John Calvin:
1. "He openly declares that he does not pray for the world, because he has no solicitude but about his own flock, which he received from the hand of the Father."
2. "We ought to pray that this man, and that man, and every man, may be saved, and thus include the whole human race, because we cannot yet distinguish the elect from the reprobate; and yet, while we desire the coming of the kingdom of God, we likewise pray that God may destroy his enemies."
3. "Now since Christ prays for the elect only, it is necessary for us to believe the doctrine of election, if we wish that he should plead with the Father for our salvation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The substance of His prayer is that they, occupying His place, may be so preserved as to be what He had been, true to the word given them, victorious over the devil, consecrated, filled with joy, to His glory and the glory of the Father in Him."
2. "Without denouncing the ‘world,’ therefore, He simply sets it aside. It may indeed be asked, Why mention it at all? The answer probably is, to bring out that perfect correspondence between the will of the Son and of the Father, which is the ground of the Son’s confidence in prayer."
3. "In John 17:6 it had been ‘They were thine:’ then they had been looked at only as the possession of the Father. Now ‘they are thine:’ they have been brought back to Him and united to Him in a closer, dearer bond than ever, the bond of fellowship in the Son."
