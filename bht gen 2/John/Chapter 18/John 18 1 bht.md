# John 18:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The brook Cedron was a dark and unclean place, often associated with darkness, filthiness, and troubles. It was a symbol of the world and the challenges faced by believers. Jesus willingly crossed this brook, surrendering Himself to His fate, just as He willingly accepted death to provide atonement and offer Himself as a voluntary sacrifice. This crossing can be seen as a parallel to the crossing of the true David, the King of Israel, in a moment of deep anguish. Through these events, Jesus demonstrated His obedience and triumph over death.
