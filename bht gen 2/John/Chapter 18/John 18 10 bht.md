# John 18:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus was betrayed by Judas, the disciples asked if they should use the sword. Peter, though not named by the other evangelists, valiantly cut off the right ear of the high priest's servant. Unlike the other writers, John provides the details of the man's name and Peter's involvement. John's account is more specific and accurate since he wrote after Peter's death, without the risk of causing harm.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "At this time took place the kiss of Judas, in accordance with the agreement entered into, and to assure the captors that the person thus offering Himself was indeed Jesus of Nazareth, and no substitute for him."
2. "On Peter's act, see Matthew 26:51."
3. "The (external) ear, though severed, was apparently still hanging on the cheek; for our Lord is said in Luke 22:51, to have touched τοῦ ὠτίου αὐτοῦ in performing the healing."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The mention of the servant's name by him is quite natural, and an interesting mark of truth in a small matter."
2. "The man was likely foremost of those who advanced to seize Jesus, and presented himself in the attitude of a combatant; hence his right side would be exposed to attack."
3. "The blow of Peter was evidently aimed vertically at his head."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Contrary to the rule which forbade the carrying of weapons on a feast-day."
2. "The high priest's servant. See on Matthew 26:51."
3. "For ear John and Mark have wjtarion, a diminutive; Luke, oujv, and Matthew, wjtion, a diminutive in form, but not in force."

### John Calvin:
1. "Boldly and courageously, indeed, he incurs great risk on Christ’s account; but as he does not consider what his calling demands, and what God permits, his action is so far from deserving praise, that he is severely blamed by Christ."
2. "In the person of Peter, Christ condemns everything that men dare to attempt out of their own fancy."
3. "Warned by so striking an example, let us learn to keep our zeal within proper bounds; and as the wantonness of our flesh is always eager to attempt more than God commands, let us learn that our zeal will succeed ill, whenever we venture to undertake anything contrary to the word of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Simon Peter...drew it, and smote the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. And the servant’s name was Malchus." 
2. "It is possible that the position of ‘therefore’ in the original, between 'Simon' and 'Peter,' may be designed to call attention to the import of the apostle’s name."
3. "The mention of this fact, as well as of the minute circumstance that the ear cut off was the right ear, illustrates the personal knowledge possessed by John of what he describes."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "After the treacherous kiss of Judas (on the hand or the cheek?), the disciples asked: 'Lord, shall we smite with the sword?'" (Luke 22:49).
2. "Peter missed the man's head as he swerved to his left. Luke also (Luke 22:50) mentions the detail of the right ear, but John alone mentions the man's name and Peter's." (John 18:26).
3. "There was peril to Peter in his rash act as comes out later (John 18:26), but he was dead long before John wrote his Gospel as was Lazarus of whom John could also safely write." (John 12:9-11).

### John Gill:
1. "Peter did this, though he is not mentioned by name by any of the rest, just as they were seizing and apprehending Christ."
2. "Perhaps the reason might be, that Peter was alive when the other evangelists wrote, and therefore it was not safe to say who it was that did it."

### John Wesley:
1. "Then Simon Peter — No other evangelist names him."
2. "Nor could they safely."
