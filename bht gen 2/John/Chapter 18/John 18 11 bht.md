# John 18:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciple's impulsive action of drawing his sword endangered the lives of all. Yet, Jesus declares that even with a single word, he could have summoned a legion of angels for his protection. However, he willingly accepts the cup of suffering, which symbolizes the righteous wrath of God and the punishment for sin, as a result of his love and obedience to the Father.

1. "Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?—This expresses both the feelings which struggled in the Lord's breast during the Agony in the garden—aversion to the cup viewed in itself, but, in the light of the Father's will, perfect preparedness to drink it."
2. "Those who take the sword must run all the risks of human warfare; but Mine is a warfare whose weapons, as they are not carnal, are attended with no such hazards, but carry certain victory."
