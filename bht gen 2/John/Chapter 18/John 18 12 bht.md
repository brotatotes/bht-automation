# John 18:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The captain and his soldiers, along with the Jewish officers, seized and bound Jesus, as foretold in the scriptures. Though Jesus had the power to overwhelm them with a single word, he willingly allowed himself to be taken, demonstrating his voluntary surrender. This divine display of power served to remove any doubt that Jesus was not a helpless victim, but a willing sacrifice. His binding was a necessary act, symbolizing the liberation of our souls from the cords of sin and Satan. As Christ was bound, we are set free.

### John Calvin:
1. "It might be thought strange that Christ, who laid the soldiers prostrate on the ground by a single word, now allows himself to be taken; for if he intended at length to surrender to his enemies, what need was there for performing such a miracle?"
2. "The demonstration of divine power was advantageous in two respects; for, first, it serves to take away the offense, that we may not think that Christ yielded as if he had been overcome by weakness; and, secondly, it proves that in dying he was altogether voluntary."

3. "Whoever reads this, will easily observe a likeness: the messengers of the great sanhedrim go to the fields of Kidron, in the evening, with their sickles and baskets; bind the standing corn; questions and answers pass between them and the people before they reap; and when they have done, they bring the sheaf in their basket to the court, to be dried at the fire."
