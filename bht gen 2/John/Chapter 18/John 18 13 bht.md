# John 18:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus was led away, the influence of Annas, a former high priest and father-in-law to the current high priest, Caiaphas, was evident. It was important for the religious leaders to seek Annas' counsel and approval in their evil plan. The Gospel of John highlights that Jesus was taken to Annas first, before being brought to Caiaphas, emphasizing the historical accuracy of the event. While not much is recorded about what transpired at Annas' house, this detail demonstrates the significance of his position in the unfolding events surrounding Jesus' trial.
