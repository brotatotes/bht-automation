# John 18:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Caiaphas, the high priest, advised that it was expedient for one man to die for the people. This counsel was given out of ill will and malice towards Jesus. The people for whom Christ would die were not all people, but the elect of God, chosen as His special people. The death of Jesus was not merely a martyrdom or example, but a substitutionary act performed on behalf of those He came to save. He willingly took their place and bore the punishment they deserved, serving as their surety before God.
