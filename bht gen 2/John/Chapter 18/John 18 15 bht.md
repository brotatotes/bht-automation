# John 18:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To be a follower of Jesus is a commendable and distinguishing characteristic, especially when it involves enduring sufferings. It is possible that the disciple who followed Jesus was someone who believed in him but had not openly confessed him due to fear of the Pharisees. This disciple, who was known to the high priest, gained access for both himself and Jesus into the palace of the high priest, specifically Caiaphas's house where the Scribes and elders had gathered.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There is no reason to doubt the universal persuasion that by this name John intends himself..." 
2. "The idea that it was Judas Iscariot... is surely too absurd to need confutation." 
3. "The palace of the High Priest was probably the dwelling of both Annas and Caiaphas."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Natural though this was, and safe enough, had he only 'watched and prayed that he enter not into temptation,' as his Master bade him, it was, in his case, a fatal step."
2. "Known unto the high priest—our Evangelist himself, no doubt."
3. "Went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Followed. Imperfect, was following."
2. "The other disciple. The correct reading omits the article."
3. "Palace. Not palace, but court, as Rev."

### John Calvin:
1. "And another disciple. Some have been led astray, by a slight conjecture, to suppose that this disciple was the Evangelist John, because he is accustomed to speak of himself without mentioning his name."
2. "John is not very exact in arranging the narrative, being satisfied with drawing up a brief summary; for, after having related that Peter once denied Christ, he intermingles other matters, and afterwards returns to the other two denials."
3. "We must, therefore, understand that, when Christ was brought before the high priest, admission was not granted to any person who chose, but that the disciple who was known to the high priest requested, as a personal favor, that Peter might be admitted."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Simon is still ‘the rock,’ notwithstanding what he is about to do. It is the very fact indeed that he is ‘Peter’ which shows how terrible is the moment, and how deep the stab inflicted upon Jesus."
2. "But so far is John from wishing to depreciate his fellow-apostle that he regards him, even in the midst of his greatest defection, as the lion of the apostolic band, the man to whom Jesus had given the name Peter in order to indicate his boldness."
3. "Before Peter has well begun his parley at the door, Jesus will be out of sight. Had it not been for an accidental circumstance the two apostles would not have been admitted at all."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Peter's companion was the Beloved Disciple, the author of the book."
2. "How well known the word does not say, not necessarily a personal friend, well enough known for the portress to admit John."
3. "Apparently Annas had rooms in the official residence of Caiaphas."

### John Gill:
1. "To follow Christ is a property of his sheep, and is highly commendable, especially to follow him in sufferings; a greater character a person cannot well have, than to be a follower of Jesus, in the exercise of grace, in the discharge of duty, and in bearing the cross." 
2. "Rather it was some one of the disciples of Christ, who had not openly professed him; one of the chief rulers that believed in him, but, for fear of the Pharisees, had not confessed him."
3. "However, through his knowledge of the high priest, he went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest; not Annas, but Caiaphas; for Christ was now brought from Annas's house to Caiaphas's, where the Scribes and elders were assembled together."
