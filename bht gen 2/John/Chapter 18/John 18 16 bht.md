# John 18:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter finds himself at a critical moment, standing at the door. It would have been wise for him to heed the warning signs and leave, as accessing the door would lead to temptation. However, Peter's curiosity compelled him to remain, and the other disciple, a person of influence, commanded the doorkeeper to let Peter in. This simple act of entering through the door marked the beginning of Peter's journey into a challenging situation.
