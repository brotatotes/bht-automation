# John 18:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of the passover season and approaching harvest time, the night grew cold with heavy dews, chilling Peter both inwardly and outwardly. Despite the warmth of the fire, Peter's decision to join the group and stand in its light shows not only his physical discomfort, but also his spiritual state as he aligned himself with those who opposed Jesus.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
- "John alone notices the material (charcoal) of which the fire was made, and the reason for a fire—the coldness of the night" [WEBSTER and WILKINSON].
- "His wishing to 'see the end' of issue of these proceedings was what led him into the palace, for he evidently feared the worst."
- "The serpent coil is drawn closer; it is a cold night, and why should not he take advantage of the fire as well as others? Besides, in the talk of the crowd about the all-engrossing topic, he may pick up something which he would like to hear."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "It is discouraging to see how the A. V. habitually ignores the imperfect tense, and thus detracts from the liveliness of the narrative."
2. "Matthew does not mention the fire. Mark has to fwv, strictly, the light of the fire. Luke says they had kindled a fire [πυρ]."
3. "Rev., correctly, were warming. So, ver. 25, was standing and was warming, for stood and warmed."

### John Calvin:
1. "This shows how great was Peter’s stupidity, when, without the least concern, he warmed himself along with a multitude of wicked men, after having denied his Master."
2. "It is possible that he may have been restrained by fear lest, in going out of the high priest’s house, he should fall into another danger of the same kind."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In this night of cold he sees Peter associating himself with the enemies of Jesus, perhaps consulting his own comfort while his Master suffers, at all events putting himself in a position where the faithlessness that had already led to his first denial must gain strength."
2. "Whether this idea is brought out also by the ‘fire of charcoal' is more difficult to say. It seems not unlikely that it is, for the word is not used by the other Evangelists; ‘coals of charcoal' are in the Old Testament one of the symbols of Divine judgment."
3. "Apart from this, however, there is enough to show that John 18:18 is not simply historical. The peculiar spirit of the Evangelist appears in it, and we have thus the less occasion for surprise if we meet in the narrative other traces of the same spirit."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A fire of coals (ανθρακιαν). Old word, in LXX, only here and John 21:9 in N.T."
2. "A heap of burning coals (ανθραξ, coal). Cf. our 'anthracite.'"
3. "Peter, unabashed by his lie, joined himself to the group and stood in the light of the fire."

### John Gill:
1. "though it was the passover, and harvest near."
2. "such very great dews fell as made it very cold, especially in the night"
3. "he was cold both inwardly and outwardly; and being so, he gets into bad company"
