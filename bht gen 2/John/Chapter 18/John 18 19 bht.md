# John 18:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The high priest interrogated Jesus about his disciples and his teachings, trying to gather evidence against him. It seems that the high priest wanted to know if Jesus had a strong following and if his teachings were in line with the Scriptures. Jesus, being aware of the high priest's intentions, did not call upon his disciples for support. Instead, he calmly defended the truth of his teachings, showing his innocence and strength in the face of his enemies. All this took place while Peter was denying his association with Jesus.

1. "The high priest interrogates Christ, as if he had been some seditious person, who had split the Church into parties by collecting disciples; and he interrogates him as if he had been a false prophet, who had endeavored to corrupt the purity of the faith by new and perverse doctrines."
2. "Our Lord Jesus Christ, having completely and faithfully discharged the office of teacher, does not enter into a new defense; but, that he may not abandon the cause of truth, he shows that he was prepared to defend all that he had taught."
3. "Yet he likewise reproves the impudence of the high priest, who inquires about a matter perfectly well known, as if it had been doubtful. Not satisfied with having rejected the Redeemer offered, together with the salvation promised to them, they likewise condemn all the exposition of the Law."

3. "All this was doing, and these questions were put to Jesus, whilst Peter was denying him."
