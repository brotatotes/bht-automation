# John 18:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus' betrayal by Judas is highlighted in this passage, as it is mentioned in both Mark and Luke as well. Judas, having knowledge of Jesus' routine and the place of his prayers, sought to exploit this advantage to enable his act of betrayal. However, Jesus did not avoid this confrontation, but rather willingly went to the garden where Judas expected to find him. This demonstrates Jesus' calm and majestic response in the face of his impending suffering.

1. "These accurate notices of our Evangelist are especially found in this last portion of his Gospel."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The baseness of this abuse of knowledge in Judas, derived from admission to the closest privacies of his Master, is most touchingly conveyed here."
2. "Jesus, however, knowing that in this spot Judas would expect to find Him, instead of avoiding it, hies Him thither, as a Lamb to the slaughter."
3. "The garden, however, with its amplitude, its shady olives, its endeared associations, would be congenial to His heart. Here He had room enough to retire."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He had no home in the city, and he sought this place, away from the bustle and confusion of the capital, for private communion with God."
2. "Every Christian should have some place - be it a grove, a room, or a garden - where he may be alone and offer his devotions to God."
