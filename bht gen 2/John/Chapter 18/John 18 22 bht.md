# John 18:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The blow that Jesus received, whether with a hand or a rod, signaled the indignities that were to come. Though Jesus had shown no disrespect to the high priest, the officer's action of striking him was a violation of all law and justice. The enemies of Christ displayed their great rage and tyrannical nature through their cruel and barbarous treatment. However, the equanimity of Jesus remained intact, as he continued to submit to his Heavenly Father's will.
