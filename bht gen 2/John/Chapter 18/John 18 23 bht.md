# John 18:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus handles the situation with the high priest calmly and rationally, even though he was treated with insolence and indecency. He does not resort to using his divine power or showing any signs of anger. Instead, he argues with the high priest in a mild and rational manner. Jesus insists that if he has not spoken anything contrary to truth, reason, and good manners, then he should not be treated in such an injurious way. His response shows that he expects justice to be done, even in the face of unjust oppression.

"He means nothing else than that each of us should be more ready to bear a second injury than to take revenge for the first; so that there is nothing to prevent a Christian man from expostulating, when he has been unjustly treated, provided that his mind be free from rancour, and his hand from revenge."
