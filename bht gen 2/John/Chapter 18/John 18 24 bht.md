# John 18:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus was sent by Annas to Caiaphas after being bound, as mentioned in John 18:13. He was still bound during this transfer, as indicated in John 18:12. This action was carried out by Annas, who saw it as more appropriate for Jesus to be examined before Caiaphas.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I cannot acquiesce in the pluperfect rendering of ἀπέστειλεν, to bring about which the οὖν has apparently been omitted."
2. "The verse simply describes what followed on the preceding: Annas therefore sent Him bound to Caiaphas the High Priest."
3. "The Evangelist had no need to relate the hearing before Caiaphas, for he has related ch. John 11:47 ff.: and we have ere this been familiarized with the habit of our Evangelist not to narrate any further the outward process, where he has already by anticipation substantially given us its result."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The words here literally are, 'Annas sent Him [not 'had sent Him'] to Caiaphas'—and the 'now' being of doubtful authority."
2. "We take this interview, then, with some of the ablest interpreters, to be a preliminary and non-official one with Annas, at an hour of the night when Caiaphas' Council could not convene."
3. "But the building in which both met with Jesus appears to have been the same, the room only being different, and the court, of course, in that case, one."

### Albert Barnes:
1. Compare John 18:13 with Matthew 26:57.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The rendering of the aorist by the pluperfect here is inadmissible, and is a device to bring this examination of Jesus into harmony with that described in Matthew 26:56-68."
2. "Escape the apparent inconsistency between the mention of the high-priest as conducting this examination and the statement of ver. 13, which implies that this was merely a preliminary examination before Annas."
3. "Probably He had been unbound during His examination."

### John Calvin:
1. "This sentence must be read by way of parenthesis; for, having said that Christ was taken to the house of Annas, and having continued his narrative, as if the assembly of the priests had been held there, the Evangelist now reminds the reader that Christ was taken from the house of Annas to the high priest’s house."
2. "But as the tense of the Greek verb ἀπέστειλε has led many people into a mistake, I have preferred translating it by the pluperfect tense, Had sent."
3. "I have chosen to render it in this way, Annas Had Sent, rather than, Annas Sent."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The difficulty connected with these words will be best explained when we have completed the consideration of the three following verses."
2. "In the original Annas is so introduced to our notice as to lead us directly back to the 'Annas' of John 18:13."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The preliminary examination by Annas was over."  
2. "Jesus was bound on his arrest and apparently unbound during the preliminary examination by Annas."

### John Gill:
1. "Who having pleased himself with so agreeable a sight..."
2. "...sent him away in this manner"
3. "...the more proper person to be examined before"

### John Wesley:
1. Now Annas had sent him to Caiaphas — As is implied John 18:13.Bound — Being still bound, John 18:12.
