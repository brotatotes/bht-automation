# John 18:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage highlights the dangerous consequences of associating with wicked individuals and engaging in their conversations, as it offers no benefit and poses risks. Satan cunningly tempts individuals by presenting seemingly good opportunities that can ultimately lead to harm. Peter's denial of being a disciple of Jesus stemmed not from a lack of worthiness or doubt in his entitlement, but rather from fear and shame, ultimately undermining his great privilege and glory.
