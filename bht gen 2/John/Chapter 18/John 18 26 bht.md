# John 18:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The kinsman of Malchus, who had witnessed Peter's violent act, asked him if he was not one of Jesus' disciples. This question, asked with bitterness, was meant to elicit an affirmative answer. The kinsman's phrasing pointedly reminded Peter that he had seen him with his own eyes in the garden just before Jesus was arrested. This was a stark reminder of Peter's previous denials and the fact that he had been observed by someone he had tried to harm. Yet, Peter stood firmly in his denial, despite the weight of evidence against him.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is natural to ask why mention is made of the relationship between the servant who asks this question and the other servant who had suffered through Peter’s hasty zeal. The probable answer is, that the circumstance is not merely historical, but that it aids in developing the idea which the Evangelist has in view."
2. "It heightens the effect. This man would ask his question with far more bitterness than the others...He had been personally aggrieved by the injury inflicted on his kinsman."

### John Gill:
1. "Hearing him so stiffly deny that he was a disciple of Jesus, when he had great reason to believe he was"
2. "as if he should have said, I saw thee with my own eyes along with Jesus, this very night in the garden, beyond Kidron, where he was apprehended, how canst thou deny it?"
3. "and wilt thou stand in it so confidently, that thou art not one of his disciples?"
