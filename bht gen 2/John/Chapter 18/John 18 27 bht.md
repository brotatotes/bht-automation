# John 18:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the early morning, Peter was confronted about his association with Jesus. Some speculate that Peter was in the vicinity when the high priest's servant got his ear cut off. However, Peter vehemently denied his connection to Jesus, swearing and cursing as a desperate attempt to distance himself. The exact location of this confrontation is uncertain, but it is possible that Annas and Caiaphas shared the same dwelling. The gravity of Peter's denial becomes apparent when we consider the significant penalty for causing harm to someone's ears.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But the immediate cause of the revulsion, which made Peter 'weep bitterly,' was, beyond all doubt, this heart-piercing 'look' which his Lord gave him."
2. "Then shall the judged One be revealed as the Judge, and His judges in this chamber appear at His august tribunal; then shall the unrighteous judges be impartially judged; and while they are wishing that they had never been born, He for whom they now watch as their Victim shall be greeted with the hallelujahs of heaven, and the welcome of Him that sitteth upon the throne!"
3. "Then did they spit in His face. And to cover His face, and to buffet Him, and to say unto Him, Prophesy unto us, Thou Christ, who is he that smote Thee?"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The use of the article would seem to mark the time, cock - crowing, rather than the incident."
2. "Compare Matthew 27:1, Matthew 27:2; 11 - 14; Mark 14:1-6; Luke 23:1-5."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Evangelist mentions the crowing of the coch, in order to inform us, that Peter was warned by God at the very time..."
2. "Thus, when any person has once begun to fall through the suggestions of Satan, no voice, no sign, no warning, will bring him back, until the Lord himself cast his eyes upon him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Not one only but many of the eager and excited spectators would ask the question, and of that number Luke and John might easily single out the person peculiarly prominent." 
2. "From the denials of Peter we pass to the nature of the trial of Jesus here recorded and to the judge before whom it took place. Is the trial described by John the same as that of which an account is given us by Matthew (chap. Matthew 26:57-68)? or is it a preliminary examination, having the nature of a precognition, and instituted for the purpose of laying a foundation for the more formal trial before the Sanhedrin?"
3. "But if this solution is not very probable, there is another which fairly meets the case. Annas and Caiaphas may have occupied apartments in the same house surrounding the ‘court’ of our narrative."

### John Gill:
1. "The fine for plucking a man's ears, and which some understand of plucking them off, was four hundred 'zuzim' s, or pence; which, as they answer to Roman pence, amount to twelve pounds ten shillings."
2. "That it might be believed he was not a disciple of Christ, so not the man; he swears in a profane manner, and imprecates the judgments of God upon him."
3. "It was now early in the morning, about three o'clock, or somewhat after."
