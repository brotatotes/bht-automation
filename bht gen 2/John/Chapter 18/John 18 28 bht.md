# John 18:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jews were cautious not to enter the palace themselves because they did not want to become defiled by going into a house that was not purged from leaven. This caution aligns with the command in Deuteronomy 16:4. They were intent on observing the Passover with sincerity and truth, understanding the importance of purity in their religious practices.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Jews would not enter the Prætorium that they might not be defiled, but that they might eat the Passover."
2. "Possibly the law concerning Levitical defilements and purifications had in that age been made more stringent or otherwise modified; possibly, they called some other meal, besides the actual Passover, by its name."
3. "Thus, he says, any time after 3 P.M. on Thursday might be called by St. Mark “the first day of unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the passover,” and by St. Luke, “the day of unleavened bread, when the Passover must be killed,” it being killed after the first and before the second evening on Friday."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The word here rendered 'hall of judgment' is from the Latin, and denotes 'the palace of the governor of a Roman province.'"
2. "They themselves went not into the judgment hall lest they should be defiled—by contact with ceremonially unclean Gentiles."
3. "But as the usages of the Jews appear to have somewhat varied at different times, and our present knowledge of them is not sufficient to clear up all difficulties, they are among the not very important questions which probably will never be entirely solved."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They took care, therefore, to guard themselves against what they considered ceremonial pollution, while they were wholly unconcerned at the enormous crime of putting the innocent Saviour to death, and imbruing their hands in their Messiah’s blood."
2. "But it shows us how much more concerned men will be at the violation of the mere forms and ceremonies of religion than at real crime, and how they endeavor to keep their consciences at ease amid their deeds of wickedness by the observance of some of the outward ceremonies of religion by mere sanctimoniousness."
3. "This defilement, produced by contact with a Gentile, they considered as equivalent to that of the contact of a dead body...and as disqualifying them to partake of the passover in a proper manner."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Sanhedrim could not hold a legal meeting, especially in capital cases, before sunrise; and in such cases judicial proceedings must be conducted and terminated by day."
2. "In capital cases, sentence of condemnation could not be legally pronounced on the day of trial."
3. "The defilement in the present case was apprehended from entering a house from which all leaven had not been removed."

### John Calvin:
1. "That they might not be defiled. In abstaining from all defilement, that, being purified according to the injunction of the Law, they may eat the Lord’s Passover, their religion, in this respect, deserves commendation. But there are two faults, and both of them are very heinous."
2. "So then it is an intolerable mockery, that they expect to please God, provided that they do not contract defilement by touching some unclean thing, though they have disregarded true purity."
3. "In short, they observe the shadow of the passover with a false and pretended reverence, and yet not only do they violate the true passover by sacrilegious hands, but endeavor, as far as lies in their power, to bury it in eternal oblivion."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The hour, immediately after 'cock-crowing,' was certainly not later than 3 or 3:30 A.M."
2. "The Jews were scrupulous because they desired to eat without an hour's delay."
3. "Instead of welcoming the true Paschal Lamb, these Jews rejected Him. What thought more in the manner of our Evangelist than to let us see that, seeking to retain the shadow, and sacrificing the substance for its sake, they lost not only the substance but the shadow too."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "There were two violations of Jewish legal procedure (holding the trial for a capital case at night, passing condemnation on the same day of the trial)."
2. "For Jewish scruples about entering the house of a Gentile see Acts 10:28; Acts 11:3."
3. "This phrase may mean to eat the passover meal as in Matthew 27:17 (Mark 14:12; Mark 14:14; Luke 22:11; Luke 22:15), but it does not have to mean that."

### John Gill:
1. "They did not think it lawful to rent out a house in Judea to a Heathen, or to assist in building a Basilica for them; hence the reason of their caution, and which they were the more observant of, that they might eat the passover; pure and undefiled."
