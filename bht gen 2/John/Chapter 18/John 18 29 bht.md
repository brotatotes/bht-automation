# John 18:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Pilate, aware of the circumstances, went out and asked them, 'What accusation do you bring against this man?' He wanted a formal accusation presented, showing his duty as a Roman judge. However, the priests, unable to condemn Jesus themselves, failed to provide any charge and urged Pilate to accept their previous decision. Pilate's character as a skeptical and cold leader is evident, but he initially tried to maintain fairness and respect for the law by seeking a proper legal inquiry. Pilate's willingness to accommodate the Sanhedrin by going outside his court showed his civility and humanity.
