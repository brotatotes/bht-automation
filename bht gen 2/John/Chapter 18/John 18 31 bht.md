# John 18:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Pilate, perceiving the religious nature of the accusation against Jesus, cleverly defers the judgment to the Jews, challenging them to apply their own law to decide his fate. In response, the Jews admit their inability to carry out capital punishment, revealing that Jesus is considered guilty of a crime deserving death, yet one that they themselves cannot execute. Moreover, their insistence on crucifixion instead of stoning, the typical punishment for such offenses, reveals their intent to subject Jesus to a more degrading and severe form of execution.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "If you suppose I am to have such implicit confidence in your judgment concerning this prisoner as to take his guilt on your word, take him and put him to death (for Œ∫œÅŒØŒΩŒ±œÑŒµ must be thus understood, see below) according to your law; reminding them that the same Roman power which had reserved capital cases for his jurisdiction, also expected proper cognizance to be taken of them, and not that he should be the mere executioner of the Sanhedrim."
2. "From the time when Archelaus was deposed (A.D. 6 or 7), and Jud√¶a became a Roman province, it would follow by the Roman law that the Jews lost the power of life and death."
3. "Pilate seems to have judged these cases at his visits during the festivals; which would fall conveniently for the purpose, it being the custom in Jerusalem, to execute great criminals at the Feasts."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "The Jews themselves say that the power of inflicting capital punishment was taken away about 40 years before the destruction of the temple; but still it is probable that in the time of Christ they had the power of determining on capital cases in instances that pertained to religion."
3. "To do this, they endeavored to make it appear that it was a case of sedition and treason, and one which therefore demanded the interference of the Roman governor."

### John Calvin:
1. "Pilate, offended by their barbarous and violent proceedings, undoubtedly reproaches them by stating that this form of condemnation, which they were eager to carry into effect, was at variance with the common law of all nations and with the feelings of mankind."
2. "He says this ironically; for he would not have allowed them to pronounce on a man a sentence of capital punishment; but it is as if he had said, 'Were he in your power, he would instantly be executed, without being heard in his own defense; and, is this the equity of your Law, to condemn a man without any crime?'"
3. "Thus do wicked men, falsely assuming the name of God as an excuse for their conduct, expose his holy doctrine to the reproaches of enemies, and the world eagerly seizes on it as an occasion of slander."

3. "He drew out at once the admission that they wanted the death of Jesus, not a fair trial for him, but Pilate's approval of their purpose to kill him."

2. "the Jews therefore said unto him, it is not lawful for us to put any man to death thereby insinuating, that he was guilty of a crime, which deserved death, and which they could not inflict"
3. "had they took him and judged him according to their law, which must have been as a false prophet, or for blasphemy or idolatry, the death they must have condemned him to, would have been stoning; but it was crucifixion they were set upon"
