# John 18:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By delivering Jesus to the Gentiles to be crucified, the Jewish leaders fulfilled the prophecy of Jesus' death. Crucifixion, a Roman punishment, was the manner of death signified by Jesus. It was necessary for Jesus to be condemned by the Roman governor in order for him to be crucified. Through his crucifixion, Jesus willingly redeemed his people from the curse of the law.
