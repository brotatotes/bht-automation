# John 18:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As the Jews accused him of a crime deserving death, Pilate decided to call Jesus inside to have a private conversation with him in the praetorium. Pilate's invitation to Jesus may have been influenced by the rumor that a king was to come, and some believed that Jesus could be that person.
