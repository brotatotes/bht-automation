# John 18:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The question regarding Jesus being the King of the Jews aims to determine whether it is a political claim that Pilate has the authority to address or if it is merely a religious matter outside of his jurisdiction. Jesus asks if Pilate raised the question himself or if he derived it from the Jews, as a way to establish the true meaning of his kingship. Jesus seeks a fair trial, reminding Pilate not to be swayed by baseless accusations. Ultimately, the intention is to prove the guilt lies with those orchestrating His death, not with Pilate.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I regard this question ἀπὸ σεαυτ . κ . τ . λ . as intended to distinguish the senses of the word King as applied to Jesus."
2. "If he asked of himself, the word could certainly have but one meaning, and that one would be wrongly applied; if from information derived from the Jews, this very fact would open the way to the true meaning in which He was King of the Jews."
3. "Stier and Ebrard think there may be some reference in ἀπὸ σεαυτοῦ to a momentary earnestness in Pilate’s own mind, a suspicion that his prisoner was what he was charged with being, from the mention of which he immediately recoils, and implies the other side of the dilemma."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "An important question for our Lord's case, to bring out whether the word 'King' were meant in a political sense, with which Pilate had a right to deal."
2. "Or whether he [Pilate] were merely put up to it by His [Jesus'] accusers, who had no claims to charge Him but such as were of a purely religious nature, with which Pilate had nothing to do."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "From any conviction of your own mind, or any apprehension of danger."
2. "This evidently was intended to remind Pilate that nothing was proved against him, and to caution him against being influenced by the malicious accusations of others."
3. "Jesus demanded a just trial, and claimed that Pilate should not be influenced by any reports that he might have heard of him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The real reason seems to be, that the guilt of those now compassing His death may be fixed upon the proper parties."
2. "It is to appear that not Pilate before whose bar He stands, but others altogether are the guilty ones."
3. "The object is attained, for Pilate’s answer shows that he knew of no harm in Jesus."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Of thyself." 
2. "Whether a sincere inquiry on Pilate's part or a trap from the Sanhedrin."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ's meaning is, whether he asserted this from the sentiments of his own mind."
2. "He was desirous of convincing Pilate of his weakness."
3. "To expose the baseness and wickedness of the Jews."
