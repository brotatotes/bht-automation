# John 18:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ clearly states that His kingdom is not of this world, indicating that it is not a physical or political kingdom. Instead, it is a spiritual kingdom, separate from the affairs and systems of this world. This distinction is crucial, as it sets apart Christ's kingdom from worldly kingdoms and reveals its origin and nature. His kingdom is one that transcends earthly power and control.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "not belonging to this world; not springing from, arising out of this world; and therefore not to be supported by this world’s weapons."
2. "if not of this world, then of another world. They assert this other world before the representative of those who boasted of their ‘orbis terrarum.’"
3. "‘If &c., I should have had servants, and those servants would have fought.’"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "My kingdom is not of this world—He does not say 'not over,' but 'not of this world'—that is, in its origin and nature; therefore 'no such kingdom as need give thee or thy master the least alarm.'"
2. "if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews—"A very convincing argument; for if His servants did not fight to prevent their King from being delivered up to His enemies, much less would they use force for the establishment of His kingdom."
3. "is my kingdom not from hence—Our Lord only says whence His kingdom is not—first simply affirming it, next giving proof of it, then reaffirming it. This was all that Pilate had to do with."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He here substantially admits that he did claim to be a king, but not in the sense in which the Jews understood it."
2. "He immediately adds a circumstance in which they differ... If the kingdom of Jesus had been of this kind, he would have excited the multitudes that followed him to prepare for battle."
3. "But though he was a king, yet his dominion was over the heart, subduing evil passions and corrupt desires, and bringing the soul to the love of peace and unity."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Servants [υπηρεται] . Only in this passage in the Gospels, of Christians."
2. "Corresponding with Christ as a king."
3. "Fight [ηγωνιζοντο] . The imperfect tense, denoting action in progress: would now be striving."

### John Calvin:
1. "I am falsely accused, as if I had attempted to produce a disturbance, or to make a revolution in public affairs. I have preached about the kingdom of God; but that is spiritual, and, therefore, you have no right to suspect me of aspiring to kingly power."
2. "If the kingdom of Christ were earthly, it would be frail and changeable...but now, since it is pronounced to be heavenly, this assures us of its perpetuity."
3. "Though there are innumerable storms by which the world is continually agitated, the kingdom of Christ, in which we ought to seek tranquility, is separated from the world."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is not His chief aim to explain the distinction between a spiritual and a political kingdom, a distinction which the Roman governor would hardly have been able to appreciate."
2. "For the same purpose He adds, 'Then would my servants strive that I should not be delivered to the Jews:' where the word 'servants' does not point to spiritual disciples of the Lord, but to such as would be His attendants and soldiers if He were a monarch of this world."
3. "Pilate thought that He could not be a King, else His servants would strive to prevent His present humiliation and fate. That is no argument against My royal claims in their true sense, is the reply, for My kingdom is not one that has its origin in this world."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Christ claims to be king to Pilate, but of a peculiar kingdom." 
2. "Christ then had only a small band of despised followers who could not fight against Caesar."
3. "Christians should never forget the profound truth stated here by Jesus."

### John Gill:
1. "By saying which, he tacitly owns he was a king."
2. "The subjects of Christ's kingdom are not of the world, they are chosen and called out of it."
3. "If Christ's kingdom had been a worldly one, set up on worldly views, and governed with worldly policy, and was to answer some worldly ends, Christ would have had servants enough among the Jews, who would have declared for him, and took up arms in his favour against the Romans."

### John Wesley:
1. "My kingdom is not of this world."
2. "Is not an external, but a spiritual kingdom; that I might not be delivered to the Jews."
