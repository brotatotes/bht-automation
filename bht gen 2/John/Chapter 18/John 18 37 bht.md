# John 18:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ, in this powerful statement about his kingship and mission, emphasizes the divine purpose behind his birth and the witness of truth he brings to the world. His human origin may be comprehensible, but the full extent of his divine nature goes beyond the understanding of Pilate. Jesus came into the world to bear witness to the truth, not just for the Jews, but also for the Gentile rulers who witnessed his passion. Anyone who truly loves and seeks the truth will recognize and heed his voice.
