# John 18:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Pilate's famous question, he reveals his ignorance and indifference towards truth, lacking both the understanding and conviction that truth exists. His cynical skepticism reflects the mindset of the worldly and the powerful. However, Jesus himself is the embodiment of absolute truth, surpassing the limitations of human understanding. Pilate's declaration of finding no crime in Jesus signifies his recognition of Jesus' innocence, but he fails to grasp the true majesty and kingship of the condemned Messiah. In the end, Pilate's ignorance and the Jews' insistence on crucifixion are to their own shame and reproach.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "His celebrated question is perhaps more the result of indifferentism than of scepticism; it expresses, not without scoff and irony, a conviction that truth can never be found: and is an apt representative of the state of the polite Gentile mind at the time of the Lord’s coming."
2. "It was rather an inability than an unwillingness to find the truth."
3. "Pilate mocks both the Witness to the Truth, and the haters of the Truth. His conduct presents a pitiable specimen of the moral weakness of that spirit of worldly power, which reached its culminating point in the Roman empire."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Thou stirrest the question of questions, which the thoughtful of every age have asked, but never man yet answered."
2. "The only certainty...is that nothing is certain, nor more miserable than man, nor more proud."
3. "And the chief priests accused Him of many things, but He answered nothing. Then said Pilate unto Him, Hearest Thou not how many things they witness against Thee? And He answered him to never a word, insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They were now alone in the judgment-hall John 18:33, and as soon as Pilate had asked the question, without waiting for an answer, he went out."
2. "It is evident that he was satisfied, from the answer of Jesus John 18:36-37, that he was not a king in the sense in which the Jews accused him; that he would not endanger the Roman government, and consequently that he was innocent of the charge alleged against him."
3. "How highly should we prize the Bible! And how patiently and prayerfully should we search the Scriptures, that we may not err and die forever!"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Jesus meant the absolute truth."
2. "Pilate's exclamation is neither the expression of an ardent thirst for truth, nor that of the despair of a soul which has long sought it in vain; it is the profession of a frivolous skepticism, such as is frequently met with in the man of the world, and especially in the statesman."
3. "Fault [αιτιαν]. Properly, cause of accusation. Rev., crime."

### John Calvin:
1. "Truth is believed to be a common thing; but God declares, on the contrary, that it far exceeds the capacity of the human understanding."
2. "These, being paradoxes, are disdainfully rejected by the ordinary understanding of men."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Not surely the question of one seriously searching after truth, but simply the question of one who, having no correct ideas as to truth, and no conviction even that there was such a thing."
2. "Were there such a thing as truth, then I might believe Thee, but truth is nothing, and therefore Thy kingly position...need not command my homage."
3. "A Roman governor, a Gentile, declares the innocence and even feels to some extent the true majesty of Him who, though King of the Jews, is rejected and doomed to death by that blinded and guilty people."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This famous sneer of Pilate reveals his own ignorance of truth, as he stood before Incarnate Truth."
2. "Pilate turned with indifference from his own great question and rendered his verdict: 'I find no crime in him.'"
3. "For this use of αιτια see Matthew 27:37; Mark 15:26. Pilate therefore should have set Jesus free at once."

### John Gill:
1. "Whatever he said and taught was truth, and the truth of all doctrine comes from him."
2. "The Gospel is truth in general; it comes from the God of truth; lies in the Scriptures of truth; Christ, who is truth itself, is the substance of it."
3. "This confession is both to the shame of Pilate and the Jews; to the reproach of Pilate, that after this he should condemn him; and of the Jews, that after such a fair and full declaration from the judge, they should insist upon his crucifixion."

### John Wesley:
1. "What is truth? - Said Pilate, a courtier; perhaps meaning what signifies truth?"
2. "Is that a thing worth hazarding your life for?"
