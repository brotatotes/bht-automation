# John 18:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Pilate, faced with the choice between Jesus and Barabbas, followed the custom of releasing a prisoner during the Passover feast. This was not a law, but a long-standing tradition that the people had come to expect. Pilate, hoping to spare Jesus' life, thought that by offering them the opportunity to release Jesus instead of Barabbas, their anger towards Jesus might subside. However, the chief priests and elders, fueled by their hatred for Jesus, insisted that Barabbas should be set free. Ultimately, Pilate left the decision in their hands.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The repeated accusation of Jesus by the chief priests and elders, to which He answered nothing." 
2. "The sending to Herod, and second proclamation of His innocence by Pilate." 
3. "For an instructive specimen of the variations in the Gospel narratives, the four accounts of this incident."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "On the typical import of the choice of Christ to suffer, by which Barabbas was set free"
2. "The subject is the sin offering on the great day of atonement"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word sunhqeia, custom, originally means intimacy, habitual intercourse, and thence naturally passes into the meaning of habit or custom."
2. "Only John puts the statement of this custom into the mouth of Pilate."
3. "More specific than Matthew and Mark, where the expression is general, kata eJorthn, at feast - time."

### John Calvin:
1. "Pilate was all along pondering in what way he might save Christ's life; but, the people being so fiercely enraged, he attempted to keep a middle path, in order to allay their fury."
2. "He thought that it would be enough if Christ, being dismissed as a malefactor, were marked with perpetual ignominy, so he selects Barabbas above all others, in order that, by a comparison with that man, the hatred which they bore to Christ might be softened down."
3. "This custom, by which the Roman governor delivered up to the Jews, every year, at the passover, some criminal, involved a base and heinous crime. It was done, no doubt in order to honor the sacredness of the day, but was, in reality, nothing else than a shameful profanation of it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Surely the poverty, the humiliation, the sufferings of the latter make Him a fit King for the former."
2. "But if so, we must either accept the supposition that ‘at’ or rather ‘in’ the Passover could be applied to the night between the 13th and the 14th (for Pilate is speaking of the present moment), or we must reject the idea that this last is the night in which we are now standing."
3. "It may be worth while to add that those who understand the words of chap. John 19:14, 'the preparation of the Passover,' as meaning the day previous to it, have no right to say that when the words 'at the Passover' occur here, we are substantially at the same point in time."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "This custom, alluded to in Mark 15:6; Matthew 27:15, is termed necessity (αναγκη) in Luke 23:17 (late MSS., not in older MSS.)."
3. "There is contempt and irony in Pilate's use of the phrase 'the king of the Jews.'"

### John Gill:
1. "Not a law, either of God or man's, but a custom."
2. "Being repeated once and again, was now looked for."
3. "He proposes it to them, and leaves it to their option."
