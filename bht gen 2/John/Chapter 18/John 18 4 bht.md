# John 18:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, with his divine knowledge, understood everything that was about to happen to him. He was fully aware of every detail and circumstance that would accompany his suffering. Instead of trying to evade his captors, Jesus willingly went forward to meet them and reveal himself to them. His actions were not driven by fear or surprise, but by a deliberate choice to surrender himself to fulfill the divine purpose of his sacrifice.
