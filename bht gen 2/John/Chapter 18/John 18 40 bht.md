# John 18:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These notorious sinners, chief of them being robbers and murderers, have taken away glory from God and brought destruction upon themselves. In their natural state, they are prisoners, confined in sin and unbelief, enclosed by the law and remaining in a state with no hope. They were deserving of death and considered children of wrath. The priests and people, together in a loud and united voice, cried out clamorously. Despite their criminal nature, they were released when Christ, who was taken, condemned, and died, was let go. This act reveals the hidden wisdom and abundant grace of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "They have not before cried out in this narrative: so that some circumstances must be pre-supposed which are not here related."
2. "There is a solemn irony in these words of the Apostle a Robber!"
3. "Thus was Jesus 'the goat upon which the Lord’s lot fell, to be offered for a sin-offering.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Cried [εκραυγασαν] . Peculiarly of a loud, importunate cry; a shout."
2. "Robber [ληστης] . See on Matthew 26:55; Mark 11:17; Luke 10:30. Matt. calls him a 'notable prisoner' (xxvii. 16)."
3. "Bandits of this kind were numerous in the neighborhood of Jerusalem under the Roman dominion. Their leaders were well known. Josephus describes them by the same word which Matthew uses, ejpishmoi, notable."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word 'again' is here peculiarly worthy of notice...The word can only be a historical reminiscence in the writer’s own mind."
2. "The cry was, 'Not this man but Barabbas;' and the guilty nature of the cry is immediately intensified by a brief but emphatic statement, designed far more to bring out this guilt than to make us acquainted with a fact of history."
3. "A robber! and yet they preferred him to the holy Jesus, to the Only-Begotten of the Father, to their King!"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Cried out (εκραυγασαν). First aorist active of κραυγαζω, old and rare verb from κραυγη, outcry (Matthew 25:6), as in Matthew 12:19."
2. "Not this man (μη τουτον). Contemptuous use of ουτος."
3. "They chose Barabbas in preference to Jesus and apparently Jesus died on the very cross planned for Barabbas."

### John Gill:
1. "These, as he, many of them at least, are notorious sinners, the chief of sinners, robbers and murderers; who have robbed God of his glory, and destroyed themselves; are prisoners, concluded in sin and unbelief, and shut up in the law, and in a pit, wherein is no water, in their natural state; and were, as this man, worthy of death, and by nature children of wrath."
2. "They all, priests and people, in a very clamorous manner, cried out as one man, with one united voice, all at once."
3. "These, though such criminals, and so deserving of punishment, were let go free, when Christ was taken, condemned, and died; and which was according to the wise and secret counsel of Jehovah, and is a large discovery of divine grace."
