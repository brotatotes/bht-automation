# John 18:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Their response of identifying Jesus as Jesus of Nazareth demonstrates a lack of personal acquaintance or recognition. In contrast, Jesus confidently declares, I am He, acknowledging Himself as the one they were seeking while also asserting His divine identity. Furthermore, the presence of Judas among the soldiers highlights the stark contrast between his previous companionship with Jesus and his current role in betraying Him. This moment captures the dramatic tension and spiritual significance of Jesus' interaction with those who sought to apprehend Him, revealing both their ignorance and His unwavering authority.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Some among them knew Him, others probably not. This answer may have been given by someone in authority among the Roman soldiers."
2. "John detected Judas standing among them, and notices the detail, as is his constant habit, by way of enhancing the tragic character of the history."
3. "John adds this touch of exactness to show that the answer 'Jesus of Nazareth' was not given because they were ignorant of His Person, but because they feared to say it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "They answered . . . Jesus of Nazareth‚Äîjust the sort of blunt, straight forward reply one expects from military men, simply acting on their instructions."
2. "I am He‚Äî(See on :-)."
3. "Judas . . . stood with them‚ÄîNo more is recorded here of his part of the scene, but we have found the gap painfully supplied by all the other Evangelists."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Of Nazareth [œÑŒøŒΩ ŒΩŒ±Œ∂œâœÅŒ±ŒπŒøŒΩ] . Literally, the Nazarene."
2. "Stood [ŒµŒπœÉœÑŒ∑Œ∫ŒµŒπ] . Imperfect tense. Rev., correctly, was standing."

### John Calvin:
1. "He replies mildly that he is the person whom they seek, and yet, as if they had been struck down by a violent tempest, or rather by a thunderbolt, he lays them prostrate on the ground."
2. "We may infer from this how dreadful and alarming to the wicked the voice of Christ will be."
3. "At that time he stood as a lamb ready to be sacrificed; his majesty, so far as outward appearance was concerned, was utterly gone; and yet when he utters but a single word, his armed and courageous enemies fall down."


### Philip Schaff:
1. "The answer may perhaps reveal the light in which Judas had represented Jesus to the Roman authorities, ‚Äòof Nazareth,‚Äô a Galilean, prone to revolt..."
2. "Jesus saith unto them, I am he. Before the effect produced by the reply is related, a parenthetical clause is introduced."
3. "And Judas also, which betrayed him, was standing with them... The powers of evil are concentrated in him; and to bring him thus prominently forward as sharing the fate of others illustrates in the most striking manner the victory of Jesus even in this hour of apparent defeat."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A vivid picture of Judas in the very act of betraying Jesus."
2. "Jesus stepped forth and affirmed that he was the one whom they were seeking."

### John Gill:
1. "Their answer is not, 'thee'; for they knew him not, their eyes were holden, or struck with dimness, or blindness, as the men of Sodom were."
2. "Jesus saith unto them, I am [he]; or 'I am', respecting his name Jehovah, averring himself to be the Christ, and owning himself under the name they were pleased to call him by."
3. "It also expresses the different company Judas was in; a little while ago, he was at supper with Christ and the other disciples, and now he is at the head of a band of soldiers, and others, to betray him."
