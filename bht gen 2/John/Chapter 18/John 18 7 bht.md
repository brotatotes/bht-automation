# John 18:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The soldiers and officers, who were initially struck down by Jesus' power, were allowed by the same divine person to rise, showing His great clemency and goodness. This also serves as a reminder of the hardened hearts of these individuals, as even witnessing miracles does not necessarily lead to repentance without the work of powerful and efficacious grace. Their response of identifying Jesus as Jesus of Nazareth, even after this display of power, reflects their persistent malice and refusal to acknowledge Him as the Messiah.
