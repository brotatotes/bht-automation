# John 18:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ spoke these words to emphasize that none of the elect, who were given to Him by the Father, would be lost. This statement does not solely refer to the apostles but applies to all the chosen ones. It demonstrates Christ's authority over the spirits of men and serves as evidence of His divine nature. The omission of the reference to Judas as the son of perdition signifies that he had been openly revealed for who he truly was at this point.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "An unquestionable proof, if any were wanted, that the words of ch. 17 are no mere description of the mind of our Lord at the time, nor free arrangement of His words, but his very words themselves."
2. "The words unquestionably had a much deeper meaning than any belonging to this occasion; but that the remarks so often made in this commentary on the fulfilment of prophecies must be borne in mind."
3. "To ‘fulfil’ a prophecy is not to exhaust its capability of being again and again fulfilled: that the words of the Lord have many stages of unfolding; and that the temporal deliverance of the Apostles now, doubtless was but a part in the great spiritual safe-keeping which the Lord asserted by anticipation in these words."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "That the saying might be fulfilled which he spake, Of them which thou gavest me have I lost none." 
2. "The reference is to such sayings as John 6:39; John 17:12; showing how conscious the Evangelist was, that in reporting his Lord's former sayings, he was giving them not in substance merely, but in form also."
3. "Observe, also, how the preservation of the disciples on this occasion is viewed as part that deeper preservation undoubtedly intended in the saying quoted."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He had kept them for more than three years, so he still sought their welfare."
2. "Even when his death was near."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ did not keep the apostles safe to the last, but this he accomplished, that, amidst incessant dangers, and even in the midst of death, still their eternal salvation was secured."
2. "Let us consider how great their weakness was; what do we think they would have done, if they had been brought to the test? While, therefore, Christ did not choose that they should be tried beyond the strength which he had given to them, he rescued them from eternal destruction."
3. "Though he try our faith by many temptations, still he will never allow us to come into extreme danger without supplying us also with strength to overcome."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The powers of the world and of evil are so identified in his eyes that oppression by, or deliverance from, the one is oppression by, or deliverance from, the other."
2. "The temporal is the shadow of the eternal, and the principles working out upon man’s stage here stretch into the long hereafter."
3. "The temporal deliverance thus afforded was really a means to secure the spiritual safety of the disciples."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "That might be fulfilled."
2. "The regular formula (John 17:12) for Scripture, here applied to the prophecy of Jesus (John 17:12) as in verse John 18:32."
3. "John treats the saying of Jesus as on a par with the O.T."

### John Gill:
1. "which though it has a peculiar respect to the apostles, is true of all the elect of God; who are given to Christ, and shall none of them be lost, neither their souls nor bodies"
2. "a very considerable instance of the power which Christ had over the spirits of these men, to restrain them; and so a proof of his proper deity"
3. "the saving clause, 'but the son of perdition', is here left out, because Judas, who is designed by that character, was now openly declared to be what he was"

### John Wesley:
1. John 17:12.
