# John 19:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The scourging of Jesus, though a legal preliminary to crucifixion, was inflicted unlawfully in an attempt to appease and satisfy the Jews. This punishment was severe, involving beating with scourges tipped with leaden balls or spikes. It is clear from the severity of the scourging that Jesus was unable to bear His own cross. Through His innocent suffering, Jesus fulfills the decree of Heaven and attests to His freedom from all sin. The mockery that followed the scourging further emphasized the deepening humiliation and agony that Jesus endured on His journey to the cross.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The reason or purpose of this scourging does not here appear; but in Luk 23:21-23 we read that after the choice of Barabbas, Pilate asked them what should be done with Jesus? And when they demanded that He should be crucified, Pilate, after another assertion of his innocence, said παιδεύσας αὐτὸν ἀπολύσω. Thus it is accounted for."
