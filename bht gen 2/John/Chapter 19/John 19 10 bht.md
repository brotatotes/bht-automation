# John 19:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus' refusal to answer Pilate's questions puzzled him. As the Roman governor and judge, Pilate possessed the authority to determine Jesus' fate. He marveled at Jesus' lack of fear and silence, especially considering his high position and power over life and death. However, Pilate's wonder was rooted in his own mindset, for it swiftly shifted from fear to arrogant boasting. This change showcased his disregard for justice and his wickedness as a magistrate, attempting to intimidate someone he believed to be innocent.
