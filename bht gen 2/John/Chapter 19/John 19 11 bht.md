# John 19:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Pilate, in claiming to possess power over Jesus, fails to recognize that Jesus is innocent and has done nothing to warrant his jurisdiction. Instead, it is God who has ordained Pilate's authority, allowing him to hold the power he possesses. Furthermore, Caiaphas, the one responsible for delivering Jesus to Pilate, bears even greater culpability, as he is aware of Jesus' innocence, yet still orchestrates His unjust handling. Thus, the exercise of power is not a reflection of the guilt or wrongdoing of Jesus, but rather reveals the sinful actions and motivations of those involved in delivering and judging Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This saying, observes Meyer, breathes truth and grace."
2. "The great stress is on the word á¼„Î½Ï‰Î¸ÎµÎ½, on which Grotius strikingly says (ungewohnlich treffend, Stier), 'inde scilicet, unde ortus sum!'"
3. "The sinfulness of His enemies. The whole delegation from above, power included, is in the neuter Î´ÎµÎ´Î¿Î¼Î­Î½Î¿Î½, q. d. except by appointment from above."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Thou thinkest too much of thy power, Pilate: against Me that power is none, save what is meted out to thee by special divine appointment, for a special end."
2. "Caiaphas, too witâ€”but he only as representing the Jewish authorities as a body."
3. "Hath the greater sinâ€”as having better opportunities and more knowledge of such matters."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "No power - No such power as you claim. You have not originated the power which you have. You have just as much as is given, and your ability extends no further."
2. "Men of office and talent, as well as others, should remember that God gives them what they have, and that they have no influence except as it is conceded to them from on high."
3. "Thus God overrules the wickedness and folly of men. He so orders affairs that the true character of men shall be brought out, and makes use of that character to advance his own great purposes."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. He that delivered. Caiaphas.

### John Calvin:
1. "Thou claimest every thing for thyself, as if thou hadst not to render an account one day to God; but it was not without His providence that thou wast made a judge. Consider, then, that His heavenly throne is far higher than thy tribunal."
2. "Therefore, he who delivered me to thee...renders their guilt more heinous and less excusable on another ground, that they constrain a divinely appointed government to comply with their lawless desires; for it is a monstrous sacrilege to pervert a holy ordinance of God for promoting any wickedness."
3. "Yet Christ does not aggravate their guilt, for the purpose of extenuating that of Pilate...but rather includes them all in the same condemnation, because they equally pollute a holy power."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "These words call attention to the fact that the source whence Pilate derived his power, â€˜from above,â€™ was the same as that whence Jesus came."
2. "In using his power, therefore, against the Son of God, he was really fighting against God."
3. "In this reply Jesus had done more than speak as an innocent man. He had assumed a position of superiority alike to His accusers and His judge."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Thou wouldest have (Î¿Ï…Îº ÎµÎ¹Ï‡ÎµÏ‚). Imperfect active indicative without Î±Î½, but apodosis of second-class condition as in John 15:22; John 15:24."
2. "Except it were given thee (Îµ Î¼Î· Î·Î½ Î´ÎµÎ´Î¿Î¼ÎµÎ½Î¿Î½). Periphrastic past perfect indicative of Î´Î¹Î´Ï‰Î¼ (a permanent possession)."
3. "From above (Î±Î½Ï‰Î¸ÎµÎ½). From God (cf. John 3:3), the same doctrine of government stated by Paul in Romans 13:1. Jesus makes God the source of all real 'authority'."

1. "Thou couldst have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above: ... but reference is had to the place from whence he came, and to the decree and council of God above, and the agreement between the eternal three in heaven."
2. "Christ speaks of a power he had against him, that is, of taking away his life; he had no lawful power to do it at all; nor any power, right or wrong, had it not been given him by God."
3. "Power was given to Pilate from heaven against him; not for any evil he himself had committed, or merely to gratify the envy and malice of the Jews, but for the salvation of God's elect, and for the glorifying of the divine perfections."

### John Wesley:
1. "Thou couldst have no power over me â€” For I have done nothing to expose me to the power of any magistrate."
2. "Therefore he that delivered me to thee, namely, Caiaphas, knowing this, is more blamable than thou."
