# John 19:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Pilate, reluctant to go against the Jewish leaders, was increasingly convinced of Jesus' innocence and hesitant to hand him over to their malicious envy. However, the accusation that releasing Jesus would make him an enemy of Caesar and not Caesar's friend, posed a threat of impeachment, a consequence feared by officials like Pilate. Although Pilate recognized Jesus' words as majestic and mild, the fear of losing favor with Caesar compelled him to ultimately deliver Jesus into their hands, thus succumbing to their treacherous demands.
