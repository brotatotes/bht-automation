# John 19:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Pilate, fearing an accusation at Rome, chose to sacrifice Jesus rather than risk his own misrule being exposed. Reluctantly, Pilate ascended the judgment seat to pronounce the solemn sentence of death on Christ. This judgment seat, known as the Œ≤·øÜŒºŒ±, was an elevated platform with a mosaic or tessellated pavement, symbolizing its importance. Jesus' condemnation from this lofty place aligns with his role as the supreme Judge who will one day acquit believers. The conflicting thoughts in Pilate's mind highlight the internal struggle he faced as he played the dual roles of judge and reluctant executor.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In such a perplexity, a man like Pilate could not long hesitate. As Caiaphas had before said, it were better that one even innocent man should die, than that all should perish: so now in like case Pilate decided rather to sacrifice Jesus though innocent, than to expose himself to so great danger." 
2. "The Œ≤·øÜŒºŒ± was in front of the pr√¶torium, on an elevated platform; Gabbatha, probably from ◊í÷º÷∏◊ë÷∑◊î÷º, altus fuit, which was paved with a tessellated pavement."
3. "Such a pavement Julius C√¶sar carried about on his expeditions."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He came here to deliver him, in due form of law, into the hands of the Jews."
2. "This was an area or room of the judgment hall whose floor was made of small square stones of various colors."
3. "The name given to the place by the Hebrews was conferred from its being the place of the tribunal, as an elevated place."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He was afraid of an accusation at Rome before Tiberius, an accusation which could be justified by his misrule."
2. "The best texts omit the article, which may indicate that the tribunal was an improvised one."
3. "Thus the Aramaic term is not a translation of the Greek term, which indicates that the place, wherever it was, was distinguished by a mosaic or tessellated pavement."

### John Calvin:
1. "We see what conflicting opinions passed through the mind of Pilate, as if he had been a stage-player who was acting two characters."
2. "He ascends the judgment-seat, in order to pronounce sentence of death on Christ solemnly, and in the customary form; and yet he declares openly, that he does so reluctantly and against his conscience."
3. "It was proper, therefore, that Christ should be condemned from a lofty place, that he, coming from heaven as the supreme Judge, may acquit us at the last day."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Greek name was probably given because the floor was laid down in the mosaic work common in those days in places of importance, such as theatres and halls of justice, and before altars of the gods. It literally means inlaid with stones."
2. "The Aramaic word Gabbatha signifies a hill or elevated spot of ground, so that we are to think of a spot in the open air where a tribunal was erected on a rising ground, the top of which was laid with tesselated pavement."
3. "The decisive moment is now come; and, according to the frequent method of our Evangelist, the way is prepared for it by the mention of several particulars."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Took his seat upon the Œ≤Œ∑ŒºŒ±" (the raised platform for the judge outside the palace as in Acts 7:5). 
2. "The Pavement (ŒõŒπŒ∏ŒøœÉœÑœÅœâœÑŒøŒΩ). Late compound from ŒªŒπŒ∏ŒøœÇ, stone, and the verbal adjective œÉœÑœÅœâœÑŒøœÇ form œÉœÑœÅœâŒΩŒΩœÖŒº, to speak, a mosaic or tesselated pavement, spread with stones, in 2 Chronicles 7:3, Josephus, Epictetus, papyri." 
3. "The Chaldean name ŒìŒ±Œ≤Œ≤Œ±Œ∏Œ±, an elevation, was apparently given because of the shape."

### John Gill:
1. "A freeing of Jesus would show an unfriendliness to Caesar"
2. "He now takes his place, and sits down as a judge, in order to give the finishing stroke to this affair"
3. "This place, in the Greek tongue, was called 'Lithostrotos'; or 'the pavement of stones'"

### John Wesley:
1. "Pilate sat down on the judgment seat."
2. "Which was then without the palace, in a place called, in Greek, the pavement, on account of a beautiful piece of Mosaic work, with which the floor was adorned: but in Hebrew, Gabbatha."
3. "Or the high place, because it stood on an eminence, so that the judge sitting on his throne might be seen and heard by a considerable number of people."
