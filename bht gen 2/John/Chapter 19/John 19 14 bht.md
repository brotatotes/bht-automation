# John 19:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On the day before the Sabbath, known as the preparation, both the Jews and Pilate were eager to bring the matter to a conclusion. This term preparation was used to refer to every Friday, as it was the day of preparation for the Sabbath. Furthermore, when the passover fell on a Friday, that day was specifically called the preparation of the passover. This helps us understand the context and urgency surrounding the events that unfolded during this time.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The signification, ‘Friday in the Passover week’ (using παρασκευή for ‘day before the Sabbath," as reff. Matt., Luke, and τοῦ π . as in σάββατον τοῦ π . Ps.-Ign. ad Philip. c. 13, p. 937, ed. Migne), has found many and some recent defenders."
2. "παρ  .   τοῦ π  . answers to עֶרֶב הפֶּסַח , and is ‘  the vigil of the Passover ,’ i.e. the day preceding the evening when the Passover was killed."
3. "The words ἴδε ὁ βασ  .   ὑμ  . seem to have been spoken in irony to the Jews in the same spirit in which afterwards the title was written over the cross: partly perhaps also, as in that case, in consequence of the saying in John 19:12 , to sever himself altogether from the suspicion there cast on him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It was the preparation—that is, the day before the Jewish sabbath."
2. "The true reading here is probably, 'the third hour'—or nine A.M.—which agrees best with the whole series of events, as well as with the other Evangelists."
3. "Having now made up his mind to yield to them, he takes a sort of quiet revenge on them by this irony, which he knew would sting them. This only reawakens their cry to despatch Him."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The preparation of the passover - See the notes at Mark 15:42."
2. "The sixth hour - Twelve o’clock noon."
3. "Mark says Mark 15:25 that it was the third hour. See the difficulty explained in the notes at that place."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Sixth hour. See on 1 39.

### John Calvin:
1. "The Evangelists appear to differ, and even to contradict each other, in the computation of time."
2. "It is plain enough from other passages that the day was at that time divided into four parts, as the night also contained four watches."
3. "Hence we infer that Christ was crucified at or about the sixth hour; for, as the Evangelist afterwards mentions, (John 19:20,) the place was near to the city."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The day now dawning, and the events now occurring, were 'a preparation of the Paschal lamb' yet not of the lamb of the Jewish feast, but of the true Paschal Lamb, Jesus Himself, of the Lamb now on His way to be sacrificed for the life of His people."
2. "The particular view to be taken of chap. John 19:28-37 also lends confirmation to what has been said."
3. "Both the place and the time for the last step in the trial of Jesus have now been mentioned. Pilate is on his judgment seat, on a spot elevated above the people. The true Lamb of God is before him ready for the sacrifice. The awful 'hour is come.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Preparation of the passover (παρασκευη του πασχα). That is, Friday of passover week, the preparation day before the Sabbath of passover week (or feast)."
2. "About the sixth hour (ως εκτη). Roman time, about 6 A.M. (a little after 6 no doubt) when Pilate rendered his final decision."
3. "Behold your king (Ιδε ο βασιλευς υμων). Ιδε is here an exclamation with no effect on the case of βασιλευς just as in John 1:29. The sarcasm of Pilate is aimed at the Jews, not at Jesus."

### John Gill:
1. "The preparing and making ready the passover the evangelists speak of, were on the same day it was eaten, and design the getting ready a place to eat it in, and things convenient for that purpose, and the killing the lamb, and dressing it, and the like."
2. "And it may be observed, that it is sometimes only called 'the day of the preparation,' and 'the preparation.'"
3. "This seems to be contrary to the practice of the Jews in the time of Christ, as related by the evangelists, understanding by the preparation they speak of, a preparation of food for the sabbath."

### John Wesley:
1. "For this reason both the Jews and Pilate were desirous to bring the matter to a conclusion." 
2. "Every Friday was called the preparation, (namely, for the Sabbath.)" 
3. "And as often as the passover fell on a Friday, that day was called the preparation of the passover."
