# John 19:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The chief priests, representing the theocratic government of Israel, stubbornly declared their allegiance to Caesar, rejecting the spiritual kingdom of God. In their eagerness for crucifixion, their insistent cry echoed their impatience. By renouncing the Messianic hope and confessing allegiance to a pagan power, they condemned themselves to misery and eternal separation from God. This vile act of rejecting their true King, Jesus, stripped them of power and ultimately led to the destruction of their government.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "a degrading confession from the chief priests of that people of whom it was said, 'The Lord your God is your King.'" 
2. "However, it furthered the present purpose, and to this all was sacrificed, including truth itself."
3. "Some of those who now cried this, died miserably in rebellion against Cæsar forty years afterwards."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Crucify your King? . . . We have no king but Cæsar."
2. "Some of those who thus cried died miserably in rebellion against Cæsar forty years afterwards. But it suited their present purpose."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The pronoun of remote reference isolates and sharply distinguishes them from Jesus." 
2. "These chief representatives of the theocratic government of Israel thus formally and expressly renounce it, and declare their allegiance to a temporal and pagan power." 
3. "This utterance is 'the formal abdication of the Messianic hope.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "This is a display of shocking madness, that the priests, who ought to have been well acquainted with the Law, reject Christ, in whom the salvation of the people was wholly contained, on whom all the promises depended, and on whom the whole of their religion was founded..."
2. "For, first, they revolt from the spiritual kingdom of God; and, secondly, they prefer the tyranny of the Roman Empire, which they greatly abhorred, to a just government, such as God had promised to them..."
3. "Thus wicked men, in order to fly from Christ, not only deprive themselves of eternal life, but draw down on their heads every kind of miseries."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Instinct tells them that the last moment when they may accomplish their object is arrived: and, roused to the utmost pitch of fury by the words of Pilate, they cry out, with a quick repetition of words corresponding to their feelings, Let him be hurried off to crucifixion."
2. "The chief priests, the heads of the Theocracy of Israel, give the answer, which thus comes upon us with a more terrible force than it could otherwise have done... 'We have no king but Cæsar.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This thing has gotten on the nerves of the crowd. Note the repetition." 
2. "Pilate weakly repeats his sarcasm: 'Your king shall I crucify?'"
