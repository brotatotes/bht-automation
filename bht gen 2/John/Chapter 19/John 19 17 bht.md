# John 19:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Jesus went out to be crucified, he initially carried the transverse beam of his cross for himself, before the Jews encountered Simon the Cyrenian and compelled him to bear it after Jesus. This act of carrying the cross signified how Christ took upon himself the burden of our sins and the punishment that was rightfully ours. The custom of making the condemned person carry their own cross highlighted the weight and shame associated with crucifixion.
