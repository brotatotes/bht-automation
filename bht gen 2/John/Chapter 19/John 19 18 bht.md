# John 19:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, as a surety, took the place of his people and died for their sins. This shows the humbleness of Christ and the righteousness of justice, as well as the wisdom, grace, and love of our Redeemer. He willingly endured every reproachful circumstance necessary for the redemption of his people and the fulfillment of divine purposes and promises.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But in this, as in many other of their doings, 'the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors'." 
2. "Then said Jesus, 'Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do'." 
3. "Often have we occasion to observe how our Lord is the first to fulfill His own precepts—thus furnishing the right interpretation and the perfect Model of them."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "All the Synoptists describe the character of the two who were crucified with Jesus."
2. "John says nothing about the character of these two, but simply describes them as two others."

### John Calvin:
1. "As if the severity of the punishment had not been sufficient of itself, he is hanged in the midst between two robbers, as if he not only had deserved to be classed with other robbers, but had been the most wicked and the most detestable of them all."
2. "We ought always to remember, that the wicked executioners of Christ did nothing but what had been determined by the hand and purpose of God."
3. "Assuredly we are prodigiously stupid, if we do not plainly see in this mirror with what abhorrence God regards sin; and we are harder than stones, if we do not tremble at such a judgment as this."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "On the lingering torture of death by crucifixion it is unnecessary to dwell."
2. "If so, the object must have been still more to bring out that idea of His royalty with which Pilate to the last mocked the Jews."

1. "They crucified." The soldiers just as in Acts 22:24; the scourging of Paul was to be done by the soldiers.

### John Gill:
1. "He, as a surety, standing in the legal place, and stead of his people; hence he died in their room, and for their sins: this shows the low estate of Christ, the strictness of justice, the wisdom of God in salvation, and the grace and love of the Redeemer."
2. "Who condescended to everything, and every circumstance, though ever so reproachful, which were necessary for the redemption of his people, and the glory of the divine perfections, and for the fulfilment of purposes, promises, and predictions."
