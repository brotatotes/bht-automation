# John 19:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The inscription placed above Jesus on the cross read, Jesus of Nazareth, the king of the Jews. These words, drawn up by Pilate himself, were meant to belittle the Jews, not Jesus. The title does not imply any disgrace to Christ, but rather reveals his true identity as the Messiah. John is the only gospel writer to mention that Pilate wrote the inscription in the technical Latin word titlon, and his account is the most detailed. It was by divine guidance that the title was proclaimed in three languages, ensuring that all people could read and understand it.
