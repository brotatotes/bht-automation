# John 19:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The soldiers, in their malicious mockery of Jesus as a king, twisted together a crown of thorns and placed it on his head. This act, along with their dressing him in a purple robe, was an effort to demean and dishonor him. The crown of thorns, symbolizing wickedness and the curse upon the earth, was a representation of the wicked men who surrounded Jesus as he suffered on the cross. Their actions, though carried out by human hands, were ultimately part of God's plan to reconcile the world to himself through the death of his Son.
