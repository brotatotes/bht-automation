# John 19:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The inscription on the cross was written in three languages: Latin, Hebrew, and Greek. The use of Latin reflected the authority and power of the Roman Empire. Hebrew was chosen because it was the language of the people, the language of the nation. Greek was used to ensure that the message could be understood by the Hellenists who were attending the feast. This multilingual inscription served not only as a public example and deterrent, but also as a means of communicating the message to different groups of people.
