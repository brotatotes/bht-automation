# John 19:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the chief priests read the title, they were greatly offended because it elevated Jesus by calling him the King of the Jews. They were worried that it reflected poorly on their nation, as crucifying their own king brought disgrace. Their discomfort led them to request a change in the title, hoping that Jesus would be portrayed as a seditious and treasonous person who sought an earthly kingdom.
