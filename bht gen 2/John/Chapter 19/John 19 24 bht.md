# John 19:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In light of the precise details of this passage, it is evident that no event in David's life or any other event can adequately mirror the fulfillment described in the 22nd Psalm. The prophet, under the influence of a supernatural ecstasy, spoke as the Messiah, conveying the message dictated by the Spirit, oblivious to his own circumstances. This fulfillment is exemplified in the division of Christ's garments among those involved in His crucifixion, as prophesied in the psalm.
