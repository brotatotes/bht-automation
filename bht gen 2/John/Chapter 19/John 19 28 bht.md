2. "Christ had not yet died: and had not yet risen again; but he saw that nothing now remained to hinder him from going forward to death and resurrection.

1. "Are now finished (Œ∑Œ¥Œ∑ œÑŒµœÑŒµŒªŒµœÉœÑŒ±). Perfect passive indicative of œÑŒµŒªŒµœâ. See same form in verse John 19:30. As in John 13:1, where Jesus is fully conscious (knowing, ŒµŒπŒ¥œâœÇ) of the meaning of his atoning death."
