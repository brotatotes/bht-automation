# John 19:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Vinegar, commonly used by the Jews for drink and to alleviate thirst, was offered to Jesus on a stalk of hyssop, a plant known for its sweet smell. The hyssop used in this case must have been a large and sturdy stalk, as the hyssop plant can grow to be quite substantial. This image of the hyssop on the cross brings to mind the account of Blandina the martyr, who was crucified on a low cross and became food for beasts of prey. The use of hyssop in this context emphasizes the humbling and sacrificial nature of Jesus' crucifixion.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The ὄξος was the posca, the sour wine, or vinegar and water, the common drink of the Roman soldiers."
2. "ὑσσώπῳ an aromatic plant growing on walls, common in the south of England and on the Continent, with blue or white flowers, and having stalks about 1½ foot long, which would in this case be long enough, the feet of the crucified person not being ordinarily raised above that distance from the ground."
3. "It was much used for sprinkling, Exodus 12:22 ; Leviticus 14:4 &c.: Psalms 51:7."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Though a stalk of this plant does not exceed eighteen inches in length, it would suffice, as the feet of crucified persons were not raised high."
2. "This 'loud voice,' noticed by three of the Evangelists, does not imply...that our Lord's strength was so far from being exhausted that He needed not to die then."
3. "But just as even His own dying saints, particularly the martyrs of Jesus, have sometimes had such gleams of coming glory immediately before breathing their last, as to impart to them a strength to utter their feelings which has amazed the bystanders, so this mighty voice of the expiring Redeemer was nothing else but the exultant spirit of the Dying Victor."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The vinegar mingled with gall (Matthew 27:34), or the wine mingled with myrrh (Mark 14:23) was offered to Jesus before his crucifixion as a stupefying draught."
2. "The hyssop gives a hint of the height of the cross, as the greatest length of the hyssop reed was not more than three or four feet."
3. "The vinegar in this case was offered in order to revive Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "The meaning is, that they fastened it to the end of a bunch of hyssop, that it might be raised to Christ’s mouth."
2. "In that country, hyssops grow as large as small shrubs."
3. "Car l’a les hyssopes sont grans comme petits arbnsseaux."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is possible that the vinegar here referred to may have been the mixture of vinegar and water used by the Roman soldiers to quench their thirst; or it may even have been a vessel of vinegar itself, of which large quantities were used at the Passover."
2. "The 'hyssop' cannot be equivalent to the 'reed' of Matthew 27:48 and Mark 15:36, for the hyssop plant was of too low and bushy a habit to supply a reed. It is simply a small bunch of hyssop, which was most probably attached to the end of a reed."
3. "A piece of sponge soaked in vinegar was fastened to the hyssop end of the rod, and the draught was in this way conveyed to the lips of Jesus."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "John, as eyewitness, had noticed it there."
2. "Not vinegar drugged with myrrh and gall which Jesus had refused just before the crucifixion."
3. "The reed of the hyssop bush was only three or four feet long."

### John Gill:
1. "Vinegar was used by the Jews for drink, as appears from Ruth 2:14 and 'dip thy morsel in the vinegar,' which Boaz's reapers had with them in the field; 'because of heat,' as the commentators say; that being good to cool, and to extinguish thirst."
2. "Vinegar indeed is good to revive the spirits, and hyssop, which is after mentioned, is an herb of a sweet smell."
3. "The hyssop with the Jews was not reckoned among herbs, but trees; the stalks of which therefore must be of some size; and so low was the cross on which Blandina the martyr suffered, as the church at Lyons relates, when on the cross she was exposed to beasts of prey, and became food for them."

### John Wesley:
1. A stalk of hyssop — Which in those countries grows exceeding large and strong. Psalm 69:21.
