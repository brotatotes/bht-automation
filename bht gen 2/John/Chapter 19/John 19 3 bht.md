# John 19:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They approached him and humbled themselves before him, kneeling as if he were an earthly king newly crowned. In their mockery, they scorned his authority and despised him as their king, just as many people do today—rejecting his reign over their lives. Some refuse to acknowledge him as king while others, though they acknowledge him as king in words, disregard his commands and show no regard for his authority. Their actions are no better than those of the soldiers who scoffed at him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Hail, King of the Jews!—doing Him derisive homage, in the form used on approaching the emperors."
2. "And they spit upon Him, and took the reed and smote Him on the head."
3. "The best comment on these affecting details is to cover the face."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The imperfect denotes the successive acts of homage of the soldiers as they came up one after the other."
2. "They smote Him with their hands [εδιδουν αυτω ραπισματα]."
3. "Literally, kept giving Him blows with their hands."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They came (ηρχοντο). Imperfect middle of repeated action, 'they kept coming and saying' (ελεγον) in derision and mock reverence with Αςε (χαιρε, Hail!) as if to Caesar."
2. "They struck him with their hands (εδιδοσαν αυτω ραπισματα). Imperfect of διδωμ, repetition, 'they kept on giving him slaps with their hands.' See on John 18:22 for this use of ραπισμα."

### John Gill:
1. "They came and prostrated themselves before him; bowed the knee unto him, and addressed him in a mock way, as if he was an earthly monarch just come to his crown." 
2. "Thus mocking at his kingly office, and despising him under that character, as many do now: some will not have him to reign over them, but reject him as King."
3. "And others, though in words they own him to be King, yet disregard his commands, and act no better part than these scoffing soldiers did."
