# John 19:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On that day, the Jews implored Pilate to have the bodies taken down from the crosses, fearing that the corpses would remain visible during the approaching Sabbath, which they regarded as a desecration. That particular Sabbath was indeed a significant occasion, not only because it was a regular Sabbath but also the second day of the feast of unleavened bread, a time when the sheaf of new corn would be presented and offered. Therefore, it was a triple celebration, and the Jews wanted to ensure that everything remained ceremonially pure.

### John Calvin:
1. "The Evangelist says, that the Jews besought that the bodies might be taken down from the crosses. This had undoubtedly been enjoined by the Law of God; but the Jews, as is usually the case with hypocrites, direct their whole attention to small matters, and yet pass by the greatest crimes without any hesitation..."
