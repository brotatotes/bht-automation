# John 19:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The soldiers, who had been seated near the cross, obeyed Pilate's command and left their position. They then approached the first of the crucified men, possibly the penitent believer on Jesus' right. The soldiers broke his legs, but it is uncertain if this was the case. They then moved to the other man, who had previously reviled Jesus. This positioning of the two criminals on either side of Jesus symbolizes the final judgment, with the righteous on the right and the wicked on the left hand.
