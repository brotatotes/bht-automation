# John 19:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The soldiers who oversaw the crucifixion did not leave Jesus on the cross out of mercy, but rather to prolong his suffering. They could tell that Jesus was already dead from the signs of death on his body, such as his bowed head, pale face, and slack jaw. They intentionally did not break his legs, not out of a lack of willingness to harm him, but because divine providence prevented them from doing so.
