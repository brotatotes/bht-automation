# John 19:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the soldier pierced Christ's side with his spear, it was not only to confirm his death but also to fulfill a divine purpose. The blood and water that flowed out from the wound were significant symbols of the atonement and sanctification brought by Christ. Just as in the Old Testament, where water represents purification and blood signifies justification, these elements point to the grace and blessings obtained through Christ's sacrifice. The miraculous nature of this event is emphasized by the immediate and distinct outpouring of both blood and water, leaving no doubt about its truth and magnitude.

2. "The fact, which is here so strongly testified, was a consequence of the extreme exhaustion of the Body of the Redeemer."
3. "His view after all seems to be the safe and true one that the circumstance is related as a miraculous sign, having deep significance as to the work of the Redeemer, and showing Him to be more than mortal."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But one of the soldiers—to make assurance of the fact doubly sure."

3. "And forthwith came thereout blood and water—"It is now well known that the effect of long-continued and intense agony is frequently to produce a secretion of a colorless lymph within the pericardium (the membrane enveloping the heart), amounting in many cases to a very considerable quantity" [WEBSTER and WILKINSON].

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This man appears to have doubted whether he was dead, and, in order to see whether he was not yet sensible, he pierced him with his spear."
2. "It was, doubtless, to furnish this conclusive proof that he was actually dead, and that an atonement had thus been made for mankind, that John mentions so particularly this fact."
3. "Let the following circumstances be remembered, showing that death must have ensued from such a wound...If it be remembered that this blow was probably in the left side, the conclusion is inevitable that death would have been the consequence of such a blow."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "They also had spears tipped with an antelope's horn sharpened like a spear-point."
2. "The verb used here, however, is also used to describe severe and deadly wounds."

### John Calvin:
1. "When the soldier pierced Christ’s side with his spear, he did so for the purpose of ascertaining if he was dead; but God had a higher object in view, as we shall immediately see."
2. "By these words he means that Christ brought the true atonement and the true washing; for, on the one hand, forgiveness of sins and justification, and, on the other hand, the sanctification of the soul, were prefigured in the Law by those two symbols, sacrifices and washings."
3. "The sacraments which Christ has left to his Church have the same design; for the purification and sanctification of the soul, which consists in newness of life, is pointed out to us in Baptism, and the Lord’s Supper is the pledge of a perfect atonement."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "With a spear (λογχη). Instrumental case of this old word, here only in the N.T." 
2. "Pierced his side (αυτου την πλευραν ενυξεν). First aorist active indicative of νυσσω, old word to pierce, here only in N.T."

### John Gill:
1. "This the soldier did, partly out of spite to Christ, and partly to know whether he was really dead; and which was so ordered by divine providence, that it might beyond all doubt appear that he really died, and was not taken down alive from the cross."
2. "This water and blood some make to signify baptism and the Lord's supper, which are both of Christ's appointing, and spring from him, and refer to his sufferings and death; rather they signify the blessings of sanctification and justification, the grace of the one being represented by water, as it frequently is in the Old and New Testament, and the other by blood, and both from Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "Forthwith there came out blood and water - It was strange, seeing he was dead, that blood should come out; more strange, that water also; and most strange of all, that both should come out immediately, at one time, and yet distinctly."
2. "It was pure and true water, as well as pure and true blood."
3. "The asseveration of the beholder and testifier of it, shows both the truth and greatness of the miracle and mystery."
