# John 19:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Gospel writer aimed to affirm the reality of Christ's death and resurrection through his own eyewitness testimony. By referring to himself in the third person, he emphasizes the undeniable evidence he was presenting. His record is considered true and trustworthy, as he was known for his commitment to the truth.
