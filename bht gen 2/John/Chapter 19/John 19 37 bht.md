# John 19:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The prophecy of Zechariah is fulfilled in Jesus, who is pierced by the soldier's spear. God's providence brings about the fulfillment of these scriptures, not by design of those involved. The piercing of Christ serves as a foundation for belief in Him as the Messiah and a reminder that wicked intentions will not go unpunished. In citing Zechariah, the New Testament writers demonstrate the accuracy and integrity of the Hebrew text. Those who have contributed to Christ's suffering will eventually look upon Him in sorrow or terror.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The ὄψονται does not refer to the Roman soldiers, but to the repentant in the world, who, at the time the Gospel was written, had begun to fulfill the prophecy."
2. "...and is not without a prophetic reference to the future conversion of Israel, who were here the real piercers, though the act was done διὰ χειρὸς ἀνόμων."
3. "The Evangelist has given the literal and, as now acknowledged, true sense of the word דָּקַר."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And there is a remarkable nicety in the choice of the words employed both by the prophet and the Evangelist for 'piercing.' The word in Zechariah means to thrust through with spear, javelin, sword, or any such weapon."
2. "How suitable this was to express the action of the Roman soldier, is manifest; and our Evangelist uses the exactly corresponding word, which the Septuagint certainly does not."
3. "Very different is the other word for 'pierce' in Zechariah 12:10 - 'They pierced my hands and my feet.' The word there used is one signifying to bore as with an awl or hammer."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We must here be struck with the wonderful providence of God, that so many scriptures were fulfilled in his death."
2. "All these things happened without any such design on the part of the men engaged in these scenes; but whatever was done by Jew or Gentile tended to the fulfillment of prophecies long on record."
3. "In this way God had so ordered it that the firmest foundation should be laid for the belief that he was the true Messiah, and that the designs of wicked men should all be overruled to the fulfillment of the great plans which God had in sending his Son."

### John Calvin:
1. "This passage is violently tortured by those who endeavor to explain it literally as referring to Christ."
2. "Christ is that God who formerly complained, by Zechariah, that the Jews had pierced his heart."
3. "God declares that they will not pass unpunished, for he will at length maintain his cause."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They pierced (εξεκεντησαν). First aorist active of εκκεντεω, late verb, correct translation of the Hebrew of Zechariah 12:10." 
2. "Not like the LXX, in N.T. only here and Revelation 1:7."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ, who is Jehovah, is there speaking prophetically of himself, here the evangelist cites it as fulfilled in him, that is, that part of it which regards the piercing of him"
2. "there is reason to believe, though the Jews are to this day hardened against him, that that part of the prophecy which concerns their looking to him, and mourning for him on account of his being pierced by them, will also, in God's own time, be fulfilled"
3. "From the citation of this passage it appears, that the writers of the New Testament did not always follow the Greek version of the Old Testament, which here renders the words very differently, and very wrongly; but John cites them according to the Hebrew text, even which we now have, and which is an instance of the truth, purity, and integrity of the present Hebrew books of the Old Testament."

### John Wesley:
1. "They shall look on him whom they have pierced."
2. "He was pierced by the soldier's spear."
3. "They who have occasioned his sufferings by their sins shall either look upon him in this world with penitential sorrow or with terror, when he cometh in the clouds of heaven."
