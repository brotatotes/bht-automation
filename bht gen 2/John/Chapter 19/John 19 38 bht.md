# John 19:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Joseph of Arimathea, a member of the Jewish sanhedrim, went to Pilate and requested permission to take down the body of Jesus. Although Joseph was a secret disciple of Jesus, his courage to openly acknowledge and care for the body of Christ in this dark hour is commendable. Nicodemus, another secret disciple, also came to assist Joseph. Their actions stand in stark contrast to the fear and shame that caused even Jesus' chosen disciples to abandon him. These two men demonstrated their love and loyalty for Jesus, even in his death.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "μετὰ ταῦτα not, 'immediately after this' but 'soon after.' The narrative implies, though it does not mention (as Mark and Luke do), that Joseph himself took down the Body from the cross."
2. "It was customary to grant the bodies of executed persons to their friends. 'Percussos sepeliri carnifex non vetat,' Quintil. Declam. vi."
3. "On Joseph, and the other particulars, see notes on Matt."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Marvellous it certainly is, that one who while Jesus was yet alive merely refrained from condemning Him, not having the courage to espouse His cause by one positive act, should, now that He was dead, and His cause apparently dead with Him, summon up courage to go in personally to the Roman governor and ask permission to take down and inter the body."
2. "But if this be the first instance, it is not the last, that a seemingly dead Christ has wakened a sympathy which a living one had failed to evoke."
3. "The reality of our Lord's death was attested by the party of all others most competent to decide on it, and certainly free from all bias—the officer in attendance—in full reliance on whose testimony Pilate surrendered the body."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A disciple of Jesus. Matt. calls him a rich man; Mark, an honorable counselor, i.e., a member of the Sanhedrin; and Luke, a counselor, good and just." 
2. "Mark adds that he went in boldly, which is suggestive in view of John's statement of his secret discipleship, a fact which is passed over by the Synoptists."
3. "Cicero, in one of his orations against Verres, has a terribly graphic passage describing such extortions. After dwelling upon the tortures inflicted upon the condemned, he says : 'Yet death is the end. It shall not be. Can cruelty go further? A way shall be found. For the bodies of the beheaded shall be thrown to the beasts. If this is grievous to parents, they may buy the liberty of burial'" (v. 45).

### John Calvin:
1. "Till now, therefore, riches had prevented them from professing to be the disciples of Christ, and might afterwards have no less influence in keeping them from making a profession so much hated and abhorred."
2. "It is therefore certain that this was effected by a heavenly impulse, so that they who, through fear, did not render the honor due to him while he was alive, now run to his dead body, as if they had become new men."
3. "Our slothfulness will be base and shameful if, now that he reigns in the heavenly glory, we withhold from him the confession of our faith."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is easy to understand that Pilate should at once grant the permission asked."
2. "By giving it up to disciples of Jesus he would have a fresh opportunity of at once doing despite to, and exasperating, the Jews."
3. "In the fact that disciples receive the body of the Lord the Evangelist beholds a token of the care with which it was watched over by His Father in Heaven."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "But it must be put down to the credit of Joseph that he showed courage in this darkest hour when the majority had lost heart."
2. "That he might take away (ινα αρη). Final clause with ινα and the first aorist active subjunctive of αιρω. Else the body of Jesus might have gone to the potter's field."
3. "Pilate gladly consented."

### John Gill:
1. "Joseph of Arimathea went to Pilate, and desired leave to take down the body of Jesus. This Joseph was a counselor, one of the Jewish sanhedrim."
2. "Being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly, for fear of the Jews; not one of the twelve, but a private hearer, who had sometimes secretly attended on the ministry of Christ."
3. "This Pilate, the Roman governor, had the disposal of, and to him Joseph applies for it; which was a great instance of his affection for Christ, and was a declaring openly for him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate — And Nicodemus also came - Acknowledging Christ, when even his chosen disciples forsook him."
2. "In that extremity Joseph was no longer afraid, Nicodemus no longer ashamed."
