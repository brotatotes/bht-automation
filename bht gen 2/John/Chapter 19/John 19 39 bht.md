# John 19:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Nicodemus, a once-secret disciple, now openly takes a stand, bringing an astonishing quantity of spices for Jesus' burial. Some suggest that the a hundred pound may be a figurative expression denoting a significant amount, while others note that Nicodemus, being a rich man, could have covered the entire body with the spices. These sweet-smelling spices, including myrrh, were commonly used in burial rituals. Despite objections from some, we cannot dismiss the testimony of the evangelist about Nicodemus' lavish offering, for it signifies his love and faith, even in the face of Jesus' humbling death.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Their love to Jesus was called out by the might of His love. His Death is the Power which constrains men."
2. "And thus this act of love on the part of both these men is a testimony for Jesus, and for the future effect of His death."
3. "Hence also it appears why the Evangelist mentions the weight of the spices, as a proof of the greatness of their love."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This remark corresponds to the secrecy of Joseph's discipleship, just noticed, and calls attention to the similarity of their previous character and conduct, and the remarkable change which had now taken place."
2. "An immense quantity, betokening the greatness of their love, but part of it probably intended as a layer for the spot on which the body was to lie."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Came Nicodemus - came by night. The contrast is marked between his first and his second coming."
2. "Mixture [μιγμα] . Only here in the New Testament."
3. "The large quantity may be explained by the intention of covering the entire body with the preparation, and by the fact that a portion was designed for the couch of the body in the grave."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The quantity of spices thus brought by Nicodemus is certainly remarkable; and hence some have shrunk from taking the words in their literal sense, holding that 'a hundred pound' (especially as here qualified by 'about') may be an expression merely denoting a great quantity."
2. "The humiliation of the King of Israel (chap. John 3:3, John 12:13), so far from discouraging, does but strengthen the once weak faith of the true disciple; and in contrast with (and may we not add in expression of shame and penitence for) timorous hesitation, we read of the lavish offering of a love open and avowed."
3. "The declaration of chap. John 12:32 begins to receive its fulfillment."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Nicodemus now at last taking an open stand."
2. "It was common to use sweet-smelling spices in the burial."
3. "Nicodemus was a rich man and probably covered the entire body with the spices."

### John Gill:
1. "This Nicodemus is thought to be the same with Nicodemus ben Gorion, the Talmudists speaks of, who, they say was one of the three rich men in Jerusalem."
2. "Myrrh was one of the principal spices in the anointing oil and holy perfume, Exodus 30:23."
3. "A Jew objects to this relation of the evangelist as unworthy of belief: he affirms, that this was enough for two hundred dead bodies, and that it could not be carried with less than the strength of a mule, and therefore not by Nicodemus. In answer to which, it is observed by Bishop Kidder that we having nothing but the Jew's own word for it, that this was enough for two hundred bodies, and a load for a mule."
