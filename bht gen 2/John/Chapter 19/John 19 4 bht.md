# John 19:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Behold, he is being brought forth, in the condition in which he was, so that you can see how he has been mistreated. This is to show you that Pilate, if he would go to such lengths to please you and yet find no fault in him, would have surely ordered his execution if he believed him guilty. Thus, Pilate is guilty of great injustice by subjecting an innocent man to such cruelty and humiliation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The unjust and cruel conduct of Pilate appears to have had for its object to satisfy the multitude by the mockery and degradation of the so-called King of the Jews."
2. "His speech is equivalent to 'See what I have done purely to please you, for I believe Him innocent.'"
3. "The ἰδοὺ ὁ ἄνθ is to move their contempt and pity; 'See this man who submits to and has suffered these indignities, how can He ever stir up the people, or set Himself up for King?'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Behold, I bring him forth to you"—am bringing, that is, going to bring him forth to you.
2. "That ye may know I find no fault in him"—and, by scourging Him and allowing the soldiers to make sport of Him, have gone as far to meet your exasperation as can be expected from a judge.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Pilate, disposed to gratify the Jews, returned to Jesus and ordered him to be scourged, as if preparatory to death, John 19:1."
2. "The patience and meekness with which Jesus bore this seem to have convinced him still more that he was innocent."
3. "The meekness, purity, and sincerity of Jesus had power to convince a Roman governor that he was not guilty."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I bring him out to you (αγω υμιν αυτον εξω). Vividly pictures Pilate leading Jesus out of the palace before the mob in front."
2. "That ye may know (ινα γνωτε). Final clause with ινα and the second aorist active subjunctive of γινωσκω, 'that ye may come to know,' by this mockery the sincerity of Pilate's decision that Jesus is innocent (John 18:38)."
3. "It is a travesty on justice and dignity, but Pilate is trying by a bit of humour to turn the mob from the grip of the Sanhedrin."

### John Gill:
1. "Behold I bring him forth unto you; that is, he had ordered him to be brought forth by the soldiers, and they were just bringing him in the sad miserable condition in which he was, that the Jews might see, with their own eyes, how he had been used."
2. "They might know and believe, that if Pilate did all this, or allowed of it to be done to a man whom he judged innocent, purely to gratify the Jews; that had he found anything in him worthy of death, he would not have stopped here, but would have ordered the execution of him."
3. "Pilate, by his own confession, in treating, or suffering to be treated in so cruel and ignominious a manner, one that he himself could find no fault in, or cause of accusation against, was guilty of great injustice."
