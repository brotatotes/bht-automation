# John 19:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As the body of Christ was prepared for burial, it was wrapped in fine linen cloths, symbolizing his purity and innocence. The use of spices further emphasized the fragrant offering of his sacrifice to God. The significance of a crucified Christ lies in the fact that through his death, sin is atoned for, the law is fulfilled, and reconciliation with God is achieved. This precious act brings about deliverance from condemnation and the abolition of death itself.

1. "Linen cloths [οθονιοις]. Used only by John, if Luke 24:12 is rejected, as by some editors. The Synoptists all have sindwn, linen cloth."
2. "The manner of the Jews. As contrasted with that of the Egyptians, for instance, which is thus described by Herodotus."
3. "Or, possibly, a contrast may be implied with the Roman custom of burning the bodies of the dead. Tacitus says of the Jews: "The bodies of the deceased they choose rather to bury than burn, following in this the Egyptian custom; with whom also they agree in their attention to the dead."

3. "The body having thus been prepared for burial, the actual entombment alone remains to be spoken of."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In linen cloths (οθονιοις). Late diminutive for the old οθονη, used for ships' sails, in N.T. here and Luke 24:12. Case here either locative or instrumental."
