# John 19:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the vicinity of his crucifixion, there was a garden where Jesus was buried. This garden was separate from the actual site of the crucifixion. It was a common practice for wealthy individuals to have their gardens located outside the city for their convenience and enjoyment. Jesus was laid to rest in a tomb within this garden, a tomb that had never been used before. The purpose of this was to leave no room for doubt or confusion that it was indeed Jesus who had risen from the dead.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The words ἐν τῷ τόπῳ ὅπου ἐσταυρώθη are so far in favour of the traditional site of the Holy Sepulchre, that Calvary and the Sepulchre are close together, under the roof of the same church."
2. "The newness of the tomb was important, that it should be seen 'neminem præter Jesum, neque Jesum alterius virtute, ut olim circa sepulchrum Elisæi acciderat, resurrexisse' (Lampe): so that (Luthardt) no room might be left for the evasions of unbelief."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But it was 'a new sepulchre' (Mark 15:46), 'wherein never man before was laid' (Mark 15:46): and Matthew (Matthew 27:60) says that Joseph laid Him 'in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock'—doubtless for his own use, though the Lord had higher use for it."
2. "Thus as He rode into Jerusalem on an ass 'whereon never man before had sat' (Matthew 27:60), so now He shall lie in a tomb wherein never man before had lain."
3. "That from these specimens it may be seen that in all things He was 'SEPARATE FROM SINNERS' (Hebrews 7:26)."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A garden. Mentioned by John only. New [καινον]".
2. "John omits the detail of the tomb being hewn in the rock, which is common to all the Synoptists."
3. "Dark. Matthew says, as it began to dawn; Mark, when the sun was risen; Luke, very early in the morning, or at deep dawn; see on Luke 24:1."

### John Calvin:
1. "It did not happen by accident, but by an undoubted providence of God, that the body of Christ was buried in a new sepulchre."
2. "He had a new sepulcher, in which no person had ever been laid."
3. "God offers them what they did not seek, that the burial of his Son might have some token to distinguish him from the rank of other men."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is not easy to say whether the Evangelist, in referring to the particulars he mentions, may have desired to prepare the way for the reality of the resurrection. They certainly tend to do so, because they help to show that, when the grave was found empty, none but Jesus could have risen from it."
2. "It seems more probable, however, that they are mentioned with the view of bringing out the honour paid to Jesus in His death. He was laid, not in the place of common burial, but in a garden, and in a new sepulchre, where no one had been laid before Him."
3. "Finally, we are informed why they laid Jesus there in the condition in which He was."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A garden. See John 18:1; John 18:26."
2. "Fresh, unused."
3. "It was Joseph's mausoleum, a rock tomb hewn out of the mountain side (Mark 15:56; Matthew 27:60; Luke 23:53), a custom common with the rich then and now."

### John Gill:
1. "Which takes in all that spot of ground that lay on that side of the city where he was crucified; or near to the place of his crucifixion, for it was not a garden in which he was crucified."
2. "Rich men used to have their gardens without the city for their convenience and pleasure."
3. "Now Christ was laid in such an one, where no man had been laid, that it might appear certainly that it was he, and not another, that was risen from the dead."

### John Wesley:
1. "In the place where he was crucified — There was a garden in the same tract of land."
2. "The cross did not stand in the garden."
