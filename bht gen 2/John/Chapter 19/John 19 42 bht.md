# John 19:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The reason why Jesus was laid in a nearby tomb was not for convenience, but because of the urgency to complete the burial before the approaching Sabbath. The proximity of the tomb to the place of crucifixion and the imminent Sabbath prompted Joseph to offer his own tomb for Jesus' burial. The mention of this closeness emphasizes the haste with which the burial took place, highlighting the significance of the events leading up to Jesus' death.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The words ὅτι ἐγγ . ἦν τὸ μν . certainly at first sight appear as if John were not aware that the tomb belonged to Joseph."

3. "John, not anxious to record every particular, may have given it as such."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "These words can hardly mean that Jesus was laid in this tomb simply as a matter of convenience, owing to the nearness of the Sabbath."
2. "The meaning must rather be that, owing to this nearness, the embalming had been more readily left in that unfinished state of which we read in the other Evangelists."
