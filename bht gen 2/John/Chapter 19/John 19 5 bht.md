# John 19:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Behold the man! His face scratched and torn, temples bleeding from the thorny crown, eyes swollen from the blows of closed fists. His appearance was pitiable, smeared with his own blood and the soldiers' spittle. Pilate's intention was to evoke compassion, revealing Jesus as a man, not their supposed king, urging them to treat him with humanity and pity. This display emphasized Jesus' vulnerability, imploring the crowd to see beyond their accusations and consider the suffering before them.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "There is no reason to think that contempt dictated this speech. There was clearly a struggle in the breast of this wretched man."
2. "Not only was he reluctant to surrender to mere clamor an innocent man, but a feeling of anxiety about His mysterious claims...was beginning to rack his breast."
3. "But, be his meaning what it may, those three words have been eagerly appropriated by all Christendom, and enshrined for ever in its heart as a sublime expression of its calm, rapt admiration of its suffering Lord."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Behold the man! - It is probable that Pilate pointed to the Saviour, and his object evidently was to move them to compassion, and to convince them, by a sight of the Saviour himself, that he was innocent."
2. "Amid all this, Jesus was meek, patient, and calm, giving evident proofs of innocence."
3. "The conduct of Pilate was as if he had said, 'See! The man whom you accuse is arrayed in a gorgeous robe, as if a king. He has been scourged and mocked. All this he has borne with patience... This is the man that you accuse; and he is now brought forth, that you may see that he is not guilty.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Wearing [φορων]. Not ferown, bearing, but the frequentative form of that verb, denoting an habitual or continuous bearing; hence, wearing, as though it were His natural dress."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus bore the mockery with kingly dignity as part of the shame of the Cross (Hebrews 12:2)."
2. "This exclamatory introduction of Jesus in mock coronation robes to the mob was clearly intended to excite pity and to show how absurd the charge of the Sanhedrin was that such a pitiable figure should be guilty of treason."
3. "Pilate failed utterly in this effort and did not dream that he was calling attention to the greatest figure of history, the Man of the ages."

### John Gill:
1. "His temples scratched and torn with the thorny crown, and the blood running down from thence, and his face and eyes swollen with the blows he had received from their closed fists, and all besmeared with his own blood, and the soldiers' spittle."
2. "Behold the man; not their king, that would have provoked them; though he did say so afterwards when he found he could not prevail upon them to agree to his release; but the man, to move their compassion."
3. "Signifying, that he was a man as they were, and that they ought to use him as such, and treat him with humanity and pity; and that he was a poor despicable man, as the condition he was in showed."
