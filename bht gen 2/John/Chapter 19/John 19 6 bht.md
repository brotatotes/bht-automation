# John 19:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is astonishing that despite Pilate's declaration of Christ's innocence, the crowd remains unrelenting in their cry for crucifixion. One would expect that this declaration would exert some influence on them, prompting them to show compassion and humanity. However, instead of relenting, their persistence in requesting crucifixion speaks to their maliciousness and impatience. It is truly disheartening that individuals who claim to uphold piety and righteousness could be capable of such blatant iniquity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Possibly St. John had not heard the cry."
2. "According as men have been in different parts of a mob, they will naturally report differently."
3. "The words of Pilate show vacillation between his own sense of the innocence of Jesus and his fear of displeasing the Jews and their rulers."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Their fiendish rage kindling afresh at the sight of Him."
2. "As if this would relieve him of the responsibility of the deed, who, by surrendering Him, incurred it all!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "When men are determined on evil, they cannot be reasoned with. Every argument tends to defeat their plans, and they press on in iniquity with the more earnestness in proportion as sound reasons are urged to stay their course."
2. "Thus sinners go in the way of wickedness down to death. They make up in firmness of purpose what they lack in reason. They are more fixed in their plans in proportion as God faithfully warns them and their friends admonish them."
3. "It was equivalent to this: 'I am satisfied of his innocence, and shall not pronounce the sentence of death. If you are bent on his ruin - if you are determined to put to death an innocent man - if my judgment does not satisfy you - take him and put him to death on your own responsibility, and take the consequences.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Crucify. The best texts omit Him."
2. "Take ye Him. According to the Greek order, 'take Him ye.' Rev., take Him yourselves."
3. "See on 18 31."

### John Calvin:
1. "He did not wish to deliver Christ into their hands, or to abandon him to their fury; only he declares that he will not be their executioner."
2. "He finds no guilt in him; as if he had said, that he will never be persuaded to shed innocent blood for their gratification."
3. "That it is only the priests and officers who demand that he shall be crucified, is evident from the circumstance that the madness of the people was not so great, except so far as those bellows contributed afterwards to kindle it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The advancement from what is stated at chap. John 18:40 to the present point is at once perceptible... Now their cry reaches its culmination, 'Crucify! Crucify!'" 
2. "The words do not seem to contain any serious authorization on the part of Pilate to the Jews to crucify Jesus... The emphatic 'yourselves' guides us to the true interpretation... It is as if he would say, 'Is He to be crucified? then it shall be by yourselves, and not by me.'" 
3. "The Jews, accordingly, are sensible that they dare not avail themselves of the permission. They must adduce fresh reasons for the sentence of condemnation which they desire."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "First aorist active imperative of σταυροω for which verb see Matthew 29:19, etc."
2. "Here the note of urgency (aorist imperative) with no word for 'him,' as they were led by the chief priests and the temple police till the whole mob takes it up (Matthew 27:22)."
3. "This is the third time Pilate has rendered his opinion of Christ's innocence (John 18:38; John 19:4). And here he surrenders in a fret to the mob and gives as his reason (γαρ, for) for his surrender the innocence of Jesus (the strangest judicial decision ever rendered)."

### John Gill:
1. "which might have been thought would have at least influenced them to the exercise of humanity and compassion to fellow creatures"
2. "the repetition of their request shows their malignity, vehemence, and impatience"
3. "men that professed so much religion and sanctity, could be guilty of such iniquity"
