# John 19:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By quoting the Sanhedrin, they revealed the real reason behind their opposition to Jesus: according to their interpretation of the law of Moses, Jesus had claimed to be the Son of God, which was considered blasphemy. This charge was significant to the Jews since they denied that God had a Son and saw Jesus' claim as a direct challenge to their beliefs.
