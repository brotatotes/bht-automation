# John 19:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Pilate's fear was heightened by the charge brought against Jesus, which he did not fully comprehend. He feared the possibility that Jesus might truly be divine or have some connection to the gods, making it dangerous for him to be involved in his condemnation. Additionally, Pilate's conscience troubled him, as he had already believed in Jesus' innocence. His fear was not solely due to the pressure from the Jews but also a sense of apprehension about being implicated in the unjust execution of an innocent man.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This charge served to increase the fear which Pilate had before: see note on ch. John 18:37."
2. "The name υἱὸς θεοῦ served also to confirm the omen already furnished by the dream of his wife."
3. "That this fear was not a fear of the Jews, nor of acting unjustly, but of the Person of Jesus, is evident from what follows."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The name 'SON OF GOD,' the lofty sense evidently attached to it by His Jewish accusers"
2. "The dialogue he had already held with Him"
3. "The dream of his wife"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He was the more afraid - What was the ground of his fear is not declared by the evangelist. It was probably, however, the alarm of his conscience, and the fear of vengeance if he suffered such an act of injustice to be done as to put an innocent man to death."
2. "He was convinced of his innocence. He saw more and more clearly the design of the Jews...dreaded their vengeance if he suffered one who claimed to be divine, and who might be, to be put to death."
3. "It is clear that Pilate was convinced that Jesus was innocent...he was thrown into this state of alarm, and resolved again to question Jesus, that he might obtain satisfaction on the subjects that agitated his mind."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "These words of the Jews produced an effect on Pilate for which they were not prepared."
2. "The saying gives strength to a dreadful presentiment which was gradually forming within him."
3. "The truth naturally presents itself to his mind in the form of pagan superstitions and mythological legends."

### John Calvin:
1. "Pilate dreaded lest some blame should be imputed to him, if a tumult arose, because he had not condemned Christ." 
2. "After having heard the name of the Son of God, his mind was moved by religion."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He was already afraid because of his wife's message (Matthew 27:19)."
2. "The claim of Jesus to deity excited Pilate's superstitious fears."

### John Gill:
1. "he was afraid to put him to death, or to consent to it before; partly on account of his wife's message to him, and partly upon a conviction of the innocence of Christ, in his own conscience"
2. "he was more afraid since here was a charge brought against him he did not well understand the meaning of"
3. "he might be the more uneasy, lest the thing they charged him with asserting, should be really fact; that he was one of the gods come down in the likeness of man; or that he was some demi-god at least, or so nearly related to deity, that it might be dangerous for him to have anything to do with him this way"

### John Wesley:
1. He was the more afraid — He seems to have been afraid before of shedding innocent blood.
