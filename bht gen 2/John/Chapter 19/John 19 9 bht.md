# John 19:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Pilate's question, Whence art thou? was not simply an inquiry about Jesus' earthly origin, but rather a deeper inquiry into his divine identity. Jesus' choice to remain silent was in accordance with his own teaching from Matthew 7:6, illustrating that his silence was a deliberate response. By not answering, Jesus conveyed a powerful message, affirming his divine origin and purpose. This silence served as a witness to his divine nature, echoing his previous declaration in John 18:37. Pilate's growing fear and wavering position were evidence of the profound impact Jesus' presence had on him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The fear of Pilate is not mere superstition, nor does it enter into the Jewish meaning of Ï…á¼±á½¸Ï‚ Î¸ .: but arises from an indefinite impression made on him by the Person and bearing of our Lord."
2. "Our Lord, in His silence, was acting according to His own precept, Matthew 7:6."
3. "This silence was the most emphatic answer to all who had ears to hear it; was a reference to what He had said before, ch. John 18:37, and so a witness to His divine origin."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Whence art thou?â€”beyond all doubt a question relating not to His mission but to His personal origin."
2. "Jesus gave him no answerâ€”He had said enough; the time for answering such a question was past."
3. "The weak and wavering governor is already on the point of giving way."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Pilate knew that he was a Galilean, but this question was asked to ascertain whether he claimed to be the Son of God - whether a mere man, or whether divine."
2. "Jesus gave him no answer - Probably for the following reasons:"

### John Calvin:
1. "It ought to be observed that, when he asks whence Christ is, he does not inquire about his country, but the meaning is, as if he had said, 'Art thou a man born on the earth, or art thou some god?'" 
2. "If reverence for God had so much influence on an irreligious man, must not they be worse than reprobate, who now judge of divine things in sport and jest, carelessly, and without any fear?"
3. "We ought not to think it strange that Jesus makes no reply; at least, if we keep in mind what I have formerly mentioned, that he did not stand before Pilate to plead his own cause... This is the reason why he makes no defense; and yet Christâ€™s silence is not inconsistent with what Paul says, Remember that Christ, before Pilate, made a good confession."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Pilate knew that Jesus was from Galilee (Luke 23:6). He is really alarmed."
2. "The silence of Jesus, like that before Caiaphas (Mark 14:61; Matthew 26:63) and Herod (Luke 23:9), irritates the dignity of Pilate in spite of his fears."

### John Gill:
1. "and saith unto Jesus, whence art thou?... from whence he sprung, who were his ancestors, and whether his descent was from the gods, or from men"
2. "Jesus gave him no answer; for his question was frivolous, and deserved none"
3. "since Christ was come to die for the salvation of his people, it was not proper he should say anything that might be a means of hindering it"

### John Wesley:
1. Whence art thou? â€” That is, whose son art thou?
