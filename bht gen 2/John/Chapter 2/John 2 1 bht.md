# John 2:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On a day shortly after the beginning of Jesus' ministry, which was the third day reckoned from the previous significant event, a wedding took place. The exact details of the wedding and the participants are uncertain, but it is believed that it may have been a relative of Jesus' mother who was getting married. This event occurred in Cana of Galilee, which is significant because it highlights the manifestation of the Savior's glory within his own region.
