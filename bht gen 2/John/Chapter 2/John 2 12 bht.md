# John 2:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After revealing his glory through the miracle of turning water into wine and strengthening the faith of his disciples, Jesus left Cana and proceeded to Capernaum. Capernaum became his frequent dwelling place in the region of Galilee. Accompanying Jesus to Capernaum were not only his disciples but also his brothers or close relatives according to their kinship in the flesh—James, Joses, Simon, and Judas, three of whom would later become his apostles.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There is no certainty as to this visit, whether or not it is the same with that hinted at in Luke 4:23 ; so that no chronological inferences can be built on the hypothesis with any security."
2. "Notice the transition from His private to His public life. His mother and brethren are still with Him, attached merely by nature: His disciples, newly attached by faith."
3. "In the next verse He has cast off His mere earthly ties for His work. Also in the  οὐ πολλὰς ἡμ  ., notice less a mere chronological design, than one to shew that He lost no time after His first miracle, in publicly manifesting Himself as the Son of God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Capernaum—on the Sea of Galilee." 
2. "His mother and his brethren." 
3. "Christ's first Passover—first cleansing of the temple."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To Capernaum - See the notes at Matthew 4:13."
2. "Not many days - The reason why he remained there no longer was that the Passover was near, and they went up to Jerusalem to attend it."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "To obtain a general view of the passage, it will be necessary briefly to examine the details in their order."
2. "But there are two reasons which deserve our attention. First, as the Priests abused this merchandise for their own gain and avarice, such a mockery of God could not be endured. Secondly, whatever excuse men may plead, as soon as they depart, however slightly, from the command of God, they deserve reproof and need correction."
3. "Since he wished to restore purity of doctrine, it was of great importance that he should prove himself to be the Lord of the temple. Besides, there was no other way in which he could bring back sacrifices and the other exercises of religion to their spiritual design than by removing the abuse of them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Nazareth, not Cana, would appear to be the place from which Jesus ‘went down’...for His brethren, who are not said to have been with Him in Cana, are now of the company."

3. "In his usual manner John divides the company into three groups, naming separately Jesus, His relations by natural kindred, His disciples."

### John Gill:
