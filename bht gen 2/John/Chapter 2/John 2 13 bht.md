# John 2:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Passover mentioned here was a feast observed by the Jews, and it is referred to as the Jews' passover because it was only obligatory for the Jews to keep it. This was the first Passover after Christ's baptism, which is believed to have occurred about six months earlier. Jesus went up to Jerusalem for this feast as it was the only place where the Passover could be kept. This visit to Jerusalem is not mentioned in the synoptic gospels, but John's Gospel provides us with this important detail of Jesus' ministry.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

1. "The feast among the Jews called the Passover."
2. "Every male among the Jews was required to appear at this feast."

1. "On John's use of the term Jews, see on 1 19. So it is used here with an under-reference to the national religion as consisting in mere ceremonies."
2. "Only John mentions this earliest passover of Christ's ministry."

### John Calvin:

3. "For John we should not know that Christ's ministry was much over a year in length."

### John Gill:
1. "And it is called the Jews' passover, because they only were obliged to keep it: nor was it obligatory upon the Gentiles; and, besides, was now abolished when John wrote this Gospel."
