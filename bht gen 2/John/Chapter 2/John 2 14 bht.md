# John 2:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the temple court, there was an unseemly mixture of sacred and profane transactions. There were those who sold oxen, sheep, and doves for the convenience of the worshippers. Additionally, there were the changers of money, who converted foreign currency into the current coin of the Jews. This desecration of the temple incursion angered Jesus, as he came to reform the abuses and restore proper worship of his Father. His cleansing of the temple was both a protest and an outcry against the commercialization.
