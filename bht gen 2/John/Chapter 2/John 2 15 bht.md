# John 2:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus was not afraid to use divine authority to cleanse the temple, as he fashioned a scourge of rushes to drive out all those who were defiling the holy place. It is worth noting that he didn't use physical force against them, focusing instead on the act of expulsion itself. Nevertheless, the fear of God's judgment fell upon the wrongdoers, leading them to flee from his presence.
