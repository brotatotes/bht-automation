# John 2:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They demanded a sign to confirm Jesus' authority over the temple. Despite witnessing his actions and words, they remained unconvinced. They asked for proof, seeking evidence that he had the right to reform the temple and act with such authority. However, their demand for a sign was misguided. Jesus had already demonstrated his divine authority through his words and actions. He had performed miracles and openly declared his relationship with his Father. Their disbelief and request for a sign were signs of their failure to recognize the true manifestation of Jesus' divine authority.
