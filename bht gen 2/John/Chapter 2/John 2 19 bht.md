# John 2:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a mysterious and symbolic way, Jesus referred to his own body as the temple.

These words revealed the profound truth that Jesus himself was the ultimate temple, the manifestation of God among humanity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "That temple, with all its ordinances and holy places, was but the shadow of the Christian Church; that, the type of the Body of the Lord, represented the Church, which is veritably His Body."
3. "The words ἐγερῶ αὐτόν, seeing that the resurrection of the Lord is ever spoken of as the work of the Father. Yes, but by power committed to Christ Himself: see ch. John 10:18, where this is distinctly asserted."
