# John 2:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, along with his five disciples, attended a wedding, emphasizing his acceptance of invitations and his courteous nature. Attending this wedding allowed Jesus to sanctify human society, rather than shunning it. In choosing to turn water into wine at this celebration, Jesus not only quenched thirst but also added to the joy of the occasion. This act shows his generosity and highlights his ability to easily attract and draw in his disciples, who would later journey through more challenging paths with him.
