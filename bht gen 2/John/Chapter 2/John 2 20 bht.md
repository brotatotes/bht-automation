# John 2:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Forty and six years had passed since Herod the Great began his magnificent reparation of the temple. The rebuilding and repairing work continued for thirty-six more years and was almost completed, except for some final touches. These efforts took place until a few years before the destruction of the temple by the Romans. The Jews, however, misunderstood Jesus and thought he was speaking of the temple built by Solomon, not realizing that he was referring to the temple in progress during their time, which had been under construction for forty-six years.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The temple was not completed till A.D. 64, under Herod Agrippa II., and the procurator Albinus; so that ᾠκοδομήθη, was in building, must refer to the greater part of the work now completed."
2. "Reckoning from this latter, we shall have twenty years till the birth of Christ, and thirty years since that event, from which fifty, however, four must be taken, since our era is four years too late. This gives forty-six."
3. "The sense of this aor. is curiously illustrated by a passage in Ezra 5:16, τότε Σαβανασὰρ ἐκεῖνος ἧλθε καὶ ἔδωκε θεμελίους τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ θεοῦ ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἀπὸ τότε ἕως τοῦ νῦν ᾠκοδομήθη καὶ οὐκ ἐτελέσθη."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Jews frequently perverted our Saviour’s meaning...he often left them to their own delusions."
2. "This temple Herod the Great commenced repairing...and as what is here mentioned happened in the thirtieth year of the age of Jesus, so the time which had been occupied in it was 'forty-six years.'"
3. "Can you, an obscure and unknown Galilean, accomplish it in three days? The thing, in their judgment, was ridiculous."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Forty and six years was this temple in building... It was spoken of as completed, although not finished until thirty - six years later." 
2. "The position of the Greek pronoun makes it emphatic."

### John Calvin:
1. "The time described in the history of Ezra is much shorter; but, though it has some appearance of contradiction, it is not at all at variance with the words of the Prophet."
2. "Thus the Papists in the present day demand miracles, not that they would give way to the power of God, but that they may not appear to have no reason for rebelling against God."
3. "Although, therefore, many of the actions and sayings of our Lord are obscure for a time, we must not give them up in despair, or despise that which we do not all at once understand."
