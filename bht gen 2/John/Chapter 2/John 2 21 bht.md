# John 2:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus spoke of the temple of his body, which was the antitype of the material temple, as the bodies of the saints are also called temples. The human nature of Christ is referred to as a tabernacle, and God grants his presence within it, accepting the prayers, praises, and spiritual sacrifices of believers. This understanding reflects John's view as he looks back at Jesus' words, recognizing their deeper meaning beyond the literal understanding of those around him.
