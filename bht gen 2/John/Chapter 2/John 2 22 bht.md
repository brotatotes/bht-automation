# John 2:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples, though initially slow to understand the doctrine of Christ's resurrection, eventually believed and recognized the fulfillment of both the Scriptures and Jesus' own words. As they reflected on his resurrection, they recalled the words he had spoken and realized their significance. Through their belief in the scriptural prophecies of his resurrection, such as Psalms 16:10 and Hosea 6:2, as well as Jesus' own teachings, they came to a deeper faith. They understood that Jesus' words were not only in agreement with the Scriptures but were also grounded in them.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Whilst, however, the Jews rejected the ‘hard saying,’ the disciples kept all these things and pondered them in their ‘heart,’ not understanding them until the prophecy was fulfilled.
