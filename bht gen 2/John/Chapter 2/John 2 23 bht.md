# John 2:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During the Passover festival in Jerusalem, Jesus performed miraculous signs and preached to the multitudes gathered there. These miracles, though not specified, were undoubtedly remarkable. As Jesus worked wonders, many people superficially believed in Him, captivated by the miracles He performed. However, these individuals may not have fully grasped the depth of His message, merely recognizing His ability to perform extraordinary acts. Despite the absence of a record detailing the specific miracles, it is evident that through His works, Jesus was able to captivate the attention and belief of the multitude present at the time.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "What miracles these were, is not related: certainly some notable ones." 
2. "The mention of them precludes us from understanding ch. John 4:54, as indicating that the healing of the ruler’s son was absolutely His second miracle."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The foregoing things occurring probably before the feast began."
2. "Many believed superficially, struck merely by 'the miracles He did.'"
3. "Of these we have no record."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Feast-day - Feast. During the celebration of the Passover, which continued eight days."
2. "Jesus took occasion to work miracles, and to preach at that time, for a great multitude were present from all parts of Judea."
3. "We should always seek and embrace opportunities of doing good, and we should not be 'deterred,' but rather 'excited,' by the multitude around us to make known our real sentiments on the subject of religion."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "His name. See on 1 12. With the phrase believe on His name, compare believe on Him (viii. 30), which is the stronger expression, indicating a casting of one's self upon Him; while to believe on the name is rather to believe in Him as being that which he claims to be, in this case the Messiah."
2. "It is believing recognition rather than appropriation."
3. "When they saw [θεωρουντες] . Rev., literally and rightly, beholding (see on 1 14, 29). He did [εποιει] . Better, was doing; the imperfect denoting the wonderful works as in progress."

### John Calvin:
1. "This appearance of faith, which hitherto was fruitless, might ultimately be changed into true faith, and might be a useful preparation for celebrating the name of Christ among others."
2. "Their faith was absurd, because it was exclusively directed to the world and earthly things."
3. "When we speak generally about faith, let us know that there is a kind of faith which is perceived by the understanding only, and afterwards quickly disappears, because it is not fixed in the heart."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In this verse we pass from the public presentation of Jesus to the people and ‘the Jews’ in the house of His Father to His more private ministry in Jerusalem: rejected as the Son of God, He continues His work as a Prophet, doing many ‘signs,’ and by these leading many to faith in His mission."
2. "It is noticeable that we do not here read ‘the Passover of the Jews:’ the desecration of the festival has been condemned in one of its manifestations, but the festival itself is honored."
3. "The signs attested His words, which were the description of His ‘name’ (see chap. John 1:12), and, beholding the signs, many became believers in His name, accepting Him as being in truth what He declared Himself to be."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Believed on his name" - See on John 1:12 for this phrase. Only one has to watch for the real import of πιστευω.
2. "Beholding his signs" - Present active participle (causal use) of θεωρεω.
3. "Which he did" - "Which he was doing" (imperfect tense). He did his first sign in Cana, but now he was doing many in Jerusalem.

### John Gill:
1. "For the passover here, seems to be the general name for the whole seven days of the festival; and the feast to be the particular feast of the first day of it, which was the fifteenth."
2. "When they saw the miracles which he did..."
3. "There were many that concluded he must be come from God."

### John Wesley:
1. Many believed — That he was a teacher sent from God.
