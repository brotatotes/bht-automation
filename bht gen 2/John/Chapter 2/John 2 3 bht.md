# John 2:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The wedding feast lasted for several days, and at some point during the celebration, the wine ran out. Mary, with compassion and concern for the reputation of the bridegroom, approached Jesus, even though he had not yet performed any miracles. Her words were an expression of her belief in his power and her desire to find a solution to the situation. Jesus, in his divine wisdom, chose this moment to manifest his glory and fulfill Mary's request, turning water into wine.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The mother of Jesus evidently is in a position of authority in the house."
2. "She cannot have had from experience any reason to suppose that her Son would work a miracle, for this was His first."
3. "The most probable explanation is that our Lord Himself had recently given some reason to expect that He would show forth His glory by wonderful works."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "No wine—evidently expecting some display of His glory..."
2. "...and hinting that now was His time."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A marriage feast among the Jews was commonly observed for seven or eight days."
2. "It is possible, therefore, that Jesus came there some time during the marriage feast."
3. "It is not known why Mary told this to Jesus. It would seem that she had a belief that he was able to supply it, though he had as yet worked no miracle."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "They wanted wine [υστερησαντος οινου]. Literally, when the wine failed."
2. "Marriage festivals sometimes lasted a whole week."
3. "They have no wine. Implying a request for help, not necessarily the expectation of a miracle."

### John Calvin:
1. "It may be doubted if she expected or asked any thing from her Son, since he had not yet performed any miracle."
2. "I consider her words to be expressive of earnest compassion; for the holy woman, perceiving that those who had been invited were likely to consider themselves as having been treated with disrespect, and to murmur against the bridegroom, and that the entertainment might in that way be disturbed, wished that some means of soothing them could be adopted."
3. "Chrysostom throws out a suspicion that she was moved by the feelings of a woman to seek I know not what favor for herself and her Son; but this conjecture is not supported by any argument."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The absolute singleness with which Jesus listens to the voice of His heavenly Father is the point to be brought out."
2. "Had it been consistent with His mission to lend help at the summons of any human authority, no bidding would have been so powerful as that of His mother."
3. "The reply of Jesus, however, shows that, besides perplexity and faith, there was also presumption in Mary’s words: she spoke as one who still had the right to suggest and to influence His action."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "When the wine failed (υστερησαντος οινου). Genitive absolute with first aorist active participle of υστερεω, old verb from υστερος, late or lacking."
2. "They have no wine (Οινον ουκ εχουσιν). The statement of the fact was in itself a hint and a request."
3. "Mary had treasured in her heart the wonders connected with the birth of Jesus (Luke 2:19; Luke 2:51). The ministry of the Baptist had stirred her hopes afresh. Had she not told Jesus all that she knew before he went to the Jordan to be baptized of John? This group of disciples meant to her that Jesus had begun his Messianic work. So she dares propose the miracle to him."

### John Gill:
1. "so it was ordered by Divine Providence, that there might be an opportunity for Christ to manifest forth his glory"
2. "knowing the power of Christ to help in this time of necessity, she modestly moves it to him"
3. "being well persuaded of his power, as she might; not from any miracles wrought by him in her family for the support of it, when in distress; but from the wonderful things told her by the angel... and from his being the Messiah"


### John Wesley:
1. "And wine falling short — How many days the solemnity had lasted, and on which day our Lord came, or how many disciples might follow him, does not appear."
2. "His mother saith to him, They have not wine — Either she might mean, supply them by miracle; or, Go away, that others may go also, before the want appears."
