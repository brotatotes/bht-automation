# John 2:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Mary's request to Jesus at the wedding in Cana is met with a gentle reproof, emphasizing the importance of divine guidance. Jesus addresses her as woman not disrespectfully, but with utmost respect. He reminds her that his work is aligned with the Father's timing and will, cautioning against elevating Mary's role beyond what belongs to God. This interaction highlights the significance of Christ's obedience to the Father and teaches us that even in delays, he works according to the proper time, bringing glory to his name.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The answer of our Lord is beyond question one of reproof, and disclaimer of participation in the grounds on which the request was made."
2. "It has perhaps not been enough noticed, that in this answer the Lord declares His period of subjection to her as His earthly parent to be at an end."
3. "My time, the time at which, from the Father‚Äôs appointment and my own concurring will, I am to begin miraculous working, is not yet arrived: forestall it not."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Woman‚Äîno term of disrespect in the language of that day."
2. "In my Father's business I have to do with Him only."
3. "Mine hour, c.‚Äîhinting that He would do something, but at His own time."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Woman - This term, as used here, seems to imply reproof, as if she was interfering in that which did not properly concern her..."
2. "What have I to do with thee? - See the notes at Matthew 8:29... But it is not probable that it denoted either in this place; if it did, it was a mild reproof of Mary for attempting to control or direct him in his power of working miracles."
3. "Mine hour ... - My time. The proper time for my interposing. Perhaps the wine was not yet entirely exhausted... It does not mean that the proper time for his working a miracle, or entering on his public work had not come, but that the proper time for his interposing there had not arrived."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Woman. Implying no severity nor disrespect. It was a highly respectful and affectionate mode of address."
2. "Though in a gentle and affectionate manner, Jesus rejects her interference, intending to supply the demand in His own way."
3. "Mine hour is not yet come. In every case the coming of the hour indicates some crisis in the personal life of the Lord, more commonly His passion."

### John Calvin:
1. "Her anxiety about the inconvenience endured by others, and her desire to have it in some way mitigated, proceeded from humanity, and ought to be regarded as a virtue; but still, by putting herself forward, she might obscure the glory of Christ."
2. "This saying of Christ openly and manifestly warns men to beware lest, by too superstitiously elevating the honor of the name of mother in the Virgin Mary, they transfer to her what belongs exclusively to God."
3. "The instruction conveyed here is still more extensive that whenever the Lord holds us in suspense, and delays his aid, he is not therefore asleep, but, on the contrary, regulates all His works in such a manner that he does nothing but at the proper time."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The English words convey an impression of disrespect and harshness which is absent from the original. This use of the Greek word for 'woman' is consistent with the utmost respect."
2. "Yet the contrast of 'woman' and 'mother' must strike every one who reads with attention. The relation of mother, however precious in its own sphere, cannot be allowed to enter into that in which Jesus now stands."
3. "In every instance 'the hour' is fraught with momentous issues: 'the hour' when the restraint put upon His foes shall continue no longer; when He shall pass away from the world to His Father; when He shall be glorified."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The use of Œ≥œÖŒΩŒ± instead of ŒºŒ∑œÑŒµœÅ (Mother) does show her she can no longer exercise maternal authority and not at all in his Messianic work."
2. "Literally the phrase means, 'What is it to me and to thee?'"
3. "Mine hour is not yet come. This phrase marks a crisis whenever it occurs, especially of his death... Here apparently it means the hour for public manifestation of the Messiahship."

### John Gill:
1. "Calling her 'woman', as it was no ways contrary to her being a virgin...so it was no mark of disrespect."
2. "It is certain she is so called, both here, and elsewhere; but then this is no contradiction to her being a virgin; one, and the same person, may be a virgin, and a woman."
3. "Hereby signifying, that though, as man, and a son of hers, he had been subject to her...yet, as God, he had a Father in heaven, whose business he came to do; and in that, and in his office, as Mediator, she had nothing to do with him; nor was he to be directed by her in that work or to be told, or the least hint given when a miracle should be wrought."

### John Wesley:
1. "He regarded his Father above all, not knowing even his mother after the flesh."
2. "A mild reproof of her inordinate concern and untimely interposal."
3. "May we not learn hence...how absurd it is to address her as if she had a right to command him, on the throne of his glory?"
