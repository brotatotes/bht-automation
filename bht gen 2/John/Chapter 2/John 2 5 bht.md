# John 2:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The mother of Jesus, recognizing her Son's authority and independence, obediently instructs the servants to do whatever he says. She understood that he had the power to perform extraordinary actions and hoped that her request would be fulfilled. It is important for us to similarly depend on Christ alone and follow his instructions if we desire to receive what we ask for.
