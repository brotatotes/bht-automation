# John 2:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These stone jars, used for ceremonial cleansing, were part of the Jewish practice of purifying themselves before eating. The number and size of these water-pots demonstrate the truth of the miracle, as they held a significant quantity of water. It is interesting to note that the jars were made of stone, likely chosen for their durability and resistance to impurities. Despite the superstition and display associated with these rituals, Jesus performed a miraculous act of kindness by providing an abundance of wine for the wedding festivities, showing His generosity and care for the needs of the people.

2. "He pours out His bounty for all, and He vouchsafes His grace to each for guidance."
3. "The filling with water, and drawing out wine, is all that is related. 'The moment of the miracle,' says Lücke, 'is rather understood than expressed. It seems to lie between vv.7 and 8' (i. 471). The process of it is wholly out of the region of our imagination."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There is much uncertainty as to the value of Hebrew measures, whether of length or of capacity. Most probably the measure here mentioned was equivalent to between eight and nine of our imperial gallons, so that the ‘firkin’ of our version is not far wrong."
2. "If each waterpot contained two ‘firkins’ and a half, the whole quantity of water would be about 130 gallons."

2. "Their rule is u,'they may put water for the hands in all sorts of vessels; in vessels of dung, in stone vessels, and in vessels of earth."
