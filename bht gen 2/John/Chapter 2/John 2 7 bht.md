# John 2:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
There was a purpose behind Christ choosing the water pots for this miracle. He made sure they were not the same vessels that were previously filled with wine, to prevent any accusation of collusion. Instead, water pots that had been emptied after the ablutions before the feast were selected. By instructing the servants to fill them with water, Jesus ensured that only water was put into them, leaving no room for any suspicion. The servants diligently followed His orders and filled the pots up to the brim, ensuring that nothing was left undone.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was done by 'them,' so that there might be no opportunity of saying that the disciples of Jesus had filled them with wine to produce the 'appearance' of a miracle."
2. "The quantity was very considerable. The servants would know whether the 'wine' or 'water' had been put in these vessels. It could not be believed that they had either the power or the disposition to impose on others in this manner."
3. "Further, vessels were used for this miracle in which wine had not been kept. These pots were never used to put wine in, but simply to keep 'water' in for the various purposes of ablution."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Fill [γεμισατε] . Compare Mark 4:37, and see on Luke 14:23.

### John Calvin:
1. "The servants might be apt to look upon this injunction as absurd; for they had already more than enough of water... the Lord often acts towards us, that his power may be more illustriously displayed by an unexpected result."
2. "This circumstance is added to magnify the miracle; for when the servants drew wine out of vessels which had been filled with water, no suspicion can remain."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Fill the waterpots with water. Probably they were now empty, perhaps in consequence of the ablutions before the feast."
2. "And they filled them up to the brim. And when they are thus filled, nothing more can be done to fit them for their original design."
3. "They are able to furnish all that can be supplied for ‘the purifying of the Jews.’"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Fill (γεμισατε). Effective first aorist active imperative of γεμιζω, to fill full."
2. "With water (υδατος). Genitive case of material."
3. "Up to the brim (εως ανω). 'Up to the top.'"
4. "No room left in the waterpots now full of water."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ chose the water pots, and not the vessel, or vessels, or bottles, now empty, out of which they had drank their wine; that it might not be said that there was any left therein, which gave colour and flavour to the water." 
2. "He ordered them to be filled with water by the servants, that they might take notice, and be witnesses, that that, and nothing else, was put into them."
3. "They filled them up to the brim; strictly observing the orders of Christ, and the instructions of his mother."
