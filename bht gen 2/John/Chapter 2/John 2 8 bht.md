### Henry Alford:
1. "The ἀρχιτρίκλινος (συμποσίαρχος, ἐπιμελητὴς τοῦ συμποσίου, Euthym), seems to be the same with the ἡγούμενος spoken of, Sirach 35 (32:1), and with the Latin rex, or magister, convivii."
2. "It would seem (from Sir. l. c.) that he was one of the guests raised to the post of presiding over the arrangements of the feast."
3. "Here, he tastes the wine; and therefore probably was a guest himself."

1. "As soon as they were filled the servants were directed to take to the governor of the feast. Jesus made no parade about it, and it does not even appear that he approached the waterpots. He willed it, and it was done."
2. "This was a clear exertion of divine power, and made in such a manner as to leave no doubt of its reality."
3. "The governor - One who presided on the occasion. The one who stood at the 'head' or upper end of the table. He had the charge of the entertainment, provided the food, gave directions to the servants, etc."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "The language of John 2:9, ‘the servants which had drawn the water,’ distinctly suggests that what they drew was water, which, either as soon as drawn, or as soon as presented to the guests, became wine." 
3. "The decision between the last two interpretations must be left with the reader; it will probably rest less on the words of the narrative than on the view which is taken of the significance and meaning of the miracle."
