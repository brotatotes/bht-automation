# John 2:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The tablemaster who tasted the wine did not know of the miracle that had taken place, as he had no knowledge that water had turned into wine. The servants at the feast, however, knew where the wine had come from and that it was indeed water that had been poured into the stone jars. There was no deception or collusion in this miracle, as everyone involved was unaware of how the water had been transformed into wine. In this passage, the governor of the feast and the bridegroom both play significant roles in organizing and overseeing the event.
