2. "She stood without the innermost part of the sepulchre, but not without the sepulchre itself; as appears from her stooping and looking into it."
3. "In a spiritual sense, the absence of Christ is cause of great distress and sorrow to gracious souls; because of the excellency of his person, the near and dear relations he stands in to them and on account of the nature of his presence and company."
