# John 20:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The angels were visible in a human form, clad in shining white garments that symbolize purity and innocence. This manifestation aligns with the Jewish belief and practice of angels appearing in such a manner. As for their positioning, one angel was present at the head and the other at the feet of the Lord's body, indicating their complete guardianship over him. The irregularities in Jewish burial customs, where graves could be arranged differently within the same vault, is why their presence was not confined to a specific location in the tomb.
