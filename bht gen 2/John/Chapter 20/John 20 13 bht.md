# John 20:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Mary Magdalene, overwhelmed by her grief and love for Jesus, encounters a supernatural manifestation at the tomb. The angel reproves her excessive weeping, yet also brings a message of joy - there is no need to weep because Christ has risen. Mary's deep emotional state makes the supernatural event seem ordinary to her. When Jesus Himself appears, she carries on a conversation as if she were speaking with a fellow human being. This conversation contains a mix of reproof and comfort from the angel. Mary's unwavering faith allows Jesus to reveal Himself directly to her, without any intermediaries present.
