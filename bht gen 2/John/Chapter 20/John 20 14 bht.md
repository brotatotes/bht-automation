# John 20:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Mary, in her grief and confusion, turned herself back, sensing the presence of someone behind her. To her surprise, she saw a person, but did not recognize him due to the unfamiliar appearance and her disbelief in seeing him alive. Just as Mary did not expect to see Jesus in that moment, sometimes in our spiritual journey, we may fail to recognize Christ's presence with us. However, the form in which Jesus reveals himself to us may vary, as he meets us where we are and in the way that is most meaningful to us.

1. "It is in the power of God, who gave eyes to men, to lessen their sharpness of vision whenever he thinks proper, that seeing they may not see."
2. "In Mary we have an example of the mistakes into which the human mind frequently falls. Though Christ presents himself to our view, yet we imagine that he assumes various shapes, so that our senses conceive of anything rather than of the true Christ."
3. "Our powers of understanding are liable to be deceived and bewitched by the world and by Satan, that they may have no perception of the truth."

2. "The key to the solution of the difficulty is to be found in Luke 24:16. Her ‘eyes were holden’ that she should not discern her Lord. She was not yet ready for any such recognition as might correspond to the new stage of existence upon which He had entered."
3. "Some further training, therefore, is still needed, and then the glorious revelation shall be given."

2. "she saw a person, but did not know who he was, by reason of the form of his appearance, the difference of his clothes, and not expecting to see him alive."
3. "so sometimes, in a spiritual sense, Christ is with, and near his people, and they know it not... but the sight of him is not always alike to them, nor does he appear to them always in the same form."
