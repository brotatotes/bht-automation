# John 20:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Mary, though mistaking Him for the gardener, still addresses Him politely and respectfully. She suggests that He may have had a reason to remove the body, not wanting to inconvenience the gardener. Just as Mary dearly loved Jesus, a gracious soul is willing to go to any length and endure any trouble to be in His presence. The absence of Jesus only intensifies the desire for Him and makes His presence all the more precious.

3. "so in a spiritual sense, a truly gracious soul is willing to do anything, and to be at any trouble, so that it may but enjoy Christ; it dearly loves him, as this good woman did; it early, and earnestly, and with its whole heart, seeks after him, as she did; and absence of him, or loss of his presence for a while, sharpens the desire after him, and makes his presence the more welcome."
