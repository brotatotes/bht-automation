## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "With one word, and that one word her name, the Lord awakens all the consciousness of His presence."
2. "That she gives way to no impassioned exclamations, but pours out her satisfaction and joy in this one word, is also according to the deepest psychological truth."
3. "The addition of και προσέδραμεν ἅψασθαι αὐτοῦ (see digest: so also, but with προέδραμεν, the cursives 13, 346) is an explanatory gloss to μή μου ἅπτου but doubtless a correct one."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Mary—It is not now the distant, though respectful, 'Woman.' It is the oft-repeated name, uttered, no doubt, with all the wonted manner, and bringing a rush of unutterable and overpowering associations with it."
2. "Rabboni!—But that single word of transported recognition was not enough for woman's full heart."
3. "Not knowing the change which had passed upon Him, she hastens to express by her action what words failed to clothe; but she is checked."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jesus saith unto her, Mary - This was spoken, doubtless, in a tone of voice that at once recalled him to her recollection."
2. "Rabboni - This is a Hebrew word denoting, literally, my great master. It was one of the titles given to Jewish teachers."
3. "This title, among the Jews, was only given to seven persons, all persons of great eminence. As given by Mary to the Saviour, it was at once an expression of her joy, and an acknowledgment of him, as her Lord and Master."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Saith unto Him, Rabboni. Insert, as Rev., after Him, in Hebrew.

### John Calvin:
1. "That Christ allowed Mary, a short time, to fall into a mistake, was useful for confirming her faith; but now, by a single word, he corrects her mistake."
2. "The efficacy of the address is evident from this circumstance, that Mary immediately renders to Christ the honor which is due to him; for the word Rabboni is not only respectful, but involves a profession of obedience."
3. "This is a secret and wonderful change effected on the human understanding when God, enlightening her by his Spirit, renders her clear-sighted, who formerly was slow of apprehension, and indeed, altogether blind."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The very mark, indeed, of the relation between Jesus and His people, when that relation is conceived of in its most tender form, is that ‘He calleth His own sheep by name.’"
2. "It is not strange that it should be so: any experience that she had had of resurrections through the power of Christ had been of resurrections to the former conditions of life. But now she is prepared for more, and therefore she shall be taught to know Jesus fully."
3. "The title thus used by Mary is probably the provincial form Rabban or Rabbi... It means properly ‘My Master,’ and is thus expressive of love and devotedness as well as of respect and reverence."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Clearly the old familiar tone of Jesus was in the pronunciation of her name."
2. "These two simple words tell the great fact that Christ is risen and Mary has seen him."
3. "One says little in really great moments."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ has personal knowledge of all his people, and can call them by name; he knows them, and makes himself known to them before they can know him."
2. "A word from Christ, attended with divine power, will give a soul a turn to him from the most excellent creatures, even angels."
3. "The word Rabboni, is of the Chaldee and Syriac form, and signifies 'my Lord, or master'; and is commonly applied to one that has a despotic power over another."

### John Wesley:
1. Jesus saith to her, Mary — With his usual voice and accent.
