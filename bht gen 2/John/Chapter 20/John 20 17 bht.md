Do not cling to me, Jesus tells Mary, indicating that their previous relationship must change.

He refers to God as my Father and your Father, my God and your God, highlighting both His unique relationship with God and the shared fellowship between God and believers. (95 words)

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This implies in the background another and truer touching, when He should have ascended to the Father."
2. "Noli me tangere, nondum enim ascendi ad Patrem meum: hoc est, nolo ut ad me corporaliter venias, nec ut me sensu carnis agnoscas: ad sublimiora te differo, majora tibi pr√¶paro."
3. "The ŒºŒøœÖ is the ground and source of the ·ΩëŒº·ø∂ŒΩ, therefore the Lord so speaks."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The reason why he directed Thomas to [touch him] was, that he doubted whether he had been restored to life. Mary did not doubt that."
2. "The reason why he forbade her to [touch him] now is to be sought in the circumstances of the case... 'Do not approach me now for this purpose. Do not delay here. Other opportunities will yet be afforded to see me.'"
3. "Nothing was better fitted to afford them consolation than this assurance that this God was theirs; and that, though he had been slain, they were still indissolubly united in attachment to the same Father and God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Mary thought that the old relations between her Lord and herself were to be renewed; that the old intercourse, by means of sight, sound, and touch, would go on as before."
2. "Christ says, 'the time for this kind of intercourse is over. Henceforth your communion with me will be by faith through the Spirit. This communion will become possible through my ascending to the Father.'"

### John Calvin:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The meaning has been made more difficult by a want of sufficient attention to the force of the words ‚ÄòTouch me not;‚Äô for these words do not express the touch of a moment only, but a touch that continues for a time."
2. "They are equivalent to ‚ÄòKeep not thy touch upon me,‚Äô ‚ÄòHandle me not,‚Äô ‚ÄòCling not to me.‚Äô Mary would have held her Lord fast with the grasp of earthly friendship and love."
3. "Jesus does not say ‚ÄòOur Father,‚Äô but ‚ÄòMy Father and your Father;‚Äô so that the significance of ‚Äòbrethren‚Äô lies in this, that the word is used in the very verse which proclaims so clearly the difference between Him and them."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Touch me not (ŒºŒ∑ ŒºŒøœÖ Œ±œÄœÑŒøœÖ). Present middle imperative in prohibition with genitive case, meaning 'cease clinging to me' rather than 'Do not touch me.'"
2. "The prohibition here reminds Mary that the previous personal fellowship by sight, sound, and touch no longer exists and that the final state of glory was not yet begun."
3. "For I am not yet ascended (ŒøœÖœÄœâ Œ≥Œ±œÅ Œ±ŒΩŒ±Œ≤ŒµŒ≤Œ∑Œ∫Œ±). Perfect active indicative. Jesus is here at all only because he has not yet gone home."

### John Gill:
1. "Not that his body was an aerial one, or a mere 'phantom', which could not be touched; the prohibition itself shows the contrary."
2. "God was his Father by nature, or with regard to his divine person, being begotten of him, and so his own proper Son, and he his own proper Father; which hold forth the natural and eternal sonship of Christ, his equality with him, and distinction from him."
3. "This was good news to be brought to his disciples; which, as it carried the strongest marks of affection, and expressions of nearness of relation; and implied that he was now risen from the dead; so it signified that he should ascend to God, who stood in the same relation to them, as to him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Touch me not ‚Äî Or rather, Do not cling to me... Detain me not now. You will have other opportunities of conversing with me."
2. "For I am not ascended to my Father - I have not yet left the world."
3. "But go immediately to my brethren - Thus does he intimate in the strongest manner the forgiveness of their fault, even without ever mentioning it."
4. "I ascend ‚Äî He anticipates it in his thoughts, and so speaks of it as a thing already present."
5. "To my Father and your Father, to my God and your God - This uncommon expression shows that the only-begotten Son has all kind of fellowship with God."
6. "Yet he does not say, Our God: for no creature can be raised to an equality with him: but my God and your God: intimating that the Father is his in a singular and incommunicable manner." (134 words)
