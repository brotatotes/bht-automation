# John 20:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The closed doors where the disciples had gathered in fear reveal the extraordinary nature of Jesus' appearance. His entrance defied the ordinary means of access, emphasizing the miraculous nature of his resurrected body. As he greeted them with the words Peace be unto you, it was not a mere wish, but a tangible impartation of his own peace into their troubled hearts. Just as Jesus opened their minds to understand the Scriptures, his purpose in these encounters was to deepen their faith in his resurrection and solidify their belief in him as the risen Lord.

### Henry Alford:
1. "The circumstance of the doors being shut is mentioned here and in John 20:26, to indicate what sort of appearances these were."

### Philip Schaff:
