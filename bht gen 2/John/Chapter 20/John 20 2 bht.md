# John 20:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Mary, filled with personal affection for Jesus, immediately left the tomb and went to Peter, undoubtedly aware of his whereabouts. Worried about the missing body, she felt compelled to inform Peter, knowing the news would also trouble the other disciples. The disciples' concern was understandable, as they did not yet grasp the resurrection of Jesus. However, they would find comfort and hope in the ministry of the Word and the sacraments in the church.
