## BHT:
Jesus appeared to his disciples after his resurrection, showing them his hands and side as undeniable proof of his bodily resurrection and identity. He not only wanted to confirm his resurrection, but also to connect his present glorification with his past sufferings. The disciples were initially filled with disbelief and fear, but their joy soon overcame them as they realized the reality of seeing their risen Lord. This physical manifestation of Christ's presence brought them immense peace and gladness. Through this encounter, they were prepared for future manifestations and gave testimony to the power and truth of his resurrection.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "not only as ocular and tangible evidence of the reality of His resurrection, but as through 'the power of that resurrection' dispensing all His peace to men."
2. "Then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He showed unto them his hands ... - In this manner he gave them indubitable proofs of his identity."
2. "He showed them that he was the same Being who had suffered; that he had truly risen from the dead, and had come forth with the same body."
3. "That body had not yet put on its glorified form. It was necessary first to establish the proof of his resurrection, and that could be done only by his appearing as he was when he died."

### John Calvin:
1. "He showed them his hands and his side. It was necessary to add this confirmation, that by all these methods they might be fully assured that Christ was risen."
2. "Christ rose not so much for himself as for us; and... whatever contributes to our salvation is glorious to Christ."
3. "Now, since those wounds... serve to confirm the belief of his resurrection, they do not diminish his glory."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In whatever respects the glorified body of Jesus differed from what it had been before His death, there was at least enough of resemblance to make identification not only possible but the necessary result of careful observation."
2. "We shall err, however, if we think that the only object which Jesus had in view in showing His hands and His side was identification. He would also connect His present glorification with His past sufferings."
3. "The disciples therefore rejoiced when they saw the Lord. These words describe the effect of the manifestation upon the disciples... They who thus rejoice when they see Him are prepared for further manifestations of His grace."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This body, not yet glorified, retained the marks of the nails and of the soldier's spear, ample proof of the bodily resurrection against the modern view that only Christ's 'spirit' arose and against the Docetic notion that Jesus had no actual human body."
2. "Jesus had said (John 16:22) that it would be so."
3. "Luke adds (Luke 24:41) that they 'disbelieved for joy.' It was too good to be true, though terror had first seized them when Jesus appeared (Luke 24:37) because of the suddenness of Christ's appearance and their highly wrought state."

### John Gill:
1. "And to put them out of all pain, and that they might know certainly who he was, he showed them his hands and his side."
2. "These he showed, partly to convince them that he was not a spirit, or an apparition, which at first sight they took him to be, from his sudden appearance among them, the doors being locked and barred."
3. "So a spiritual sight of Christ is always rejoicing to a disciple of his; that is, one that has learned of Christ, and learned Christ, who has believed in him, and is enabled to deny sinful, righteous, civil, worldly, and natural self, for Christ."
