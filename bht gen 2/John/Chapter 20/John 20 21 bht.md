The disciples are sent forth by Jesus to continue his ministry, just as he was sent by the Father.

Jesus affirms their commission by imparting the gift of the Holy Spirit, ensuring their success in preaching the Gospel. Their mission is grounded in the example of Christ, and through their willing service, they are to bring the message of peace and redemption to the world.
