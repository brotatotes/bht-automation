# John 20:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the disciples received the breath of Jesus upon them, it symbolized the new life and vigor they would receive. This act not only represented the Spirit of God, but also served as a pledge and confirmation of what they would experience on the day of Pentecost. By breathing on them, Jesus was imparting a special influence of the Holy Spirit, preparing them for their future ministry. This was just a taste of what was to come at Pentecost, an earnest of the full outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon them.

2. "The presence of the Lord among them now was a slight and temporary fulfilment of His promise of returning to them; and so the imparting of the Spirit now, was a symbol and foretaste of that which they should receive at Pentecost."
3. "He proceeds forth in His work (as in His essence) from the Father and the Son: this breathing of His influence was an imparting of Him from the Son in His risen Body, but that Body had not yet been received up, without which union of the God-manhood of the Son to the glory of the Father the Holy Spirit would not come."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "It is the glory of Christ alone to form those whom he appoints to be teachers of his Church... Receive ye the Holy Spirit... The fact plainly shows how different their stinking breath is from the Divine breathing of Christ; for what else is it that they do than to change horses into asses?"
3. "A sure criterion is here laid down for judging of the calling of those who govern the Church of God; and that criterion is, if we see that they have received the Holy Spirit... the efficacy of all those things which believers receive from the sacraments depends on the testimony of the word."
