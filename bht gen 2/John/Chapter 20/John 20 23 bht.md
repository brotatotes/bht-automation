# John 20:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus claimed the power to forgive sins which belongs only to God. He then bestowed upon his disciples the authority to declare, in his name, the conditions and assurance of forgiveness. This authority does not grant the disciples the ability to personally remit sins but rather to proclaim the forgiveness of sins by God. The mission of the Church is to announce her existence as a community of forgiven individuals, inviting others to join in this forgiveness and reconciliation with God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "With the gift and real participation of the Holy Spirit, comes the conviction, and therefore the knowledge, of sin, of righteousness, and judgment."
2. "Since this is so, they who are pre-eminently filled with His presence are pre-eminently gifted with the discernment of sin and repentance in others, and hence by the Lordâ€™s appointment authorized to pronounce pardon of sin and the contrary."
3. "And this gift belongs to the Church in all ages, and especially to those who by legitimate appointment are set to minister in the Churches of Christ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is worthy of remark here that Jesus confers the same power on all the apostles. He gives to no one of them any special authority."
2. "This passage conclusively proves that they were invested with equal power in organizing and governing the church."
3. "The meaning of the passage is not that man can forgive sins that belongs only to God, but that they should be inspired; that in founding the church, and in declaring the will of God, they should be taught by the Holy Spirit to declare on what terms, to what characters, and to what temper of mind God would extend forgiveness of sins."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "The chief point of difference between the Gospel and heathen philosophy lies in this, that the Gospel makes the salvation of men to consist in the forgiveness of sins through free grace."
2. "While Christ enjoins the Apostles to forgive sins, he does not convey to them what is peculiar to himself. It belongs to him to forgive sins. This honor, so far as it belongs peculiarly to himself, he does not surrender to the Apostles, but enjoins them, in his name, to proclaim the forgiveness of sins, that through their agency he may reconcile men to God."
3. "We ought, therefore, to keep by the manner of forgiving sins, so as to know what is that power which has been granted to the apostles."

### John Gill:
1. "God only can forgive sins, and Christ being God, has a power to do so likewise."
2. "It is the mark of antichrist, to attempt anything of the kind; who, in so doing, usurps the divine prerogative, places himself in his seat, and shows himself as if he was God."
3. "But this is to be understood only in a doctrinal, or ministerial way, by preaching the full and free remission of sins, through the blood of Christ, according to the riches of God's grace, to such as repent of their sins, and believe in Christ; declaring, that all such persons as do so repent and believe, all their sins are forgiven for Christ's sake."

### John Wesley:
1. "Whose soever sins ye remit â€” they are remitted, and whose soever sins ye retain - they are retained. So far is plain."
2. "Are not the sins of one who truly repents, and unfeignedly believes in Christ, remitted, without sacerdotal absolution? And are not the sins of one who does not repent or believe, retained even with it? What then does this commission imply?"
3. "Can it imply any more than, 1. A power of declaring with authority the Christian terms of pardon; whose sins are remitted and whose retained? As in our daily form of absolution; and 2. A power of inflicting and remitting ecclesiastical censures? That is, of excluding from, and re-admitting into, a Christian congregation."
