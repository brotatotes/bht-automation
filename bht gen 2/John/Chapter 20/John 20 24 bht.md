# John 20:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The doubting nature of Thomas is highlighted in the passage. His absence when Jesus appeared to the other disciples shows his skepticism and lack of faith. It is important to note that Thomas had both a Jewish and Gentile name, which emphasizes his dual identity. Despite Thomas' shortcomings, this incident serves to strengthen the faith of believers. It serves as a reminder of the importance of fellowship and not neglecting the gatherings of Christ's followers.
