# John 20:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples were able to see the Lord after His resurrection, witnessing the undeniable marks of His crucifixion wounds, which left no room for doubt or deception. This firsthand experience provided a strong foundation for their faith. It is worth noting, however, that encountering Christ goes beyond physical sight. Attending gatherings with fellow believers can offer spiritual sight, allowing individuals to experience the presence and blessings of the Lord. Even the most faithful believers may struggle with doubt, but it is important to confront and address unbelief as a sin that can hinder our relationship with God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He requires no more than had been granted to the rest: but he had their testimony in addition, and therefore ample ground for faith to rest on."
2. "Olshausen calls him the 'Rationalist among the Apostles.'"
3. "Meyer lays some stress on œÑœåœÄŒøŒΩ being used (see var. readd.) instead of œÑœçœÄŒøŒΩ in the second place: 'œÑœçœÄŒøœÇ videtur, œÑœåœÄŒøœÇ impletur,' Grot.; he would see the œÑœçœÄŒøœÇ, but place his finger in the œÑœåœÄŒøœÇ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Except I see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe‚ÄîThe very form of this speech betokens the strength of unbelief."
2. "It is not, 'If I shall see I shall believe, but, unless I shall see I will not believe; nor does he expect to see, although the others tell him they had."
3. "But whence sprang this pertinacity of resistance in such minds? Not certainly from reluctance to believe, but as in Nathanael from mere dread of mistake in so vital a matter."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It requires proof of uncommon clearness and strength to overcome the despondency, and to convince us that we may obtain the object of our desires."
2. "This incident shows, what all the conduct of the apostles proves, that they had not conspired together to impose on the world."
3. "The testimony of those eleven men - including Thomas who saw him alive after he was crucified; who were willing to lay down their lives to attest that they had seen him alive; who had nothing to gain by imposture, and whose conduct was removed as far as possible from the appearance of imposture, should be regarded as ample proof of the fact that he rose from the dead."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Put - thrust [Œ≤Œ±Œªœâ] . The same verb in both cases. Hence better, as Rev., put for thrust."
2. "I will not [ŒøœÖ ŒºŒ∑] . Double negative : in nowise."

### John Calvin:
1. "Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails. This points out the source of the vice to be, that every one wishes to be wise from his own understanding, and flatters himself beyond measure."
2. "These words have no approach to faith, but it is what may be called a sensual judgment, by which I mean, a judgment which is founded on the perception of the senses."
3. "The same thing happens to all who are so devoted to themselves that they leave no room for the word of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He will not believe unless he sees. Yet it hardly seems as if the Resurrection of Jesus were the sole object of his incredulity."
2. "Could he be convinced of the Resurrection they would revive; and he would believe not merely in that miracle as an isolated fact, but in the whole redeeming work of which it was the culmination and the seal."
3. "But there is no such meaning in the original. The word is indeed the same as that in the previous clause which the translators of the Authorised Version themselves render by 'put.' What Thomas desires is certainly more than had been granted to the others."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "Except I shall see... and put."
3. "The print... the original idea."

3. "We may learn from hence how great is the sin of unbelief; that the best of men are subject to it... yet this did not excuse the sin of Thomas."
