# John 20:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After eight days had passed, Jesus made another appearance among his disciples on the following Sunday. This deliberate timing emphasizes the significance of the Lord's Day. Despite locked doors, Jesus entered the room and stood in their midst, demonstrating his divine power. He greeted them with words of peace, showing his desire to strengthen the faith of not only Thomas but also all future believers. This encounter serves as a testament to the truth of monotheism, refuting any notion of multiple gods. Through this event, we are reminded of the importance of observing the Lord's Day and the enduring impact of Christ's resurrection.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There is not the least reason for supposing, with Olshausen, that this appearance was in Galilee. The whole narrative points out the same place as before."
2. "The eight days' interval is the first testimony of the recurring day of the Resurrection being commemorated by the disciples: but, it must be owned, a weak one; for in all probability they had been thus assembled every day during the interval."
3. "It forms however an interesting opening of the history of THE LORD'S DAY, that the Lord Himself should have thus selected and honoured it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Their Lord designedly reserved His second appearance among them till the recurrence of His resurrection day, that He might thus inaugurate the delightful sanctities of THE LORD'S DAY."
2. "Jesus stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was natural that the apostles should observe this day, but not probable that they would do it without the sanction of the Lord Jesus."

2. "This shows, therefore, the truth of what I said a little ago, that the faith which appeared to be destroyed was, as it were, concealed and buried in his heart."
3. "But he plainly ratifies what Thomas said; and, therefore, this passage is abundantly sufficient for refuting the madness of Arius; for it is not lawful to imagine two Gods."
