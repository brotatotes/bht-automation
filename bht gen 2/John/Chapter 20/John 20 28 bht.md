# John 20:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Thomas, completely convinced, boldly addresses the Resurrected Christ as both his Lord and his God. Jesus accepts these words, commending Thomas for his profound declaration of faith. Astonished by the condescension and grace of his Lord, Thomas, filled with shame for his former unbelief, acknowledges his subjection, affection, and unwavering faith in Him. This confession not only confirms Jesus as the risen Lord, but also emphasizes his divine nature, surpassing any previous declarations. Thomas's faith, unshakeable even without physical evidence, stands as a testament to the truth of Christ's deity.
