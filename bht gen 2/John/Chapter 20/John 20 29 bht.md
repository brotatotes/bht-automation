# John 20:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Thomas, though initially doubting, eventually believed when he saw Jesus. Jesus gently reproved Thomas, suggesting that if he had not seen, he would not have believed. However, Christ acknowledges Thomas's faith, affirming that he believed in Jesus as his Lord and God. This faith, though late and slow, was sure and certain, and Thomas rightly recognized Jesus as Lord and God. Jesus approves of Thomas's faith but emphasizes the blessedness of those who believe without personally seeing.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Thou hast become believing and now believest."
2. "Who never saw, and yet became believers."
3. "All the appearances of the forty days were mere preparations for the believing without seeing."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Thou hast indeed believed; it is well: it is only on the evidence of thy senses, and after peremptorily refusing all evidence short of that."
2. "Wonderful indeed and rich in blessing for us who have not seen Him, is this closing word of the Gospel."
3. "And indeed, as the Lord pronounced them blessed who not having seen Him have yet believed, so for that one end have the whole contents of this Gospel been recorded, that all who read it may believe on Him, and believing, have life in that blessed name."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Because thou hast seen me - Because you have looked upon my body, and seen the proofs that I am the same Saviour that was crucified."
2. "Jesus here approves the faith of Thomas, but more highly commends the faith of those who should believe without having seen."
3. "That have not seen ... - Those who should be convinced by the testimony of the apostles, and by the influences of the Spirit. They would evince stronger faith."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Thomas. Omit.

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ blames Thomas for rendering less honor to the word of God than he ought to have done, and for having regarded faith — which springs from hearing, and ought to be wholly fixed on the word — as bound to the other senses."
2. "He draws a comparison between the Apostles and the holy kings and prophets, (Matthew 13:17,) who had been kept under the dark shadows of the Mosaic Law. He says, that now the condition of believers is much more desirable, because a brighter light shines around them, or rather, because the substance and truth of the figures was made known to them."
3. "In this sense Paul says to the Galatians, (Galatians 3:1,) that Christ was crucified before their eyes; and, therefore, if we desire to see in Christ what may render us happy and blessed, let us learn to believe, when we do not see."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The words are intended for the Church now about to be called out of the world, for the Church of all ages, which by the very necessity of the case must believe without seeing." 
2. "The contrast is of a deeper kind, between a faith resting entirely upon outward evidence of Divine claims, and a faith rising higher and resting upon that intuitive perception of the Divine in Jesus which is afforded by the consideration of what He is in Himself as the Crucified and Risen Lord."
3. "Thus to us, who are separated by many centuries from the time when the Lord was personally present in the world, is the blessed assurance given that, though we have not seen Him, we may love Him; and that, though now we see Him not, we may rejoice in Him with a joy unspeakable and glorified."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Thou hast believed" - Bernard
2. "Thomas made a noble confession, but he missed the highest form of faith without the evidence of the senses." - Commentary
3. "It was sight, not touch that convinced Thomas" - Bernard

### John Gill:
1. "Because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed; which carries in it a tacit and gentle reproof for his unbelief, and suggests, that if he had not seen, he would not have believed; but is not so harsh as if that had been expressed." 
2. "Christ here allows that Thomas had believed, that he was risen from the dead, and that he was his Lord and God; and though his faith was late and slow, it was sure and certain, and was appropriating; it was a faith of interest, though upon sight, and not on hearing, or the report of the other disciples." 
3. "From hence may be observed, that Christ allows of the epithets and titles given him by Thomas, and therefore must be Lord and God; and approves of Thomas's faith, and therefore that must be right; though he prefers faith without personal sight of him to it."
