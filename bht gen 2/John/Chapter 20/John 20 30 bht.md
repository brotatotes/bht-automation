# John 20:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The book being discussed contains an account of Jesus' miracles, but the author is clear that it does not include a complete record. Many other miracles performed by Jesus are not written down in this book or in the writings of the other evangelists. However, it is important to know that Jesus performed a vast number of miracles, some of which were witnessed by his disciples after his resurrection. These signs were sufficient to build and strengthen faith in him as the Messiah.
