# John 20:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The purpose of the book is to provide enough evidence for us to believe that Jesus, the son of Mary and Joseph, the carpenter's son from Nazareth and Galilee, is indeed the Christ, the true Messiah. This title, the Son of God, does not just describe Jesus' role, but also his divine nature and his relationship to God. Through faith in Jesus, believers receive spiritual and eternal life, including grace, justification, sanctification, and communion with Him. The written accounts serve to confirm and strengthen our belief, and reading the Scriptures can help to increase and sustain our faith.
