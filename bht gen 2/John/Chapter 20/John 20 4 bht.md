# John 20:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples were filled with eagerness and excitement as they set out to the tomb of Jesus, running rather than walking, eager to discover the truth. John, being younger and more nimble, outran Peter and arrived at the sepulchre first. It is worth noting that Peter's concern and guilt over denying Jesus might have also played a role in his slower pace. Nonetheless, the race to the tomb was won by John, revealing his youthful feet and fervent spirit.
