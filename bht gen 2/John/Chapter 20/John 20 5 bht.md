# John 20:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
John stooped down and looked into the tomb, seeking to catch a glimpse of what lay within. He peered in, his eyes filled with awe and curiosity. It is noteworthy that he did not enter the tomb. The entrance was low, and he had to bend down to even see inside. Perhaps, his timid nature caused him to hesitate or fear going in alone. Yet, he remained at the entrance, his gaze fixed on the mystery before him.
