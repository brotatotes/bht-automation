# John 20:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter entered the tomb and noticed the linen clothes in which the body had been wrapped lying there, not haphazardly but deliberately placed. This careful arrangement of the linen clothes and the folded napkin indicated that the body had not been stolen or hastily removed. It would have taken time and effort to carefully unwrap the body. Perhaps it was the angels who served the Risen One who took the time to fold the napkin and linen clothes, signifying the tranquillity and grandeur of the resurrection.
