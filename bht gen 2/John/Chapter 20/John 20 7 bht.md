# John 20:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The organized arrangement in the tomb indicates a calm and deliberate resurrection. Despite false claims that the body was sewn up, the mention of a separate napkin refutes those ideas. The napkin for the head was neatly rolled up and placed apart from the linen clothes. This attention to detail and orderliness demonstrates that there was no haste or theft involved. Instead, it signifies that Christ, whether by himself or with the assistance of angels, intentionally left behind the tokens of death to testify to his blessed and immortal life.

### John Calvin:
1. "When the Evangelist says, that a napkin was wrapped about his head, this refutes the falsehood of the Papists, who pretend that the whole body was sewed up in one linen garment..."
2. "To this is added a fabulous miracle, which they have contrived, to this effect, that the likeness of Christ’s body continued to be visible in the linen cloth."
3. "Let us be satisfied with this simple view of the matter, that Christ, by laying aside the tokens of death, intended to testify that he had clothed himself with a blessed and immortal life."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The napkin (το σουδαριον). Already in John 11:44 which see. This napkin for the head was in a separate place."
2. "Rolled up (εντετυλιγμενον). Perfect passive participle, predicate accusative like κειμενον, from εντυλισσω, late verb, to wrap in, to roll up, already in Matthew 27:59; Luke 23:53. It was arranged in an orderly fashion."
3. "There was no haste. By itself (χωρις). Old adverb, 'apart,' 'separately.'"

### John Gill:
1. "The word σουδαριον, rendered 'napkin', is thought to be originally Latin, and signifies an handkerchief, with which the sweat is wiped off the face..."
2. "Peter... observed that which neither he nor John had taken notice of, when only stooping they looked in: and that is, that this head binder, or napkin, was not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself..."
3. "Clearly showed, that the body was not taken away in a hurry, or by thieves, since everything lay in such order and decency; and which was done, either by our Lord himself, or by the angels."
