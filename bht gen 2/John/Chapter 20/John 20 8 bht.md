# John 20:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
John, inspired by Peter's actions, also entered the tomb and observed that the body of Jesus was not there. He witnessed the linen clothes lying in one place and the folded-up napkin in another. This observation affirmed his belief in the resurrection, as he understood that if Jesus had truly risen from the dead, His physical body would no longer be in the tomb.
