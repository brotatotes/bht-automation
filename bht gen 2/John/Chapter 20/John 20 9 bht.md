# John 20:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples, overwhelmed with sorrow, did not initially comprehend or remember the many times Jesus had foretold His resurrection. Their lack of understanding stemmed from a limited grasp of the Scriptures and preconceived notions about the nature of the Messiah. However, through the divine work of God, their eyes were opened to the truth, and they became witnesses to the fulfillment of Scripture in the resurrection of Jesus.
