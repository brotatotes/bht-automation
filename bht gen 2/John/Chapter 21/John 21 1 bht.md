# John 21:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The third appearance of Jesus to the disciples reinforces the truth of his resurrection. These appearances were not mere coincidences or hallucinations, but deliberate manifestations of Jesus in order to establish his divine authority and encourage the faith of his followers. The repetition of his appearances emphasizes the certainty and significance of the resurrection event.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The use of the verb here indicates that the usual state of the Lord at this time was not manifestation, but invisibility to them."
2. "The expression indicates the locality, not the manner, of the appearance; on, i.e. on the shore of the sea of Galilee."
3. "ἐφαν. δὲ οὕτως must not be too rashly cited as unlike John’s style. We must remember that, in adding an appendix, expressions of this kind would occur, which the narrative itself would not contain."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Jesus showed himself again—manifested himself again." 
2. "This way of speaking shows that after His resurrection He appeared to them but occasionally, unexpectedly, and in a way quite unearthly, though yet really and corporeally."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Galilee was a retired place where they would be free from danger, and was therefore a safe and convenient situation for Jesus to meet them, in order to give them his last instructions."
2. "On this wise - Thus. In this manner."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "It is the setting forth of the law or will or character of God; of the person or work of Christ; of the character or deeds of men, with a view to the disclosure of their quality and to the producing of a moral impression."

1. "The Evangelist still labors to prove the resurrection of Christ, and relates, that he appeared to seven disciples, among whom he mentions Thomas, not out of respect to him, so much as because his testimony ought to be the more readily believed in proportion to the obstinacy of his unbelief."
2. "The Evangelist enters sufficiently into detail; for he carefully collects all the circumstances which contribute to prove the truth of the history."
3. "We have formerly mentioned that the Lake of Tiberias, according to the Hebrew custom, is called the Sea of Tiberias."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The words 'after these things' are indefinite, and throw no light upon the length of the interval that elapsed between the last and the present appearance of Jesus."
2. "What we have before us, therefore, is not merely the fact that Jesus showed Himself to the disciples, but that He exhibited Himself in a glory which the natural eye could not have discerned."
3. "Surely such notices on the part of different historians are supplementary, not discordant."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus was only seen during the forty days now and then, ten instances being recorded."
2. "The word φανεροω is often used of Christ on earth, of his works, of the second coming, of Christ in glory."
3. "Tiberias, the capital city of Galilee, gave this epithet to the Sea of Galilee."

### John Gill:
