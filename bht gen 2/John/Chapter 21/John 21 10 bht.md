# John 21:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples obediently followed Christ's instruction to bring some of the fish they caught, which He miraculously directed them to catch. This act served a twofold purpose - to provide enough food for a meal and to symbolize the gathering of souls to Christ through the ministry of the Word, adding to those already gathered. The combination of the fish caught by Christ's divine power and the disciples' labor demonstrates the synergy between God's provision and human participation.
