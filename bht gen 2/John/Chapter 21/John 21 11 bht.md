# John 21:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The multitude and size of fish caught in the net symbolically foreshadowed the vast success of their approaching ministry. The net breaking represented the difficulty of keeping the caught men from escaping back into the world. Jesus Himself invisibly gathers some, who later join the efforts of the fishers of men. The number of fish caught was remarkable, but the net remained intact, signifying that none were lost. This miracle contrasts with the one in Luke 5:6, emphasizing the difference between a ministry of trial and a ministry of triumph.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The enumeration is singular, and not to be accounted for by any mystical significance of the number..."
2. "This betokens the careful counting which took place after the event, and in which the narrator took a part."
3. "Herein [it] differs from what happened in Luke 5:6, when it was broken."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The multitude and the size of the fishes they caught symbolically foreshadowed the vast success of their now fast approaching ministry, and this only as a beginning of successive draughts."
2. "The net 'was breaking'...expressive of the difficulty with which, after they had 'caught men,' they would be able to retain, or keep them from escaping back into the world."
3. "Jesus Himself, by unseen methods, gathers some, who afterwards are recognized by the constituted fishers of men, and mingle with the fruit of their labors."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The number is mentioned because it seems to have been a very unusual draught, and it was particularly gratifying and striking to them after they had spent the whole night and had caught nothing."
2. "This convinced them that it was no other than the same Saviour who had so often worked wonders before them that was now with them."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "All authorities agree as to the abundance of fish in the Lake of Galilee."
2. "The fame of the lake in this particular reached back to very early times."
3. "The Talmud names certain kinds of fish which might be eaten without being cooked, and designates them as small fishes."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The fishes drawn to shore by means of the net were 'great:' yet neither by their size nor by their number was the net rent. No fish was lost."
2. "The comparison of this miracle with that of the draught of fishes in Luke 5:4-7 supplies various points of contrast, at once bringing out and confirming what we have yet to speak of as the inner meaning of the section before us."
3. "The contrasts all point to the difference between a ministry of trial with a suffering Lord, and a ministry of triumph with a glorified Lord."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Went up (ανεβη). Into the little boat or dinghy."
2. "Drew (ειλκυσεν). Same verb as ελκυσα in verse John 21:6. Peter now did what they had failed to do."
3. "Was not rent (ουκ εσχισθη). First aorist passive indicative of σχιζω, to split (our word 'schism')."

### John Gill:
1. "An emblem of the whole number of God's elect being brought safe to shore, to Christ, and to heaven, through various tribulations and afflictions in the world, fitly signified by the waves of the sea."
2. "What mystery there may be in the number, I know not. The conjecture of Grotius, that it is a figure of the proselytes in the days of David and Solomon, seems to be without foundation; since they were not only so many thousands, but six hundred over."
3. "And for all there were so many; in number, and these so large and big, and the weight of them so great. The Syriac reads כלה יוקראבהנא, 'with all this weight', or 'burden', and so the Persic; but the Arabic, 'with such a number'; both ideas of number and weight are to be preserved, to make what follows the more observable: yet was not the net broken."
