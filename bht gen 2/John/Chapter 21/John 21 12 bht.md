# John 21:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples, in awe of the miraculous signs that had revealed Jesus to them, sat down in silence, knowing Him to be their divine Host. The breakfast they shared with Jesus was not a typical meal but an early morning feast, reminiscent of the Greek breakfast known as ajkratisma. Their hesitation to ask Him who He was stemmed from their certainty of His identity as the risen Lord. In this intimate encounter, Jesus provided a sign of the spiritual refreshment that believers find in His presence and the future joy awaiting them in the resurrection morning.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "οὐδεὶς ἐτ. ] I take these words to imply that they sat down to the meal in silence, wondering at, while at the same time they well knew, Him who was thus their Host."
2. "Chrys. says, οὐκέτι γὰρ τὴν αὐτὴν παῤῥησίαν εἶχον … ἀλλὰ μετὰ σιγῆς καὶ δεοῦς πολλοῦ καὶ αἰδοῦς ἐκαθέζοντο προσέχοντες πρὸς αὐτόν."
3. "τολμᾶν and  ἐξετάζειν are  not elsewhere in John."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Come and dine - The word in the original means the meal which is taken in the morning, or breakfast."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The meal described here, however, evidently took place at an earlier hour, and would seem to have answered more nearly to the ajkratisma, or breakfast of the Greeks, which was taken directly upon rising."
2. "Plutarch, however, expressly states that both names were applied to the morning meal, and says of Alexander, 'He was accustomed to breakfast [ηριστα] at early dawn, sitting, and to sup [εδειπνει] late in the evening.'"
3. "Ask [εξετα. σαι] . Rev., inquire. Implying careful and precise inquiry. It occurs only three times in the New Testament; of Herod's command to search diligently for the infant Christ (Matthew 2:8), and of the apostles' inquiring out the worthy members of a household (Matthew 10:11)."

### John Calvin:
1. "The disciples did not ask Christ, because they were afraid of doing him wrong; so plain and manifest were the signs by which he had made himself known to them."

3. "The Evangelist...means that the disciples did not ask Christ, because they were not sufficiently certain that he was the Christ."

### Philip Schaff:

### John Gill:
1. "One would think it should rather have been said, come and take a breakfast than a dinner, since it was so early in the morning...but Grotius has observed, out of Homer, that αριστον, is used for food taken in a morning."
2. "...an emblem of that spiritual refreshment believers enjoy with Christ in his house and ordinances now, and of those everlasting pleasures they will partake with him in the resurrection morn."
3. "And none of the disciples durst ask him, who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord...so at the last day, when every eye shall see him coming in the clouds of heaven, none will ask who he is; all will know him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Come ye and dine" - Our Lord needed not food.
2. "And none presumed" - To ask a needless question.
