# John 21:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ came and took his place as the master of the feast, giving thanks and distributing both bread and fish to His disciples. He acted as a host, providing plentifully for His people in a spiritual sense. This meal with His faithful followers symbolized His provision and care, inviting them to partake freely of what He had prepared for them. Just as He physically nourished them at this breakfast, He also nourishes us with the hidden manna, the tree of life, and the living waters, all at His own expense and for our benefit.
