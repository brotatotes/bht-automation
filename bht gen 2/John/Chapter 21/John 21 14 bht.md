# John 21:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This is the third time that Jesus manifested himself to his disciples, emphasizing the significance of this particular event. Before this, he had appeared to Mary Magdalene and to the group of women. Now, he appears to them together, confirming his resurrection and further solidifying their faith in him. This manifestation not only serves as a confirmation of his resurrection but also as a preparation for the important mission that would follow for his disciples.
