# John 21:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus questions Peter, his use of the name Simon bar Jonah signifies the previous occasion where Peter made a strong profession of faith and was blessed by Jesus. The purpose of this question is to remind Peter of his denial and to make him reflect on his love for Christ compared to the other disciples. By asking three times, Jesus alludes to Peter's threefold denial, making him more aware of his past actions and helping him recognize Jesus's knowledge of his heart.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Surely every word would have been recorded. One great object of this appearance, observes Stier, certainly was the confirmation, and encouragement of the 'fisher of men,' in his apostolic office."
2. "Peter’s answer shows that he understood the question as above. He says nothing of the πλέον τούτων but dropping all comparison of himself with others, humbly refers to the Searcher of hearts the genuineness of his love, however the past may seem to have called it in question."
3. "The distinction between ἀγαπᾶν and φιλεῖν must not here be lost sight of, nor must we superficially say with Grotius, 'Promiscue hic usurpavit Johannes ἀγαπᾶν et φιλεῖν ut mox βόσκειν et ποιμαίνειν (see below).' If so, why do the Lord’s two first questions contain ἀγαπᾷς while Peter’s answers have φιλῶ whereas the third time the question and answer both have φιλεῖν? This does not look like accident."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Silence appears to have reigned during the meal; unbroken on His part, that by their mute observation of Him they might have their assurance of His identity the more confirmed; and on theirs, from reverential shrinking to speak till He did."
2. "He adds not, 'more than these,' but prefixes a touching appeal to the Saviour's own omniscience for the truth of his protestation, which makes it a totally different kind of speech from his former."
3. "It is much more according to usage to understand by the 'lambs,' young and tender disciples, whether in age or Christian standing, and by the 'sheep' the more mature."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Lovest thou me more than thou lovest these objects? Art thou now willing, from love to me, to forsake all these, and go and preach my gospel to the nations of the earth?"
2. "In this question Jesus refers to the profession of superior attachment to him which Peter had made before his death."
3. "The church is often compared to a flock. The Lord Jesus saw, what has been confirmed in the experience of the church, that the success of the gospel among men depended on the care which the ministry would extend to those in early life."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He never addresses him by the name of Peter, while that name is commonly used, either alone or with Simon, in the narrative of the Gospels." 
2. "The question conveys a gentle rebuke for his former extravagant professions." 
3. "There is a remarkable resemblance between the present situation and that of the two scenes in the previous life of Peter with which it is related."

### John Calvin:
1. "That treacherous denial, which has been formerly described, had, undoubtedly, rendered him unworthy of the apostleship; for how could he be capable of instructing others in the faith, who had basely revolted from it?"
2. "To us also, in the present day, it is of very great importance, that Peter comes forth to us as a new man, from whom the disgrace that might have lessened his authority has been removed."
3. "But because he employs the agency of men in preaching doctrine, he conveys to them also his own name, or, at least, shares it with them. Those men, therefore, are reckoned to be Pastors in the sight of God, who govern the Church by the ministry of the word under Christ, who is their Head."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The question ('lovest thou') contains the second of the two Greek verbs for loving, of which we have already spoken... This verb is less expressive of emotions of tenderness, of personal feeling and affection, than that verb used by Peter in his reply." 
2. "The words 'more than these' in our Lord's question can hardly spring from anything else than the remembrance of the apostle's hasty assertion before his denial of his Master."
3. "Not only so; it is to be further noticed that the apostle does not use the same word for 'love' as had been employed by Jesus. He uses one that speaks of a more familiar and friendly affection, implying less depth of serious thought."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Lovest thou me more than these? (αγαπαις με πλεον τουτων;). Ablative case of comparison τουτων (disciples) after πλεον."
2. "Peter makes no claim here to superior love and passes by the 'more than these' and does not even use Christ's word αγαπαω for high and devoted love, but the humbler word φιλεω for love as a friend."
3. "Feed my lambs (Βοσκε τα αρνια μου). For the old word βοσκω (to feed as a herdsman) see Matthew 8:33."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ calls him by this name of Simon bar Jonah, when he made the most ample profession of his faith in him, and was pronounced blessed by him." 
2. "The question is, whether he loved Christ more than the rest of the disciples loved him."
3. "Nothing he looks upon as a firmer and clearer proof and evidence of love to him, than to feed these lambs of his, and take care of them."

### John Wesley:
1. "The remembrance of which might make him more deeply sensible of his late denial of him whom he had so confessed."
2. "Thrice our Lord asks him, who had denied him thrice.
3. "He had now learnt by sad experience that Jesus knew his heart."
