# John 21:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus had appreciated Peter's desire to avoid comparison when discussing his love for Jesus compared to others. With this repetition, Jesus challenges Peter to affirm his own love. Peter, in his reply, echoes his previous response. Jesus uses the term shepherd to convey the care, guidance, and protection that is required for his followers. He values each act of love and care shown to his sheep as an indication of devotion to him.
