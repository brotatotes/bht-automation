# John 21:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When thou art old, another shall gird thee, referring to the time when Peter would be bound and led to his crucifixion. This displays the contrast between his previous freedom and the constraints he would face as a follower of Christ. It signifies the readiness and courage required to bear the cross and fulfill God's work. Ultimately, Peter's journey led him to a place he did not desire to go, symbolizing the struggle between his natural inclinations and the call to obey and serve God.
