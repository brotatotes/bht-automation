# John 21:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter, the disciple of Jesus, would glorify God through his death. He was destined to die a martyr's death and specifically, he would be crucified. It is significant to note that Peter requested to be crucified upside down. This act of martyrdom, as confirmed by ecclesiastical history, demonstrates Peter's profound commitment and willingness to follow Jesus' command to follow me. By suffering for his faith, Peter exemplified the ultimate act of glorifying God.
