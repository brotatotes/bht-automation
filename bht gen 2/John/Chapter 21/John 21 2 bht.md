# John 21:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Amidst the anticipation for the Holy Spirit's arrival, the disciples, including Simon Peter who had once denied Jesus, remained unified and hopeful, longing for another encounter with their beloved Lord. Alongside them, Thomas, who had initially doubted the resurrection, now held steadfast in his conviction and eagerly seized every chance to meet with the resurrected Christ. Additionally, Nathanael, also known as Bartholomew, a genuine and sincere follower of Jesus, was present among the disciples, embodying the virtues of an Israelite devoid of deceit.
