This disciple, referred to as the disciple whom Jesus loved, had a special connection with Jesus, symbolized by his leaning on Jesus' breast. This disciple's close relationship with Jesus justified his close following of Jesus, even when others did not.

Just as this disciple followed Jesus without hesitation, so should we faithfully respond to God's calling.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is impossible to think that the Evangelist intends us to confine our attention to the literal details given in this verse."
