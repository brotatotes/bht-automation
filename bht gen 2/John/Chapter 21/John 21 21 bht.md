# John 21:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter's question about the other disciple's role shows that he understood the prophecy regarding himself. He was likely curious about what work and service the other disciple would be involved in, as he seemed willing to serve Jesus. However, Jesus did not choose to indulge Peter's curiosity and instead focused on his own instructions for Peter. Peter's inquiry may have stemmed from his deep affection for the other disciple and a desire to understand their respective roles in serving Christ.
