# John 21:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Peter inquired about the fate of another disciple, Jesus sharply rebuked him and said, If it was my pleasure that he should live until I come, what is that to you? Jesus made it clear that Peter's primary focus should be on his own duty and calling, not on the fate of others. Christ reminds Peter to stay committed and faithful to following Him, without being consumed by curiosity about the lives and futures of fellow believers. We are each responsible for our own journey of faith, following our Lord and Master with steadfastness and devotion.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "They remind Peter of the distinctness of each man’s position and duty before the Lord; and the σύ μοι ἀκ ., which follows, directs his view along that course of duty and suffering, which was appointed for him by his Divine Master."
2. "At the destruction of Jerusalem began that mighty series of events of which the Apocalypse is the prophetic record, and which is in the complex known as the ‘COMING OF THE LORD,’ ending, as it shall, with His glorious and personal Advent."
3. "When De Wette (whom Lücke in the main follows: see also Mr. Elliott, Apocal. Alf. p. 160) calls this interpretation ganz nichtig, and would interpret this answer by the current idea in apostolic times, that His coming was very near, he is assuming (1) that this was the idea of the Apostles themselves; (2) that this answer is not that of our Lord, but apocryphal."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "From the fact that John alone of the Twelve survived the destruction of Jerusalem, and so witnessed the commencement of that series of events which belongs to 'the last days,' many good interpreters think that this is a virtual prediction of fact, and not a mere supposition."
2. "It seems more natural to consider our Lord as intending to give no positive indication of John's fate at all, but to signify that this was a matter which belonged to the Master of both, who would disclose or conceal it as He thought proper, and that Peter's part was to mind his own affairs."
3. "Observe the absolute disposal of human life which Christ claims: 'If I will that he tarry till I come,' &c."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If I will that he should not die at all, it is nothing to thee."
2. "Our main business is to follow the Lord Jesus Christ."
3. "Jesus will take care of all his true disciples, and that we should not be unduly solicitous about them."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Till I come. Rather, while I am coming."
2. "What is that to thee? Literally, what as concerns thee?"
3. "Compare John 9:4; John 12:35, John 12:36; 1 Timothy 4:13."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is no concern of yours," says he, "and you have no right to inquire what becomes of your companion; leave that to my disposal; think only about yourself, and prepare to follow where you are called."
(237)
2. "Not that all anxiety about brethren is uncalled for but it ought to have some limit, so that it may be anxiety, and not curiosity, that occupies our attention."
(237)
3. "Let every man, therefore, look to his neighbours, if by any means he may succeed in drawing them along with him to Christ, and let not the offenses of others retard his own progress."
(237)

3. "That lesson Peter needed."

### John Gill:
1. "If it was his pleasure that he should live, not till his second coming to judge the quick and dead at the last day, but till he should come in his power and take vengeance on the Jewish nation, in the destruction of their city and temple by the Romans, and in dispersing them through the nations of the world."
2. "The question was too curious, improper, and impertinent; it became him to attend only to what concerned himself, and he was bid to do."
3. "Christ is to be followed by his people as their leader and commander; as the shepherd of the flock; as a guide in the way, and the forerunner that is gone before; as the light of the world; as the pattern and example of the saints, and as their Lord and master."
