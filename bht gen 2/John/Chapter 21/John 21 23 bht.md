# John 21:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Christians, also known as the brethren, were taught by Jesus himself to use this term. It is interesting to note that Jesus did not explicitly say to John that he would not die. In fact, it seems that even St. John himself, the author of this Gospel, was unsure whether he would die or not.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

2. "The simple recapitulation of the words of the Lord shows that their sense remained dark to the writer, who ventured on no explanation of them."

### John Calvin:
1. "The teaching of Christ is useful, and for edification; that is, it is plain; but we obscure the light by our wicked inventions, which we bring to it from our own views."
2. "The consequence was, that this very error, against which the Evangelist had expressly warned them to be on their guard, continued notwithstanding to gain currency in the world; for a fable has been contrived, that he ordered a ditch to be digged for him, and went down into it, and that next day it was found empty."
3. "We see, therefore, that we shall never cease to err, unless we unreservedly receive what the Lord hath taught us, and reject all inventions of men."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Having reported the answer of Jesus, the Evangelist is constrained to correct a misapprehension of its meaning which had prevailed in the Church."
