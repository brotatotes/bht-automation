# John 21:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The purpose of this passage is to highlight the fragmentary nature of the Gospel, emphasizing that it only captures a portion of the many things Jesus did. The author acknowledges that if every detail were written, the world itself would not be able to contain all the books. This hyperbolic statement conveys the abundance and depth of Jesus' works. The Gospel presents the profound understanding of God's nature, surpassing the speculations of philosophers. These written accounts are intended to provide sufficient evidence of Jesus' identity as the true Messiah, eliciting faith in him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The purpose of this verse seems to be to assert and vindicate the fragmentary character of the Gospel, considered merely as a historical narrative."
2. "I am persuaded that in this chapter we have a fragment, both authentic and genuine, added by the Apostle himself, bearing evidence of his hand, but in a 'second manner,' a later style."
3. "His √† priori reason, that had it been an appendix afterwards added, we should have had two distinct editions of the Gospel, whereas now all the MSS. contain it, is not reliable."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And there are many other things which Jesus did‚Äî(Compare John 20:30; John 20:31)."
2. "even the world itself would not hold the books, &c.‚Äînot a mere hyperbolical expression, unlike the sublime simplicity of this writer, but intended to let his reader know that, even now that he had done, he felt his materials so far from being exhausted, that he was still running over, and could multiply 'Gospels' to almost any extent within the strict limits of what 'Jesus did.'"
3. "But in the limitation of these matchless histories, in point of number, there is as much of that divine wisdom which has presided over and pervades the living oracles, as in their variety and fulness."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This figure of speech is commonly the effect of surprise, or having the mind full of some object, and not having words to express the ideas: at the same time, the words convey no falsehood."
2. "Thus, when Longinus said of a man that 'he was the owner of a piece of ground not larger than a Lacedaemonian letter,' no one understood him literally."
3. "It contains the purest and most elevated views of God to be found anywhere, as far exceeding all the speculations of philosophers as the sun does the blaze of a taper."

### John Calvin:
1. "He does not speak of Christ‚Äôs actions of every kind, but of those which relate to his public office; nor ought we to think that the hyperbole is absurd, when we bear with many figures of speech of the same kind in heathen authors."
2. "The majesty of Christ, which by its infinity swallowed up, if I may so speak, not only the senses of men, but heaven and earth, gave a miraculous display of its own splendor in those works."
3. "Yet we ought to remember what we formerly stated, that the summary which the Evangelists have committed to writing, is sufficient both for regulating faith and for obtaining salvation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To have given a complete history of the facts of Christ‚Äôs life would have been impossible. He has chosen those only which bore upon his particular aim."
2. "But is it not at once more reverent and more true to say that the language here used expresses the infinitude which the apostle beheld in the life of Jesus, the fathomless depths which he knew his Lord‚Äôs every work and every word to contain?"
3. "What apostle or disciple of Jesus, known to us as belonging to the first age of the Christian Church, could have so spoken but that apostle whom Jesus loved?"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "If they should be written every one (ŒµŒ±ŒΩ Œ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒ∑œÑŒ± Œ∫Œ±Œ∏' ŒµŒΩ). Condition of the third class with ŒµŒ±ŒΩ and present passive subjunctive of Œ≥œÅŒ±œÜœâ, "If they should be written one by one" (in full detail)."
2. "I suppose (ŒøŒπŒºŒ±). Note change back to the first person singular by the author."
3. "Would not contain (ŒøœÖŒ¥' Œ±œÖœÑŒøŒΩ œÑŒøŒΩ Œ∫ŒøœÉŒºŒøŒΩ œáœâœÅŒ∑œÉŒµŒπŒΩ). Future active infinitive in indirect discourse after ŒøŒπŒºŒ±."

### John Gill:
1. "The Holy Ghost has not thought fit to lay such a burden on men they could not bear, as to read such numbers of volumes; but has reduced them into a brief compendium, which may be read with ease, delight, and pleasure."
2. "The intention of this expression, supposing it hyperbolical, is to show, that but a few of the wonderful things done by Christ were recorded by the evangelist, in comparison of the many which he every day did."
3. "These that were written are sufficient to prove him to be the true Messiah, and to require faith in him as such."

### John Wesley:
1. "If they were to be written particularly ‚Äî Every fact, and all the circumstances of it."
2. "I suppose ‚Äî This expression, which softens the hyperbole, shows that St. John wrote this verse."
