# John 21:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Simon Peter, having no immediate service in the ministry of the word, decided to go fishing, his former occupation. This was partly to avoid idleness and also to sustain himself since the death of Christ had changed their circumstances. The disciples, belonging to the tribe and division near the sea, had the right to use a boat and net, which they did as they embarked on their fishing expedition.

3. "Their present part was not to go fishing of themselves, but περιμένειν τ . ἐπαγγελίαν τοῦ πατρός, Acts 1:4."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "Immediately. Omit."

### John Calvin:
