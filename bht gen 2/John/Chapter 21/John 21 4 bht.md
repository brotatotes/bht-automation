# John 21:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus appeared to the disciples at daybreak, they did not immediately recognize him, as if their eyes were prevented from seeing him clearly. This lack of recognition may have been due to the imperfect light or perhaps because it was not yet the time for Jesus to reveal himself fully. Nevertheless, it is a reminder that Christ can be present among his people even when they do not perceive his presence.
