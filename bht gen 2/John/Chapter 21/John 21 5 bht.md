# John 21:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
And even though Jesus used this affectionate and familiar term of address, they still did not recognize him. The term children is reminiscent of believers who are referred to as true children in the New Testament. Sometimes believers may find themselves without spiritual nourishment, but Jesus, as the Good Shepherd, will not let them go hungry. He has made provision for their spiritual needs through the ministry of the Word and sacraments.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "παιδία. See reff. In ch. Joh 13:33 we have τεκνία." 
2. "προσφάγιον is said by the grammarians to be the Hellenic form equivalent to the Attic ὄψον, signifying anything eaten as an additament to bread, but especially fish." 
3. "So that here the best rendering would be as in A.V.R., Have ye any fish?"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Children—This term would not necessarily identify Him, being not unusual from any superior; but when they did recognize Him, they would feel it sweetly like Himself."
2. "have ye any meat?—provisions, supplies, meaning fish."
3. "They answered . . . No—This was in His wonted style, making them tell their case, and so the better prepare them for what was coming."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Children - A term of affection and friendship, 1 John 2:18."
2. "Any meat - This word (Greek) means anything eaten with bread. It was used by the Greeks especially to denote fish (Schleusner)."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Children, little children. Used also by John, in address, twice in the First Epistle."
2. "The interrogative mh ti indicates that a negative answer is expected: you have not, I suppose, anything."
3. "Prosfagion is equivalent to ojyarion, what is added to bread at a meal, especially fish."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is hardly possible to imagine that the word ‘children’ is here used because Jesus is addressing Himself as ‘a master to his workmen,’ or because He is speaking with the dignity of a superior. It is a word of tenderness and affection."
2. "There is at least a striking coincidence between the word ('children') here used and that used in Hebrews 2:13 (Isaiah 8:18). He who speaks is engaged in the same occupation, takes the same position, is called to the same work as they."
3. "The question which He asks is important, especially the word which is rendered in the Authorised Version 'meat,' but which we have rendered by 'to eat.' For thus we observe the true point of the question, not, 'Have you caught fish?' but, 'Have you fish to eat?'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Children (Παιδια). Diminutive of παις and used here alone by Jesus in addressing his disciples. It is a colloquial expression like 'my boys.' The aged Apostle John uses it in 1 John 2:13; 1 John 2:18."
2. "Have ye aught to eat? (μη τ προσφαγιον εχετε?)." The negative answer is expected by this polite inquiry as in John 4:29.
3. "The rare and late word προσφαγιον from the root φαγ (εσθιω, to eat) and προς (in addition) was used for a relish with bread and then for fish as here. So in the papyri. Nowhere else in the N.T."

### John Gill:
1. "And still they knew him not, though he used this endearing and familiar appellation..." 
2. "Christ's children, true believers, are sometimes without spiritual food..." 
3. "...but he will not suffer them to starve; for as he has made provisions for them in the ministry of the word and ordinances..."
