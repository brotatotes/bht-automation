## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The οὖν here seems distinctly to allude to the former occasion the similarity of the incident having led the beloved Apostle to scrutinize more closely the person of Him who spoke to them." 
2. "He bound round him his fisher’s coat or shirt, to facilitate his swimming. ἦν γὰρ γυμ ., i.e. as above, he was stripped for his fisher’s work; [some say] without his upper garment."
3. "Some [more probably] take it literally, and understand that he girt round him his ἐπενδύτης as a subligaculum. Theophyl., ἐπενδ . λινοῦν τι ὀθόνιον , ὃν οἱ Φοίνικες κ . οἱ Σύροι ἁλιεῖς περιελίττουσιν ἑαυτοῖς."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "that disciple whom Jesus loved, said, It is the Lord—again having the advantage of his brother in quickness of recognition, to be followed by an alacrity in Peter all his own."
2. "he was naked—his vest only on, worn next to the body."
3. "cast himself into the sea—the shallow part, not more than a hundred yards from the water's edge, not meaning therefore to swim, but to get sooner to Jesus than in the full boat which they could hardly draw to shore."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is the Lord - He was convinced, perhaps, by the apparent miracle, and by looking more attentively on the person of one who had been the means of such unexpected and remarkable success."
2. "His fisher's coat - His upper or outer garment or tunic, in distinction from the inner garment or tunic which was worn next to the skin."
3. "He was naked - He was undressed, with nothing on but the undergarment or tunic. The word does not require us to suppose a greater degree of nakedness than this."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Fisher's coat [επενδυτην]. An upper garment or blouse."
2. "Naked. Not absolutely, but clothed merely in his undergarment or shirt."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is our duty to raise our hearts to God, whenever we succeed in anything beyond our expectation."
2. "That holy recognition of the grace of God...led him [John] also to the knowledge of Christ."
3. "Peter is actuated by a peculiar zeal in comparison to the others."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "That the incident thus related of each of the two apostles is in closest harmony with everything else that we know of them strikes every reader."
2. "He does not call him simply Simon Peter; but, as in chap. John 18:10, he interposes a word between the two names, ‘Simon, therefore, Peter.’"
3. "The girding is probably not to pass unnoticed. It was thus that at John 13:4-5, our Lord prepared Himself for service: His apostle, when preparing for the active service of his Master, must do the same."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is the Lord." John's quick insight appears again.

### John Gill:
1. "John knew that it was the Lord, either by some special revelation, or from the multitude of fishes which were taken, and which showed a divine hand and power to be concerned."
2. "So faithful ministers of the Gospel know when Christ is with them, by his power attending their ministrations to the conversion of souls."
