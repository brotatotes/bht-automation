# John 21:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When they arrived on the land, the disciples witnessed Jesus' extraordinary provision of a meal. The fire of coals, reminiscent of the charcoal fire mentioned in John 18:18, was ready, along with the fish and bread. This whole scene serves as a powerful demonstration of Jesus' divine power and his care for his followers while they are engaged in his work on this earth. Moreover, it foreshadows the ultimate spiritual and everlasting nourishment that awaits believers in the heavenly realm when they have completed their earthly assignments.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Let any child reading the chapter be the judge."
2. "What difficulty is there in such a fire and fish being provided either by the Lord Himself, or by the ministry of angels at His bidding?"
