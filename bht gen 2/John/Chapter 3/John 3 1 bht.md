# John 3:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Nicodemus, a man of note and eminence, belonged to the strictest sect of the Pharisees, known for their dedication to religion and holiness.

This encounter provides an example of Christ's understanding of humanity, as Nicodemus, unlike others, was willing to trust and seek further knowledge. It is a reminder of the depravity of mankind and the importance of entering the school of Christ to progress in heavenly doctrine.
