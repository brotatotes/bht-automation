# John 3:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Nicodemus, a respected and dignified teacher within the Jewish community, is reproached for his lack of understanding regarding the fundamental truths of religion. Despite his esteemed position, his ignorance of these teachings is seen as a significant shortcoming. This highlights the fact that being in a position of authority or having prior knowledge does not guarantee spiritual insight. Instead, true understanding of the teachings of the Scriptures requires humility and a receptive heart. It serves as a reminder that even the most learned individuals can be blinded to the spiritual realities revealed within the Word of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I believe the E. V. is right in rendering ·ΩÅ Œ¥ŒπŒ¥. as a master; the article is inserted as required by œÑŒø·ø¶ before ·º∏œÉœÅŒ±ŒÆŒª, which is expressed as giving a solemnity to ·º∏œÉœÅ. as the people of God."
2. "Nicodemus was manifestly in no supereminent place among the ·ºÑœÅœáŒøŒΩœÑŒµœÇ: see ch. John 7:50-52."
