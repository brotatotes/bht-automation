# John 3:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Nicodemus, as a revered teacher of Israel, should have been aware of the doctrine of regeneration and the importance of spiritual understanding. However, his position of authority and adherence to Pharisaic theology hindered his comprehension of these truths. This lack of spiritual perception was not due to a lack of previous knowledge, but rather a result of his rigid traditionalism. It is crucial for us to recognize that no matter our level of education or title, we must approach the Bible with humility and a willingness to be transformed by the Holy Spirit.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I believe the E. V. is right in rendering ὁ διδ. a master; the article is inserted as required by τοῦ before Ἰσραήλ, which is expressed as giving a solemnity to Ἰσρ. as the people of God."
2. "Nicodemus was manifestly in no supereminent place among the ἄρχοντες: see ch. John 7:50-52."
3. "Still less can I with Bp. Middleton, Gr. Art. pp. 242 3, believe any blame conveyed in the title."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The question clearly implies that the doctrine of regeneration is so far disclosed in the Old Testament that Nicodemus was culpable in being ignorant of it."
2. "Nor is it merely as something that should be experienced under the Gospel that the Old Testament holds it forth—as many distinguished critics allege, denying that there was any such thing as regeneration before Christ."
3. "For our Lord's proposition is universal, that no fallen man is or can be spiritual without a regenerating operation of the Holy Ghost, and the necessity of a spiritual obedience under whatever name, in opposition to mere mechanical services, is proclaimed throughout all the Old Testament."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A man whose business it was to teach the people should be a stranger to so plain and important a doctrine."
2. "Worldly-minded men...seek those offices for the sake of ease or reputation."
3. "No man can understand the Bible fully unless he is a humble Christian."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Art thou a master of Israel [συ ει ο διδασκαλος του ισραηλ]. The su, thou, is emphatic. A master is more correctly rendered by Rev., the teacher. Not ironical, but the article marks Nicodemus' official relation to the people, and gives additional force to the contrast in the following words."
2. "Knowest not [ου γινωσκεις]. See on 2 24. Nicodemus is not reproved for the want of previous knowledge, but for the want of perception or understanding when these truths are expounded to him. Rev., better, understandest not."

### John Calvin:
1. "And certainly such persons will never make any progress, until the wicked confidence, with which they are puffed up, be removed."
2. "He thought, that not to admit a thing to be possible would be considered a proof of gravity and intelligence, because that man is accounted foolishly credulous who assents to what is told him by another, before he has fully inquired into the reason."
3. "For what religion have we, what knowledge of God, what rule of living well, what hope of eternal life, if we do not believe that man is renewed by the Spirit of God?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The question which expressed the bewilderment of Nicodemus is answered by another question."
2. "No word so clearly brings into view the nation of God’s special choice."
3. "Nicodemus is not blamed for any want of previous knowledge of these things, but because he does not perceive the truth of the teaching when presented to him."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The teacher of Israel: The accepted authority in the Israel of God."
2. "His Pharisaic theology had made him almost proof against spiritual apprehension."
3. "It was outside of his groove, his mere traditionalism."

### John Gill:
1. "Upbraiding him with his continued and invincible ignorance, which was aggravated by his dignified character."
2. "He was not a common teacher, not a teacher of babes, nor a teacher in their synagogues, but in their great sanhedrim; that famous and most excellent one, who was talked of all over Jerusalem and Judea, as a surpassing one."
3. "Yet was he ignorant of the first and most important things in religion."
