# John 3:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Nicodemus, the teacher of God's people Israel, should have been aware of the doctrine of regeneration found in the Old Testament. The bewilderment expressed by Nicodemus is answered with a question, highlighting his lack of understanding despite his esteemed position. True comprehension of the Bible requires humility and a heart devoted to God's glory. Those who are worldly-minded often remain strangers to the plain truths of Scripture. Nicodemus is not criticized for his ignorance, but for failing to perceive the truth when presented to him by one whose authority he acknowledged.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I believe the E.V. is right in rendering ·ΩÅ Œ¥ŒπŒ¥. a master; the article is inserted as required by œÑŒø·ø¶ before ·º∏œÉœÅŒ±ŒÆŒª, which is expressed as giving a solemnity to ·º∏œÉœÅ. as the people of God."
2. "Or is it possible that ·ΩÅ Œ¥ŒπŒ¥Œ¨œÉŒ∫Œ±ŒªŒøœÇ may merely be meant as one of Œø·º± Œ¥ŒπŒ¥Œ¨œÉŒ∫Œ±ŒªŒøŒπ?"
3. "I prefer either of these reasons for the presence of the article, to supposing it to have any emphatic meaning."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The question clearly implies that the doctrine of regeneration is so far disclosed in the Old Testament that Nicodemus was culpable in being ignorant of it."
2. "No fallen man is or can be spiritual without a regenerating operation of the Holy Ghost, and the necessity of a spiritual obedience under whatever name, in opposition to mere mechanical services, is proclaimed throughout all the Old Testament."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A child thus may have more real knowledge of the way of salvation than many who are pretended masters and teachers of Israel." 
2. "No man can understand the Bible fully unless he is a humble Christian, and the easiest way to comprehend the truths of religion is to give the heart to God and live to his glory."
3. "When worldly-minded men are placed in offices of religion...it is no wonder that they are strangers to the plain truths of the Bible."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A master is more correctly rendered by Rev., the teacher."
2. "Nicodemus is not reproved for the want of previous knowledge, but for the want of perception or understanding when these truths are expounded to him."
3. "Rev., better, understandest not."

### John Calvin:
1. "Such persons will never make any progress, until the wicked confidence, with which they are puffed up, be removed."
2. "He thought, that not to admit a thing to be possible would be considered a proof of gravity and intelligence, because that man is accounted foolishly credulous who assents to what is told him by another, before he has fully inquired into the reason."
3. "For what religion have we, what knowledge of God, what rule of living well, what hope of eternal life, if we do not believe that man is renewed by the Spirit of God?"


### Philip Schaff:
1. "The question which expressed the bewilderment of Nicodemus is answered by another question. He has assumed the office of teacher, teacher of God‚Äôs people Israel, and yet he does not recognise these truths." 
2. "It is not simply ‚Äòa teacher,‚Äô though it is not very easy to say what the presence of the article denotes. It is possible that Nicodemus occupied a superior position, or was held in especial honour amongst the doctors of the law; or the words may merely imply that he magnified his office and was proud to be teacher of God‚Äôs people." 
3. "Nicodemus is not blamed for any want of previous knowledge of these things, but because he does not perceive the truth of the teaching when presented to him, and presented, moreover, by One whose right to teach with authority he had himself confessed."

### John Gill:
1. "Upbraiding him with his continued and invincible ignorance"
2. "He was not a common teacher not a teacher of babes, nor a teacher in their synagogues, or in their 'Midrashim', or divinity schools, but in their great sanhedrim"
3. "Yet was he ignorant of the first and most important things in religion"
