# John 3:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We confidently affirm what we have experienced and know to be true, for our testimony is not based on speculation or conjecture.

It is essential that our words are received and acknowledged with credibility and trust, recognizing the weight and validity of our witness.

2. "Let every man, therefore, see what the Lord has revealed to him, that no man may go beyond the bounds of his faith; and, lastly, that no man may allow himself to speak anything but what he has heard from the Lord."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus simply claims knowledge of what he has tried to make plain to the famous Rabbi without success."
