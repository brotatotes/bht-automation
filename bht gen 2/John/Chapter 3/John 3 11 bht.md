# John 3:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We speak what we know, for the new birth imparts a new vision and understanding of the Gospel dispensation. Christ, as the representative and head of the class to which I belong, knows and has seen the truth. The unbelief of Nicodemus and others does not hinder the certainty and durability of the doctrine preached, for even though men reject revelation, the truth remains true and constant. Let every man, therefore, receive the witness and testimony of those born of the Spirit, for their words are a powerful reminder of the saving power of the gospel.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Henceforward the discourse is an answer to the unbelief, and in answering that, to the question of Nicodemus: by shewing him the appointed means of this new birth, and of being upheld in the life to which it is the entrance, viz. faith in the Son of God."
2. "Why these plurals? Various interpretations have been given... I had rather take it as a proverbial saying; q. d. ‘I am one of those who,’ &c. Our Lord thereby brings out the unreasonableness of that unbelief which would not receive His witness, but made it an exception to the general proverbial rule."
3. "οὐ λαμβάνετε, addressed still to Nicodemus, and through him to the Jews: not to certain others who were present, as Olsh. supposes."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "We speak that we know, and have seen—that is, by absolute knowledge and immediate vision of God"
2. "The 'we' and 'our' are here used, though Himself only is intended, in emphatic contrast"
3. "referring to the class to which Nicodemus belonged, but from which he was beginning to be separated in spirit."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We do not deliver doctrines which we do not practically understand."
2. "Every successful minister of the gospel thus becomes a witness of the saving power of the gospel."
3. "Men reject revelation though it is attested by the strongest evidence, and though it is constantly producing the most desirable changes in the hearts and lives of men."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The new birth imparts a new vision."
2. "The man who is born of the Spirit hath eternal life."
3. "Jesus meets the 'we know' of Nicodemus, referring to the class to which he belonged, with another 'we know,' referring to another class, of which He was the head and representative."

### John Calvin:
1. "For my own part, I have no doubt that Christ mentions himself in connection with all the prophets of God, and speaks generally in the person of all."
2. "Let every man, therefore, see what the Lord has revealed to him, that no man may go beyond the bounds of his faith."
3. "Though you do not receive my doctrine, it remains nevertheless certain and durable; for the unbelief of men will never prevent God from remaining always true."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The connecting link between John 3:10-11 is reproof. The last verse laid stress on the knowledge which should have prepared the teacher of Israel for the reception of the word of Jesus; in this the emphasis lies on the dignity of the Teacher whose word he had been so slow to receive."
2. "Every one who dwells in the spiritual world of which Jesus has been speaking is a witness to its reality and its wonders. Here then Jesus associates with Himself in this emphatic testimony all who have been born of the Spirit."
3. "The words closely correspond (knowing to speaking; seeing to bearing witness), while there is at the same time an advance in the thought, since bearing witness rises above speaking, and we have seen is more expressive than we know."

### John Gill:
1. "We speak that we do know...the Gospel dispensation, he declared was just at hand."
2. "Christ must needs thoroughly, and certainly know what he spoke."
3. "Testify that we have seen...since 'seeing' and 'knowing' are qualifications in a witness."

### John Wesley:
1. We speak what we know — I and all that believe in me.
