# John 3:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We speak what we know, the truth revealed to us through the Gospel. It is not just I, but all who believe in me, who testify to this knowledge. Our testimony is based on what we have personally seen, the undeniable truth of the Gospel and the transformative power of the new birth. It is a witness that should be received with faith, as it is a testimony backed by evidence and the certainty of Christ's words. Those who reject our witness only compound their own unbelief, disregarding the truth that remains constant and unshakable, regardless of their skepticism.

### Henry Alford:
1. "Faith in the Son of God."
2. "Our Lord thereby brings out the unreasonableness of that unbelief which would not receive His witness."
3. "Not to certain others who were present, as Olsh. supposes."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "We speak that we know, and... have seenâ€”that is, by absolute knowledge and immediate vision of God, which 'the only-begotten Son in the bosom of the Father' claims as exclusively His own."
2. "The 'we' and 'our' are here used, though Himself only is intended, in emphatic contrast, probably, with the opening words of Nicodemus, 'Rabbi, we know.'"
3. "Ye receive not, &c.â€”referring to the class to which Nicodemus belonged, but from which he was beginning to be separated in spirit."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We do not deliver doctrines which we do not practically understand."
2. "Every successful minister of the gospel thus becomes a witness of the saving power of the gospel."
3. "Men reject revelation though it is attested by the strongest evidence, and though it is constantly producing the most desirable changes in the hearts and lives of men."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The new birth imparts a new vision. The man who is born of the Spirit hath eternal life."
2. "The we in this verse includes, with Jesus, all who are truly born anew of the Spirit."
3. "Jesus meets the 'we know' of Nicodemus, referring to the class to which he belonged, with another 'we know', referring to another class, of which He was the head and representative."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ claims it as peculiar to himself and all the servants of God, that they deliver no doctrine but what is certain."
2. "Let every man, therefore, see what the Lord has revealed to him, that no man may go beyond the bounds of his faith."
3. "Though you do not receive my doctrine, it remains nevertheless certain and durable; for the unbelief of men will never prevent God from remaining always true."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The sudden transition to the plural 'we know' is remarkable... Jesus associates with Himself in this emphatic testimony all who have been born of the Spirit."
2. "The two parallel members of this verse bring the truth expressed into bold relief... there is at the same time an advance in the thought, since  bearing witness rises above speaking, and we have seen is more expressive than we know."
3. "Though the reference is to a class (â€˜ye receiveâ€™), yet the words seem to imply that some unbelief still lingered in the heart of Nicodemus himself."

### John Gill:
1. "We speak that we do know...the Gospel dispensation." 
2. "Christ must needs thoroughly, and certainly know what he spoke...and testify that we have seen...."
3. "And ye received not our witness; which was an aggravation of their sin and unbelief."
