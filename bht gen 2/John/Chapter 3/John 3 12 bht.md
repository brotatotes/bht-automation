# John 3:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Earthly things refer to the truths that are visible and practical, like the new birth and the benefits experienced by believers. On the other hand, heavenly things denote the profound and hidden mysteries of God's redemption plan, including the eternal nature of the Son and the divine unity within the Trinity. Jesus admonishes that if Nicodemus and others fail to comprehend these heavenly truths, it is their own responsibility. The earthly truths can be grasped through their visible effects, but the heavenly truths require divine revelation and spiritual understanding.
