# John 3:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus spoke to Nicodemus about both earthly and heavenly matters. The earthly things were visible and believable, such as the operations of the Spirit on earth. However, understanding the heavenly things, which involved the profound mysteries of redemption and the divine will, proved more challenging. Jesus condescended to our ignorance, yet it is wickedness to disregard His words based on His willingness to meet us where we are. He alone came from heaven and can perfectly reveal the heavenly things, for they are the words of God Himself.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Faith is, in the most pregnant sense, 'the receiving of testimony;' because it is the making subjectively real the contents of that testimony."
2. "This faith is neither reasoning nor knowledge, but a reception of divine Truth declared by One who came from God; and so it is far above reasoning and knowledge: œÄŒπœÉœÑŒµœçŒøŒºŒµŒΩ above Œø·º¥Œ¥Œ±ŒºŒµŒΩ."
3. "And the ·ºêœÄŒøœÖœÅŒ¨ŒΩŒπŒ± are the things of which the discourse goes on to treat from this point: viz. the heavenly side of the new birth and salvation of man, in the eternal counsels of God regarding His only-begotten Son."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "earthly things‚Äîsuch as
regeneration, the gate of entrance to the kingdom of God on
earth"
2. "heavenly things‚Äîthe
things of the new and more heavenly evangelical economy"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If I have told you earthly things - Things which occur on earth. Not sensual or worldly things, for Jesus had said nothing of these; but he had told him of operations of the Spirit which had occurred 'on earth,' whose effects were visible, and which 'might' be, therefore, believed. These were the plainest and most obvious of the doctrines of religion."
2. "How shall ye believe - How will you believe. Is there any probability that you will understand them?"
3. "Heavenly things - Things pertaining to the government of God and his doings in the heavens; things which are removed from human view, and which cannot be subjected to human sight; the more profound and inscrutable things pertaining to the redemption of men."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Not things of earthly nature, but things whose proper place is on earth."
2. "Things which are in heaven, mysteries of redemption, having their seat in the divine will, realized in the world through the work and death of Jesus Christ and the faith of mankind."
3. "He had, in particular, heard these words : 'Thou art my well beloved Son; ' He reposed on the Father 's bosom, and He could descend and redescend without ceasing into the depths of the Father 's fathomless love, of which He felt the vivifying power; and when He came, at certain exceptional moments, to speak of that divine relationship, and to give scope to that fullness of life with which it supplied Him, His language took a peculiar, solemn, mystical, one might even say a heavenly tone; for they were heavenly things which He then revealed."

### John Calvin:
1. "He shows that the blame does not lie with him, that all are not properly instructed, since he comes down even to the earth, that he may raise us to heaven."
2. "But it shows an extraordinary degree of wickedness, that we yield less reverence to God speaking to us, because he condescends to our ignorance."
3. "For, though the whole of Christ‚Äôs discourse was heavenly, yet he spoke in a manner so familiar, that the style itself had some appearance of being earthly."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The things that are in heaven can only be made known by Him who has been in heaven; this is suggested by the connection between this verse and the next."
2. "'The heavenly things' are those truths which He who cometh from heaven, and He alone, can reveal, which are the words of God revealing His counsels by the Divine Son now come."
3. "The truth of John 3:5 would seem to be placed by Jesus rather amongst the 'earthly' than amongst the 'heavenly' things."

### John Gill:
1. "Not that the doctrines he delivered were earthly ones...and this doctrine of regeneration was a heavenly doctrine."
2. "either they were the more easy doctrines of the Gospel; or were delivered in a plain and easy style, and illustrated by similes taken from earthly things."
3. "and ye believe not...how shall ye believe...if I tell you of heavenly things?"

### John Wesley:
1. "Earthly things - Things done on earth; such as the new birth, and the present privileges of the children of God."
2. "Heavenly things - Such as the eternity of the Son, and the unity of the Father, Son, and Spirit."
