# John 3:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus conveys both earthly and heavenly things in his teachings. The earthly things he mentions involve visible and tangible concepts such as the new birth and the privileges of God's children. Conversely, the heavenly things pertain to more profound and spiritual truths, like the eternal nature of the Son and the unity within the Godhead. Jesus employs familiar language and illustrations to explain these heavenly truths, making them accessible and understandable to his audience. His intention is to enlighten humanity about both the practical and mysterious aspects of faith, revealing divine truths through his teachings.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Faith is, in the most pregnant sense, ‚Äòthe receiving of testimony;' because it is the making subjectively real the contents of that testimony." 
2. "This faith is neither reasoning, nor knowledge, but a reception of divine Truth declared by One who came from God; and so it is far above reasoning and knowledge."
3. "The ·ºêœÄŒØŒ≥ŒµŒπŒ± are the matters relating to the new birth which have hitherto been spoken of; called so because that side of them has been exhibited which is upon earth, and happens among men."
4. "And the ·ºêœÄŒøœÖœÅŒ¨ŒΩŒπŒ± are the things of which the discourse goes on to treat from this point: viz. the heavenly side of the new birth and salvation of man, in the eternal counsels of God regarding His only-begotten Son."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "earthly things‚Äîsuch as regeneration, the gate of entrance to the kingdom of God on earth"
2. "heavenly things‚Äîthe things of the new and more heavenly evangelical economy, only to be fully understood after the effusion of the Spirit from heaven through the exalted Saviour."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If I have told you earthly things - Things which occur on earth. Not sensual or worldly things, for Jesus had said nothing of these; but he had told him of operations of the Spirit which had occurred 'on earth,' whose effects were visible, and which 'might' be, therefore, believed. These were the plainest and most obvious of the doctrines of religion."
2. "How shall ye believe - How will you believe. Is there any probability that you will understand them?"
3. "Heavenly things - Things pertaining to the government of God and his doings in the heavens; things which are removed from human view, and which cannot be subjected to human sight; the more profound and inscrutable things pertaining to the redemption of men. Hence, learn:"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Those facts and phenomena of the higher life as a class, which have their seat and manifestation on earth; which belong in their realization to our present existence; which are seen in their consequences, like the issues of birth; which are sensible in their effects, like the action of the wind; which are a beginning and a prophecy, and not a fulfillment" (Westcott).
2. "Mysteries of redemption, having their seat in the divine will, realized in the world through the work and death of Jesus Christ and the faith of mankind."
3. "The instructions of the first kind had a more simple, more practical, more varied character. They referred to the different situations of life; it was the exposition of the true moral relations of men to each other, and of men to God."

### John Calvin:
1. "He shows that the blame does not lie with him, that all are not properly instructed, since he comes down even to the earth, that he may raise us to heaven."
2. "It shows an extraordinary degree of wickedness, that we yield less reverence to God speaking to us, because he condescends to our ignorance."
3. "Though the whole of Christ‚Äôs discourse was heavenly, yet he spoke in a manner so familiar, that the style itself had some appearance of being earthly."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The things that are in heaven can only be made known by Him who has been in heaven."
2. "'The heavenly things' are those truths which He who cometh from heaven, and He alone, can reveal, which are the words of God revealing His counsels by the Divine Son now come."
3. "The truth of John 3:5 would seem to be placed by Jesus rather amongst the ‚Äòearthly‚Äô than amongst the ‚Äòheavenly‚Äô things."

### John Gill:
1. "Not that the doctrines he delivered were earthly ones; for he was not of the earth, but from heaven, and above all, and so spake not of the earth, but of heaven."
2. "Either they were the more easy doctrines of the Gospel; or were delivered in a plain and easy style, and illustrated by similes taken from earthly things."
3. "And these delivered in language suitable to them, without figures, or natural similes, which help the understanding, and convey ideas of things more easily to it."

### John Wesley:
1. "Earthly things - Things done on earth; such as the new birth, and the present privileges of the children of God."
2. "Heavenly things - Such as the eternity of the Son, and the unity of the Father, Son, and Spirit."
