# John 3:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
No one except the Son of God, who came down from heaven, can speak of heavenly things or convey the blessing of the new birth. The great facts of redemption have been accomplished, allowing for the announcement and reception of this divine knowledge. Jesus, being both God and man, was able to unite heaven and earth in His person. He knows the heavenly things both before and after taking on human flesh. Jesus is the only qualified teacher of heavenly truths and has made it possible for us to be raised to heaven with Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Son of Man, the Lord Jesus, the Word made Flesh, was in, came down from, heaven, and was in heaven while here, and ascended up into heaven when He left this earth; and by all these proofs, speaking in the prophetic language of accomplished Redemption, does the Lord establish, that He alone can speak of τὰ ἐπουράνια to men, or convey the blessing of the new birth to them."
2. "He regards therefore throughout the passage, the great facts of redemption as accomplished, and makes announcements which could not be literally acted upon till they had been so accomplished."
3. "As uniting in Himself God, whose dwelling is heaven, with man whose dwelling is on earth, He ever was in heaven."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "No one has gone up but He that came down, even He who is at once both up and down."
2. "The perfect knowledge of God is not obtained by any man's going up from earth to heaven to receive it—no man hath so ascended—but He whose proper habitation, in His essential and eternal nature, is heaven, hath, by taking human flesh, descended as the Son of man to disclose the Father."
3. "He knows by immediate gaze alike in the flesh as before He assumed it, being essentially and unchangeably 'in the bosom of the Father'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "No man, therefore, is qualified to speak of heavenly things, John 3:12."
2. "This does not mean that no one had gone to heaven or had been saved, for Enoch and Elijah had been borne there (Genesis 5:24; compare Hebrews 11:5; 2 Kings 2:11); and Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and others were there: but it means that no one had ascended and 'returned,' so as to be qualified to speak of the things there."
3. "Since Jesus was 'in' heaven - as his proper abode was there - he was fitted to speak of heavenly things, and to declare the will of God to man."
