# John 3:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
No one has gone up to heaven and returned to earth except for the Son of God, who came down from heaven. He is both in heaven and on earth, possessing the divine attribute of omnipresence. This demonstrates the mysterious unity of the Divine and human nature in Christ. Through his incarnation, Jesus came to fulfill the will of God, preaching the Gospel, performing miracles, obeying the law, and ultimately sacrificing himself for the sake of humanity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Son of Man, the Lord Jesus, the Word made Flesh, was in, came down from, heaven, and was in heaven while here, and ascended up into heaven when He left this earth; and by all these proofs, speaking in the prophetic language of accomplished Redemption, does the Lord establish, that He alone can speak of τὰ ἐπουράνια to men, or convey the blessing of the new birth to them."
2. "He regards therefore throughout the passage, the great facts of redemption as accomplished, and makes announcements which could not be literally acted upon till they had been so accomplished."
3. "To explain such expressions as ἀναβαίνειν εἰς τ. οὐρ., &c., as mere Hebrew metaphors (Lücke, De Wette, &c.) is no more than saying that Hebrew metaphors were founded on deep insight into divine truth: these words in fact express the truths on which Hebrew metaphors were constructed."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "No one has gone up but He that came down, even He who is at once both up and down." (13.)
2. "The perfect knowledge of God is not obtained by any man's going up from earth to heaven to receive it—no man hath so ascended—but He whose proper habitation, in His essential and eternal nature, is heaven, hath, by taking human flesh, descended as the Son of man to disclose the Father, whom He knows by immediate gaze alike in the flesh as before He assumed it, being essentially and unchangeably 'in the bosom of the Father'." (13.)

### Albert Barnes:
1. "No man hath ascended into heavens...To speak of those things requires intimate acquaintance with them - demands that we have seen them...no one is qualified to speak of them but He who came down from heaven." 
2. "He is represented as coming down, because, being equal with God, he took upon himself our nature...He is represented as 'sent' by the Father...The Son of man...is a favorite title which the Lord Jesus gives to himself."
3. "This can be understood only as referring to the fact that he had two natures...Since Jesus was 'in' heaven...he was fitted to speak of heavenly things, and to declare the will of God to man."

### John Calvin:

2. "For to ascend to heaven means here, 'to have a pure knowledge of the mysteries of God, and the light of spiritual understanding.'"
3. "Christ quickly proposes a remedy, when he adds, that what was denied to all others is granted to the Son of God. And this too is the reason why he calls himself the Son of man, that we may not doubt that we have an entrance into heaven in common with him who clothed himself with our flesh, that he might make us partakers of all blessings."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "No one can tell the heavenly things unless he has been in heaven, and no one has been in heaven and come down to earth save myself."
2. "The special thought is not the having gone up into heaven, but the having been in heaven."
3. "He came down from heaven and became the Son of man to reveal these heavenly truths and to give the heavenly blessings unto man."

3. "He is the one who has come down out of heaven."

### John Gill:

3. "He came from heaven to do the will of God by preaching the Gospel, working miracles, obeying the law, and suffering death in the room of his people."
