# John 3:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As the divine commentary explains, the witness being taken away in an ignominious manner is a clear reference to the sufferings and death of Christ. This event was symbolically portrayed in Numbers 21:8,9, where the copper serpent was lifted up on a pole, effectively giving light to the camp of Israel. Just as the serpent was honored in its exaltation, so was Christ honored in His crucifixion, which would ultimately serve as a powerful testimony and a means of salvation for all who would believe.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The comparison lies between the exalted serpent of brass, and the exalted Son of Man. The brazen serpent sets forth the Redeemer."
2. "The 'serpent' is in Scripture symbolism, the devil... So sin, the poison of the devil, being instilled into our nature, that nature has become a poisoned nature, a flesh of sin."
3. "In it [the brazen serpent], there was no poison; only the likeness of it. Now was not the Lord Jesus made in the likeness of sin? Was not He made 'Sin for us, who knew no sin'?"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Stung by serpents, by a serpent they are healed. By 'fiery serpents' bittenâ€”serpents, probably, with skin spotted fiery red [KURTZ]â€”the instrument of cure is a serpent of brass or copper, having at a distance the same appearance."
2. "In both cases the remedy is conspicuously displayed; in the one case on a pole, in the other on the cross, to 'draw all men unto Him' (John 12:32)."
3. "Both methods are stumbling to human reason. What, to any thinking Israelite, could seem more unlikely than that a deadly poison should be dried up in his body by simply looking on a reptile of brass? Such a stumbling-block to the Jews and to the Greeks foolishness was faith in the crucified Nazarene as a way of deliverance from eternal perdition."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Men are sinners. There is no cure by human means for the maladies of the soul."
2. "As the people who were bitten might look on the image of the serpent and be healed, so may sinners look to the Saviour and be cured of the moral maladies of our nature."
3. "Must - It is proper; necessary; indispensable, if men are saved."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Must signifies the eternal necessity in the divine counsels."
2. "The reference here is to the crucifixion, but beyond that, to the glorification of Christ."
3. "It is characteristic of John to blend the two ideas of Christ's passion and glory."

### John Calvin:
1. "He explains more clearly why he said that it is he alone to whom heaven is opened; namely, that he brings to heaven all who are only willing to follow him as their guide; for he testifies that he will be openly and publicly manifested to all, that he may diffuse his power over men of every class."
2. "The simple meaning of the words therefore is, that, by the preaching of the Gospel, Christ was to be raised on high, like a standard to which the eyes of all would be directed."
3. "Hence it ought to be inferred that Christ is clearly exhibited to us in the Gospel, in order that no man may complain of obscurity; and that this manifestation is common to all, and that faith has its own look, by which it perceives him as present."

### John Gill:
1. "There is, in many things, an agreement between this serpent, and Jesus Christ: as in the matter of it, it was a brazen serpent... this may denote the meanness of Christ in his human nature, in his birth and parentage, and place of education and converse; and especially in his crucifixion and death."
2. "The comparison between the serpent Moses lifted up, and Christ, may be observed in the form of it... so Christ was sent, in the likeness of sinful flesh, and was found in fashion as a man, as a sinful man, but was without sin, and was perfectly holy."
3. "And whereas brass is both a strong and durable metal, it may signify the strength of Christ, who is the mighty God, and mighty to save; and his duration, as a Saviour, being the same today, yesterday, and for ever."

### John Wesley:
1. "And even this single witness will soon be taken from you; yea, and in a most ignominious manner."
2. "Numbers 21:8,9."
