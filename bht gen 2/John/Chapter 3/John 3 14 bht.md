## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The comparison lies between the exalted serpent of brass, and the exalted Son of Man."
2. "The brazen serpent sets forth the Redeemer."
3. "Now was not the Lord Jesus made ·ºêŒΩ ·ΩÅŒºŒøŒπœéŒºŒ±œÑŒπ œÉŒ±œÅŒ∫·Ω∏œÇ ·ºÅŒºŒ±œÅœÑŒØŒ±œÇ, Rom 8:3? Was not He made ‚ÄòSin for us, who knew no sin‚Äô (2Co 5:21)? Did not He, on His Cross, make an open shew of, and triumph over, the Enemy, so that it was as if the Enemy himself had been nailed to that Cross (Col 2:15)?"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In both cases the remedy was divinely provided. In both the way of cure strikingly resembled that of the disease. Stung by serpents, by a serpent they are healed."
2. "But as the uplifted serpent had none of the venom of which the serpent-bitten people were dying, so while the whole human family were perishing of the deadly wound inflicted on it by the old serpent, 'the Second Man,' who arose over humanity with healing in His wings, was without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing."
3. "Both methods are stumbling to human reason. What, to any thinking Israelite, could seem more unlikely than that a deadly poison should be dried up in his body by simply looking on a reptile of brass? Such a stumbling-block to the Jews and to the Greeks foolishness was faith in the crucified Nazarene as a way of deliverance from eternal perdition."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Men are sinners. There is no cure by human means for the maladies of the soul; and as the people who were bitten might look on the image of the serpent and be healed, so may sinners look to the Saviour and be cured of the moral maladies of our nature."
2. "Lifted up - Erected on a pole. Placed on high, So that it might be seen by the people."
3. "Even so - In a similar manner and with a similar design. He here refers, doubtless, to his own death."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Must signifies the eternal necessity in the divine counsels."
2. "The reference here is to the crucifixion, but beyond that, to the glorification of Christ."
3. "It is characteristic of John to blend the two ideas of Christ's passion and glory."

### John Calvin:
1. "He testifies that he will be openly and publicly manifested to all, that he may diffuse his power over men of every class."
2. "As a type of this lifting up, he refers to the brazen serpent, which was erected by Moses, the sight of which was a salutary remedy to those who had been wounded by the deadly bite of serpents."
3. "Christ clothed himself with the form of sinful flesh, which yet was pure and free from all sin, that he might cure in us the deadly wound of sin."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus draws a vivid parallel between the act of Moses and the Cross on which he himself (the Son of man) 'must' be lifted up." 
2. "In John, œÖœàŒøœâ always refers to the Cross." 
3. "Jesus is complimenting the standing and intelligence of Nicodemus as 'the teacher of Israel' by telling him this great truth and fact that lies at the basis of the work of the kingdom of God."

### John Gill:
1. "There is, in many things, an agreement between this serpent, and Jesus Christ: as in the matter of it, it was a brazen serpent; it was made not of gold, nor of silver, but of brass...this may denote the meanness of Christ in his human nature, in his birth and parentage..." (39 words)
2. "The brazen serpent had the form of a serpent, but not the poison and venomous nature of one; so Christ was sent, in the likeness of sinful flesh, and was found in fashion as a man, as a sinful man, but was without sin, and was perfectly holy..." (40 words)
3. "As these bitings were such as Moses could not cure; so the wounds of sin, through the old serpent, are such as cannot be healed by the law..." (28 words)

### John Wesley:

2. "Numbers 21:8,9."
