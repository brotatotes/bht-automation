# John 3:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Whoever believes in him, regardless of their background or sinfulness, will not perish, but have eternal life. This faith in Jesus is a complete surrender and trust in him as the Savior, relying on him for every aspect of life. The purpose of Christ being lifted up on the cross was to purchase salvation for all who believe in him. Just as those who looked at the serpent in the Old Testament were physically healed, so all who look to Jesus by faith can experience spiritual health and salvation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This involves, on the part of the believer, the anguish of the bite of the fiery serpent, and the earnest looking on Him in Whom sin is crucified, with the inner eye of faith."
2. "Just as in the type, God did not remove the fiery serpents, or not all at once, but healing was to be found in the midst of them by looking to the brazen serpent."
3. "So the temptations and conflicts of sin shall not leave the believer, but in the midst of these, with the Eye of Faith fixed on the uplifted Son of Man, he has eternal life; perishes not of the bite, but ζήσεται."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "All may come and be saved."
2. "All who believe on Jesus shall be saved from this condemnation and be raised up to eternal life."

2. "Such a faith, by which a soul sees a glory, fulness, and suitableness in him as a Saviour; goes to him, ventures on him, commits itself to him, lays hold on him, and receives him, leans and relies upon him, and trusts in him, and lives upon him."
3. "Now the end of Christ's crucifixion and death is, that such an one should not perish; though he is in a lost and perishing condition in Adam, and by nature, and sees himself to be so."
