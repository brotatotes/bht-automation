By looking to Jesus and believing in Him, we can find salvation and eternal life.

Even though we may face temptations and conflicts, if we keep our faith in Jesus, we will persevere and have everlasting life. Through Jesus' sacrifice, he has purchased salvation for all believers, and it is by His grace that we are saved.
