# John 3:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Whoever believes in him, whether Jew or Gentile, a greater or a lesser sinner, of any state and condition, age or sex, has the opportunity to have eternal life. Such a faith involves seeing the glory and sufficiency of Jesus as a Savior, going to him, committing oneself to him, and relying upon him. This faith is not based on works, but on the free gift of God. By being lifted up, Jesus purchased salvation for all believers, just as those who looked at the serpent in the wilderness were healed.
