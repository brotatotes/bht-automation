# John 3:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For those who put their faith in him and hold fast to their confidence until the end, they will find everlasting life. God's love extends to all people, even those who reject it, offering them the chance to be saved. Those who question whether they should believe in Christ should understand that if he was given for them, they should indeed believe in him. The giving of God's only Son was a genuine and sincere act of love and sacrifice.
