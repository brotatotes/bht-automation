# John 3:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's love for the world is a reflection of his immense compassion and desire for the happiness of all humanity. It is not a mere approval of their conduct, but a selfless act of benevolence. This love stands in stark contrast to the gods of pagan religions who do not offer assurance of forgiveness and salvation. Through the gift of his Son, God demonstrates his unconditional and unmerited love, going beyond the boundaries of race or religion. This love is offered freely to all who believe, promising them everlasting life and the assurance of grace.

3. "His love for the world, or for all mankind, in giving his Son, was shown by these circumstances: That he gave - It was a free and unmerited gift. Man had no claim...
