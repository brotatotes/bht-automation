In this verse, we witness the remarkable love of God for humanity. God's desire for the happiness and salvation of all sinners is evident. This love surpasses our understanding and is unlike the limited view of gods in paganism. Through Christ, God offered the ultimate sacrifice, His only Son, to save the world from eternal destruction. Through faith in Him, we can obtain everlasting life and be rescued from perdition. This gift demonstrates the immense depth and fervor of God's love for us.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This discourse would be altogether fragmentary, and would have left Nicodemus almost where he was before, had not this most weighty concluding part been also spoken to him. This it is, which expands and explains the assertions of John 3:14-15, and applies them to the present life and conduct of mankind."
2. "The Lord here reveals Love as the one ground of the divine counsel in redemption, salvation of men, as its one purpose with regard to them."
3. "By the repetition of this final clause verbatim from John 3:15, we have the identity of the former clauses established: i.e. the uplifting of the Son of Man like the serpent in the wilderness is the manifestation of the Divine Love in the gift of the Son of God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "What proclamation of the Gospel has been so oft on the lips of missionaries and preachers in every age since it was first uttered?"
2. "What has sent such thrilling sensations through millions of mankind?"
3. "How would Nicodemus' narrow Judaism become invisible in the blaze of this Sun of righteousness seen rising on 'the world' with healing in His wings!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "God hates wickedness, but he still desires the Happiness of those who are sinful. 'He hates the sin, but loves the sinner.'"
2. "A parent may love his child and desire his welfare, and yet be strongly opposed to the conduct of that child."
3. "This is the highest expression of love of which we can conceive. A parent who should give up his only son to die for others who are guilty - if this could or might be done - would show higher love than could be manifested in any other way."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "This attitude of God toward the world is in suggestive contrast with that in which the gods of paganism are represented."
2. "Man has no assurance of forgiveness even when he offers the sacrifices in which the gods especially delight."
3. "Human life is a life without the certainty of grace."

### John Calvin:
1. "For God so loved the world. Christ opens up the first cause, and, as it were, the source of our salvation, and he does so, that no doubt may remain; for our minds cannot find calm repose, until we arrive at the unmerited love of God."
2. "And this is still more clear from what follows; for he adds, that God gave his Son to men, that they may not perish. Hence it follows that, until Christ bestow his aid in rescuing the lost, all are destined to eternal destruction."
3. "The word only-begotten is emphatic, to magnify the fervor of the love of God towards us. For as men are not easily convinced that God loves them, in order to remove all doubt, he has expressly stated that we are so very dear to God that, on our account, he did not even spare his only-begotten Son."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Son of man is the Son of God, the only begotten Son; the one term expresses His fitness for the work, the other points to His dignity and to the greatness of the Fatherâ€™s love."
2. "The universality of the blessing is marked with twofold emphasis; designed, not for Israel only, but for the whole world, it is the actual possession of every believer."
3. "The Divine purpose is presented under two aspects, not one only; it is that the believer may be saved from perdition, and may now possess eternal life."

### John Gill:
1. "God has so loved the Gentiles, as well as the Jews, that he gave his only begotten Son; to, and for them, as well as for the Jews; to be a covenant of the people, the Gentiles, the Saviour of them, and a sacrifice for them; a gift which is a sufficient evidence of his love to them."
2. "Whosoever believeth in him, whether Jew or Gentile, should not perish, but have everlasting life."
3. "The gift of his Son: nor is Christ God's gift to every one; for to whomsoever he gives his Son, he gives all things freely with him; which is not the case of every man."

### John Wesley:
1. "Whosoever believeth on him â€” With that faith which worketh by love, and hold fast the beginning of his confidence steadfast to the end."
2. "God so loved the world â€” That is, all men under heaven; even those that despise his love, and will for that cause finally perish."
3. "He gave his only Son â€” Truly and seriously. And the Son of God gave himself, Galatians 4:4, truly and seriously."
