# John 3:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God did not send His Son into the world with the purpose of condemning it. Contrary to what some may accuse Him of, Jesus came into the world to fulfill a mission of love and salvation. His purpose was to offer pardon and salvation, not to bring condemnation upon the world.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The κόσμος, the Gentile world, was according to Jewish ideas to be judged and condemned by the Messiah. This error our Lord here removes."
2. "The κρῖμα there, as here, results from the separation of mankind into two classes, those who will and those who will not come to the light; and that result itself is not the purpose why the Son of God came into the world, but is evolved in the accomplishment of the higher purpose, viz. Love, and the salvation of men."
3. "Not that the Lord is not the σωτὴρ τοῦ κόσμου (ch. Joh 4:42), but that the peculiar cast of this passage required the other side of the truth to be brought out."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Though 'condemnation' is to many the issue of Christ's mission, it is not the object of His mission, which is purely a saving one."
2. "A statement of vast importance."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "God was willing that there should be an offer of pardon, and the sentence of condemnation was delayed."
2. "Jesus did not come then to condemn mankind, yet the time is coming when he will return to judge the living and the dead."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "The verb krinw means, originally, to separate. So Homer, of Ceres separating the grain from the chaff."
3. "The threefold repetition of the word has a certain solemnity."

### John Calvin:
1. "For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world... it is the peculiar office of the Son of God, that all who believe may obtain salvation by him."
2. "We ought not, therefore, to look at anything else in Christ, than that God, out of His boundless goodness, chose to extend His aid for saving us who were lost."

2. "This alone is sufficient to show that the word 'judge,' though not in itself equivalent to 'condemn,' has reference to a judgment which tends to condemnation."

### John Gill:
1. "God did send his Son into the world in the likeness of sinful flesh, being made of a woman, and made under the law; and which is an instance of his great love, and not of any disrespect to his Son, or of any inequality between them."
2. "nor judge and condemn them; he was to come again in power and great glory, when he would take vengeance on them, and cause wrath to come upon them to the uttermost, for their disbelief and rejection of him; but this was not his business now."
