# John 3:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God did not send his Son into the world to condemn it, despite the accusations against him. The purpose of his coming was not to judge or condemn the world, but rather to bring salvation and demonstrate God's great love. Through his incarnation and fulfillment of the law, Jesus was sent as a Savior, not a condemner, to rescue humanity from sin and offer the opportunity for eternal life. The intention was always for the world to be saved through him, not condemned.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The κόσμος, the Gentile world, was according to Jewish ideas to be judged and condemned by the Messiah."
2. "The κρῖμα there, as here, results from the separation of mankind into two classes, those who will and those who will not come to the light; and that result itself is not the purpose why the Son of God came into the world, but is evolved in the accomplishment of the higher purpose, viz. Love, and the salvation of men."
3. "Not that the Lord is not the σωτὴρ τοῦ κόσμου, but that the peculiar cast of this passage required the other side of the truth to be brought out."

3. "His mission...is purely a saving one."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Sent rather than gave... because the idea of sacrifice is here merged in that of authoritative commission."

2. "The thought of the last verse is expanded. There it was the gift of God’s love that was brought before us; now it is the mission of the Son."
3. "He came to save, not to judge the world. He came to judge the world in so far as it will not allow itself to be saved; and this judgment is one that takes place even now (because even now there is wilful unbelief), though it will only be consummated hereafter."
