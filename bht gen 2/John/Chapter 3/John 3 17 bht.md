# John 3:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In sending His Son into the world, God's intention was not to condemn the world, but rather to provide salvation for it. This act of sending His Son demonstrates God's great love and should not be seen as an act of disrespect or inequality. It is important to recognize that while Jesus will judge and condemn the wicked when He comes again, His primary mission during His first coming was for the salvation of the world. Sadly, there are many who falsely accuse Him of condemnation, failing to understand His true purpose of saving mankind.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The assertion ch. John 9:39, Œµ·º∞œÇ Œ∫œÅ·øñŒºŒ± ·ºêŒ≥·Ωº Œµ·º∞œÇ œÑ. Œ∫œåœÉ. œÑŒø·ø¶œÑ. ·º¶ŒªŒ∏ŒøŒΩ, is no contradiction to this."
2. "The Œ∫œÅ·øñŒºŒ± there, as here, results from the separation of mankind into two classes, those who will and those who will not come to the light; and that result itself is not the purpose why the Son of God came into the world, but is evolved in the accomplishment of the higher purpose, viz. Love, and the salvation of men."
3. "Not that the Lord is not the œÉœâœÑ·Ω¥œÅ œÑŒø·ø¶ Œ∫œåœÉŒºŒøœÖ (ch. Joh 4:42), but that the peculiar cast of this passage required the other side of the truth to be brought out."
