# John 3:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who trust in Him are no longer under the guilty verdict of sin; they are acquitted and justified before God. The significance of the name of the only-begotten Son of God implies the greatness and magnificence of the person spoken of. On the other hand, those who do not believe in Him are already in a state of condemnation because they have not placed their faith in the name of the Son of God.
