# John 3:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When we put our trust in Jesus as our Savior, we are acquitted and justified before God, for there is no condemnation for those who are in Him. The name of the only-begotten Son of God represents the person Himself, signifying the greatness and magnificence of Jesus. On the contrary, the one who does not believe is already condemned, referring to someone who persists in impenitence and unbelief.
