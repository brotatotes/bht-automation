# John 3:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
That light is come into the world, but men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. This passage reveals the condemnation that already exists in the world. The arrival of the light, representing divine revelation in the form of the law and the Gospel, is a great favor to humanity. However, many choose to reject this light and instead cling to darkness, which symbolizes ignorance, iniquity, and error. The deliberate rejection of Christ reveals a love for darkness, which is ultimately a result of evil deeds.
