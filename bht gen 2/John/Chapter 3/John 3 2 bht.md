# John 3:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Nicodemus, a ruler and Pharisee, came to Jesus at night out of both desire and shame. He acknowledged Jesus as a teacher from God, acknowledging the signs he performed as proof of his mission. Others among the Pharisees had reached a similar conviction, understanding the necessity of signs and miracles from the Messiah.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is harsh, in this private conversation, to take the plural as merely of singular import, as Lightfoot seems to do."
2. "I would rather take it to express the true conviction respecting Jesus, of that class to which Nicodemus belonged the ἄρχοντες."
3. "ἐλήλυθας: Stier thinks that there is involved in this word a recognition by Nicodemus of the Messianic mission of Jesus."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "came to Jesus by night—One of those superficial 'believers' mentioned in John 2:23; John 2:24, yet inwardly craving further satisfaction"
2. "Nicodemus comes to Jesus in quest of it, but comes 'by night' (see John 19:38; John 19:39; John 12:42); he avows his conviction that He was come from God—an expression never applied to a merely human messenger, and probably meaning more here—but only as 'a teacher'"
3. "in His miracles he sees a proof merely that 'God is with Him'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Scarcely any man, of any rank, will refuse to converse on this subject when addressed respectfully and tenderly in private."
2. "We should not be disposed to blame men where Jesus did not, and we should desire to find goodness in every man rather than be ever on the search for evil motives."
3. "When we read the words of Jesus in the Bible, it should be with a belief that he came from God, and was therefore qualified and authorized to teach us the way of life."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "By night, 'when Jewish superstition would keep men at home.'"
2. "He could reach Jesus' apartment without being observed by the other inmates of the house, for an outside stair led to the upper room."
3. "We may be sure that a member of the sect that carefully scrutinized the Baptist's credentials would not lightly address Jesus by this title of honor or acknowledge Him as teacher."

### John Calvin:
1. "From the circumstance of his coming by night we infer that his timidity was excessive; for his eyes were dazzled, as it were, by the splendor of his own greatness and reputation."
2. "And it ought to be observed, that though religion was greatly corrupted and almost destroyed among the Jews, still they always held this principle, that no man was a lawful teacher, unless he had been sent by God."
3. "Nicodemus had profited aright in the former part, because by miracles he recognizes Christ as a true prophet of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Chap. John 19:38-39, seems clearly to show that the motive of Nicodemus in thus coming by night was the same as the cause of Joseph’s secret discipleship, the ‘fear of the Jews.’"
2. "The confession of Nicodemus was made in the name of others besides himself. ‘We know;’ others amongst the Pharisees, perhaps already others amongst the rulers, had reached the same point."
3. "Nicodemus acknowledges the works to be ‘signs’ and he shows that in him the signs had precisely answered the designed end. The faith indeed which rested on these alone was imperfect, but it was faith; more could be gained; the faith could be educated, raised higher, and made more complete."

### John Gill:
1. "Through fear of the Jews, of being reproached or turned out of his place by them; or through shame, that such a doctor as he was, should be known to go to Jesus of Nazareth, to be instructed by him."
2. "Salutations among the Jews, were forbidden in the night;" "but here was no such danger; nor was this salutation made in the street, and in the dark, which the canon seems to respect."
3. "Miracles were expected by the Jews, to be wrought by the Messiah, and many believed in Jesus on this account; though the modern Jews deny it to be necessary, that miracles should be done by the Messiah."

### John Wesley:
1. "The same came — Through desire; but by night - Through shame." 
2. "We know - Even we rulers and Pharisees."
