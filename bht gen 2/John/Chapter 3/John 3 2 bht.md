# John 3:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Nicodemus, a member of the ruling class, approached Jesus at night out of excessive timidity and fear of the Jews. He acknowledged Jesus as the one who had come from God, recognizing the Messianic mission and the signs and wonders performed by Him. Though his faith was initially based on miracles, Nicodemus showed a willingness to deepen and strengthen it. This dialogue highlights the importance of approaching Christ respectfully and tenderly, as even those in positions of power and influence may have sincere spiritual seeking.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "the true conviction respecting Jesus, of that class to which Nicodemus belonged the ·ºÑœÅœáŒøŒΩœÑŒµœÇ: and see in it an important fact, that their persecutions and murder of the Prince of Life hence found their greatest aggravation, that they were carried on against the conclusions of their own minds, out of bitter malice, and worldly disappointment at His humble and unobtrusive character, and the spiritual purity and self-sacrifice which He inculcated."
2. "Stier thinks that there is involved in this word a recognition by Nicodemus of the Messianic mission of Jesus: that it expresses His being ·ΩÅ ·ºêœÅœáœåŒºŒµŒΩŒøœÇ."
3. "No one can do, etc. unless we expect some strong expression of the truth, but the sentence drops to merely 'God be with him,' which is a very poor and insufficient exponent of ·ºÄœÄ·Ω∏ Œ∏. ·ºêŒªŒÆŒªœÖŒ∏Œ±œÇ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Nicodemus comes to Jesus in quest of further satisfaction, but comes 'by night'." 
2. "He avows his conviction that He was come from God ‚Äì an expression never applied to a merely human messenger." 
3. "In His miracles, he sees a proof merely that 'God is with Him'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Scarcely any man, of any rank, will refuse to converse on this subject when addressed respectfully and tenderly in private."
2. "Since no bad motive is imputed to him, it is most in accordance with Christian charity to suppose that his motives were such as God would approve."
3. "Miracles show that a prophet or religious teacher comes from God, because God would nor work a miracle in attestation of a falsehood or to give countenance to a false teacher."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "We may be sure that a member of the sect that carefully scrutinized the Baptist's credentials (i. 19 - 24) would not lightly address Jesus by this title of honor, or acknowledge Him as teacher" (Milligan and Moulton).
2. "Assured conviction based on Jesus' miracles."
3. "It is from God that thou hast come."

### John Calvin:
1. "From the circumstance of his coming by night we infer that his timidity was excessive; for his eyes were dazzled, as it were, by the splendor of his own greatness and reputation."
2. "It ought to be observed, that though religion was greatly corrupted and almost destroyed among the Jews, still they always held this principle, that no man was a lawful teacher, unless he had been sent by God."
3. "Miracles are not performed by the arm of man, but that the power of God reigns, and is illustriously displayed in them. In a word, as miracles have a twofold advantage, to prepare the mind for faith, and, when it has been formed by the word, to confirm it still more."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Chap. John 19:38-39, seems clearly to show that the motive of Nicodemus in thus coming by night was the same as the cause of Joseph‚Äôs secret discipleship the ‚Äòfear of the Jews.‚Äô That he himself was one of ‚Äòthe Jews‚Äô only makes this explanation more probable."
2. "But the words ‚ÄòThou art come from God‚Äô will appear even more significant, if we keep in mind that the most familiar designation of the Messiah was ‚Äòthe coming One,‚Äô He that should come."
3. "Nicodemus acknowledges the works to be ‚Äòsigns‚Äô(not so the Jews, chap. John 2:18), and he shows that in him the signs had precisely answered the designed end. The faith indeed which rested on these alone was imperfect, but it was faith; more could be gained; the faith could be educated, raised higher, and made more complete."

### John Gill:
1. "Though some things may be said in favour of this conduct of Nicodemus; for since Christ would not trust himself with those that believed in him upon seeing his miracles...it was necessary, that if he would have any discourse with him, that he should take this method..." 
2. "Salutations among the Jews, were forbidden in the night...but here was no such danger; nor was this salutation made in the street, and in the dark, which the canon seems to respect."
3. "Miracles were expected by the Jews, to be wrought by the Messiah, and many believed in Jesus on this account...considered the miracles of Christ as such, as could never be done by man, nor without the presence and power of God; and concluded that he was with God, and God with him, and was the true Immanuel, who is God with us."

### John Wesley:
1. "Through desire; but by night - Through shame."
