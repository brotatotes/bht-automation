# John 3:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Every person who lives a life characterized by evil hates Christ and his Gospel because they expose and convict him of his wicked actions, rebuking him for them. Such individuals avoid coming into the light, refusing to hear Christ preach, attend church, or engage with the means of grace offered through the Gospel. Their avoidance stems from a fear that their evil deeds will be discovered, revealed, and they will be exposed to shame and blame, yet they are unwilling to let go of their sinful ways.

2. "There is here a difference between φαῦλα πράσσειν, and ποιεῖν τὴν ἀλήθειαν, which is too remarkable to be passed over."
3. "He who πράσσει, has nothing but his πρᾶγμα, which is an event, a thing of the past, a source to him only of condemnation, for he has nothing to show for it, for it is also φαῦλον, worthless; whereas he that ποιεῖ, has his ποίημα, he has abiding fruit; his works do follow him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
