# John 3:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Every person who lives a life filled with evil hates the light of Christ and His Gospel because they expose and convict them of their wicked deeds. They refuse to come to the light, to hear Christ's preaching and attend to the Gospel, in fear that their evil deeds will be brought into the open and they will be reproved and advised to change.

2. "There is here a difference between φαῦλα πράσσειν, and ποιεῖν τὴν ἀλήθειαν, which is too remarkable to be passed over."
3. "He who πράσσει, has nothing but his πρᾶγμα, which is an event, a thing of the past, a source to him only of condemnation, for he has nothing to show for it, for it is also φαῦλον, worthless; whereas he that ποιεῖ, has his ποίημα, he has abiding fruit; his works do follow him."
