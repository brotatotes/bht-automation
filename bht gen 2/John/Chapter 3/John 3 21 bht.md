# John 3:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The good man seeks the light, not for the sake of praise, but for communion with God. He desires to place his works in the light, where they can be tested and proven to be of God. In doing so, he acknowledges his own imperfections and the need for divine assistance. The sincerity of his actions is demonstrated by his love for the truth and his willingness to seek it. Such a person is free from hypocrisy and willingly presents themselves before God as the ultimate judge of their works.
