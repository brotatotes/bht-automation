# John 3:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The one who lives out the truth comes to the light of Christ and His Word, seeking to have their actions tested and proven to be genuinely righteous. Their desire is not for recognition or praise, but for the assurance that their works are born out of the life-transforming power and love of God. May we also seek to walk in the truth, fully surrendered to the light of Christ, so that our deeds may bear witness to the divine work being accomplished within us.
