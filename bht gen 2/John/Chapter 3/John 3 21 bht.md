# John 3:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who live according to the truth are drawn to the light. They seek communion with God and desire their works to be tested and proven in the presence of God. This genuine pursuit of truth and the willingness to be examined by God distinguishes them from those who act in error and falsehood. The actions of those who love the truth are performed with the aid of God, and they long for their deeds to be shown as works done in the light and power of God.
