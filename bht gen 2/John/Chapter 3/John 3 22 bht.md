# John 3:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus ventured into the rural parts of Judea, distancing himself from the bustling city of Jerusalem. It is worth noting that the baptism mentioned here was not performed personally by Jesus, but rather by his disciples under his guidance and authority. According to another reference in the Gospel of John, Jesus started publicly practicing this baptismal ministry at the beginning of his mission.
