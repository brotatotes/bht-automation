# John 3:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus went into the land of Judea, specifically the rural areas surrounding Jerusalem. It is worth noting that the term baptized does not necessarily mean that Jesus himself performed the baptisms, but rather that his disciples carried out this practice under his instruction and authority. This suggests that Jesus made a deliberate decision to spend a significant period of time in the countryside, engaging with the local population and spreading his message through the act of baptism.
