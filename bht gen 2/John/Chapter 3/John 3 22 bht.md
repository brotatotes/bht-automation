# John 3:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, after his encounter with Nicodemus, ventured into the land of Judea, specifically the countryside surrounding Jerusalem. This distinction highlights the influence of the capital city compared to the surrounding rural areas. During his time there, Jesus engaged in the practice of baptism, where his disciples baptized individuals on his behalf, following his instructions. This act further solidified the significance and authority of water baptism as a sacred ordinance.
