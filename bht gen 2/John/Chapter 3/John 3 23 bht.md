# John 3:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
John was baptizing in Aenon, a place known for its abundance of water, where he continued to baptize while Jesus was teaching and baptizing in the same area. John's choice of location was deliberate, as there were many waters present, making it suitable for immersing the whole body. Despite the growing popularity of Jesus, John did not discourage or reject those who approached him for baptism but instead directed them to Jesus, showing his humility and recognition of Jesus' superiority.
