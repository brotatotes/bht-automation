## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "If Scythopolis was the ancient Bethshan, both places were in Samaria: and to this agree Epiphanius and the Samaritan chronicle called Abul Phatach."
2. "Both places were West of the Jordan: see John 3:26, and compare ch. John 1:28."
3. "œÄŒ±œÅŒµŒ≥...Œ∫...·ºêŒ≤., i.e. the multitudes."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 23. √Ünon . . . Salim‚Äîon the
	west of Jordan. (Compare John 3:26;
	John 1:28).

### Albert Barnes:
1. "John‚Äôs preaching attracted great multitudes... He selected a spot that was well watered, probably, with springs and rivulets."
2. "The mention of the fact that there was much water there, and that John selected that as a convenient place to perform his office as a baptizer, proves nothing in regard to the mode in which the ordinance was administered."
3. "As all the facts in the case are fully met by the supposition that John might have baptized in some other way besides immersion, and as it is easy to conceive another reason that is sufficient to account for the fact that such a place was selected, this passage certainly should not be adduced to prove that he performed baptism only in that manner."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The substantive verb with the participle also indicating continuous or habitual action; was engaged in baptizing."
2. "Aenon is probably akin to the Hebrew ayin, an eye, a spring."
3. "Probably referring to a number of pools or springs."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Where √Ünon and Salim were situated it is not easy to determine."
2. "The objection to this identification is that, as John was clearly in the neighbourhood of Jesus, it takes the latter from the route leading to Samaria and Galilee."
3. "John no doubt alludes to the meaning of AEnon when he adds that there were ‚Äòmany waters‚Äô there."

### John Gill:
1. "He chose this place, because there was much water there; or 'many waters'; not little purling streams, and rivulets; but, as Nonnus renders it, abundance of water; or a multitude of it."
2. "This was the work he was sent to do, and which he continued in as long as he had his liberty."
3. "And they came, and were baptized."

### John Wesley:
1. "He did not repel them that offered."
2. "He more willingly referred them to Jesus."
