# John 3:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage reveals an important detail: John had not yet been thrown into prison. This is significant because it corrects a misconception that our Lord's public ministry began with John's imprisonment. It is clear that John's role at this time was to call people to repentance and prepare them for the Messiah, an important task that continued even after Jesus began His work. We see the accuracy of the Evangelist's narrative in correcting this common misunderstanding, ensuring that the true sequence of events is rightly understood.
