# John 3:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When some people approached John the Baptist and mentioned how everyone was now going to Jesus, it revealed their misguided priorities. Their words suggested that they saw it as a betrayal by Jesus, as if John should have taken credit for the fame that Jesus had gained. Yet, in reality, John's role was to announce the arrival of the Son of God, and he faithfully fulfilled that mission. The comments made by these individuals were fueled by envy and sinful ambition. Nevertheless, John's response, full of nobility, showed his unwavering commitment to his purpose.
