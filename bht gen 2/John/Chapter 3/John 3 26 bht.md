# John 3:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These disciples of John were clearly jealous of Jesus as a rival of John, blaming John for endorsing someone who was already becoming more popular. Their jealousy was stirred by the sight of the growing crowds with Jesus and the dwindling crowds with John. They took offense at Jesus baptizing, believing that it was the proper and unique duty of their master. The title of Rabbi reflects the respect and reverence given to Jesus. It is a life-like picture of ministerial jealousy in all ages.
