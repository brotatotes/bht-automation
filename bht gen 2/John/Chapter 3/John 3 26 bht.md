# John 3:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples of John were concerned that Jesus was baptizing and drawing people to Himself, fearing that John's influence and disciples would wane. They believed that John's role was to administer baptism, but Jesus seemed to take on that responsibility. This caused them to view Jesus as an intruder and as assuming a role that only belonged to John. However, many people were coming to Jesus, perhaps even more than came to John. This threatened the disciples of John, as they were envious of Jesus and concerned about their own status.
