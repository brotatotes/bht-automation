# John 3:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The honor and authority that Jesus has received were given to him by God, therefore there is no reason for dissatisfaction or envy towards him. In fact, John himself recognizes that he can only receive what has been given to him from heaven. The disciples' jealous and resentful words are met with the calm and composed response of John, who does not let their negativity affect him. This demonstrates the humble and selfless nature of John, who is content with the role assigned to him by God.
