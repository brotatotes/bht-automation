# John 3:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
John's words in this verse are a response to his disciples who doubted his testimony about Jesus. He reminds them that they themselves can attest to what he said before - that he is not the Christ, but the one sent before Him. By emphasizing his role as the forerunner, John suggests the superiority of Jesus in office, honor, and usefulness. John's purpose was not to exalt himself but to prepare the way for Jesus' coming and ensure that people would be ready to receive Him.
