# John 3:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The bride belongs to her husband, and in this case, it is the church that belongs to Christ, the bridegroom. The role of the friend of the bridegroom is to accompany and support the bridegroom during the marriage celebration. Just as the friend of the bridegroom rejoices greatly by hearing the joyful voice of the bridegroom, we too can rejoice in the assurance of a happy completion of Christ's mission and the sweet and saving voice of the Bridegroom.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The friend rejoices at hearing the φωνὴ τοῦ νυμφίου, in his triumph and joy, at the marriage."
2. "He χαρᾷ χαίρει because he hears in the voice of the Bridegroom an assurance of the happy completion of his mission, and on account of the voice itself, τὴν οὕτω γλυκεῖαν, τὴν οὕτως ἐπέραστον, τὴν οὕτω σωτήριον."
3. "ἑστηκὼς καί belongs merely to the graphic setting forth of the similitude."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He that hath the bride ... - This is an illustration drawn from marriage. The bride belongs to her husband. So the church, the bride of the Messiah, belongs to him."
2. "The friend of the bridegroom - He whose office it is to attend him on the marriage occasion. This was commonly the nearest friend, and was a high honor. Rejoiceth greatly - Esteems himself highly honored by the proof of friendship."
3. "The relation of Christ to the church is often compared with the marriage relation, denoting the tenderness of the union, and his great love for his people."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The bride. A common figure in the Old testament prophecies, of the relation between Jehovah and His people"
2. "Friend of the bridegroom. Or groomsman. The term is appropriate to Judaea, the groomsmen not being customary in Galilee"
3. "In Judaea there were two groomsmen, one for the bridegroom, the other for his bride"

### John Calvin:
1. "It is a great and lofty distinction, that men are appointed over the Church, to represent the person of the Son of God. They are, therefore, like the friends whom the bridegroom brings with him, that they may accompany him in celebrating the marriage."
2. "The whole amounts to this, that all the eminence which teachers may possess among themselves ought not to hinder Christ from ruling alone in his Church, or from governing it alone by his word."
3. "Whoever shall have such affections that, laying aside all regard to himself, he shall extol Christ and be satisfied with seeing Christ honored, will be faithful and successful in ruling the Church; but, whoever shall swerve from that end in the slightest degree will be a base adulterer, and will do nothing else than corrupt the spouse of Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He that hath the bride is the bridegroom. The Lord is taking home His bride-His people. To the name of bridegroom I have no claim, nor can I have the bridegroom’s joy." 
2. "The friend of the bridegroom that standeth and heareth his voice, catching the first sound as he draws near, listening to the words and tones in which his joy breaks forth throughout the marriage feast, he too has his joy, a reflection of the rejoicing of the bridegroom."
3. "By the ‘friend’ John does not mean the particular friend who presided over the marriage ceremonies, for the words ‘standeth and heareth’ are unsuitable to a functionary whose duties were those of action. But these words exactly correspond to the position of the Baptist as one who stood apart and listened."

### John Gill:
1. "He that hath the bride...all the elect of God, whether among Jews or Gentiles."
2. "And this being the case, John suggests, that by these persons following Christ, and giving up themselves to him, it appeared that he was the bridegroom."
3. "The friend of the bridegroom; meaning himself...such an one is called by the Rabbins, 'a lover', or 'friend'."

2. "But all men now come to Jesus. Hence it is plain he is the bridegroom."
3. "The friend who heareth him — Talk with the bride; rejoiceth greatly - So far from envying or resenting it."
