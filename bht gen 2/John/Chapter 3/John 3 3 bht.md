# John 3:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To enter the kingdom of God, one must be born again. This new birth is not a physical one, but a spiritual transformation. It is a complete change of heart and life that only the power of God can bring about. Every person, regardless of their background, needs this regeneration to understand and experience the kingdom. Through the mercy of God, who gave His Son to save us, we can be transformed and become new creatures in Him. This new birth is essential for us to escape our state of sin and enter into eternal life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

3. "The true meaning is to be found by taking into account the answer of Nicodemus, who obviously understood it of a new birth in mature life."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

1. "Except a man - This is a universal form of expression designed to include all mankind. Of 'each and every man' it is certain that unless he is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God."
2. "Our natural birth introduces us to light, is the commencement of life, throws us amid the works of God, and is the beginning of our existence; but it also introduces us to a world of sin. We early go astray. All men transgress."
3. "To escape from sin, to be happy in the world to come, it is necessary that man should be changed in his principles, his feelings, and his manner of life. This change, or the beginning of this new life, is called the 'new birth,' or 'regeneration.' It is so called because in many respects it has a striking analogy to the natural birth."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word is used in the following senses in the New Testament, where it occurs thirteen times : 1. From the top : Matthew 27:51; Mark 14:38; John 19:23. 2. From above : John 3:31; John 19:11; James 1:17; James 3:15, James 3:17. 3. From the beginning : Luke 1:3; Acts 26:5. 4. Again : Galatians 4:9, but accompanied by palin, again."
2. "In favor of the rendering from above, it is urged that it corresponds to John's habitual method of describing the work of spiritual regeneration as a birth from God (i. 13; 1 John 3:9; 1 John 4:7; 1 John 5:1, 1 John 5:4, 1 John 5:8); and further, that it is Paul, and not John, who describes it as a new birth."
3. "Again, however, does not give the exact force of the word, which is rather as Rev., anew, or afresh. Render, therefore, as Rev., except a man be born anew."

### John Calvin:
1. "For as it is useless to sow seed in a field which has not been prepared by the labors of the husbandman, so it is to no purpose to scatter the doctrine of the Gospel, if the mind has not been previously subdued and duly prepared for docility and obedience."
2. "So long as thou art destitute of that which is of the highest importance in the kingdom of God, I care little about your calling me Master; for the first entrance into the kingdom of God is, to become a new man."
3.

### John Wesley:
