# John 3:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus's response to Nicodemus emphasizes the need for a profound change within a person. Instead of focusing on external actions, Jesus speaks of a new birth, a transformation of the inner self. This new birth is not a mere reformation of life but a radical shift that can only be brought about by the power of God. It is a spiritual rebirth that allows us to truly understand and experience the kingdom of God. Jesus's words challenge us to examine our hearts and seek a genuine transformation that goes beyond superficial changes.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "My teaching is not of doing and leaving undone, but of a change in the man...so that it is, not new works done, but a new man to do them; not another life only, but another birth."
2. "The true meaning is to be found by taking into account the answer of Nicodemus, who obviously understood it of a new birth in mature life. Born afresh would be a better rendering than 'born again,' being closer to the meaning of á¼„Î½Ï‰Î¸ÎµÎ½, 'from the very beginning;'" 
3. "That John never uses the word elsewhere in this sense...is here of little weight, for he uses it only three times more, and never with a verb cognate to Î³ÎµÎ½Î½Î¬Î¿Î¼Î±Î¹."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This blunt and curt reply was plainly meant to shake the whole edifice of the man's religion, in order to lay a deeper and more enduring foundation."
2. "Nicodemus probably thought he had gone a long way, and expected, perhaps, to be complimented on his candor. Instead of this, he is virtually told that he has raised a question which he is not in a capacity to solve, and that before approaching it, his spiritual vision required to be rectified by an entire revolution on his inner man."
3. "Had the man been less sincere, this would certainly have repelled him but with persons in his mixed state of mindâ€”to which Jesus was no stranger (John 2:25)â€”such methods speed better than more honeyed words and gradual approaches."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jesus declared to every man, high or low, rich or poor, the most humbling truths of the gospel."
2. "It was necessary, in addition to [acknowledging Jesus as the Messiah], to experience in his own soul that great change called the 'new birth' or regeneration."
3. "This change, or the beginning of this new life, is called the 'new birth,' or 'regeneration.' It is so called because in many respects it has a striking analogy to the natural birth."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Expositors are divided on the rendering of anwqen, some translating, from above, and others, again or anew."
2. "In favor of the rendering from above, it is urged that it corresponds to John's habitual method of describing the work of spiritual regeneration as a birth from God."
3. "The phrase occurs only in John's Gospel."

### John Calvin:
1. "Such, then, is the design of the double affirmation. Though this discourse appears to be far-fetched and almost inappropriate, yet it was with the utmost propriety that Christ opened his discourse in this manner."
2. "For as it is useless to sow seed in a field which has not been prepared by the labors of the husbandman, so it is to no purpose to scatter the doctrine of the Gospel if the mind has not been previously subdued and duly prepared for docility and obedience."
3. "This exhortation, therefore, resembled ploughing to purify him, that nothing might prevent him from profiting by the doctrine."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Nicodemus brings in the word 'man,' to give more expressiveness to his reply."
2. "Our Lordâ€™s words, then, teach the fundamental truth, that not natural birth, descent from the stock of Israel, but a second birth, the being begotten anew, a complete spiritual change (see John 3:5), admits into the kingdom of God."
3. "To a state of outward earthly privilege rights of natural birth might give admittance. In declaring that without a complete inward change none can possibly see (have a true perception of) 'the kingdom of God,' Jesus declares the spiritual character of His kingdom."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ assures him, that he must be 'born again'; in distinction from, and opposition to his first birth by nature."
2. "By this phrase our Lord signifies, that no man can have any true knowledge of, or right unto, the enjoyment of the kingdom of God, unless he is born again or regenerated, and quickened by the Spirit of God."
3. "If this is not the case, a man can have no true knowledge of the kingdom of the Messiah, which is not a temporal and carnal one."

### John Wesley:
1. "That an entire change of heart as well as of life was necessary for that purpose: that this could only be wrought in man by the almighty power of God."
2. "Every man born into the world was by nature in a state of sin, condemnation, and misery."
3. "If our Lord by being born again means only reformation of life, instead of making any new discovery, he has only thrown a great deal of obscurity on what was before plain and obvious."
