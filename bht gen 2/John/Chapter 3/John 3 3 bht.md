# John 3:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus explains that in order to enter the kingdom of God, one must go through a profound transformation, being born again in a spiritual sense. This transformation is not simply a matter of outward actions but requires a complete change of heart and life. It is a recognition that every person is born into the world in a state of sin and separation from God, deserving condemnation and experiencing misery. However, by embracing the new birth, one can receive forgiveness, salvation, and eternal life. Jesus warns that rejecting him would result in a severe, everlasting condemnation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is not learning, but life, that is wanted for the Messiah’s Kingdom; and life must begin by birth."
2. "My teaching is not of doing and leaving undone, but of a change in the man; so that it is, not new works done, but a new man to do them; not another life only, but another birth."
3. "The true meaning is to be found by taking into account the answer of Nicodemus, who obviously understood it of a new birth in mature life. Born afresh would be a better rendering than 'born again,' being closer to the meaning of ἄνωθεν, 'from the very beginning.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This blunt and curt reply was plainly meant to shake the whole edifice of the man's religion, in order to lay a deeper and more enduring foundation."
2. "Had the man been less sincere, this would certainly have repelled him but with persons in his mixed state of mind—to which Jesus was no stranger—such methods speed better than more honeyed words and gradual approaches."
3. "Be born again—or, as it were, begin life anew in relation to God; his manner of thinking, feeling, and acting, with reference to spiritual things, undergoing a fundamental and permanent revolution."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jesus declared to every man, high or low, rich or poor, the most humbling truths of the gospel."
2. "It was not sufficient to be a Jew, or to acknowledge him to be a teacher sent by God that is, the Messiah; it was necessary, in addition to this, to experience in his own soul that great change called the 'new birth' or regeneration."
3. "The change in the New Testament is elsewhere called the 'new creation' and 'life from the dead,' or a resurrection."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word is used in the following senses in the New Testament, where it occurs thirteen times: From the top, from above, from the beginning, again."
2. "In favor of the rendering from above, it corresponds to John's habitual method of describing the work of spiritual regeneration as a birth from God."
3. "In favor of the other rendering, again, it may be said that Nicodemus clearly understood the word as meaning again, since, in ver. 4, he translated it into a second time."

### John Calvin:
1. "For as it is useless to sow seed in a field which has not been prepared by the labors of the husbandman, so it is to no purpose to scatter the doctrine of the Gospel, if the mind has not been previously subdued and duly prepared for docility and obedience."
2. "This exhortation, therefore, resembled a ploughing to purify him, that nothing might prevent him from profiting by the doctrine."
3. "So the meaning is, that no man can be truly united to the Church, so as to be reckoned among the children of God, until he has been previously renewed."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Whatever meaning may be assigned to the words of John 3:2, we may certainly say that every thoughtful Jew who believed what Nicodemus believed was ‘waiting for the kingdom of God.’ But the Pharisee’s conception of the Messianic promise was false. In great measure, at least, his ‘kingdom of God’ was outward and carnal, not inward and spiritual, a privilege of birth, belonging of right to Israel." 
2. "Our Lord’s words, then, teach the fundamental truth, that not natural birth, descent from the stock of Israel, but a second birth, the being begotten anew, a complete spiritual change (see John 3:5), admits into the kingdom of God."
3. "In declaring that without a complete inward change none can possibly see (have a true perception of) ‘the kingdom of God,’ Jesus declares the spiritual character of His kingdom. In it none but the spiritual can have any part."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Except a man be born anew (εαν μη τις γεννηθη ανωθεν)... a second birth from the womb."
2. "The meaning is 'from above' (δεσυπερ)... a birth from above by the Spirit."
3. "He cannot see the kingdom of God (ου δυνατα ιδειν την βασιλειαν του θεου)... to participate in it."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ assures him, that he must be 'born again'; in distinction from, and opposition to his first birth by nature."
2. "By this phrase our Lord signifies, that no man can have any true knowledge of, or right unto, the enjoyment of the kingdom of God, unless he is born again or regenerated."
3. "If this is not the case, a man can have no true knowledge of the kingdom of the Messiah, which is not a temporal and carnal one."

### John Wesley:
1. "That an entire change of heart as well as of life was necessary for that purpose."
2. "That every man born into the world was by nature in a state of sin, condemnation, and misery."
3. "But that if they rejected him, their eternal, aggravated condemnation, would be the certain consequence."
