# John 3:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He must increase, but I must decrease, signifies the understanding that those who are currently influential and prominent must eventually fade away as others rise in power and influence around them. This sentiment encourages us to be aware of our own limitations and to find comfort in recognizing the potential for greater impact in the emerging leaders who will continue the work we started. It is a reminder to not only focus on our own rise to success, but also on equipping and empowering those who will come after us.
