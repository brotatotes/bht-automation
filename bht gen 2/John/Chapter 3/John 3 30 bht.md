# John 3:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He must increase, but I must decrease. As John the Baptist understood, this verse reminds us of the importance of Christ's increasing authority and influence. It is not about his physical stature or wisdom, but rather about his fame, reputation, and ministry. Christ's word, even after his resurrection and ascension, continued to grow and increase mightily. His kingdom and interest also experienced remarkable growth over time. As we reflect on this verse, let us appreciate the significance of Christ's rise to prominence, while humbly recognizing our own need to decrease and point others to his everlasting glory.
