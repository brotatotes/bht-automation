# John 3:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He must increase, but I must decrease. This statement reveals John the Baptist's recognition that the authority and influence of Christ must grow, while his own ministry must diminish. The growing fame and reputation of Christ among men will lead to his exaltation. As the ministry of the Word increases, it will cover the earth, just as the waters cover the sea. John's words remind us that those who shine brightly in their service to God must gracefully decrease while others rise to take their place, trusting in the divine plan for greater usefulness beyond their own time.
