# John 3:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse reminds us of the contrast between the one who comes from above, representing the Messiah's divine origin, and the one who is of the earth, referring to a mere human. The one who comes from above speaks with authority and power, reflecting the eternal and divine nature of their message. In contrast, the one who is of the earth speaks from a limited and temporary perspective. The verse highlights the unique position of the one who comes from above, surpassing all others in their authority and ability to reveal truth.
