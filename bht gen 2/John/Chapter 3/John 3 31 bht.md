# John 3:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The contrast between Jesus and earthly teachers is evident in this passage. Jesus, who comes from above, is distinguished by his divine authority and heavenly origin. In comparison to him, all human teachers are merely of the earth, limited by their human nature. Their words and teachings are confined to earthly wisdom, while Jesus speaks with the wisdom and authority of heaven. It is crucial to acknowledge Jesus' unique status as the one who comes from above and to recognize the unparalleled greatness of his teachings.
