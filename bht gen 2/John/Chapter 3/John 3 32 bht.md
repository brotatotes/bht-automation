# John 3:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Though multitudes came to him, drawn by various motives, yet 'few' became his 'real' disciples. The words 'no man' are here to be understood in the sense of 'few.' Though his doctrine is pure, plain, sublime, yet 'few,' comparatively, received it in faith. Often many persons 'appear' for a time to become the followers of Christ, who in the end are seen to have known nothing of religion. Only a select few were open and receptive to his teachings, while the majority of people were hesitant to receive his pure and divine doctrine in faith.
