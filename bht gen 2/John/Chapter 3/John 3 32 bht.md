# John 3:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ's teachings are pure, plain, and sublime, yet few people received them in faith. Although multitudes came to him, only a small number became his true disciples. Many appeared to follow him, but knew nothing of true religion. Christ teaches what has been ascertained and revealed to him by God. He is the faithful witness and brings forward divine truths. Unfortunately, many wickedly rejected him. No one can truly receive Christ's witness and believe in him unless it is given by the grace of God.
