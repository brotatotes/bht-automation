# John 3:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Though Christ teaches pure and sublime doctrine, only a few truly receive and believe in his testimony. Many may come to him, but only a small number become his true disciples. It is disheartening to see how the world rejects such an authentic and faithful interpreter of God. However, this serves as a reminder to us to remain steadfast in our obedience to the Gospel, for it is the truth that comes from God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "What he hath seen and heard."
2. "Would it were so, but alas! they are next to 'none' [BENGEL]. They were far readier to receive himself, and obliged him to say, I am not the Christ, and he seems pained at this."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Though his doctrine is pure, plain, sublime, yet 'few,' comparatively, received it in faith." 
2. "Though multitudes came to him, drawn by various motives, yet 'few' became his 'real' disciples." 
3. "Often many persons 'appear' for a time to become the followers of Christ, who in the end are seen to have known nothing of religion."

### John Calvin:
1. "He means that Christ teaches nothing but what has been fully ascertained."
2. "He afterwards charges the world with ingratitude, in basely and wickedly rejecting such an undoubted and faithful interpreter of God."
3. "And, therefore, whenever we see such obstinacy in the world, let this admonition hold us in constant obedience to the Gospel, that it is truth which came from God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He that cometh out of heaven beareth witness of what he hath seen and heard; and no man receiveth his witness."
2. "Jesus alone belongs to this sphere: all the prophets before His coming, though divinely commissioned, had ‘the earth’ as the starting-point of their utterances, spoke of what they had received on earth, spoke truly but not perfectly."
3. "In Jesus the heavenly light itself came into the world. Jesus alone, then, beareth witness to that which He hath seen and which He heard, and (here again is the mournful cadence of this Gospel) no one receiveth His witness."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "What he hath seen and heard (ο εωρακεν κα ηκουσεν). Perfect active indicative followed by aorist active indicative, because, as Westcott shows, the first belongs to the very existence of the Son and the latter to his mission. There is no confusion of tenses here."
2. "No man (ουδεις). There were crowds coming to Jesus, but they do not really accept him as Saviour and Lord (John 1:11; John 2:24). It is superficial as time will show."
3. "But 'no one' is not to be pressed too far, for it is the rhetorical use."

### John Gill:
1. "The phrases express the clear and perfect knowledge Christ has of all truths and doctrines; he having all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge in him."
2. "He [Christ] testifies fully, freely, and faithfully; withholds nothing, but declares the whole counsel of God; and is deservedly called the faithful witness."
3. "No one person can receive the testimony of Christ, and believe in him, unless it be given him from above, by the grace of God."

### John Wesley:
1. No man — None comparatively, exceeding few; receiveth his testimony - With true faith.
