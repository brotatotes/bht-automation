# John 3:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers who have received and fully believed the testimony of Christ have set their seal of approval on the veracity of God's words. This act of sealing mirrors the Jewish custom where witnesses would affirm the truthfulness of their testimonies. By embracing the truth of God through Christ, believers not only confirm His faithfulness in fulfilling promises but also attest to the authenticity of His message. This act of setting a seal serves as a powerful affirmation of God's truth and our unwavering trust in Him.
