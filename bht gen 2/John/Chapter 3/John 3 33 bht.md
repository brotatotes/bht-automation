# John 3:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He who firmly believes in the testimony of Christ not only attests to the truth of God, but also confirms it by embracing the message of Jesus. This act of faith can be likened to setting a seal, a common practice among the Jews, where a witness would mark their testimony as true. By setting our seal and accepting the truth of God's word spoken through Christ, we affirm God's faithfulness and trustworthiness.
