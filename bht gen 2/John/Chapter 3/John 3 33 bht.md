# John 3:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who have embraced the testimony of Christ have set their seal, confirming the truthfulness of God's words. By fully believing in the Messiah's teachings and following Him sincerely, they have confirmed that God is true. In doing so, they add their own testimony to the faith. Those who do not believe in Christ make God out to be a liar, which is a grave insult. However, those who wholeheartedly accept the message of the Gospel show that they have faith in God, the ultimate Author of their belief.
