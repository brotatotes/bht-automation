# John 3:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, as the one sent by God, speaks the words of God Himself. In receiving the teachings of Christ, we are directly encountering God's own words. Unlike the prophets and ordinary ministers who received the Spirit in a limited degree, the Spirit given to Christ is without measure. He possesses all the gifts and grace of the Spirit in fullness and abundance. This anointing of the Holy Spirit sets Jesus apart, enabling him to speak the words of God in the most perfect manner. Thus, when we listen to Jesus, we are hearing the divine revelation of God Himself.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "They have the Spirit in a limited degree; but God giveth not [to Him] the Spirit by measure." 
2. "It means the entire fulness of divine life and divine power."
3. "The present tense 'giveth,' very aptly points out the permanent communication of the Spirit by the Father to the Son, so that a constant flow and reflow of living power is to be understood."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Whom God hath sent - The Messiah.Speaketh the words of God - The truth, or commands of God."
2. "For God giveth not the Spirit - The Spirit of God. Though Jesus was God as well as man, yet, as Mediator, God anointed him, or endowed him with the influences of his Spirit, so as to be completely qualified for his great work."
3. "By measure - Not in a small degree, but fully, completely. The prophets were inspired on particular occasions to deliver special messages. The Messiah was continually filled with the Spirit of God. 'The Spirit dwelt in him, not as a vessel, but as in a fountain, as in a bottomless ocean (Henry).'"

### John Calvin:
1. "For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God. He confirms the preceding statement, for he shows that we have actually to do with God, when we receive the doctrine of Christ; because Christ proceeded from none else than from the Heavenly Father." 
2. "It is, therefore, God alone who speaks to us by him; and, indeed, we do not assign to the doctrine of Christ all that it deserves unless we acknowledge it to be divine."
3. "But if any one choose to interpret it more simply, it is no unusual thing that there should be a change of tenses in such verbs, and that giveth should be put for hath given. The meaning is now plain, that the Spirit was not given to Christ by measure, as if the power of grace which he possesses were in any way limited."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The last verse rests on the thought that the words of Jesus are the words of God."
2. "He speaketh not â€˜words of Godâ€™ only, but â€˜the words of God,â€™ giving all the revelation that God gives."
3. "The enabling power thus to speak is the gift of the Spirit. Every one whom God sends is enabled to speak Godâ€™s words words that, for the portion of the revelation he is commissioned to give, are truly Godâ€™s words."

### John Gill:
1. "Still meaning Christ, who was sent in human nature, in the likeness of sinful flesh, in the fulness of time; to be the Saviour of the world, of that which was lost, of the chief of sinners."
2. "For God giveth not the Spirit by measure [unto him], as he did to the prophets of the Old Testament, and to the apostles of the New; and to the ordinary ministers of the word, who have gifts differing one from another."
3. "But the Lord Jesus has every gift of the Spirit, and the fulness of grace in him: he is anointed with the oil of gladness, with the Holy Ghost above his fellows; and has an immeasurable unction of the holy one."

### John Wesley:
1. "God giveth not him the Spirit by measure" - As he did to the prophets, but immeasurably.
2. "Hence he speaketh the words of God in the most perfect manner."
