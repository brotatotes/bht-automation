# John 3:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Within the Trinity, the Father and Son share a natural and necessary relationship. This relationship is characterized by love, as the Son is the dear Son of the Father, sharing the same nature and perfections. The love between them is evident in the Son's sacrifice for the sheep, willingly laying down his life and enduring the bruising of his soul. Even in moments of darkness on the cross and in the grave, the Father's love for the Son remained steadfast, never leaving him nor allowing him to see corruption.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This, again, is the ground why the Father gives not the Spirit by measure (to Him)." 
2. "What is commonly known as John’s form of expression was not confined to him, but originated higher, having its traces in the synoptic narrative, which is confessedly, in its main features, independent of him."

1. "The Father loveth, &c."
2. "See on  :-, where we have the 'delivering over of all things into the hands of the Son,' while here we have the deep spring of that august act in the Father's ineffable 'love of the Son.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Loveth the Son - Loves him eminently, above all the prophets and all the other messengers of God."
2. "Hath given all things into his hand - See the notes at Matthew 28:18."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Father loveth the Son. But what is the meaning of this reason? Does he regard all others with hatred? The answer is easy, that he does not speak of the common love with which God regards men whom he has created, or his other works, but of that peculiar love which, beginning with the Son, flows from him to all the creatures."
2. "For that love with which, embracing the Son, he embraces us also in him, leads him to communicate all his benefits to us by his hand."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Father loveth the Son. There is a continual heightening of the thought and expression. We read of Him ‘that cometh from above,’ Him ‘that cometh out of heaven,’ Him ‘whom God sent,’ ‘the Son,’ whom ‘the Father loveth.’"
2. "Here we read of the love of the Father towards the Son who thus gave Himself for the accomplishment of the purpose of the Father."

2. "Jesus makes the same claim in John 5:19-30; Matthew 11:27; Matthew 28:18."

### John Gill:
1. "There is such a relation as that of Father and Son subsisting between the first and second persons in the Trinity; which is not by constitution and appointment, but is natural and necessary."
2. "And from this relation arises love; hence, the Son of the Father is his dear Son, the Son of his love; as he must needs be, since he is of the same nature, has the same perfections he has."
3. "He loved him when he laid down his life for the sheep: when he was bruised, and his soul made an offering for sin; he loved him when on the cross, and even when he hid his face from him; when lay in the grave he left him not, nor would he suffer him to see corruption."
