# John 3:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life. The believer possesses the gift of eternal life. It is the faith of God's elect, the gift of God, and the operation of His Spirit. Through faith in Christ, the believer has a right to eternal life and a readiness for it. However, those who do not believe in the Son, who do not obey His authority, will not enter into everlasting life. Instead, the wrath of God abides on them. The consequence of not believing is a life separated from the eternal bliss that comes through faith in Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Unbelief implies disobedience."
2. "It [unbelief] can only be removed by faith in the Son of God, which he has not."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "hath everlasting life—already has it."
2. "The contrast here is striking: The one has already a life that will endure for ever—the other not only has it not now, but shall never have it—never see it."
3. "It was on Him before, and not being removed in the only possible way, by 'believing on the Son,' it necessarily remaineth on him!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Piety here is the same that it will be there, except that it will be expanded, matured, purified, made more glorious."
2. "The Christian here has a foretaste of the world of glory, and enjoys the same kind of felicity, though not the same degree, that he will there."
3. "As there is no way of escaping the wrath of God but by the Lord Jesus Christ, so those who will not believe must go to eternity 'as they are,' and bear alone and unpitied all that God may choose to inflict as the expression of 'his' sense of sin."

### John Calvin:
1. "He shows that enjoyment consists in faith; and not without reason, since by means of it we possess Christ, who brings along with him both righteousness and life, which is the fruit of righteousness."
2. "But he who believeth not in the Son...now he adjudges to eternal death all who do not believe in Christ...they who reject the salvation offered in him are justly suffered to remain in death...all the righteousness which the world thinks that it has out of Christ is condemned and reduced to nothing."
3. "To see life is here put for 'enjoying life.'...death hangs over all unbelievers, and keeps them oppressed and overwhelmed in such a manner that they can never escape...by their unbelief they draw down on themselves a new death."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He that believeth in the Son has in Him the highest of all blessings, life eternal; has this in present possession-involved in the communion of faith in which he lives."
2. "The change from believing to obedience results from the thought of the last verse: supreme power is given to the Son; therefore he that receives Him not by faith is guilty of disobeying His authority; not faith only, but the obedience of faith, is His due."
3. "The rejection of the Son brings with it the wrath of God, by whom all things were given into the Son’s hand: this is the present and the abiding heritage of him that obeyeth not the Son."

### John Gill:
1. "He that believeth on the Son... is the faith of God's elect, the gift of God, and the operation of his Spirit; by which a man sees the Son, goes unto him, ventures and relies upon him, and commits himself to him, and expects life and salvation from him." 
2. "He has it in Christ his head, in whom he believes; he has a right unto it through the justifying righteousness of Christ, and a meetness for it by his grace; he has it in faith and hope; he has the beginning of it in the knowledge of Christ, and communion with him."
3. "He shall not enter into it, and enjoy it; he shall die the second death... the wrath of God abideth on him... it hangs over their heads, and lights upon them, and they will be filled with a dreadful sense of it to all eternity."

### John Wesley:
1. "He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life"
2. "He hath it already. For he loves God. And love is the essence of heaven."
3. "He that obeyeth not — A consequence of not believing."
