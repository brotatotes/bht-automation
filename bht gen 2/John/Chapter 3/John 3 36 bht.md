# John 3:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who believe in the Son already possess everlasting life through the communion of faith. This belief not only brings righteousness but also life, a fruit of righteousness. The rejection of the Son, on the other hand, brings forth the enduring consequence of God's wrath. Through belief in the Son, one can escape this wrath and enter into eternal life. Obeying the Son is a natural outcome of true faith, encompassing both belief and obedience. Thus, those who do not believe not only lack eternal life but also bear the weight of God's wrath.
