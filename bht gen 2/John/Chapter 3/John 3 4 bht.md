# John 3:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Nicodemus, an elderly man, struggled to grasp the idea of being born again. His literal interpretation demonstrated his lack of spiritual understanding, as he could not comprehend a repeated physical birth. This highlighted his limited knowledge and revealed the prevalent ignorance among the religious scholars of his time. It serves as a reminder that prejudice can hinder the comprehension of essential religious teachings. Just as Nicodemus needed a spiritual rebirth to grasp the concept of regeneration, we too must approach spiritual matters with an open mind, ready to undergo a transformative experience.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is impossible that Nicodemus can have so entirely and stupidly misunderstood our Lord‚Äôs words, as his question here would seem to imply."
2. "But together with this there was also considerable real ignorance."
3. "He therefore rebuts the assertion with a reductio ad absurdum, which in spirit expresses, as in ch. John 6:60, 'This is a hard saying; who can hear it?'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The figure of the new birth, if it had been meant only of Gentile proselytes to the Jewish religion, would have been intelligible enough..." 
2. "But that Jews themselves should need a new birth was to him incomprehensible."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It may seem remarkable that Nicodemus understood the Saviour literally, when the expression 'to be born again' was in common use among the Jews to denote a change from 'Gentilism' to 'Judaism' by becoming a proselyte by baptism."
2. "When, therefore, our Saviour used it of a Jew, when he affirmed its necessity of every man, Nicodemus supposed that there was an absurdity in the doctrine, or something that surpassed his comprehension."
3. "And we may learn from this: 1.That prejudice leads men to misunderstand the plainest doctrines of religion. 2.That things which are at first incomprehensible or apparently absurd, may, when explained, become clear. The doctrine of regeneration, so difficult to Nicodemus, is plain to a 'child' that is born of the Spirit."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "When he is old [Œ≥ŒµœÅœâŒΩ œâŒΩ]. Literally, being an old man. Can he [ŒºŒ∑ Œ¥œÖŒΩŒ±œÑŒ±Œπ]. The interrogative particle anticipates a negative answer. Surely he cannot."
2. "Nicodemus looks at the subject merely from the physical side. His second time is not the same as Jesus ' anew."
3. "He does not understand the difference between a second beginning and a different beginning."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is evident how imperfectly skilled the Scribes at that time were in the reading of the Scriptures."
2. "As almost all devoted their attention to useless subtleties, what was of chief importance in the doctrine of piety was disregarded."
3. "Popery exhibits to us, at the present day, an instance of the same kind in her Theologians."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "These are the words of a man amazed beyond measure."
2. "The solemn emphasis laid on the words 'born anew' forbids his thinking of a mere figure of speech."
3. "The privilege which he attached to natural birth within the bounds of Israel is tom away by a word; the 'any one' of our Lord‚Äôs answer, makes all men equal; and the prize which seemed almost within his grasp is given to every one who has been born anew."

### John Gill:
1. "Understanding him of a natural birth, to be repeated: how can a man be born when he is old?"
2. "This he urges, as absurd, impracticable, and impossible."
3. "Which shows him to have been as yet a natural man, who could not receive nor discern spiritual things."

### John Wesley:
1. When he is old ‚Äî As Nicodemus himself was.
