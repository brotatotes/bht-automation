# John 3:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Nicodemus, a learned Pharisee, struggled to comprehend Jesus' words about being born again. He misinterpreted the idea of new birth, assuming it pertained only to Gentile proselytes. Nicodemus' lack of understanding stemmed from both ignorance and prejudice, leading him to underestimate the significance of spiritual transformation. His emphasis on the physical aspect of aging further highlighted his misunderstanding. Jesus' response challenged Nicodemus' limited perspective, affirming that the new birth applies to all, regardless of their status or heritage. Nicodemus' inability to grasp this concept exemplifies how prejudice can obstruct our understanding of profound religious truths.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The idea of new birth was by no means alien from the Rabbinical views."
2. "There was something of the spirit that would not understand, and the disposition to turn to ridicule what he heard."
3. "But together with this there was also considerable real ignorance."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The figure of the new birth, if it had been meant only of Gentile proselytes to the Jewish religion, would have been intelligible enough to Nicodemus, being quite in keeping with the language of that day..."
2. "...that Jews themselves should need a new birth was to him incomprehensible."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It may seem remarkable that Nicodemus understood the Saviour literally, when the expression 'to be born again' was in common use among the Jews to denote a change from 'Gentilism' to 'Judaism' by becoming a proselyte by baptism."
2. "And we may learn from this: 1.That prejudice leads men to misunderstand the plainest doctrines of religion. 2.That things which are at first incomprehensible or apparently absurd, may, when explained, become clear."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "When he is old [γερων ων]. Literally, being an old man. Can he [μη δυναται]. The interrogative particle anticipates a negative answer. Surely he cannot."
2. "Nicodemus looks at the subject merely from the physical side. His second time is not the same as Jesus' anew."
3. "He does not understand the difference between a second beginning and a different beginning."

### John Calvin:
1. "It certainly was not one man only who was to blame for not knowing what was meant by the grace of regeneration."
2. "Popery exhibits to us, at the present day, an instance of the same kind in her Theologians."
3. "For while they weary out their whole life with profound speculations, as to all that strictly relates to the worship of God...they know no more on these subjects than a cobbler or a cowherd knows about the course of the stars."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "These are the words of a man amazed beyond measure."
2. "The solemn emphasis laid on the words 'born anew' forbids his thinking of a mere figure of speech."
3. "The privilege which he attached to natural birth within the bounds of Israel is torn away by a word; the 'any one' of our Lord's answer, makes all men equal."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "But 'this stupid misunderstanding' (Bernard) of the meaning of Jesus is precisely what John represents Nicodemus as making."
2. "The blunder of Nicodemus is emphasized by the second question with the μη expecting the negative answer."
3. "The learned Pharisee is as jejune in spiritual insight as the veriest tyro."

### John Gill:
1. "Understanding him of a natural birth, to be repeated: how can a man be born when he is old?"
2. "This he urges, as absurd, impracticable, and impossible; and which shows him to have been as yet a natural man, who could not receive nor discern spiritual things."

### John Wesley:
1. When he is old — As Nicodemus himself was.
