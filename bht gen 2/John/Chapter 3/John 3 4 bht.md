# John 3:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Nicodemus, a learned Jewish leader, struggled to grasp Jesus' teaching about being born again. The concept of a new birth was not unfamiliar to Jewish thought, often associated with Gentile proselytes converting to Judaism. However, Nicodemus failed to comprehend that this new birth was not exclusive to Gentiles, but necessary for every individual. His literal understanding and physical perspective hindered him from recognizing the spiritual truth Jesus was conveying. Nicodemus' inability to grasp this new beginning highlights the tendency of prejudice to cloud understanding and disregard the significance of essential doctrines in faith.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The idea of new birth was by no means alien from the Rabbinical views."
2. "I agree with Stier in thinking that there was something of the spirit that  would not understand, and the disposition to turn to ridicule what he heard."
3. "He therefore rebuts the assertion with a reductio ad absurdum, which in spirit expresses, as in ch. John 6:60 , â€˜This is an hard saying; who can hear it?â€™"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The figure of the new birth, if it had been meant only of Gentile proselytes to the Jewish religion, would have been intelligible enough to Nicodemus, being quite in keeping with the language of that day."
2. "But that Jews themselves should need a new birth was to him incomprehensible."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It may seem remarkable that Nicodemus understood the Saviour literally, when the expression 'to be born again' was in common use among the Jews to denote a change from 'Gentilism' to 'Judaism' by becoming a proselyte by baptism."
2. "When, therefore, our Saviour used it of a Jew, when he affirmed its necessity of every man, Nicodemus supposed that there was an absurdity in the doctrine, or something that surpassed his comprehension."
3. "And we may learn from this: 1.That prejudice leads men to misunderstand the plainest doctrines of religion. 2.That things which are at first incomprehensible or apparently absurd, may, when explained, become clear."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "When he is old...Can he...Surely he cannot."
2. "Nicodemus looks at the subject merely from the physical side."
3. "He does not understand the difference between a second beginning and a different beginning."

### John Calvin:
1. "Though the form of expression which Christ employed was not contained in the Law and the prophets, yet as renewal is frequently mentioned in Scripture, and is one of the first principles of faith..."
2. "It certainly was not one man only who was to blame for not knowing what was meant by the grace of regeneration; but as almost all devoted their attention to useless subtleties, what was of chief importance in the doctrine of piety was disregarded."
3. "We need not wonder, therefore, to find here that Nicodemus stumbles at a straw; for it is a just vengeance of God, that they who think themselves the highest and most excellent teachers, and in whose estimation the ordinary simplicity of doctrine is vile and despicable, stand amazed at small matters."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The solemn emphasis laid on the words â€˜born anewâ€™ forbids his thinking of a mere figure of speech, and apparently banishes from his mind the Old Testament expressions which approach the same truth."
2. "The privilege which he attached to natural birth within the bounds of Israel is tom away by a word; theâ€™ any one â€˜of our Lordâ€™s answer, makes all men equal; and the prize which seemed almost within his grasp is given to every one who has been born anew."
3. "In his bewilderment he sees no meaning in the words of Jesus, except they be understood physically of a second natural birth; and the evident impossibility of this he expresses in the very strongest terms."

### John Gill:
1. "Understanding him of a natural birth, to be repeated:how can a man be born when he is old?"
2. "This he urges, as absurd, impracticable, and impossible; and which shows him to have been as yet a natural man, who could not receive nor discern spiritual things."

### John Wesley:
1. When he is old â€” As Nicodemus himself was.
