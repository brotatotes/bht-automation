# John 3:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To truly enter into the newness of life offered by God, one must be born of water and of the Spirit, symbolizing the external act of baptism and the inward transformation by the Holy Spirit. The water represents the grace and purification bestowed by God, and the Spirit is the catalyst for conviction, sanctification, and renewal. This process of regeneration is attributed to all three persons of the Trinity, emphasizing the importance of each in our spiritual rebirth. Through baptism and the work of the Spirit, believers experience a complete transformation, leaving behind their old ways and entering into the kingdom of God. (97 words)

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There can be no doubt, on any honest interpretation of the words, that Œ≥ŒµŒΩŒΩŒ∑Œ∏·øÜŒΩŒ±Œπ ·ºêŒæ ·ΩïŒ¥Œ±œÑŒøœÇ refers to the token or outward sign of baptism, and ·ºêŒ∫ œÄŒΩŒµœçŒºŒ±œÑŒøœÇ to the thing signified, or inward grace of the Holy Spirit."
2. "Both [baptisms] were appointed means, the one by the Jewish Church, the other, stamping that first with approval, by God Himself, towards their respective ends."
3. "He here unites together the two elements of a complete Baptism which were sundered in the words of the Baptist, ch. Joh 1:33 in which united form He afterwards ordained it as a Sacrament of His Church."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "To a Jewish ecclesiastic, so familiar with the symbolical application of water, in every variety of way and form of expression, this language was fitted to show that the thing intended was no other than a thorough spiritual purification by the operation of the Holy Ghost."
2. "Indeed, element of water and operation of the Spirit are brought together in a glorious evangelical prediction of Ezekiel, which Nicodemus might have been reminded of had such spiritualities not been almost lost in the reigning formalism."
3. "Already had the symbol of water been embodied in an initiatory ordinance, in the baptism of the Jewish expectants of Messiah by the Baptist, not to speak of the baptism of Gentile proselytes before that; and in the Christian Church it was soon to become the great visible door of entrance into 'the kingdom of God,' the reality being the sole work of the Holy Ghost."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Baptism...is an ordinance of his religion, and the sign and seal of the renewing influences of his Spirit."
2. "Jesus meant...that this was to be the regular and uniform way of entering into his church; that it was the appropriate mode of making a profession of religion."
3. "By this is clearly intended that the heart must be changed by the agency of the Holy Spirit; that the love of sin must be abandoned...the great change is in the Scripture ascribed uniformly to the Holy Spirit."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "That the former of these two factors is not to be merged in the latter; that the spiritual element is not to exclude or obliterate the external and ritual element." 
2. "That while Jesus asserted the obligation of the outward rite, He asserted likewise, as its necessary complement, the presence and creating and informing energy of the Spirit."
3. "Through water and the Spirit, he passes indeed into the outward fellowship, but through that into the vision and fellowship of the kingdom of God."

### John Calvin:
1. "He connects the Water with the Spirit, because under that visible symbol he attests and seals that newness of life which God alone produces in us by his Spirit."
2. "By water, therefore, is meant nothing more than the inward purification and invigoration which is produced by the Holy Spirit."
3. "And the view which I have taken is supported by what follows; for when Christ immediately proceeds to assign the reason why we must be born again, without mentioning the water, he shows that the newness of life which he requires is produced by the Spirit alone; whence it follows, that water must not be separated from the Spirit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The first words have given rise to warm and continued controversy. Many have held that the birth 'of water and spirit; can only refer to Christian baptism; others have denied that Christian baptism is alluded to at all."
2. "We cannot doubt that this is the true rendering; no direct reference is made as yet to the personal Holy Spirit. The words 'water and spirit' are most closely joined, and placed under the government of the same preposition."
3. "It is possible that the Jews of that age may have been familiar with the figure of a new birth in connection with baptism."


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Nicodemus had failed utterly to grasp the idea of the spiritual birth as essential to entrance into the Kingdom of God."
2. "By using water (the symbol before the thing signified) first and adding Spirit, he may have hoped to turn the mind of Nicodemus away from mere physical birth and, by pointing to the baptism of John on confession of sin which the Pharisees had rejected, to turn his attention to the birth from above by the Spirit."
3. "That is to say the mention of 'water' here may have been for the purpose of helping Nicodemus without laying down a fundamental principle of salvation as being by means of baptism."

### John Gill:
1. "these are, ◊©◊†◊ï◊™◊û◊ú◊ï◊™, 'two words', which express the same thing, as Kimchi observes in many places in his commentaries, and signify the grace of the Spirit of God."
2. "by 'water' is meant, in a figurative and metaphorical sense, the grace of God."
3. "regeneration is sometimes ascribed to God the Father, as in 1 Peter 1:3, and sometimes to the Son, 1 John 2:29 and here to the Spirit, as in Titus 3:5, who convinces of sin, sanctifies, renews, works faith, and every other grace; begins and carries on the work of grace, unto perfection."

### John Wesley:
1. "Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit"
2. "Except he experience that great inward change by the Spirit, and be baptized (wherever baptism can be had) as the outward sign and means of it."
