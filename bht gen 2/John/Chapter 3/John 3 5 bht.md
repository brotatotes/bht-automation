# John 3:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To enter into the kingdom of God, one must undergo both an inner transformation and an outward expression of it. This change is brought about by the work of the Holy Spirit, not merely through water baptism itself. Water baptism serves as a sign and means of this inward renewal, symbolizing the cleansing and rebirth that takes place within. It is through the combination of this inward change by the Spirit and the outward act of baptism that one can truly enter into the fullness of God's kingdom.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There can be no doubt, on any honest interpretation of the words, that Œ≥ŒµŒΩŒΩŒ∑Œ∏·øÜŒΩŒ±Œπ ·ºêŒæ ·ΩïŒ¥Œ±œÑŒøœÇ refers to the token or outward sign of baptism, Œ≥. ·ºêŒ∫ œÄŒΩŒµœçŒºŒ±œÑŒøœÇ to the thing signified, or inward grace of the Holy Spirit."
2. "Both were appointed means, the one by the Jewish Church, the other, stamping that first with approval, by God Himself, towards their respective ends."
3. "Baptism, complete, with water and the Spirit, is the admission into the kingdom of God. Those who have received the outward sign and the spiritual grace, have entered into that Kingdom."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "To a Jewish ecclesiastic, so familiar with the symbolical application of water, in every variety of way and form of expression, this language was fitted to show that the thing intended was no other than a thorough spiritual purification by the operation of the Holy Ghost."
2. "Indeed, element of water and operation of the Spirit are brought together in a glorious evangelical prediction of Ezekiel (36:25), which Nicodemus might have been reminded of had such spiritualities not been almost lost in the reigning formalism."
3. "Already had the symbol of water been embodied in an initiatory ordinance, in the baptism of the Jewish expectants of Messiah by the Baptist, not to speak of the baptism of Gentile proselytes before that; and in the Christian Church it was soon to become the great visible door of entrance into 'the kingdom of God,' the reality being the sole work of the Holy Ghost (John 3:5)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Baptism was practiced by the Jews in receiving a Gentile as a proselyte... Jesus here says that it is an ordinance of his religion, and the sign and seal of the renewing influences of his Spirit." 
2. "Jesus meant, undoubtedly, to be understood as affirming that this [baptism] was to be the regular and uniform way of entering into his church; that it was the appropriate mode of making a profession of religion."
3. "He cannot enter into the true church here, or into heaven in the world to come, except in connection with a change of heart, and by the proper expression of that change in the ordinances appointed by the Saviour."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "That water points definitely to the rite of baptism, and that with a twofold reference - to the past and to the future."
2. "Jesus' words included a prophetic reference to the complete ideal of Christian baptism - 'the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Ghost' (Titus 3:5; Ephesians 5:26); according to which the two factors are inseparably blended."
3. "The ideal of the new life presented in our Lord's words includes the relation of the regenerated man to an organization. The object of the new birth is declared to be that a man may see and enter into the kingdom of God."

### John Calvin:
1. "The meaning would then be, that by baptism we enter into the kingdom of God, because in baptism we are regenerated by the Spirit of God. Hence arose the belief of the absolute necessity of baptism, in order to the hope of eternal life."
2. "But though we were to admit that Christ here speaks of baptism, yet we ought not to press his words so closely as to imagine that he confines salvation to the outward sign; but, on the contrary, he connects the Water with the Spirit, because under that visible symbol he attests and seals that newness of life which God alone produces in us by his Spirit."
3. "By water, therefore, is meant nothing more than the inward purification and invigoration which is produced by the Holy Spirit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The birth 'of water and spirit' is most closely joined, and placed under the government of the same preposition."
2. "It is possible that the Jews of that age may have been familiar with the figure of a new birth in connection with baptism."
3. "In the words before us there is in some sort a reference to baptism, at all events, to the baptism of John."
4. "John's baptism was directly symbolic, a translation into visible symbol of such promises as Ezekiel 36:25."
5. "No man can enter into the kingdom of God unless he have been born anew, the elements of the new birth being the removal by cleansing of the old sinful life, and the impartation by the Holy Spirit of a new holy principle of life."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'water', is not meant material water, or baptismal water; for water baptism is never expressed by water only, without some additional word, which shows, that the ordinance of water baptism is intended: nor has baptism any regenerating influence in it."
2. "By 'water' is meant, in a figurative and metaphorical sense, the grace of God, as it is elsewhere; see Ezekiel 36:25. Which is the moving cause of this new birth, and according to which God begets men again to, a lively hope, and that by which it is effected."
3. "Regeneration is sometimes ascribed to God the Father, as in 1 Peter 1:3, and sometimes to the Son, 1 John 2:29 and here to the Spirit, as in Titus 3:5, who convinces of sin, sanctifies, renews, works faith, and every other grace; begins and carries on the work of grace, unto perfection."

### John Wesley:
1. "Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit... he experience that great inward change by the Spirit." 
2. "Except he experience... be baptized as the outward sign and means of it."
