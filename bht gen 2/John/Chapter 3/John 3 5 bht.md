# John 3:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, signifies the token or outward sign of baptism and the inward grace of the Holy Spirit. Jesus intended baptism to be the regular and uniform way of entering His Church, symbolizing spiritual purification and making a profession of faith. Through baptism, we demonstrate our abandonment of sin and the transformative work of the Holy Spirit. This new life in Christ necessitates a change of heart by the agency of the Spirit, and establishes our relationship with the Church. Thus, water and Spirit represent the twofold reference to baptism and the work of the Holy Spirit in regeneration.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There can be no doubt, on any honest interpretation of the words, that Œ≥ŒµŒΩŒΩŒ∑Œ∏·øÜŒΩŒ±Œπ ·ºêŒæ ·ΩïŒ¥Œ±œÑŒøœÇ refers to the token or outward sign of baptism... ·ºêŒ∫ œÄŒΩŒµœçŒºŒ±œÑŒøœÇ to the thing signified, or inward grace of the Holy Spirit."
2. "The words of our Lord have in them life and meaning for all ages of His Church: and more especially these opening declarations of His ministry... in which united form He afterwards ordained it as a Sacrament of His Church."
3. "Here He speaks of spiritual Baptism, as in ch. 6. of spiritual Communion, and in both places in connexion with the outward conditions and media of these sacraments."


### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "To a Jewish ecclesiastic, so familiar with the symbolical application of water, in every variety of way and form of expression, this language was fitted to show that the thing intended was no other than a thorough spiritual purification by the operation of the Holy Ghost."
2. "Indeed, element of water and operation of the Spirit are brought together in a glorious evangelical prediction of Ezekiel, which Nicodemus might have been reminded of had such spiritualities not been almost lost in the reigning formalism."
3. "Already had the symbol of water been embodied in an initiatory ordinance, in the baptism of the Jewish expectants of Messiah by the Baptist, not to speak of the baptism of Gentile proselytes before that; and in the Christian Church it was soon to become the great visible door of entrance into 'the kingdom of God,' the reality being the sole work of the Holy Ghost."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Baptism was practiced by the Jews in receiving a Gentile as a proselyte... Jesus here says that it is an ordinance of his religion, and the sign and seal of the renewing influences of his Spirit." 
2. "Jesus meant, undoubtedly, to be understood as affirming that this was to be the regular and uniform way of entering into his church; that it was the appropriate mode of making a profession of religion."
3. "By this is clearly intended that the heart must be changed by the agency of the Holy Spirit; that the love of sin must be abandoned... This great change is in the Scripture ascribed uniformly to the Holy Spirit."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "That water points definitely to the rite of baptism, and that with a twofold reference - to the past and to the future."
2. "Jesus' words opened to Nicodemus a new and more spiritual significance in both the ceremonial purifications and the baptism of John which the Pharisees had rejected."
3. "The ideal of the new life presented in our Lord's words includes the relation of the regenerated man to an organization."

### John Calvin:
1. "Thus they view the language as allegorical, and suppose Christ to have taught that we ought to lay aside the heavy and ponderous mass of the flesh, and to become like water and air, that we may move upwards, or, at least, may not be so much weighed down to the earth."
2. "It is true that, by neglecting baptism, we are excluded from salvation; and in this sense I acknowledge that it is necessary; but it is absurd to speak of the hope of salvation as confined to the sign."
3. "Accordingly, he employed the words Spirit and water to mean the same thing, and this ought not to be regarded as a harsh or forced interpretation; for it is a frequent and common way of speaking in Scripture, when the Spirit is mentioned, to add the word Water or Fire, expressing his power."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The words ‚Äòwater and spirit‚Äô are most closely joined, and placed under the government of the same preposition."
2. "It is very possible that this testimony was well known to others besides John‚Äôs disciples, to all indeed in Judea who were roused to inquiry respecting the Baptist and his relation to Jesus."
3. "Here again, therefore, we have some confirmation of the view that in the words before us there is in some sort a reference to baptism, at all events, to the baptism of John."


### John Gill:
1. "Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit: these are, ◊©◊†◊ï◊™◊û◊ú◊ï◊™, 'two words', which express the same thing, as Kimchi observes in many places in his commentaries, and signify the grace of the Spirit of God."
2. "By 'water' is meant, in a figurative and metaphorical sense, the grace of God, as it is elsewhere; see Ezekiel 36:25. Which is the moving cause of this new birth, and according to which God begets men again to a lively hope."
3. "Regeneration is sometimes ascribed to God the Father, as in 1 Peter 1:3, and sometimes to the Son, 1 John 2:29 and here to the Spirit, as in Titus 3:5, who convinces of sin, sanctifies, renews, works faith, and every other grace; begins and carries on the work of grace, unto perfection."

### John Wesley:
1. "Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit ‚Äî Except he experience that great inward change by the Spirit."
2. "and be baptized (wherever baptism can be had) as the outward sign and means of it."
