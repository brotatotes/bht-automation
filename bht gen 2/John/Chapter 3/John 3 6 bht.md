# John 3:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus answers Nicodemus's hypothetical question about entering the mother's womb a second time by emphasizing the need for a spiritual birth. He explains that the natural birth is a physical one, but the new birth is a spiritual one. This new birth is brought about by the Spirit of God and is characterized by a transformation from a natural, carnal state to a spiritual state. It is through this new birth that individuals become holy and can enter the spiritual kingdom of God. One cannot have evidence of being born again unless they live a holy life, reflecting the work of the Spirit within them.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Lord here answers Nicodemus‚Äôs hypothetical question of John 3:4, by telling him that even could it be so, it would not accomplish the birth of which He speaks."
2. "In this œÉŒ¨œÅŒæ is included every part of that which is born after the ordinary method of generation: even the spirit of man, which, receptive as it is of the Spirit of God, is yet in the natural birth dead, sunk in trespasses and sins, and in a state of wrath."
3. "But when the man is born again of the Spirit...then just as flesh generates flesh, so spirit generates spirit, after its own image...and since the Kingdom of God is a spiritual kingdom, such only who are so born can enter into it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "That which is begotten carries within itself the nature of that which begat it."

2. "The 'flesh' in the Scriptures is often used to denote the sinful propensities and passions of our nature, as those propensities are supposed to have their seat in the animal nature."
3. "Here we learn: 1. That all men are by nature sinful. 2. That none are renewed but by the Spirit of God. 3. That the effect of the new birth is to make men holy. 4. And, that no man can have evidence that he is born again who is not holy, and just in proportion as he becomes pure in his life will be the evidence that he is born of the Spirit."
