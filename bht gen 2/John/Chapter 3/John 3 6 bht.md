# John 3:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Man, by his natural birth, is carnal and corrupted, unable to discern spiritual things. Therefore, there is a necessity for him to be born again through the grace of the Spirit, becoming a spiritual man. This new birth, by the Spirit of God, enables a person to discern and judge all things of a spiritual nature and be fit to partake in spiritual ordinances and privileges. The contrast is clear between the mere flesh, which is void of the Spirit and even hostile towards it, and the spiritual nature that is heavenly, divine, and reflects its divine Author.
