# John 3:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By nature, human beings are sinful and separated from the kingdom of God. We are born of the flesh, lacking the spiritual nature needed for entry into the heavenly realm. Our understanding, reason, and affections are corrupted and wicked, influenced by our carnal nature. However, there is hope. Through the new birth by the Spirit, we are transformed and given a spiritual nature, enabling us to discern and embrace the things of God. This contrast between the flesh and the Spirit emphasizes the need for a new birth and the divine origin of the spiritual life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The neuter denotes not only the universal application of this truth, but the very first beginnings of life in the embryo, before sex can be predicated."
2. "The Lord here answers Nicodemus's hypothetical question by telling him that even could it be so, it would not accomplish the birth of which He speaks."
3. "Such 'flesh and blood' cannot inherit the Kingdom of God. But when the man is born again of the Spirit, then just as flesh generates flesh, so spirit generates spirit, after its own image."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "That which is begotten carries within itself the nature of that which begat it."
2. "Not the mere material body, but all that comes into the world by birth, the entire man; yet not humanity simply, but in its corrupted, depraved condition, in complete subjection to the law of the fall."
3. "So that though a man 'could enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born,' he would be no nearer this 'new birth' than before."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "By 'that which is born of the flesh' he evidently intends man as he is by nature, in the circumstances of his natural birth."
2. "The 'flesh' in the Scriptures is often used to denote the sinful propensities and passions of our nature, as those propensities are supposed to have their seat in the animal nature."
3. "Here we learn: 1. That all men are by nature sinful. 2. That none are renewed but by the Spirit of God. 3. That the effect of the new birth is to make men holy. 4. And, that no man can have evidence that he is born again who is not holy, and just in proportion as he becomes pure in his life will be the evidence that he is born of the Spirit."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The aorist tense (3, 4, 5, 7), marks the fact of birth; the perfect (as here), the state of that which has been born."
2. "John uses the word sarx generally, to express humanity under the conditions of this life."
3. "Spirit and flesh are the distinguishing principles, the one of the heavenly, the other of the earthly economy."

### John Calvin:
1. "For he takes for granted, that we cannot enter into the kingdom of God unless we are spiritual. But we bring nothing from the womb but a carnal nature. Therefore it follows, that we are naturally banished from the kingdom of God, and, having been deprived of the heavenly life, remain under the yoke of death."
2. "Christ therefore declares that our understanding and reason is corrupted, because it is carnal, and that all the affections of the heart are wicked and reprobate, because they too are carnal."
3. "The reply is easy. The gifts which God hath left to us since the fall, if they are judged by themselves, are indeed worthy of praise; but as the contagion of wickedness is spread through every part, there will be found in us nothing that is pure and free from every defilement."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Thus the necessity of a new birth is enforced, and the ‘cannot’ of John 3:3 explained."
2. "The latter seems more likely, both from the context (where the contrast is between the natural and the spiritual birth) and from John’s usage elsewhere."
3. "To speak of this would be beside the point of the verse now before us, which teaches that the spiritual life of the kingdom of God can only come from the new spiritual principle."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "That which is born (το γεγεννημενον). Perfect passive articular participle."
2. "The sharp contrast between flesh (σαρξ) and Spirit (πνευμα), drawn already in John 1:13, serves to remind Nicodemus of the crudity of his question in John 3:4 about a second physical birth."

### John Gill:
1. "Man by his natural birth, and as he is born according to the flesh of his natural parents, is a mere natural man; that is, he is carnal and corrupt, and cannot discern spiritual things."
2. "By 'flesh' here, is not meant the fleshy part of man, the body, as generated of another fleshy substance; but by flesh is designed, the nature of man; not merely as weak and frail, but as unclean and corrupt, through sin."
3. "A man that is regenerated by the Spirit of God, and the efficacy of his grace, is a spiritual man; he can discern and judge all things of a spiritual nature; he is a fit person to be admitted to spiritual ordinances and privileges."

### John Wesley:
1. "That which is born of the flesh is flesh — Mere flesh, void of the Spirit, yea, at enmity with it."
2. "And that which is born of the Spirit is spirit - Is spiritual, heavenly, divine, like its Author."
