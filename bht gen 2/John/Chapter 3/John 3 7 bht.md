# John 3:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Being born again is a transformative process that brings about a profound inward change from sinfulness to holiness. This change is likened to the physical birth of a baby, where a great transformation occurs in the soul, just as the body undergoes a significant change when being born into the world. It is through this spiritual rebirth that one is able to experience a new life, shedding the old self and embracing a life of righteousness and godliness.

### John Calvin:
1. "Nicodemus reckoned that what he had heard about regeneration and a new life was incredible, because the manner of this regeneration exceeded his capacity."
2. "To prevent him from entertaining any scruple of this sort, Christ shows that even in the bodily life there is displayed an amazing power of God, the reason of which is concealed."
3. "If in this frail and transitory life God acts so powerfully that we are constrained to admire his power, what folly is it to attempt to measure by the perception of our own mind his secret work in the heavenly and supernatural life?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Nicodemus had no doubt shown by look or exclamation his astonishment at hearing such words, containing so strange a view of the kingdom of God and the conditions on which it could be entered."
2. "The use of ‘marvel’ in other passages would seem to show that in this Gospel the word indicates much more than amazement. It is certainly not the astonishment of admiration, but incredulous and sometimes angry surprise."

### John Gill:
1. "Nicodemus was quite astonished, at this doctrine of the new birth; it was altogether new to him, and unheard of by him; nor could he understand, nor conceive in what manner it could be."
2. "There is a necessity of the regeneration of those, who are the chosen of God, and the redeemed of the Lamb; and of them only can the words be understood; for as for others, they neither can, nor will, nor must be born again."
3. "The people of God 'must' [be born again] partly because it is the will of God; it is his purpose and resolution, that they shall be regenerated; he has chosen them, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto salvation by Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "To be born again, is to be inwardly changed from all sinfulness to all holiness."
2. "It is fitly so called, because as great a change then passes on the soul as passes on the body when it is born into the world."
