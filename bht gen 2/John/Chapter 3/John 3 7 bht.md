# John 3:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The doctrine of being born again left Nicodemus astonished and puzzled, as he struggled to grasp how such a transformation could take place. The necessity of this regeneration is not to be taken lightly; it is a profound inward change from sinfulness to holiness. This change is comparable to the transformative process of being born into the world, a drastic shift in both body and soul. The marvel of God's work in this spiritual rebirth extends beyond human understanding, urging us to embrace it with unwavering faith and admiration.

3. "When Christ says to Nicodemus that he ought not to wonder, we must not understand it in such a manner as if he intended that we should despise a work of God, which is so illustrious, and which is worthy of the highest admiration; but he means that we ought not to wonder with that kind of admiration which hinders our faith."
