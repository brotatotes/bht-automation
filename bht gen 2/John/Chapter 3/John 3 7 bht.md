# John 3:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The idea of being born again refers to a profound inward transformation that takes place within a person. It is not a physical rebirth, but a spiritual renewal that involves a complete change from a life of sinfulness to a life of holiness. This transformation is like the birth of a baby, where a significant change occurs in the body. Similarly, the new birth brings about a radical transformation in the individual, ushering them into a new spiritual existence.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Lord did not, could not, say this of Himself... on Him no second birth passed; when the Holy Spirit descended on Him at His baptism, the words spoken by the Father were indicative of past approval, not of renewal."
2. "His obedience was accepted as perfect, and the good pleasure of the Father rested on Him."
3. "The Î¼á½´ Î¸Î±Ï…Î¼Î¬Ïƒá¿ƒÏ‚ applies to the next verse, in which Nicodemus is told that he has things as wonderful around him every day in the natural world."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If a spiritual nature only can see and enter the kingdom of God if all we bring into the world with us be the reverse of spiritual; and if this spirituality be solely of the Holy Ghost, no wonder a new birth is indispensable."
2. "Ye mustâ€”'Ye, says Jesus, not we' [BENGEL]."
3. "After those universal propositions, about what 'a man' must be, to 'enter the kingdom of God'â€”this is remarkable, showing that our Lord meant to hold Himself forth as 'separate from sinners.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Marvel not - Wonder not."
2. "It is possible that Nicodemus in some way still expressed a doubt of the doctrine."
3. "Jesus took occasion in a very striking manner to illustrate it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Unto thee - ye must. Note the change from the singular to the plural pronoun."
2. "In his address to Nicodemus (thee) the Lord had spoken also to those whom Nicodemus represented, and whom he had included when he said 'we know' (ver. 2)."
3. "His error was the error of his class."

### John Calvin:
1. "Though its power be felt, we know not its source and cause."
2. "If in this frail and transitory life God acts so powerfully that we are constrained to admire his power, what folly is it to attempt to measure by the perception of our own mind his secret work in the heavenly and supernatural life, so as to believe no more than what we see?"
3. "We must not understand it in such a manner as if he intended that we should despise a work of God, which is so illustrious, and which is worthy of the highest admiration; but he means that we ought not to wonder with that kind of admiration which hinders our faith."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The use of â€˜marvelâ€™ in other passages would seem to show that in this Gospel the word indicates much more than amazement."
2. "It is certainly not the astonishment of admiration, but incredulous and sometimes angry surprise."
3. "Our Lordâ€™s teaching had set at nought the accepted teaching of Israel, thoughts and hopes to which Nicodemus had long and firmly clung, and his heart rebels."

### John Gill:
1. "Marvel not that I said unto thee,...., For Nicodemus was quite astonished, at this doctrine of the new birth; it was altogether new to him, and unheard of by him; nor could he understand, nor conceive in what manner it could be."
2. "There is a necessity of the regeneration of those, who are the chosen of God, and the redeemed of the Lamb; and of them only can the words be understood; for as for others, they neither can, nor will, nor must be born again."
3. "The people of God 'must' be born again; partly because it is the will of God; it is his purpose and resolution, that they shall be regenerated; he has chosen them, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto salvation by Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "To be born again, is to be inwardly changed from all sinfulness to all holiness."
2. "It is fitly so called because as great a change then passes on the soul as passes on the body when it is born into the world."
