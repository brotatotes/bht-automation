# John 3:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The wind bloweth freely, according to its own nature, not subject to human will, and yet its sound can be heard. In a similar way, the Spirit of God is a free agent in regeneration, working how, and where, and when it pleases. The evidence of this transformative work can be observed in the varied and profound changes in those who have been born again. While we may not fully comprehend or explain the specific manner in which the Spirit operates, the fact of the new birth and its effects remains undeniable.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He takes that one, which is above others symbolic of the action of the Spirit."
2. "The wind breatheth, &c.: so is, i.e. 'so it is with' every one born of the Spirit."
3. "The physiognomies of those who are born again, are as various as those of natural men."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The wind, breath, and spirit are constantly brought together in Scripture as analogous."
2. "The laws which govern the motion of the winds are even yet but partially discovered."
3. "The operation of the Holy Ghost in the new birth will probably ever be a mystery to us."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It might appear incomprehensible, but it was to be judged of by its effects."
2. "We see the changes produced. Men just now sinful become holy; the thoughtless become serious; the licentious become pure; the vicious, moral; the moral, religious; the prayerless, prayerful; the rebellious and obstinate, meek, and mild, and gentle."
3. "That there may be great variety in the modes of the operation of the Spirit. As the 'wind' sometimes sweeps with a tempest, and prostrates all before it, and sometimes breathes upon us in a mild evening zephyr, so it is with the operations of the Spirit."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The wind [Ï„Î¿ Ï€Î½ÎµÏ…Î¼Î±] . Some hold by the translation spirit, as Wyc., the spirit breatheth where it will... In Hebrew the words spirit and wind are identical."
2. "The usual rendering, wind, is confirmed here by the use of the kindred verb pnei, bloweth, and by fwnhn, sound, voice."
3. "The statement of Jesus is not meant to be scientifically precise, but is rather thrown into a poetic mold, akin to the familiar expression 'free as the wind.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "The wind bloweth where it pleaseth. Not that, strictly speaking, there is will in the blowing, but because the agitation is free, and uncertain, and variable; for the air is carried sometimes in one direction and sometimes in another."
2. "Christ means that the movement and operation of the Spirit of God is not less perceptible in the renewal of man than the motion of the air in this earthly and outward life, but that the manner of it is concealed."
3. "We are ungrateful and malicious, if we do not adore the inconceivable power of God in the heavenly life, of which we behold so striking an exhibition in this world."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The wind breatheth where it listeth, and thou hearest the voice thereof, but knowest not whence it cometh and whither it goeth." From the beginning the wind seems to have been the divinely-intended witness and emblem in the natural world of the Spirit of God. 
2. "Thou hearest its voice, it is present though invisible; thou feelest its power, for thou art in its course; but where the course begins, what produces the breath, whither the course is tending, what is the object of the breath,-thou knowest not."
3. "The wind breatheth where He will, and thou hearest His voice, but knowest not whence He cometh and whither He goeth; so is every one that hath been born of the Spirit." The chief comparison, however, is between the â€˜thouâ€™ of the first member and the â€˜every oneâ€™ of the second.

### John Gill:
1. "The Spirit of God is a free agent in regeneration; he works how, and where, and when he pleases."
2. "This grace of the Spirit in regeneration, like the wind, is powerful and irresistible; it carries all before it; there is no withstanding it."
3. "Regeneration by the Spirit of God, who is comparable to the wind, and whose name so signifies, need not be thought so marvellous and astonishing, though the natural man discerns it not, and cannot account for it."

### John Wesley:
1. "The wind bloweth â€” According to its own nature, not thy will, and thou hearest the sound thereof." 
2. "Thou art sure it doth blow, but canst not explain the particular manner of its acting." 
3. "So is every one that is born of the Spirit â€” The fact is plain, the manner of his operations inexplicable."
