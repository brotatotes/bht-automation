# John 3:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The wind bloweth freely, moving in its own way without our control, and we hear its sound, yet we cannot fully understand its method of action. Similarly, everyone who is born of the Spirit experiences the undeniable reality of God's work, but the way in which the Spirit operates remains mysterious and beyond our comprehension.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The wind breatheth, &c.: so is, i.e. 'so it is with' every one born of the Spirit."
2. "It is one of those sudden breezes springing up on a calm day, which has no apparent direction, but we hear it rustling in the leaves around."
3. "He describes the mystery of the spiritual life: we see its effects, in ourselves, and others who have it; but we cannot trace its beginnings, nor can we prescribe to the Holy Spirit His course."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Breath and spirit (one word both in Hebrew and Greek) are constantly brought together in Scripture as analogous."
2. "The laws which govern the motion of the winds are even yet but partially discovered."
3. "So of the operation of the Holy Ghost in the new birth."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It might appear incomprehensible, but it was to be judged of by its effects."
2. "Men just now sinful become holy; the thoughtless become serious; the licentious become pure; the vicious, moral; the moral, religious; the prayerless, prayerful; the rebellious and obstinate, meek, and mild, and gentle."
3. "Everyone that is born of the Spirit is, in some respects, like the effects of the wind. You see it not, you cannot discern its laws, but you see its effects."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In Hebrew the words spirit and wind are identical."
2. "The usual rendering, wind, is confirmed here by the use of the kindred verb pnei, bloweth, and by fwnhn, sound, voice."
3. "The statement of Jesus is not meant to be scientifically precise, but is rather thrown into a poetic mold."

### John Calvin:
1. "The wind bloweth where it pleaseth. Not that, strictly speaking, there is will in the blowing, but because the agitation is free, and uncertain, and variable; for the air is carried sometimes in one direction and sometimes in another."
2. "So is every one that is born of the Spirit. Christ means that the movement and operation of the Spirit of God is not less perceptible in the renewal of man than the motion of the air in this earthly and outward life, but that the manner of it is concealed."
3. "We are ungrateful and malicious, if we do not adore the inconceivable power of God in the heavenly life, of which we behold so striking an exhibition in this world, and if we ascribe to him less in restoring the salvation of our soul than in upholding the bodily frame."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Nature itself may teach him. In nature there is an agent whose working is experienced and acknowledged by all, while at the same time it is full of mystery; yet the mystery makes no man doubt the reality of the working."
2. "The choice of terms (  breatheth, listeth,  voice) shows that the wind is personified. It is perhaps of the gentle breeze rather than of the violent blast that the words speak...in the  breath of wind there is even more mystery than in the  blast."
3. "Thou hearest the sound of the wind, but canst not fix the limits of   this course, experiencing only that thou thyself art in that course: every one that hath been born of the Spirit knows that His influence is real, experiencing that influence in himself, but can trace His working no farther, knows not the beginning or the end of His course."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The word πνευμα occurs 370 times in the N.T. and never means wind elsewhere except in a quotation from the O.T." 
2. "So φωνη can be either sound (as of wind) or voice (as of the Spirit)." 
3. "Certainly the conclusion 'of the Spirit' is a direct reference to the Holy Spirit who works his own way beyond our comprehension even as men even yet do not know the law of the wind."

### John Gill:
1. "The Spirit of God is a free agent in regeneration; he works how, and where, and when he pleases."
2. "This grace of the Spirit in regeneration, like the wind, is powerful and irresistible; it carries all before it; there is no withstanding it."
3. "Regeneration by the Spirit of God, who is comparable to the wind... need not be thought so marvelous and astonishing, though the natural man discerns it not, and cannot account for it."

### John Wesley:
1. "The wind bloweth — According to its own nature, not thy will, and thou hearest the sound thereof - Thou art sure it doth blow, but canst not explain the particular manner of its acting."
2. "So is every one that is born of the Spirit — The fact is plain, the manner of his operations inexplicable."
