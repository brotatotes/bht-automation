# John 3:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The wind blows freely and uncontrollably, and we can hear its sound without being able to see it. Similarly, the Spirit of God works in the regeneration of individuals according to His own nature and will. We may be certain of its effect, yet unable to fully comprehend the specific manner in which it operates. Every person born of the Spirit is a testament to the undeniable reality of this divine work, even though its workings remain mysterious and beyond our complete understanding.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Notice it is not ὁ ἄνεμος here, but  τὸ πνεῦμα , the gentle breath of the wind; and it is heard, not felt; a case in which the  οὐκ οἶδας κ . τ . λ . is more applicable than in that of a violent wind steadily blowing."
2. "The  ὅπου θέλει  ,  in the application , implies the  freedom ( 2Co 3:17 ) and  unrestrained working of the Spirit ( 1Co 12:11 )."
3. "This saying of the Lord in contradiction to all so-called Methodism, which prescribes the time and manner of the working of the Spirit assures us of the manifold and undefinable variety of both these."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The wind, c.—Breath and spirit (one word both in Hebrew and Greek) are constantly brought together in Scripture as analogous."
2. "The laws which govern the motion of the winds are even yet but partially discovered but the risings, failings, and change in direction many times in a day, of those gentle breezes here referred to, will probably ever be a mystery to us."
3. "So of the operation of the Holy Ghost in the new birth."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It might appear incomprehensible, but it was to be judged of by its effects."
2. "When we see such changes, we ought no more to doubt that they are produced by some cause - by some mighty agent, than when we see the trees moved, or the waters of the ocean piled on heaps, or feel the cooling effects of a summer’s breeze."
3. "Everyone that is born of the Spirit is, in some respects, like the effects of the wind. You see it not, you cannot discern its laws, but you see its effects.”

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The wind [το πνευμα]...In Hebrew the words spirit and wind are identical." 
2. "The usual rendering, wind, is confirmed here by the use of the kindred verb pnei, bloweth, and by fwnhn, sound, voice."
3. "The statement of Jesus is not meant to be scientifically precise, but is rather thrown into a poetic mold, akin to the familiar expression 'free as the wind.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "The wind bloweth where it pleaseth. Not that, strictly speaking, there is will in the blowing, but because the agitation is free, and uncertain, and variable; for the air is carried sometimes in one direction and sometimes in another."
2. "Christ means that the movement and operation of the Spirit of God is not less perceptible in the renewal of man than the motion of the air in this earthly and outward life, but that the manner of it is concealed."
3. "We are ungrateful and malicious, if we do not adore the inconceivable power of God in the heavenly life, of which we behold so striking an exhibition in this world, and if we ascribe to him less in restoring the salvation of our soul than in upholding the bodily frame."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Nature itself may teach him. In nature there is an agent whose working is experienced and acknowledged by all, while at the same time it is full of mystery; yet the mystery makes no man doubt the reality of the working."
2. "The choice of terms (breatheth, listeth, voice) shows that the wind is personified. It is perhaps of the gentle breeze rather than of the violent blast that the words speak. Thou hearest its voice, it is present though invisible; thou feelest its power, for thou art in its course; but where the course begins, what produces the breath, whither the course is tending, what is the object of the breath,-thou knowest not."
3. "The birth itself belongs to a region beyond the outward and the sensible, just as none can tell whence the breath of wind has come."

### John Gill:
1. "The Spirit of God is a free agent in regeneration; he works how, and where, and when he pleases."
2. "This grace of the Spirit in regeneration, like the wind, is powerful and irresistible; it carries all before it."
3. "Regeneration by the Spirit of God, who is comparable to the wind, and whose name so signifies, need not be thought so marvellous and astonishing, though the natural man discerns it not, and cannot account for it."

### John Wesley:
1. "The wind bloweth — According to its own nature, not thy will, and thou hearest the sound thereof."
2. "Thou art sure it doth blow, but canst not explain the particular manner of its acting."
3. "So is every one that is born of the Spirit — The fact is plain, the manner of his operations inexplicable."
