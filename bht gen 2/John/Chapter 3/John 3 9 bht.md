# John 3:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Nicodemus, in his unbelief, remained ignorant and unable to grasp the truth of the new birth from above. His preoccupation and unwillingness to empty his mind hindered him from understanding the profound concept Jesus was presenting. Despite his initial astonishment yielding to some understanding, Nicodemus still struggled with comprehending how all these things could possibly be.
