# John 3:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The tone of this answer is very different from that of John 3:4, as Nicodemus's initial skepticism gives way to a deeper understanding. He now recognizes that Jesus is speaking of a new spiritual birth, distinct from the natural birth he had previously believed to be sufficient for entering the kingdom of the Messiah. However, the victory over unbelief is not yet complete, for Nicodemus still finds the concept of being born again impossible to fully comprehend.
