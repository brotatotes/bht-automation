# John 3:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Nicodemus, though now a disciple, still struggles with unbelief. His question reveals his difficulty in comprehending the truth. Jesus, in responding, emphasizes that it is not for Nicodemus to understand how these things occur, but rather to accept them by faith. Nicodemus slowly grasps the concept of the new birth, recognizing that it is distinct from physical birth, thanks to the words of Jesus. Yet, there is still a lingering element of unbelief that remains. Despite Christ's explanation, the concept of being born again seems impossible and impracticable to Nicodemus.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "From this moment Nicodemus says nothing more, but has sunk unto a disciple who has found his true teacher."
2. "Therefore the Saviour now graciously advances in His communications of truth, and once more solemnly brings to the mind of this teacher in Israel, now become a learner, his own not guiltless ignorance, that He may then proceed to utter, out of the fulness of His divine knowledge, such farther testimonies both of earthly and heavenly things as his docile scholar may to his own profit receive."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "And we have here an instance of a man of rank stumbling at one of the plainest doctrines of religion, and unwilling to admit a truth because he could not understand 'how' it could be..."
2. "No small part of people's difficulties are because they cannot understand how or why a thing is."

4. "This is one reason why such men, particularly, so often reject the truths of the gospel."
5. "If it renews my heart, humbles my pride, subdues my sin, and comforts my soul, it is a matter of little importance how it does all this."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "Every thing that he hears appears monstrous, because he does not understand the manner of it."

3. "We reject with diabolical pride every thing that is not explained to our reason; as if it were proper to limit the infinite power of God to our poor capacity."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The tone of this answer is very different from that of John 3:4. Here, as there, the question is, How can …? But there the added words show that the meaning is, ‘It is impossible’(comp. Luke 1:18); whereas in this verse the chief stress lies on the first word ‘How’(comp. Luke 1:34)."
2. "The offended astonishment of Nicodemus (John 3:7) has yielded to the words of Jesus. He now understands that Jesus really means that there is such a thing as a new spiritual birth, in contrast with that natural birth which had ever seemed to him the only necessary condition of entrance into the kingdom of Messiah."
3. "Still, as John 3:12 shows, the victory over unbelief is not yet complete."

1. "Remaining still as ignorant as ever, though Christ had explained..."
2. "...a being 'born of water and of the Spirit', or of the grace of the Spirit of God; and had illustrated this by the free, powerful, and invisible blowing of the wind"
3. "seemed as impossible, and as impracticable as ever"
