## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "An inference may be drawn from this, that our Lord knew the anger of the Pharisees to be more directed against Him than against the Baptist, probably on account of what had passed in Jerusalem." 
2. "ὃτι Ἰησοῦς, not ὅτι αὐτὸς... because the report which the Pharisees had heard is given verbatim: the ὅτι is ‘recitantis’ merely."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "the Lord knew—not by report, but in the sense of :-, for which reason He is here styled 'the Lord.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "How the Pharisees had heard - The Pharisees, here, seem to denote either the members of the Sanhedrin or those who were in authority."
2. "They claimed the authority to regulate the rites and ceremonies of religion, and hence they supposed they had a right to inquire into the conduct of both John and our Lord."
3. "As they were displeased with John, so they were with Jesus, who was doing the same thing on a larger scale - not only making disciples, but baptizing also without their authority, and drawing away the people after him."

### Marvin Vincent:

3. "Both verbs are in the present tense. The narrator puts himself at the scene of the story: is making and baptizing."

### John Calvin:

1. "In the narrative portion of John we have usually ο Ιησους, but ο Κυριος in five passages (John 4:1; John 6:23; John 11:2; John 20:20; John 21:12). There is no reason why John should not apply ο Κυριος to Jesus in the narrative sections as well as Luke."
