If the woman had understood the magnitude and importance of the gift that Jesus, the Son of God, could offer her, she would have eagerly asked Him for it. This gift is not only a favor from God, but it is also the gift of God Himself. It is like a fresh and perennial stream, symbolizing the gift of the Holy Spirit, which brings new life and joy to the thirsty soul. This living water, the Spirit and its fruits, is a remarkable and indispensable gift from God.
