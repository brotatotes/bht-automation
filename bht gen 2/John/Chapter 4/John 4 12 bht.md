# John 4:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The woman, in her limited understanding, questioned whether Jesus was greater or wiser than their forefather Jacob, who had drunk from the well. However, her comparison was flawed, for she failed to recognize the spiritual significance of Jesus' words. Just as the Samaritans mistakenly claimed descent from Jacob, many today misunderstand the true nature of Christ's teachings. Let us not make the same mistake, but honor the gifts of God in others while acknowledging that God Himself remains preeminent above all.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Art thou greater, c.—already perceiving in this Stranger a claim to some mysterious greatness." 
2. "our father Jacob—for when it went well with the Jews, they claimed kindred with them, as being descended from Joseph but when misfortunes befell the Jews, they disowned all connection with them."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Art thou greater? - Art thou wiser, or better able to find water, than Jacob was? It seems that she supposed that he meant that he could direct her to some living spring, or to some better well in that region, and that this implied more knowledge or skill than Jacob had."
2. "This shows how ready sinners are to misunderstand the words of Christ, and to pervert the doctrines of religion. If she had had any proper anxiety about her soul, she would at least have 'suspected' that he meant to direct her thoughts to spiritual objects."
3. "And drank thereof ... - This was added in commendation of the water of the well. A well from which Jacob, and his sons, and cattle had drank must be pure, and wholesome, and honored, and quite as valuable as any that Jesus could furnish."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Art thou greater [μη συ μειζων]. The interrogative particle indicates that a negative answer is expected: Surely thou art not."
2. "The su, thou, first in the sentence, is emphatic, and possibly with a shade of contempt."
3. "Cattle [θρεμματα]. Only here in the New Testament. From [τρεφω] to nourish. A general term for whatever is fed or nursed. When used of animals - mostly of tame ones - cattle, sheep, etc. It is applied to children, fowls, insects, and fish, also to domestic slaves, which, according to some, is the meaning here; but, as Meyer justly remarks, 'there was no need specially to name the servants; the mention of the herds completes the picture of their nomadic progenitor.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "How faulty this comparison is, appears plainly enough from this consideration, that she compares the servant to the master, and a dead man to the living God; and yet how many in the present day fall into this very error?"
2. "The more cautious ought we to be not to extol the persons of men so as to obscure the glory of God."
3. "We ought, indeed, to acknowledge with reverence the gifts of God, wherever they appear. It is, therefore, proper that we should honor men who are eminent in piety, or endued with other uncommon gifts; but it ought to be in such a manner that God may always remain eminent above all."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The feeling may have been tinged with superstition, but it was honorable in itself."
2. "The first part of her answer showed how limited the range of the woman’s thoughts still was: in the words of this verse we see her dawning conviction of the Stranger’s greatness, and the impression made upon her by His manner and His words."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Art thou (Μη συ ε). Expecting a negative answer."
2. "Greater than our father Jacob (μειζων ε του πατρος ημων Ιακωβ). Ablative case πατρος after the comparative adjective μειζων (positive μεγας). The Samaritans claimed descent from Jacob through Joseph (tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh)."
3. "Cattle (θρεμματα). Old word from τρεφω, to nourish, nursling, child, flock, cattle. Only here in N.T."

### John Gill:
1. "A person of greater worth and character than he, who was content to drink of this water; or wiser and more knowing than he, who could find out no better fountain of water in all these parts?"
2. "And so to this day, they draw their genealogy from Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and particularly call Joseph their father, and say, from whence are we, but from the tribe of Joseph the just."
3. "Which shows both the goodness and plenty of the water: though our Lord had spoken of living water, this woman understood him of no other water, but spring water; called living water, from its motion, because it is continually springing up, bubbling, and ever running."

### John Wesley:
1. "Our father Jacob — So they fancied he was; whereas they were, in truth, a mixture of many nations, placed there by the king of Assyria, in the room of the Israelites whom he had carried away captive, 2 Kings 17:24."
2. "Who gave us the well — In Joseph their supposed forefather: and drank thereof - So even he had no better water than this."
