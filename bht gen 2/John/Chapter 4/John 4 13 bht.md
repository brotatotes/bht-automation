# John 4:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus gently responded to the woman, patiently explaining the superiority of the living water He offered compared to the water from the well. While the water from the well could momentarily quench thirst, it was temporary and would not satisfy permanently. As the woman herself knew, and Jesus later demonstrated when He drank water, the physical thirst would return. The living water Jesus spoke of, on the other hand, would provide a lasting source of refreshment, far surpassing the temporary relief of physical water.

### John Calvin:
1. "He distinguishes between the use of the two kinds of water; that the one serves the body, and only for a time, while the power of the other gives perpetual vigor to the soul."
2. "For, as the body is liable to decay, so the aids by which it is supported must be frail and transitory. That which quickens the soul cannot but be eternal."

### John Gill:
1. "Jesus answered and said unto her.... In a mild and gentle manner, patiently bearing all her scoffs and flouts, and continuing to instruct and inform her, concerning this living water, showing the preferableness of it to all others."
2. "Whosoever drinketh of this water;...shall thirst again; as this woman had often done, and would again, as she herself knew, John 4:15, and as Jesus did, who very likely afterwards drank of it, John 19:28. For though water allays heat, quenches thirst, and refreshes and revives the spirits for a while, yet in process of time, natural heat increases, and thirst returns, and there is a necessity of drinking water again."
