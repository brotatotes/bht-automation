## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "The soul by nature is like such a desert, or like a traveler wandering through such a desert. It is thirsting for happiness, and seeking it everywhere, and finds it not."
2. "He who drinks this will not wish to seek for happiness in other objects. 'Satisfied' with the grace of Christ, he will not desire the pleasures and amusements of this world."
3. "So religion always lives; and, amid all changes of external circumstances - in heat and cold, hunger and thirst, prosperity and adversity, life, persecution, contempt, or death - it still lives on, and refreshes and cheers the soul."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The reception of the divine life by a believer does not do away with all further desire. On the contrary, it generates new desires."
2. "The drinking of the living water is put as a single act, in order to indicate the divine principle of life as containing in itself alone the satisfaction of all holy desires as they successively arise."
3. "Thirst is to be taken in the same sense in both clauses, as referring to that natural craving which the world cannot satisfy, and which is therefore ever restless."

### John Gill:
1. "Whoever truly partakes [of the Spirit and his grace], shall never thirst; either after sinful lusts and pleasures, and his former vicious way of living, which he now disrelishes."
2. "They shall never thirst, so as to be like the thirsty and parched earth, dried up, and have no moisture in them; for however this may seem sometimes to be their case, God will, and does, pour out water and floods upon them."
3. "The grace of God given at conversion is exceeding abundant, it superabounds all the aboundings of sin; it comes in large flows into the hearts of regenerate persons, and flows out of them, as rivers of living water."

### John Wesley:
1. "Will never thirst â€” Will never (provided he continue to drink thereof) be miserable, dissatisfied, without refreshment."
2. "But the water that I shall give him â€” The spirit of faith working by love, shall become in him - An inward living principle, a fountain."
