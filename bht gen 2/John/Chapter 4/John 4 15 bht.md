# John 4:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This woman, eager to comprehend the mysterious words of the Stranger, desires to obtain the kind of water that would quench her thirst forever. She longs for this gift so that she no longer needs to go to the well for water. Although she may not fully comprehend the nature of the gift, her request reveals her genuine desire to receive it.
