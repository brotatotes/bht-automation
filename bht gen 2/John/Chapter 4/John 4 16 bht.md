# John 4:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus addresses the woman in a way that catches her attention and shows her that he is not an ordinary person. He wants to engage her in a conversation that will make her realize that he knows her past and current life. By doing so, he aims to bring her to a place where she recognizes her sin and its consequences, ultimately leading her to understand her need for him and his grace. Jesus desires to offer her something far greater than the water she initially sought, and he does this by directly addressing her most significant sin.
