# John 4:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This woman's whole life of sin, which she in vain endeavors to cover, is exposed as Jesus pierces her heart with His words, leading her to repentance. Though she initially speaks with a double sense of language, Jesus sees through her deceit and reads her heart, fully knowing the truth of her life. He accepts her confession of guilt, emphasizing the significance of her statement by repeating her words in a different order. In his response, there is both weightiness and courtesy, as Jesus acknowledges the truthfulness of her words.
