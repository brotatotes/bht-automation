# John 4:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The woman in question had been married five times, whether each husband was deceased or if they had been divorced, it is unclear. The fact remained that these marriages were legal. However, the man she was currently with was not her lawful husband - they were not married. This revelation about her current relationship was made known to her by Jesus, who detected the hidden falsehood of her situation. Despite her past mistakes and the questionable nature of her current relationship, it is important to note that her heart was not hardened.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The conviction of sin here lies beneath the surface: it is not pressed, nor at the moment does it seem to have worked deeply, for she goes on with the conversation with apparent indifference to it."
2. "These five were certainly lawful husbands; they are distinguished from the sixth, who was not; probably the woman had been separated from some by divorce, from some by death, or perhaps by other reasons more or less discreditable to her character."
3. "The Lord, by His divine knowledge, detects the hidden falsehood of it. Notice it is ἀληθές, not ἀληθῶς: this one word was true."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Who have either died; or who, on account of your improper conduct, have divorced you; or whom you have left improperly, without legal divorce. Either of these might have been the case."
2. "You are not lawfully married to him. Either she might have left a former husband without divorce, and thus her marriage with this man was unlawful or she was living with him without the form of marriage, in open guilt."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The ‘five’ were no doubt lawful husbands, from whom she had been separated either by death or by divorce."
2. "In contrast with the lawful marriages is set the present unlawful union with one who was no husband."
3. "Whatever may have led her to an evil life, it is plain that her heart was not yet hardened."

### John Gill:
1. "Which she either had had lawfully, and had buried one after another; and which was no crime, and might be."
2. "Or rather, she had had so many, and had been divorced from everyone of them, for adultery; for no other cause it should seem did the Samaritans divorce."
3. "And he whom thou now hast, is not thy husband; that is, not thy lawful husband, as the Persic version reads, and Nonnus paraphrases; being not married to him at all, though they cohabited as man and wife, when there was no such relation between them."

### John Wesley:
1. "Whether they were all dead or not, her own conscience now awakened would tell her."
2. "Thou hast had five husbands."
3. "Her own conscience now awakened would tell her."
