# John 4:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Though Jesus had the power to baptize, he chose not to do so himself. Instead, he delegated this task to his disciples and servants. This decision highlights the distinct roles and responsibilities that Jesus had. While others were appointed to perform water baptism, Jesus focused on his higher calling of administering the baptism of the Spirit. Furthermore, by abstaining from water baptism, Jesus prevented any potential divisions among his followers, ensuring unity among them. His actions illustrate the importance of recognizing the significance of baptism and viewing it as a divine act, regardless of the person who carries it out.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Probably for the same reason that Paul did not baptize usually (1Co 1:14-16); viz. because His office was to preach and teach; and the disciples as yet had no office of this kind."
2. "To assume a further reason, e.g. that there might not be ground for those whom the Lord himself had baptized to boast of it, is arbitrary and unnecessary."
3. "Johannes, minister, sua manu baptizavit; discipuli ejus, ut videtur, neminem. At Christus baptizat Spiritu Sancto."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
2. "Jesus baptized not—John being a servant baptized with his own hand; Christ as the Master, 'baptizing with the Holy Ghost,' administered the outward symbol only through His disciples."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The reason why Jesus did not baptize was probably because, if He had baptized, it might have made unhappy divisions among his followers."
2. "Those might have considered themselves most worthy or honored who had been baptized by Him."

### John Calvin:
1. "He gives the designation of Christ’s Baptism to that which he conferred by the hands of others, in order to inform us that Baptism ought not to be estimated by the person of the minister, but that its power depends entirely on its Author, in whose name, and by whose authority, it is conferred."
2. "Hence we derive a remarkable consolation, when we know that our baptism has no less efficacy to wash and renew us, than if it had been given by the hand of the Son of God."
3. "In short, not only does Christ baptize inwardly by his Spirit, but the very symbol which we receive from a mortal man ought to be viewed by us in the same light as if Christ himself displayed his hand from heaven, and stretched it out to us."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Imperfect tense means that it was not the habit of Jesus."
2. "This is the last mention of baptism under the direction of Jesus till the Great Commission."
3. "It is possible that Jesus stopped the baptizing because of the excitement and the issue raised about his Messianic claims till after his resurrection when he enjoined it upon his disciples as a rite of public enlistment in his service."

### John Gill:
1. "The king did not baptize in water, but left that for his disciples and servants to do; he had other and greater work to perform." 
2. "He had another sort of baptism, of a more excellent nature to administer, namely, the baptism of the Spirit."
