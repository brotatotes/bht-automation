# John 4:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The woman's question about the proper place of worship was not a trivial matter but a matter of life and death to her. The Jews asserted the exclusive claim that true worship must take place only in Jerusalem, while the Samaritans held that Mount Gerizim was the sacred mountain for worship. The woman's inquiry shows her sincere desire for clarity and guidance from Jesus, as she recognized that the dispute between the two places went beyond a mere historical or cultural disagreement and had spiritual implications.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Mount Gerizim, on which once stood the national temple of the Samaritan race."
2. "The Samaritans still used it as a place of prayer and sacrifice, and to this day the few Samaritans resident in Nablus (Sychem) call it the holy mountain, and turn their faces to it in prayer."
3. "She pauses, having suggested, rather than asked, a question, seeming to imply, ‘Before I can receive this gift of God, it must be decided, where I can acceptably pray for it;’ and she leaves it for Him whom she now recognizes as a prophet, to resolve this doubt."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "On this account, as well as because the patriarchs are mentioned as having worshipped in Shechem, they supposed that that was the proper place on which to erect the temple."
2. "In building this, David and Solomon were under the divine direction."
3. "Accordingly, our Saviour decided in favor of the Jews, yet in such a manner as to show the woman that the question was of much less consequence than they supposed it to be."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "This mountain. Gerizim, at the foot of which lies the well. Here, according to the Samaritan tradition, Abraham sacrificed Isaac, and met Melchisedek."
2. "By some convulsion of nature, the central range of mountains running north and south, was cleft open to its base at right angles to its own line of extension, and the deep fissure thus made is the vale of Nablus."
3. "The summit is a small level plateau. In the midst of the southern end is a sloping rock, said by the Samaritans to be the site of the altar of their temple, and on approaching which they remove their shoes."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is well known that there was a constant dispute between the Jews and the Samaritans about the true rule of worshipping God. ... Our fathers worshipped in this mountain."
2. "We ought to observe in how many ways the world commonly sins in this respect. ... we subject the balance to those things which ought to be weighed by it; and, in short, where so much importance is attached to the imitation of the Fathers, the world thinks that there can be no danger in sinning after their example."
3. "To this ignorance ought to be ascribed that huge mass of ceremonies by which the Church has been buried under Popery. ... Now, since the coming of Christ, matters are entirely changed. We ought, therefore, to consider what he enjoins on us under the Gospel, that we may not follow at random what the Fathers observed under the Law."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Her question was not prompted by mere curiosity or an interest in the settlement of an ancient controversy. It was a question of life and death to her."
2. "The claim of the Jews was exclusive. Not only 'ought' men to worship in Jerusalem, but that was the place where men must worship, the only true holy place."
3. "That her national pride had not stifled every hesitation on such a point as this plainly attests her earnestness: it is no ordinary candour that can look on the supremacy of Gerizim or Jerusalem as an open question."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Samaritans held that Abraham offered up Isaac on Gerizim. The Samaritans kept up this worship on this mountain and a handful do it still."
2. "Ye Jews. Ought to worship (προσκυνειν δε). 'Must worship,' as of necessity (δε)."
3. "Προσκυνεω in John is always worship, not just respect."

### John Gill:
1. "By the 'fathers', this woman claims as theirs, are meant, not the immediate ancestors of the Samaritans, or those only of some few generations past; but the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, whose descendants they would be thought to be; and they improved every instance of their worshipping in these parts, in favour of this mountain, being a sacred place."
2. "The Jews pleaded... that God had chosen [Jerusalem] to put his name, and fix his worship there; and had ordered them to come thither, and bring their offerings and sacrifices, and to keep their passover and other feasts."
3. "And since, now there were so many things to be said on each side of the question, this woman desires, that seeing Christ was a prophet, he would be pleased to give her his sense of the matter, and inform her which was the right place of worship."

### John Wesley:
1. "This mountain - Pointing to Mount Gerizim. Sanballat, by the permission of Alexander the Great, had built a temple upon Mount Gerizim, for Manasseh, who for marrying Sanballat's daughter had been expelled from the priesthood and from Jerusalem."
2. "Our fathers worshipped - This plainly refers to Abraham and Jacob (from whom the Samaritans pretended to deduce their genealogy) who erected altars in this place: Genesis 12:6,7, and Genesis 33:18,20. And possibly to the whole congregation, who were directed when they came into the land of Canaan to put the blessing upon Mount Gerizim, Deuteronomy 11:29."
3. "Ye Jews say, In Jerusalem is the place - Namely, the temple."
