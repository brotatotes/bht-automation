# John 4:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believe me, the hour is coming when true worship will not be limited to a specific place, whether this mountain or Jerusalem. Our Lord's statement signifies a new era, where worship will transcend physical locations and will be accessible to all, both Samaritans and Jews. This revelation to the Samaritan woman, a person outside of the Jewish faith, emphasizes the universality of true worship.
