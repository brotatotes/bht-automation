# John 4:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Samaritans were in the dark about what they truly worshipped, while the Jews had the full revelation of God. The Samaritans rejected the prophets and the Psalms, limiting their understanding of God. Salvation is promised to the Jews, as the messiah will come from them, shedding light on the misconception that this gospel is hostile towards the Jewish people. The promises of salvation were made to the Jews before they were known to the Gentiles.
