# John 4:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The worshippers of the true God shall worship the Father, not only in specific places or at certain times, but at all times and in all places. These true worshippers are those who have a genuine and sincere relationship with God, offering their worship to the Father in a manner that is in spirit and truth. It is the Father who seeks such genuine worshippers, those who worship Him in the right way and with a true understanding of who He is.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The phrase 'in spirit and in truth' describes the two essential characteristics of true worship: in spirit, as distinguished from place or form or other sensual limitations; in truth, as distinguished from the false conceptions resulting from imperfect knowledge."
2. "True worship includes a spiritual sense of the object worshipped, and a spiritual communion with it; the manifestation of the moral consciousness in feelings, motions of the will, 'moods of elevation, excitements,' etc. It includes also a truthful conception of the object."
3. "For the Father also, on His part, seeketh such as those worshipping him: as His worshippers. Such: i.e., those who worship in spirit and in truth, and are therefore real worshippers of the real God."

### John Calvin:
1. "The worship of God is said to consist in the spirit, because it is nothing else than that inward faith of the heart which produces prayer, and, next, purity of conscience and self-denial, that we may be dedicated to obedience to God as holy sacrifices." 
2. "Now it is certain that nothing is more at variance with the order appointed by God than the gross and singularly carnal pomp which prevails in Popery."
3. "What it is to worship God in spirit and truth appears clearly from what has been already said. It is to lay aside the entanglements of ancient ceremonies, and to retain merely what is spiritual in the worship of God; for the truth of the worship of God consists in the spirit, and ceremonies are but a sort of appendage."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The worshippers denoted by it [the word 'true'] are not merely sincere, free from all falsehood and dishonesty; they offer a worship that deserves the name, that fully answers to the lofty, noble, pure idea that the word ‘worship’ brings before the mind." 
2. "The very name by which Jesus indicates the object of all worship, ‘the Father’... had prepared the way for the abolition of all limitations of place: the leaching is completed here, when man’s spirit is declared to be the ‘hallowed ground’ where he may approach his Father and his God."
3. "The Son appearing as the revealer of the Father, Himself the Truth, Himself giving to men the Holy Spirit who alone can hallow man’s spirit as the sanctuary of worship, all these are thoughts which cannot but press on us as we read this verse."
