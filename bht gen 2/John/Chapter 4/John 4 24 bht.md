God is a Spirit, devoid of any physical form or material substance. This highlights the divine nature of God, who is not limited by the constraints of the physical world.

### Henry Alford:
1. "God being pure spirit, cannot dwell in particular spots or temples, cannot require, nor be pleased with, earthly material offerings nor ceremonies, as such."

The non-corporeality of God is clearly stated and the personality of God also. All this is put in three words for the first time."
