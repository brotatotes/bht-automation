## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "How these matters may be, I cannot understand; they will be all made clear when the Christ shall come."
2. "The question of Joh 4:20 had not been answered to her liking or expectation: she therefore puts aside, as it were, what has been said, by a remark on that suspicion which was arising in her mind."
3. "It is not certain what expectations the Samaritans had regarding the Messiah. The view here advanced might be well derived from Deuteronomy 18:15; and the name, and much that belonged to it, might have been borrowed from the Jews originally."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If we take our Lord's immediate disclosure of Himself, in answer to this, as the proper key to its meaning to His ear, we can hardly doubt that the woman was already all but prepared for even this startling announcement."
2. "Thus quickly, under so matchless a Teacher, was she brought up from her sunken condition to a frame of mind and heart capable of the noblest revelations."
3. "An expectation founded probably on Luke 12:41."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Messias cometh - As the Samaritans acknowledged the five books of Moses, so they expected, also, the coming of the Messiah."
2. "Which is called Christ - These are probably the words of the evangelist, as it is not likely that the woman would explain the name on such an occasion."
3. "Will tell us all things - Jesus had decided the question proposed to him John 4:20 in favor of the Jews. The woman does not seem to have been satisfied with this answer, and said that the Messiah would tell them all about this question."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Samaritans also expected the Messiah, basing their hopes on such Scriptures as Genesis 3:15; Genesis 49:10; Numbers 24:17; Deuteronomy 18:15."
2. "The Samaritan idea was less worldly and political than the Jewish."
3. "He is come [εκεινος]. Emphatic; pointing to Messiah as contrasted with all other teachers."

### John Calvin:
1. "Now it is probable that, when the woman ascertained from Christ’s discourse that a very extraordinary change was about to take place in the Church of God, her mind instantly recurred to the recollection of Christ, under whom she hoped that all things would be fully restored."
2. "The woman declares that she expects such a Christ as will be the interpreter of his Father, and the teacher and instructor of all the godly."
3. "I wish that those who now boast of being the pillars of the Christian Church, would at least imitate this poor woman, so as to be satisfied with the simple doctrine of Christ, rather than claim I know not what power of superintendence for putting forth their inventions."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There is nothing surprising in her avowal that a Deliverer was looked for...this people had waited in expectation of ‘the Converter’ or ‘the Guide.’"
2. "Separated as the nations were, the famous name which the Jews universally applied to the Deliverer, for whose coming both peoples alike were waiting, would naturally be known far beyond the limits of Judea."
3. "If, however, the Samaritans expected less than the fuller revelation warranted, they at least escaped the prevalent Jewish error of looking for a Conqueror rather than a Prophet, for a temporal rather than a spiritual King."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Messiah cometh (Μεσσιας ερχετα). Hebrew word in N.T. only here and John 1:41 and explained by Χριστος in both places."
2. "The Samaritans looked for a Messiah, a prophet like Moses (Deuteronomy 18:18)."
3. "Wistfully she turns to this dim hope as a bare possibility about this strange 'prophet.' He will declare unto us all things."

### John Gill:
1. "The knowledge of the coming of the Messiah was not peculiar to this woman, but was common to all the Samaritans...They not only knew that there was a Messiah to come, and expected him, but that he was coming, just ready to come..."
2. "The Samaritans might conclude from his general character as a prophet, like unto Moses, to whom men were to hearken, Deuteronomy 18:15, and from a common prevailing notion among the Jews, that the times of the Messiah would be times of great knowledge..."
3. "The Messiah is come, who lay in the bosom of the Father, and has made known all things to his disciples, he hath heard of him he has declared him to them, his love, grace, and mercy. God has spoken all he has to say that appertains to his own worship, and the salvation of the children of men by his Son Jesus Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "With joy for what she had already learned"
2. "Desire of fuller instruction"
