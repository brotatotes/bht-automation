# John 4:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus compassionately reveals himself as the Messiah to the Samaritan woman, a person society deems unworthy. He withholds this revelation from the Jews, as they are focused on a temporal kingdom. This encounter exemplifies Christ's grace, as he openly proclaims his identity to someone whom others may view as insignificant. His purpose is not to force events to align with preconceived ideas but to meet each person where they are and vary his revelations based on individual dispositions.
