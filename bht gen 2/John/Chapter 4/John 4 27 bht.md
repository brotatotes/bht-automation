# John 4:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples were amazed that Jesus engaged in conversation with a woman, as it was considered scandalous for a respected man to do so. They were also surprised that he would converse with a Samaritan woman, as the Jews had animosity towards the Samaritans. However, despite their astonishment, none of them had the audacity to question Jesus or the woman about their interaction.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The position of μετὰ γυναικός before the verb throws an emphasis on the words, and makes it probable that the meaning is as above." 
2. "Either to the woman, 'What seekest thou?' and to the Lord, 'Why talkest thou with her?' or perhaps both questions to Him: and then we must suppose a mixture of two constructions..."
3. "I rather prefer the former interpretation."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "How poor, if not false, are many of our most plausible estimates!"
2. "No man said . . . What? . . . Why?—awed by the spectacle, and thinking there must be something under it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They wondered because the Jews had no contact with the Samaritans, and they were surprised that Jesus was engaged with her in conversation."
2. "They had such respect and reverence for him that they did not dare to ask him the reason of his conduct, or even to appear to reprove him."
3. "We should be confident that Jesus is right, even if we cannot fully understand all that he does."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The tense of each verb is different: the aorist, came, marking as in a single point of time the disciples' arrival, and the imperfect, they were wondering, marking something continued."
2. "They were surprised, not at his talking with that woman, but that their teacher should converse with any woman in public."
3. "The Rabbinical writings taught that it was beneath a man's dignity to converse with women... It was also held in these writings that a woman was incapable of profound religious instruction."

### John Calvin:
1. "For why do they not rather look at themselves? They would certainly have found no less reason to be astonished, that they who were men of no note, and almost the offscourings of the people, were raised to the highest rank of honor."
2. "And yet it is useful to observe what the Evangelist says — that they did not venture to put a question; for we are taught by their example that, if any thing in the works or words of God and of Christ be disagreeable to our feelings, we ought not to give ourselves a loose rein so as to have the boldness to murmur, but ought to preserve a modest silence, until what is hidden from us be revealed from heaven."
3. "The foundation of such modesty lies in the fear of God and in reverence for Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To talk with a woman in public was one of six things forbidden to a Rabbi."
2. "Their surprise, no doubt, found expression in these very questions (asked among themselves) which the Evangelist speaks of as not addressed to their Lord."
3. "Something in His look may have restrained them; or the eager wondering attitude of the one, and the solemn earnestness of the Other, proclaiming the willing hearer and the earnest Teacher, may have forbidden them to interrupt such intercourse."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They marvelled. Imperfect active describing the astonishment of the disciples as they watched Jesus talking with a woman." 
2. "It is not 'with the woman,' but simply 'with a woman.' There was a rabbinical precept: 'Let no one talk with a woman in the street, no, not with his own wife.' The disciples held Jesus to be a rabbi and felt that he was acting in a way beneath his dignity." 
3. "Yet no man said. John remembers through the years their amazement and also their reverence for Jesus and unwillingness to reflect upon him."

### John Gill:
1. "According to the Jewish canons, it was not judged decent, right, and proper, nor indeed lawful, to enter into a conversation, or hold any long discourse with a woman."
2. "Their astonishment was not merely at his talking with a woman, and with a Samaritan woman, but at what he said unto her, that he should so plainly tell her that he was the Messiah, when he so strictly charged them to tell no man."
3. "This shows the reverence the disciples had for Christ, and the great opinion they entertained of him, that whatever he did was well, and wisely done, though it might seem strange to them, and they could not account for it."

### John Wesley:
1. "The disciples marveled that he talked with a woman, which the Jewish rabbis reckoned scandalous for a man of distinction to do."
2. "They marveled likewise at his talking with a woman of that nation, which was so peculiarly hateful to the Jews."
3. "Yet none said, to the woman, 'What seekest thou?' - Or to Christ, 'Why talkest thou with her?'"
