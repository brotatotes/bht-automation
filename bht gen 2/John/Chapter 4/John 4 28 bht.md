# John 4:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In her excitement and embarrassment, the woman left her water pot behind. This act of leaving behind the smaller things demonstrates the profound impact that her encounter with Jesus had on her. The urgency and eagerness to share her newfound faith with others caused her to prioritize spreading the news of the Messiah over tending to her immediate needs. It serves as a powerful example of how encountering Christ can completely transform our priorities and compel us to boldly proclaim the good news to others.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
