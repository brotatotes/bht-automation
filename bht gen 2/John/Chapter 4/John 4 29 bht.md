# John 4:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Come and see a man who told me all things that ever I did. With this statement, the woman earnestly invites her fellow citizens to witness the extraordinary knowledge and insight of Jesus. She believes that He may be the Christ, the promised Messiah, based on His revelation of her own life. Though she poses her belief as a question, her intention is to provoke their curiosity and encourage them to personally engage with Jesus to discern His true identity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The form of the question (in the Greek) is a distant, modest way of only half insinuating what it seemed hardly fitting for her to affirm."
2. "She refers to what He said of Himself, but solely to His disclosure to her of the particulars of her own life."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Though she probably believed it, yet she proposed it modestly, lest she should appear to dictate in a case which was so important, and which demanded so much attention."
2. "The evidence on which she was satisfied that he was the Messiah was that he had told her all things that she had done - perhaps much more than is here recorded."
3. "The question which she submitted to them was whether this was not satisfactory proof that he was the Messiah."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Jesus' insight in the one case convinced her that He knew everything, and to her awakened conscience it seemed as though He had told everything."
2. "Is not this the Christ? Rather, as Rev., can this be. The particle suggests a negative answer."
3. "Surely this cannot be, yet with some hope."

### John Calvin:
1. "She endeavors, according to her feeble capacity, to bring her fellow-citizens to permit themselves to be taught by Christ."
2. "It was a very powerful stimulant which she employed to excite them when she knew, by a sign which was not obscure or doubtful, that he was a prophet."
3. "The woman, kindled by a holy zeal, does not spare herself or her reputation, to magnify the name of Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did." She fixes on the wonderful knowledge which the Stranger had displayed: what had impressed her must also convince them.
2. "Her own belief she expresses in the form of doubt, or problem to be solved; and every reader must feel how natural and wise was her procedure."
3. "To have declared herself convinced that the Stranger was the Christ would have done little towards persuading the men of her own village."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "All things that ever I did. Ha, not οσα (as many as), no 'ever' in the Greek. But a guilty conscience led her to exaggerate a bit." 
2. "Can this be the Christ? She is already convinced herself, but she puts the question in a hesitant form to avoid arousing opposition."
3. "With a woman's intuition she avoided ουκ and uses μητ. She does not take sides, but piques their curiosity."

### John Gill:
1. "An uncommon, an extraordinary man, a prophet."
2. "Come, go along with me, and see him and converse with him, and judge for yourselves, who, and what he is."
3. "Is not this the Christ? that was to come, has been promised and prophesied of, and we have expected, who is of quick understanding, and even God omniscient."

### John Wesley:
1. "A man who told me all things that ever I did — Our Lord had told her, but a few things. But his words awakened her conscience, which soon told her all the rest."
2. "Is not this the Christ? — She does not doubt of it herself, but incites them to make the inquiry."
