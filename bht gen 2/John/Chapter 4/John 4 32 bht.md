# John 4:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus declares, I have meat to eat that ye know not of, referring to the conversion of the Samaritan woman and others who were coming to him. This spiritual harvest of souls was a source of delight and refreshment for him. The disciples, unaware of this, were focused on physical sustenance and did not comprehend Jesus' spiritual fulfillment. His commitment to his mission was such that he had no desire for physical food, consumed as he was by the greater nourishment of souls coming to faith.
