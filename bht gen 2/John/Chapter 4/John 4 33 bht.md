# John 4:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples, like the woman of Samaria, were slow to understand the spiritual meaning behind Jesus' words. Their thoughts were consumed with bodily food, rather than spiritual nourishment. They even discussed amongst themselves if someone had brought Jesus something to eat while they were away. Their lack of comprehension revealed their dullness in understanding spiritual truths, similar to the Samaritan woman misunderstanding Jesus' teachings about living water.
