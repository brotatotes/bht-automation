# John 4:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers who faithfully labor in the work of God not only receive a tangible reward, but also find delight and satisfaction in their efforts. The fruit they gather is the conversion of sinners, which is a result of the Gospel ministry and the power of divine grace. This success is built upon the foundation laid by the prophets of the Old Testament and the work of Christ Himself. In the end, those who sow and those who reap will rejoice together in heaven, united in their service and the souls saved through their efforts.
