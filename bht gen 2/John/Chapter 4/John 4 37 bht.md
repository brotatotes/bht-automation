# John 4:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the spiritual realm, it is true that one may sow the word while another reaps the fruit. This proverb finds application in various situations, where one person may labor while another enjoys the results. The prophets sow the seeds of truth, and it is the apostles and their successors who reap the harvest. It is important to recognize that the work of sowing and reaping is interconnected and that each laborer plays a vital role in carrying forward the word of God.
