## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Here, as often, our Lord speaks of the office and its work as accomplished, which is but beginning."
2. "By 'ἄλλοι' here He cannot mean the O.T. Prophets, for then His own place would be altogether left out; and besides, all Scripture analogy is against the idea of the O.T. being the seed of which the N.T. is the fruit."
3. "The plural is I believe merely inserted as the correspondent word to ὑμεῖς in the explanation, as it was ἄλλος ἄλλος, in the proverb."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I, the Lord of the whole harvest: 'sent you,' points to their past appointment to the apostleship, though it has reference only to their future discharge of it."
2. "Ye bestowed no labour—meaning that much of their future success would arise from the preparation already made for them."
3. "Christ represents Himself as the Husbandman [rather the Lord of the laborers], who has the direction both of the sowing and of the harvest, who commissions all the agents—those of the Old Testament as well as of the New—and therefore does not stand on a level with either the sowers or the reapers."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The labor of both is equally necessary, and the labor of both would be useless if God did not give the increase."
2. "We should not be discouraged if we do not meet with immediate success."
3. "Every part of the work of the ministry and of teaching men is needful, and we should rejoice that we are permitted to bear any part, however humble, in bringing sinners to the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ."

### Marvin Vincent:

3. "The 'toil' that has made any harvest possible is that of His whole mission. All that was necessary that He might be able to say 'I am the Christ,' the self-renunciation and sorrow and pain of His atoning and redeeming work, virtually included in His one act of acceptance of that work, and present to His thought from the beginning, is involved in His 'toil.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
