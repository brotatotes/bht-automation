# John 4:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Many Samaritans in that city believed in him, acknowledging him as the true Messiah, based on the woman's testimony. Her account was so clear and genuine that they couldn't help but believe. It's remarkable how Jesus, being perceptive and discerning, was able to reveal the hidden aspects of people's lives. Her witness was strong and persuasive, causing many to put their faith in Jesus even before meeting him personally. Their response challenges us to also boldly share our testimonies and proclaim Christ to others.
