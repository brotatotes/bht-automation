# John 4:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Samaritans, despised and rejected by the Jews, unexpectedly embraced the divine discourses of Jesus upon hearing him themselves. Joyfully welcoming him, they desired to engage in conversation with him, disregarding his Jewish identity. Jesus, mindful of not discouraging them, granted their request without staying for too long, so as not to provoke the Jews. This encounter served as a remarkable testament to the power of Jesus' message and foreshadowed the future inclusion of the Gentile world into the Church.
