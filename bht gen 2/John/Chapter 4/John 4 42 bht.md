# John 4:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Now we believe, not because of the woman's testimony alone, but because we have heard his powerful teachings and have been strengthened in our faith by them. We acknowledge that this is truly the Christ, the genuine Messiah, and not a counterfeit. He is the Savior not only of the Jewish people, but of the entire world.

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "Here, the Samaritans distinguish between the more authoritative and dignified word of Jesus, and the talk of the woman. Rev., speaking."

3. "In faith, therefore, the first thing necessary is, to know that it is Christ who speaks by his ministers; and the next is, to give him the honor which is due; that is, not to doubt that he is true and faithful, so that, relying on so undoubted a guarantee, we may rely safely on his doctrine."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
