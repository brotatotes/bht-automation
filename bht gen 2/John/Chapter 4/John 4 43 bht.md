# John 4:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After staying in Sychar for two days, talking and sharing his teachings with the Samaritans and seeing many of them being converted, Jesus departs from that place and continues his journey. His next destination is the region of Galilee, but it is important to note that he does not go to Nazareth, where he was not honored. Instead, he chooses to visit other towns in Galilee, where his message may be better received and where he can continue his ministry.
