# John 4:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For Jesus himself testified...that a prophet hath no honour in his own country. These words, spoken by Jesus, explain why he went into Galilee instead of his own city, Nazareth. Jesus recognized that he would not receive honor or respect in Nazareth, as they had treated him with contempt in the past. Thus, he chose to go to Galilee, where he expected a more welcoming reception.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It stands as a preliminary explanation of the 'Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe;' and as indicating the contrast between the Samaritans, who believed on Him for His word, and His own countrymen, who only received Him because they had seen the miracles which He did at Jerusalem."
2. "The reason (Joh 4:1) why He left Judæa for Galilee was, because of the publicity which was gathering round Himself and his ministry."
3. "He betakes Himself to Galilee therefore, to avoid fame, testifying that His own country (Galilee) was that where, as a prophet, He was least likely to be honored."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For it seems strange, if 'His own country' here means Nazareth, which was in Galilee, that it should be said He came to Galilee because in one of its towns He expected no good reception."
2. "But all will be simple and natural if we fill up the statement thus: 'He went into the region of Galilee, but not, as might have been expected, to that part of it called "His own country," Nazareth.'"
3. "For He acted on the maxim which He oft repeated, that 'a prophet,'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jesus went to Galilee, but not to Nazareth, for he testified..."
2. "Jesus went to Galilee, 'although' he had said that a prophet had no honor in his own country..."
3. "...because he foreknew that the Galileans would many of them believe on him, he went at this time."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "For assigns the reason why Jesus went into Galilee."
2. "By His own country, Judaea seems to."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For Jesus himself testified." John's explanation of the conduct of Jesus by quoting a proverb often used by Jesus (Mark 6:4; Matthew 13:57; Luke 4:24 in reference to Nazareth), but not necessarily used by Jesus on this occasion.
2. "A prophet hath no honour in his own country." What is meant by πατριδ? In the Synoptics (Luke 4:24; Mark 6:4; Matthew 13:57) the reference is to Nazareth where he was twice rejected. But what has John in mind in quoting it here? He probably knew the quotations in the Synoptics.
3. "If he means Galilee, he immediately mentions the cordial welcome accorded Jesus there." But even so this is probably John's meaning for he is speaking of the motive of Jesus in going into Galilee where he had not yet laboured and where he apparently had no such fame as in Judea and now in Samaria.

### John Gill:
1. "For Jesus himself testified...that a prophet hath no honour in his own country." Matthew 13:57
2. "All the Oriental versions read, 'in his own city'; that is, Nazareth."
3. "These words must not be understood as a reason why Christ left Judea, and went into Galilee, because he had no honour in Judea...but are a reason why, when he came into Galilee, he did not go to Nazareth, his own city, where he was educated, and had been brought up...because they treated him with great disrespect and contempt." Matthew 13:57.

### John Wesley:
1.  Matthew 13:57.
