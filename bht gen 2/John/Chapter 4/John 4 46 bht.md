# John 4:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
There was a nobleman, possibly a courtier or a servant of the king, who was connected to the royal household. It is believed that he belonged to Herod Antipas, the tetrarch of Galilee, and was known as a great man. This nobleman's son was gravely ill in Capernaum, and his sickness continued without any sign of improvement. The significance of this miracle was enhanced by the fact that the nobleman was of high rank, which made the healing all the more remarkable and noteworthy.
