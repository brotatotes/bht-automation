# John 4:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus spoke these words with a tinge of reproof, for those who required signs and miracles to believe in Him. The Samaritans were able to believe without witnessing any miracles, yet the Galileans were seeking constant proof to strengthen their faith. Jesus longed for a deeper faith from His followers, and He hoped to cultivate it through His teachings and interactions. He wanted them to grasp that true belief went beyond mere signs and wonders.
