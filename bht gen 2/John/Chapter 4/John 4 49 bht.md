# John 4:49 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The nobleman displayed an earnestness that revealed the depth of his concern as a father. However, his faith was incomplete, and Jesus would use this encounter to refine it. The man was so desperate for his son's healing that he couldn't fathom it occurring without Jesus physically present. He did not grasp the extent of Jesus' power, doubting that He could raise the dead. Nevertheless, Jesus, through His response, was guiding the man towards a deeper understanding and a purer faith.
