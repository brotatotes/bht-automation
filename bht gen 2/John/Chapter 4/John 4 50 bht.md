# John 4:50 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The man was astonished by the kindness and condescension of Christ as he heard the words, Thy son liveth. Though the man had asked Jesus to come and heal his son, Jesus assured him that his son was already healed even before he spoke. The man believed the words of Jesus and left in peace, no longer troubled and distressed. His faith was strengthened by the power of Christ's words, both in healing his son and overcoming his unbelief.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The bringing out and strengthening of the man’s faith by these words was almost as great a spiritual miracle, as the material one which they indicated."
2. "Thus (as Trench observes, after Chrysostom) the weak faith of the nobleman is strengthened, while the humility of the centurion is honoured."

1. "The man believed the word." 
2. "The cure, shooting quicker than lightning from Cana to Capernaum, was felt by the dying youth."
3. "And the wave rolled from the head to the members of his household."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Go thy way - This was a kind and tender address. It was designed to convince him that he could word a miracle though not personally present."
2. "The man believed - The manner in which Jesus spoke it, and the assurance which he gave, convinced the man that he could heal him there as well as to go to Capernaum to do it. This is an instance of the power of Jesus to convince the mind, to soothe doubts, to confirm faith, and to meet our desires."
3. "God will hear our prayers and grant our requests, but often not in the precise manner in which we ask it. It is his to judge of the best way of doing us good."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "‘Thy son liveth’ does not mean, ‘is made to live now after thy second petition’; but, ‘even while the word is in thy mouth, or before it was so, thy son liveth.’"
2. "The meaning, in short, is not, I perform the cure at this instant; but rather, I have performed it, the work is done, thy son is recovered."
3. "He will not come to heal the child; there is no need that He should do so, the child is already whole."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Thy son is living," and will not now die, Jesus means.
2. Words too good and gracious to be true.
3. His son is healed without Jesus even going to Capernaum, "absent treatment" so to speak, but without the cure being absent.
4. Instantaneous faith, trusted the word.
5. "Started on his way," acted on his faith.

### John Gill:
1. "Return home in peace, be not over much troubled and distressed about this matter; leave it with me, I will take care of it; all will be well."
2. "Such power went along with the words of Christ, as not only cured the son at that distance, who lay at the point of death, but also the father of his unbelief."
