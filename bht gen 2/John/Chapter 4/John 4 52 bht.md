# John 4:52 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The story of this miraculous healing reminds us of Jesus' intimate knowledge and almighty power. The courtier's inquiry about the time of his son's recovery only serves to affirm the truth of the miracle. We also see the benevolence of Jesus, as he can be called upon at any time and will never fail us. It is important for us to closely examine the works of God, as this deepens our faith and understanding of his power.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "From this miracle we may learn...that Jesus has an intimate knowledge of all things."
2. "That Jesus has almighty power...Nothing else could have healed this child."
3. "We see the benevolence of Jesus...he may be called on at all times, and will never be called on in vain."

### John Calvin:
1. "That this courtier asked his servants at what time his son began to recover, was done by a secret impulse from God, that the truth of the miracle might be rendered more conspicuous."
2. "For by nature we have an exceedingly wicked disposition to extinguish the light of the power of God, and Satan labors, by various means, to hide the works of God from our view."
3. "In order that they may obtain from us that praise which is due to them, they must be made so manifest that no room is left for doubt."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "As the distance between Cana and Capernaum is not above five-and-twenty miles, it may seem strange that the officer should not have reached his home the same day."
2. "If the ‘seventh hour’ were reckoned from sunrise, the time of the cure would be a little later than noon; in that case it would be necessary to suppose that the servants were following the familiar Jewish reckoning of time, and regarding sunset as the commencement of a new day."
3. "The words ‘began to amend’ do not suggest any hesitation on the father’s part as to the completeness of the cure. He had believed the word ‘thy son liveth’ (John 4:50), and what he asks now is as to the hour at which his child had been stopped upon the road to death, and turned back upon that to full health and strength."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Began to mend (κομψοτερον εσχεν). Second aorist ingressive active indicative of εχω (took a turn, got better) and comparative of adverb κομψως." 
2. "Arrian (_Epictetus iii. 10.13) has κομψως εχεις from a physician, 'Thou hast it fine,' 'Thou art doing finely.' The papyri give several similar examples. Κομψως (neat) is from κομεω, to take care of." 
3. "At the seventh hour (ωραν εβδομην). The accusative case without a preposition as in Revelation 3:3, though we have περ ωραν ενατην (about the ninth hour) in Acts 10:3. See the accusative also in Exodus 9:18 ταυτην την ωραν αυριον (tomorrow about this hour)."

### John Gill:
1. "He did not at all hesitate about the truth of it, or was in any surprise upon it."
2. "He seemed to think, that his recovery might be gradual, and not all at once, as it was."
3. "The fever left him; entirely at once, so that he was perfectly well immediately."

### John Wesley:
1. "The more exactly the works of God are considered, the more faith is increased."
2. "He asked the hour when he amended."
3. "The more exactly the works of God are considered, the more faith is increased."
