This is the second miracle that Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee, coming out of Judea into Galilee. It is mentioned as the second miracle because Jesus had already performed many miracles in Jerusalem as well.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "By that (ch. Joh 2:11), His disciples had been convinced: by this, one (himself a type of the weak and unworthy in faith) outside the circle of His own. By both, half-belief was strengthened into faith in Him: but in each case it is of a different kind."
2. "It is an interesting question, whether or not this miracle be the same as the healing of the centurion’s servant (or son, Matt.?) in Matthew 8:5; Luke 7:1. Irenæus appears to hold the two narratives to be the same history."
3. "The inner kernel of the history is, in our case here, the elevation of a weak and mere wonder-seeking faith into a deep conviction of the personal power and love of our Lord; in the other, the commendation of a noble confession of our Lord’s divine power, indicating great strength and grasp of faith, and inducing the greatest personal humility."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There is thus by means of 'again' and 'second' a double statement as to the position of the miracle."
2. "The first of these points receives importance from the fact that the 'sign' now related was done after Jesus had left 'His own country,' rejected by 'His own' to be accepted by Galileans."
3. "It is not necessary to discuss the question whether this miracle is identical with that related in Matthew 8:5-13; Luke 7:2-10."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This again a second sign did Jesus having come out of Judea into Galilee."
2. "The first one was also in Cana, but many were wrought in Jerusalem also."

### John Gill:
1. "This [is] again the second miracle [that] Jesus did,.... That is, in that place, in Cana of Galilee."
2. "When he was come out of Judea into Galilee; this was the first he wrought, after his coming out of Judea into Galilee."
3. "This time, and was the second that he wrought in Cana of Galilee."
