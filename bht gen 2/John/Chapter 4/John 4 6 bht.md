# John 4:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, exhausted from his journey, sat down by the well, experiencing the weariness of a human body. He rested on the bare ground beside the well, finding respite from his fatigue. The time was around six in the evening, the scorching heat of noon, as Jesus sought not only physical refreshment, but also a divine encounter with a woman who would soon approach the well.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Robinson (iii. 112) can only solve the difficulty of the present well standing in a spot watered by so many natural fountains, by supposing that it may have been dug, according to the practice of the patriarchs, by Jacob, in connexion with the plot of ground which he brought, to have an independent supply of water."
2. "There is no authority for the meaning ἁπλῶς ὡς ἔτυχε, 'just as he was,' or 'just as it happened,' i.e. on the bare stone."
3. "The unusualness of a woman coming to draw water at mid-day is no argument against its possibility; indeed the very fact of her being alone seems to shew that it was not the common time."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In fact, this is perhaps the most human of all the scenes of our Lord's earthly history. We seem to be beside Him, overhearing all that is here recorded, nor could any painting of the scene on canvas, however perfect, do other than lower the conception which this exquisite narrative conveys to the devout and intelligent reader."
2. "But with all that is human, how much also of the divine have we here, both blended in one glorious manifestation of the majesty, grace, pity, patience with which 'the Lord' imparts light and life to this unlikeliest of strangers, standing midway between Jews and heathens."
3. "But what music is that which I hear from His lips, 'Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jacob’s well - This is not mentioned in the Old Testament... It is about 100 feet deep. It is cut through solid rock of limestone."
2. "The well is covered with a large stone, which has a hole in the center large enough to admit a man."
3. "Sat thus - Jesus was weary, and, being thus weary, sat down on the well... he sat down 'by' the well, or near it."


### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The traditional well still remains... with every claim to be considered the original well." 
2. "The well is deep."
3. "According to the Jewish reckoning, mid-day. According to the Roman mode, between 5 and 6 P.M."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The distinction between the natural spring and the artificial well is usually maintained with great care in the language of Scripture." 
2. "Turning off a little from the road, Jesus reached the well, and (now alone, because His disciples had gone into Sychar to buy provisions) wearied with a long day’s travel He ‘sat thus’ sat, wearied as He was ‘by the fountain,’ or on the low wall built round the well." 
3. "By ‘sixth hour,’ therefore, according to the usage of the ancients, we must understand either the hour between 5 and 6 A.M. or the hour between 5 and 6 P.M. On the whole, the latter seems more probable."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is really a cistern 100 feet deep dug by a stranger apparently in a land of abundant springs."
2. "John emphasizes the human emotions of Jesus."
3. "Sat  (εκαθεζετο). Imperfect (descriptive) middle of καθεζομα, 'was sitting.'"

### John Gill:
1. "Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey; having travelled on foot, from Judea thither; and he having a body like to ours, subject to weariness, and which proves the truth and reality of it, was greatly fatigued"
2. "sat thus on the well; or by it; by the side of it, upon the brink of it, as Nonnus paraphrases it, upon the bare ground"
3. "and it was about the sixth hour; about twelve o'clock at noon. The Ethiopic version adds by way of explanation, and 'it was then noon'"

### John Wesley:
1. "Jesus sat down — Weary as he was." 
2. "It was the sixth hour — Noon; the heat of the day."
