# John 4:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ takes the opportunity to speak with the woman while his disciples are away, likely to avoid any potential controversy or offense they may have taken at his conversation with her. Additionally, by choosing to speak privately with her, he prevents her from being embarrassed or shamed in front of the others. It is interesting to note that in some places, it is believed that eating the bread of the Samaritans is equivalent to eating flesh, but details about this belief are not provided.
