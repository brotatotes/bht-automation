# John 4:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The woman's straightforwardness is evident from her initial response. In regards to the Jews, they have no social interaction with the Samaritans, completely avoiding any form of relationship or friendship with them. This refusal to associate with Samaritans extends to rejecting any acts of kindness or assistance from them.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There seems to be a sort of playful triumph in the woman’s question, q. d. ‘even a Jew, when weary and athirst, can humble himself to ask drink of a Samaritan woman.’"
2. "The question of the woman shews a lively naïve disposition, which is further drawn out and exemplified by Him who knew what is in man, in the following dialogue."
3. "The fact is abundantly illustrated in the Rabbinical writings: see Schöttg. h. l."

2. "Have no dealings [ου συγχρωνται] . Have no familiar or friendly intercourse with."
3. "The Jews treated the Samaritans with every mark of contempt, and accused them of falsehood, folly, and irreligion."

### John Calvin:

2. "We may rather imagine her as hastening to procure what was asked for, whilst not failing to point out how inconsistent with Jewish principles it was to ask even for such a favour as this."
3. "The use of the present tense ('have no dealings') adds some support to this view; and one can hardly avoid the conviction that, had John himself given such an explanation, he would have so expressed himself as to avoid all appearance of discordance with his statement in John 4:8."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
