# John 5:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The feast, although it is not certain which one exactly, provided Christ with the perfect opportunity to share his teachings to a larger crowd and to fulfill the requirements of the Law. Jesus, in his wisdom, chose to visit Jerusalem before the events recorded in chapter 6, showing the significance he attached to being in the holy city. It is possible that there were other unnamed feasts taking place at that time, which further highlight the immense work and impact Jesus had during his ministry.

"Now Christ came to Jerusalem to the feast, partly because at that time, on account of the great multitude of people who were assembled, he had the opportunity of publishing his doctrine more extensively, and partly because it was necessary that he should be subject to the Law, that he might redeem us from the bondage of the Law, as we have already explained on former occasions."
