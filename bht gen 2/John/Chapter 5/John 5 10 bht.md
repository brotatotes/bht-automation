# John 5:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus performed a miraculous healing on the Sabbath, leading to a dispute about whether it was lawful. Some believed that carrying a bed on the Sabbath was forbidden by the law itself. Jesus defended the healing by stating that he had divine authority to command such actions. The debate surrounded the interpretation of the Sabbath law, with some faithfully following the law and others enforcing traditions that went against its spirit. Ultimately, the healing itself was secondary to the larger question of the authority of Jesus, who is the Lord of the Sabbath.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The bearing of burdens on the Sabbath was forbidden not only by the glosses of the Pharisees, but by the law itself."
2. "Our Lord does not...appeal here to the reasonableness of the deed being done on the Sabbath...but takes altogether loftier ground, as being One greater than the Sabbath."
3. "The whole kernel of this incident and discourse is not that it is lawful to do works of mercy on the Sabbath: but that the Son of God is Lord of the Sabbath."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "A glorious testimony to the cure, as instantaneous and complete, from the lips of the most prejudiced!"
2. "In ordinary circumstances, the rulers had the law on their side."
3. "Yet they ingeniously parried the thrust, asking him, not who had 'made him whole,' but who had dared to order a breach of the Sabbath?"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Not lawful - It was forbidden, they supposed, in the Old Testament."
2. "The Jews were very strenuous in the observation of the external duties of religion."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Cured [œÑŒµŒ∏ŒµœÅŒ±œÄŒµœÖŒºŒµŒΩœâ]. See on Matthew 8:7; Luke 5:15; Acts 17:25."
2. "To carry [Œ±œÅŒ±Œπ]. Rev., more correctly, to take up. It is Jesus ' own word in ver. 8."

### John Calvin:
1. "We are therefore taught by this example to avoid every rash judgment, until the reason of each action be fully known."
2. "Whatever contradicts the word of God deserves to be condemned without hesitation; but, as it frequently happens that there are mistakes in this matter, we ought first to inquire modestly and calmly, that our decision may be sound and sober."
3. "The defense is, that he who had been cured replies that he does nothing but by the command of him who had power and authority to command; for, though he did not yet know who Christ was, yet he was convinced that he had been sent by God, because he had received a proof of his divine power."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Were they faithfully carrying out the letter of the law of Moses, or were they enforcing one of those traditions by which they destroyed its spirit? We have no hesitation in adopting the former view." 
2. "The question must be decided apart from the miracle, of which at this moment the Jews seem to have had no knowledge." 
3. "The law of Moses forbade any work on that day; and the special enactments in the Pentateuch... show how this law was to be interpreted."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Unto him that was cured (œÑœâ œÑŒµŒ∏ŒµœÅŒ±œÄŒµœÖŒºŒµŒΩœâ). Perfect passive articular participle of Œ∏ŒµœÅŒ±œÄŒµœÖœâ (only example in John), 'to the healed man.'" 
2. "To take up thy bed (Œ±œÅŒ± œÑŒøŒΩ Œ∫œÅŒ±Œ≤Œ±œÑœÑŒøŒΩ). The very words of Jesus (verse John 5:8), only infinitive (first aorist active). Carrying burdens was considered unlawful on the Sabbath (Exodus 23:12; Nehemiah 13:19; Jeremiah 17:21)."
3. "The healing of the man was a minor detail."

### John Gill:
1. "Surely you forget yourself, or you would never be guilty of such an action as this; it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed."
2. "Carrying out and bringing in anything, from one place to another, is said to be work, and one of the principal works."
3. "He that rolls up a bed of the brasiers or tinkers (i.e. on the sabbath day) is bound to a sin offering."
