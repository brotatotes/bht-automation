# John 5:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The man's response to the religious leaders carries significant weight, as it highlights the authority of the one who healed him. By emphasizing that the same one who made him whole commanded him to take up his bed and walk, he implies that this divine power extends beyond mere healing and can supersede the observance of the Sabbath. It becomes clear that the one who performed this miraculous act must be from God and deserves to be listened to and followed in all matters.
