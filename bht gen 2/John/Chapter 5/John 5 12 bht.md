# John 5:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They look at what they think is a violation of the law, rather than the miracle or the man's statement about how he was healed. They focus on the difference of opinion and disregard the reasons behind it. Their complete indifference to the work of mercy reveals their hard-hearted malice. With contempt, they ask, Who is the man? disregarding the significance of the cure.
