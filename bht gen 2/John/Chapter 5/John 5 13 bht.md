# John 5:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The man who was healed had never seen or heard of Christ before, so he did not recognize Him. Instead of giving the man an opportunity to speak with Him, Jesus slipped away, allowing the man to wonder about his mysterious healer. It seems that Jesus intentionally avoided drawing attention to Himself, as He quickly disappeared after performing the miracle.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "His fame had not been so spread yet, but that He might during the crowd of strangers at the feast pass unnoticed."
2. "Just spoke the healing words, and then went on among the crowd; so that no particular attention was attracted to Himself, either by the sick man or others."
3. "The context requires this interpretation: being violated by the ordinary one, that Jesus 'conveyed himself away because a multitude was in the place.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "That some one, with unparalleled generosity, tenderness and power, had done it, the man knew well enough: but as he had never heard of Him before, so he disappeared too quickly for any inquiries."
2. "conveyed himself away—slipped out of the crowd that had gathered, to avoid both hasty popularity and precipitate hatred."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Had conveyed himself away - Was lost in the crowd."
2. "He had silently mingled with the multitude, or had passed on with the crowd unobserved."
3. "The man had been so rejoiced at his cure that he had not even asked for the name of his benefactor."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "[He that was healed] Compare ver. 10, and note the different word for healing. See references there." 
2. "Had conveyed Himself away [εξενευσεν]. The verb means, literally, to turn the head aside, in order to avoid something. Hence, generally, to retire or withdraw." 
3. "The present tense, who it is."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ certainly did not intend that the glory of so great a work should pass away, but he intended that it should become generally known before that he acknowledged himself to be the Author of it."
2. "He therefore withdrew for a little, that the Jews might have it in their power to judge of the fact itself, without reference to any person."
3. "And hence we learn that the cure of this man cannot be ascribed to his faith, since, even after having been cured, he does not acknowledge his Physician; and yet, when he was ordered, he carried his bed, which appears to have been done by the guidance of faith."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We need not wonder that this man, unable to move from place to place, perhaps only recently come to Jerusalem, had no previous knowledge of Jesus."
2. "After his cure, too, he could hear nothing of his benefactor, for, to avoid the recognition and enthusiasm of the multitude, Jesus withdrew, literally ‘slipped aside,’ became suddenly lost to sight."
3. "The conflict between Jesus and the Jews has begun: all His actions deepen their hatred against Him. The ‘multitude,’ on the other hand, is the object of His compassion: from time to time they follow Him eagerly, however slight may be their knowledge of His true teaching and aims."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He that was healed"
2. "Had conveyed himself away"
3. "A multitude being in the place"

### John Gill:
1. "He had never seen, and perhaps had never heard of Christ before, and so knew him not."
2. "Christ gave him no opportunity of conversing with him, or so much as to ask him who he was."
