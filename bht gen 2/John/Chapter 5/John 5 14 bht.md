# John 5:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is clear from this passage that sin is a disease, inherent in all of us, and that the man's previous sickness was a result of his own sin. Jesus warns him to stop sinning, as the mercy he has received obligates him to live a life free from sin. While it is inevitable that we will sin to some extent, we should not continue to live in sin as we did before.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The knowledge of our Lord extended even to the sin committed thirty-eight years ago, from which this long sickness had resulted."
2. "The χεῖρόν τι gives us an awful glimpse of the severity of God's judgments."
3. "The severity of God's judgments is seen in Matthew 12:45."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I will go into Thy house with burnt offerings, I will pay my vows which my lips have uttered and my mouth hath spoken when I was in trouble" (Psalms 66:13; Psalms 66:14).
2. Jesus, there Himself for His own ends, "findeth him there"—not all accidentally, be assured.
3. A glimpse this of the reckless life he had probably led before his thirty-eight years' infirmity had come upon him, and which not improbably had brought on, in the just judgment of God, his chronic complaint. Fearful illustration this of "the severity of God," but glorious manifestation of our Lord's insight into "what was in man."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There is nothing more improper, when we are raised up from a bed of pain, than to forget God our benefactor, and neglect to praise him for his mercies."
2. "Sin no more - By this expression it was implied that the infirmity of this man was caused by sin... Jesus shows him that he knew the cause of his sickness, and takes occasion to warn him not to repeat it."
3. "The only way of safety in all such cases is to 'sin no more;' not to be in the way of temptation; not to expose ourselves; not to touch or approach that which came near to working our ruin."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Sin no more [μηκετι αμαρτανε]. No longer continue to sin."
2. "A worse thing. Than even those thirty-eight years of suffering."
3. "Come unto thee [σοι γενηται]. Rev., better, befall thee. Literally, come to pass."

### John Calvin:
1. "This passage contains a highly useful doctrine; for when Christ says, lo, thou art made whole, his meaning is, that we make an improper use of the gifts of God, if we are not excited to gratitude."
2. "Thus, as God by stripes instructs and spurs us on to repentance, so he invites us to it by his goodness and forbearance; and, indeed, it is the universal design both of our redemption and of all the gifts of God, to keep us entirely devoted to Him."
3. "We ought also to observe how slow we are in deriving benefit from God’s chastisements; for if Christ’s exhortation was not superfluous, we may learn from it that the soul of this man was not yet fully purified from every vice."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There is no reason to doubt that he had gone there for purposes of devotion, having recognised the Divine deliverance."
2. "The words of Jesus imply much more than the general connection of sin and suffering; they show that in this case the sickness had in some way been the result and the punishment of sin."
3. "Yet sorer judgment will follow a return to the life of sin (Matthew 12:45)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Sin no more. 'No longer go on sinning.' ... Jesus used the same words to the woman taken in adultery ... He had suffered for 38 years. All sickness is not due to personal sin, but much is and nature is a hard paymaster."
2. "Lest a worse thing befall thee. Negative final clause ... Worse than the illness of 38 years, bad as that is. He will now be sinning against knowledge."

### John Gill:
1. "sin is a disease, which is original, natural, and hereditary to men; it is an epidemical one, all are affected with it, and all the powers and faculties of the soul."
2. "the time past of his life should suffice, for a course of sinning; and that the mercy he had received, laid him under an obligation to guard against it."
3. "though it cannot be thought that they should be, and act without sin, yet it becomes them not to live in sin, or go on in a course of it, as heretofore."

### John Wesley:
1. Sin no more — It seems his former illness was the effect or punishment of sin.
