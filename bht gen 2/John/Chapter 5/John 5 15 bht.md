# John 5:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The man, in his obedience to the authorities, ended up unintentionally arousing their hatred towards Jesus. His intention was pious, wanting to honor the One who had healed him. However, the Jews, with their venomous nature, accused Jesus of Sabbath violation and displayed extreme cruelty. Despite the man's motive, John sees in his act the fulfillment of a divine mission. It is not surprising that his well-intentioned actions were met with hostility, as those who prefer sacrifice to mercy often slander and persecute the defenders of the true Gospel.
