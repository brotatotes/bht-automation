# John 5:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They vehemently opposed him, spreading rumors and slandering his character, accusing him of being a Sabbath breaker and a violator of the law. They sought to prosecute him, either by inciting violence against him or by bringing him before the Sanhedrin for judgment. Their hatred toward him was fueled by envy, as he performed miraculous works that were not in line with their own religious practices. Although they used his alleged violation of the Sabbath as a pretext, their true animosity stemmed from their resistance against the power of true religion and the spread of the gospel.
