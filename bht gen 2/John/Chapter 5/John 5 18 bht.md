# John 5:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jews perceived that when Jesus referred to God as His Father, He was claiming a unique and intimate relationship, a personal Sonship that indicated equality with God. Jesus' affirmation of this understanding further confirms that He was indeed making Himself equal with God. This truth emphasizes the divine nature of Christ, going beyond mere adoption and signifying a distinct and privileged position that set Him apart from all creation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Jews understood His words to mean nothing short of peculiar personal Sonship, and thus equality of nature with God."
2. "And that this their understanding was the right one, the discourse testifies."
3. "Thus we obtain from the adversaries of the faith a most important statement of one of its highest and holiest doctrines."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "God was his Father—literally, 'His own [or peculiar] Father,' (...) The addition is their own, but a very proper one."
2. "making himself equal with God—rightly gathering this to be His meaning, not from the mere words 'My Father,' but from His claim of right to act as His Father did in the like high sphere, and by the same law of ceaseless activity in that sphere."
3. "And as, instead of instantly disclaiming any such meaning—as He must have done if it was false—He positively sets His seal to it in the following verses, merely explaining how consistent such claim was with the prerogatives of His Father, it is beyond all doubt that we have here an assumption of peculiar personal Sonship, or participation in the Father's essential nature."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We may learn from his answer: 1.That we are not to keep back truth because it may endanger us."
2. "That when any one portion of truth enrages hypocrites, they will be enraged the more they hear."
3. "The interpretation of the Jews was a very natural and just one. He not only said that God was his Father, but he said that he had the same right to work on the Sabbath that God had; that by the same authority, and in the same manner, he could dispense with the obligation of the day."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He was annulling the law and duty of Sabbath observance."
2. "His own Father."

### John Calvin:
1. "By his example he has taught us that we ought never to yield to the fury of wicked men, but should endeavor to maintain the truth of God, so far as necessity demands it, though the whole world should oppose and murmur."
2. "Nor is there any reason why the servants of Christ should take it ill that they do not profit all men according to their wish, since Christ himself did not always succeed."
3. "The principal cause of their wrath was, that he called God his Father... Christ intended that it should be understood that God was his Father in a peculiar sense, so as to distinguish himself from the ordinary rank of other men."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He who could thus speak, and who justified His works by the works of God, was calling God His own Father in the highest sense which these words can bear, and was claiming equality with God."
2. "The meaning which we gather from those that stand written before us probably could not be conveyed by spoken words without repetition and enlargement."
3. "From this point onwards we have the conflict that nothing could reconcile, the enmity of the Jews which would not and could not rest until they had compassed the death of Him who had come to save them."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They sought to kill him, to kill him off and be done with him."
2. "He was now a common and regular Sabbath-breaker."
3. "Certainly the Jews understood Jesus to claim equality with the Father in nature and privilege and power."

### John Gill:
1. "They were the more desirous to take away his life, and were more bent and resolute upon it, and studied all ways and means how to bring it about."
2. "And if they had known what that means, that God will have mercy, and not sacrifice, they would have been convinced that he had not broke it by this act of mercy to a poor distressed object."
3. "They rightly understood him, that he asserted his equality with him; for had he intended no more, and had they imagined that he intended no more by calling God his Father, than that he was so by creation, as he is to all men, or by adoption, as he was to the Jews, they would not have been so angry with him."

### John Wesley:
1. "His own Father—The Greek word means his own Father in such a sense as no creature can speak."
2. "Making himself equal with God—It is evident all the hearers so understood him, and that our Lord never contradicted, but confirmed it."
