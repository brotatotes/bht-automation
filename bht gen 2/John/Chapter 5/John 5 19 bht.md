# John 5:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Son, being one with God, can do nothing apart from Him, for their union is such that they act in perfect accord. In all things, the Son acts in accordance with the nature and will of God. By doing the same works as the Father, the Son not only displays his unity with Him but also reveals his divine nature. His actions are not separate or independent from the Father, but rather a reflection of their shared nature and purpose. Through his works, the Son affirms his equality with the Father and demonstrates that he is God.

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ is so far from vindicating himself from what the Jews asserted, though they intended it as a calumny, that he maintains more openly that it is true."

3. "The Son does the selfsame works as the Father does, such as the works of creation and providence, the government both of the church, and of the world; and he does these things in like manner, with the same power, and by the same authority, his Father does, and which proves him to be equal with him."

### John Wesley:
1. "The Son can do nothing of himself â€” This is not his imperfection, but his glory, resulting from his eternal, intimate, indissoluble unity with the Father."
2. "Hence it is absolutely impossible, that the Son should judge, will, testify, or teach any thing without the Father, John 5:30, etc.; John 6:38; John 7:16; or that he should be known or believed on, separately from the Father."
3. "And he here defends his doing good every day, without intermission, by the example of his Father, from which he cannot depart: these doth the Son likewise - All these, and only these; seeing he and the Father are one."
