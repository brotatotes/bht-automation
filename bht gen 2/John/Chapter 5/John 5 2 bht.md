# John 5:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The pool of Bethesda, referred to as the great pool, is believed to be the same pool mentioned by the Jews. This pool served as a means of grace, a place of mercy, resembling the ministry of the word and ordinances in the house of God. It had five porches, which were convenient for the diseased who came seeking a cure. This indicates that John wrote his Gospel before the destruction of Jerusalem, approximately thirty years after Christ's ascension.
