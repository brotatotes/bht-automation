# John 5:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Father's love for the Son is a reflection of their perfect fellowship and mutual endearment. As love has no concealments, the Father openly shows the Son all things that He Himself does, demonstrating their unity. The Son, being the perfect image of the Father, shares in His divine nature and perfections. Thus, the Father's love for the Son establishes the Son's authority and is the reason for the great works that He will do. These greater works are not merely signs or wonders, but a manifestation of the Son's divine power and authority.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For (this last is ensured by the fact, that) the Father loves the Son, and shews to Him all things which He Himself does."
2. "The Lord sets forth to us the unfolding of the will and purposes of the Father."
3. "This manifestation will go on increasing in majesty, that the wonder which now is excited in you by these works may be brought out to its full measure."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "As love has no concealments, so it results from the perfect fellowship and mutual endearment of the Father and the Son."
2. "The Father communicates to the Son all His counsels, and what has been thus shown to the Son is by Him executed in His mediatorial character."
3. "Their oneness of interest is no unconscious or involuntary thing, but a thing of glorious consciousness, will, and love, of which the Persons themselves are the proper Objects."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This authority he traces to the love which the Father has for him - that special, ineffable, infinite love which God has for his only-begotten Son, feebly and dimly illustrated by the love which an earthly parent has for an only child."
2. "And as God shows him 'all' that he does, he must be possessed of omniscience, for to no finite mind could be imparted a knowledge of 'all' the works of God."
3. "The greater works to which he refers are those which he proceeds to specify - he will raise the dead and judge the world, etc."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "To love is expressed by two words in the New Testament, filew and ajgapaw. Agapaw indicates a reasoning, discriminating attachment, founded in the conviction that its object is worthy of esteem, or entitled to it on account of benefits bestowed."
2. "Filew represents a warmer, more instinctive sentiment, more closely allied to feeling, and implying more passion. Hence ajgapaw is represented by the Latin diligo, the fundamental idea of which is selection, the deliberate choice of one out of a number, on sufficient grounds, as an object of regard."
3. "As Jesus does whatever He sees the Father do (ver. 19), the showing of greater works will be the signal for Jesus to do them. On works, as a characteristic word in John, see on 4 47."

### John Calvin:
1. "God loves himself in the Son."
2. "Christ is loved by the Father, as he is the Head of the Church."
3. "He shows that this love is the cause why the Father does all things by his hand."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The principle of the relation between the Father and the Son, out of which this communion springs, is ‘love,’ an eternal and continuous and infinite love, the source of an eternal and continuous and perfect communion."
2. "The fitness of the employment of the two words is very clear in almost all these instances."
3. "The design of these greater works, of this higher and more complete manifestation of Jesus, is ‘that ye may marvel.’"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Sometimes a distinction (John 21:17) is made, but not here, unless φιλεω presents the notion of intimate friendship (φιλος, friend), fellowship, the affectionate side, while αγαπαω (Latin diligo) is more the intelligent choice."
2. "But John uses both verbs for the mystery of love of the Father for the Son."
3. "Wonder belongs to childhood and to men of knowledge. Modern science has increased the occasion for wonder."

### John Gill:
1. "For the Father loveth the Son,... As being his Son, his image, the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person; as being of the same nature, and having the same perfections, and so equal to him;"
2. "and showeth him all things that himself doth; not as if he was ignorant of them, since he lies in the bosom of his Father, is the wisdom of God, is the omniscient God, that knows all things;"
3. "but this is said of the Father, as consulting with him, communicating his designs to him, as his equal; doing nothing without him... and by him he shows himself, and his works, to men."

### John Wesley:
1. "The Father showeth him all things that himself doth — A proof of the most intimate unity."
2. "And he will show him — By doing them. At the same time (not at different times) the Father showeth and doth, and the Son seeth and doth."
3. "Greater works — Jesus oftener terms them works, than signs or wonders, because they were not wonders in his eyes."
