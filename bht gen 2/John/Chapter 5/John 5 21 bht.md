# John 5:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus proclaims the greater works of the Father, which include raising the dead and judging the world. The power to bring life to those whom He chooses is a direct result of His authority to judge. In this way, the ability to give life and the right to judge go hand in hand. These two works, the quickening of the dead and the judgment of the world, are clearly presented in John 5:21-22.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is very important to observe the distinction here between the working of the Eternal Son (in creation, e.g.) as He is ἐν οὐρανῷ, with God, and His working in the state of His humiliation in which the Father should by degrees advance Him to exaltation and put His enemies under His feet."
2. "The former belong to the Son as His proper and essential work: the latter are opened out before Him in the process of His passing onward in the humanity which He has taken."
3. "Observe, this ζωοποιεῖ lays hold of life in its innermost and deepest sense, and thus finds its illustration in the waking both of the outwardly and the spiritually dead."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "so the Son quickeneth them—that is, raiseth up and quickeneth. whom he will—not only doing the same divine act, but doing it as the result of His own will, even as the Father does it."
3. "This statement is of immense importance in relation to the miracles of Christ, distinguishing them from similar miracles of prophets and apostles, who as human instruments were employed to perform super-natural actions, while Christ did all as the Father's commissioned Servant indeed, but in the exercise of His own absolute right of action."

### Albert Barnes:

### Marvin Vincent:
