# John 5:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Father, who might be expected to be judge, does not judge anyone, but instead has given all judgment to the Son. It is through the Son that God exercises this judgment, and not without him. In doing so, he justifies and acquits whom he pleases, demonstrating his role as a just judge who does right. This is a trust and work that only someone who is God, equal with the Father, can fulfill. It is the Son whom the Father has ordained to judge, and through him, the Father's judgment is carried out.

2. "By ‘judgment,’ as in chap. John 3:17-19, we must certainly understand a judgment that issues in condemnation: the parallelism between John 3:18, ‘He that believeth in Him is not judged,’ and John 5:24, ‘He that heareth my word and believeth Him that sent me hath eternal life, and cometh not into judgment,’ is remarkably close."
3. "The Son maketh to live whom He will; but there are some on whom He does not bestow life (compare John 5:40); them therefore He judges, He condemns, for not even is this Divine prerogative withholden from Him; nay, all judgment hath been given unto the Son."

3. "Now for such a trust, and such a work as this, whether the particular government of the church, or the general judgment of the world, he would not be fit, was he not God equal with the Father; the thing he had suggested, and which he supports and maintains in this vindication of himself."
