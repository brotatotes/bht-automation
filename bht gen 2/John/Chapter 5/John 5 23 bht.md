# John 5:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To truly honor and worship God, we must acknowledge and revere both the Father and the Son. The Father not only intends for us to honor the Son, but desires that we give them equal honor, recognizing the equality between them. By rejecting or denying the honor due to the Son, we indirectly dishonor the Father who sent him. Our understanding and worship of God are incomplete if we fail to give proper praise and homage to Jesus Christ, who is equal to God and reveals the Father to us.
