## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is a kind of hearing which awakens to life, one accompanied by πιστεύειν τῷ πέμψαντί με . And this last is not barely ‘Him who sent Me,’ but Him, the very essence of belief in Whom is in this , THAT HE SENT ME."
2. "The faith is set before us as an enduring faith, and its effects described in their completion."
3. "The believers in Christ will not be judged according to their works: they are justified before God by faith, and by God θεὸς ὁ δικαιῶν, τίς ὁ κατακρίνων?"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

3. "What a transition!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He that heareth my word - To 'hear,' in this place, evidently denotes not the outward act of hearing, but to receive in a proper manner; to suffer it to make its proper impression on the mind; to obey."
2. "Hath everlasting life - The state of man by nature is represented as death in sin... But religion is 'life.' The Christian lives with God, and feels and acts as if there was a God... He 'has' everlasting life; not merely shall have but is already in possession of that life or happiness which shall be everlasting."
3. "Shall not come into condemnation - He was by nature under condemnation... This promise is sure; it is made by the Son of God, and there is no one that can pluck them out of his hand."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Heareth. Closely connected with believeth."
2. "Shall not come into condemnation...cometh not into doom."
3. "From death...out of death, pointing to the previous condition in which he was."

### John Calvin:
1. "Nothing is more common than a false profession of Christianity... But here Christ demands from us no other honor than to obey his Gospel."
2. "Both... the robe of devout and sincere worship which he requires from us, and the method by which he restores us to life."
3. "The unconditional forgiveness of sins, in which alone the happiness of men consists... For then does a man begin to live when he has God reconciled to him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He that heareth my word, and believeth Him that sent me, hath eternal life, and cometh not into judgment, but hath passed out of death into life." 
2. "The Son maketh to live the dead, even those whom He will: he that heareth His word hath eternal life, and hath passed out of his state of death into life."
3. "Believing in Christ, he has life in Him, and to all that are in Christ Jesus there is no condemnation."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Hath eternal life. Has now this spiritual life which is endless."
2. "In this passage (John 5:21-29) Jesus speaks now of physical life and death, now of spiritual, and one must notice carefully the quick transition."
3. "But hath passed out of death into life. Perfect active indicative of μεταβαινω, to pass from one place or state to another. Out of spiritual death into spiritual life and so no judgement."

### John Gill:
1. "The Gospel, and is so called, both because it is spoken by Christ, and first began to be spoken by him; and because he is spoken of in it; his person, office, and work, peace, pardon, righteousness, life, and salvation by him, being the sum and substance of it."
2. "He that hears Christ's words, and receives him, and believes in him, receives and believes in him that sent him; and the same effects and consequences follow upon the one as on the other, upon hearing the word of Christ, as upon believing on the Father of Christ; and which is no inconsiderable proof of their perfect equality."
3. "He has also a meetness for it, and has the pledge and earnest of it, the Spirit of God, and shall certainly enjoy it: and shall not come into condemnation."

### John Wesley:
1. And cometh not into condemnation — Unless he make shipwreck of the faith.
