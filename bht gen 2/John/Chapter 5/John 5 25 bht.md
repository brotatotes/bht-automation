# John 5:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live.

It is a powerful demonstration of Christ's divine ability to bring life to the dead.

1. "the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live" - This may be understood either of a corporeal resurrection, and of some particular instances of it, which should shortly be; and of some persons who would be in the state of the dead, and to whom the voice of Christ would be attended with such power as to cause them to hear and live; as did Jairus's daughter upon his saying "Talitha Cumi", damsel arise, and the widow of Naim's son upon his saying, young man arise, and Lazarus, upon his calling to him, Lazarus come forth; and which is a full proof of his being equal to God that quickens the dead.
