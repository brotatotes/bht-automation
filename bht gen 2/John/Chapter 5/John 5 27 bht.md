## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "what Christ had properly in view was the indwelling of the Son's essential life in humanity as the great theater and medium of divine display" 
2. "the appointment of a Judge in our own nature is one of the most beautiful arrangements of divine wisdom in redemption"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'authority' here implies all that is necessary to execute judgment - all the physical power to raise the dead, and to investigate the actions and thoughts of life; and all the moral right or authority to sit in judgment on the creatures of God, and to pronounce their doom."
2. "He has appointment to 'do justice;' to see that the universe suffers no wrong, either by the escape of the guilty or by the punishment of the innocent."
3. "It is to be remarked here that the word 'son' does not have the article before it in the original: Because he is A son of man - that is, because he is a man. It would seem from this that there is a propriety that one in our nature should judge us."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The authority is assigned to Him as being very man."
2. "The article is wanting. The authority is assigned to Him as being very man."
3. "John uses the article everywhere with this phrase, except here and Revelation 1:13; Revelation 14:14."

### John Calvin:
1. "He again repeats that the Father hath given him dominion, that he may have full power over all things in heaven and in the earth."
2. "He comes forth to men, adorned with such magnificence of power, that he may impart to them what he has received from the Father."
3. "What had been hidden in God is revealed to us in Christ as man, and life, which was formerly inaccessible, is now placed before our eyes."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Son 'maketh to live,' but He maketh to live 'whom He will'... He giveth life to those who have heard His voice, and not to all." 
2. "Where, then, He is not the Giver of life, He is necessarily the Judge." 
3. "The Father who gave to the Son the possession of life gave Him judgment also... a gift which belongs to time and not eternity, a gift which the Son receives ‘because He is a son of man.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Because he is a son of man" (note absence of articles and so not as the Messiah), because the judge of men must partake of human nature himself.
2. Bernard insists that John is here giving his own reflections rather than the words of Jesus and uses υιος ανθρωπου in the same sense as ο υιος του ανθρωπου (always in the Gospels used by Jesus of himself).
3. But that in my opinion is a wrong view since we have here ostensibly certainly the words of Jesus himself.

### John Gill:
1. "Both in his church and kingdom, in the present state of things, and at the last day, when all shall stand before his judgment seat."
2. "The authority of executing judgment, according to the council and covenant of peace, is committed to him; or that men might have a visible judge, or be judged by one in their own nature."
3. "He is that son of man spoken of in prophecy, especially in Daniel 7:13; by whom is meant the Messiah, as the Jews themselves allow, and who was not a mere man, but the man God's fellow; and so being omniscient and omnipotent, was equal to such a work."

### John Wesley:
1. Because he is the Son of man — He is appointed to judge mankind because he was made man.
