# John 5:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
At a time yet to come, Jesus assures that everyone, without exception, will experience resurrection. He emphasizes the inclusiveness of this event, with all being the key word, signifying the universality of the resurrection. This resurrection is not a mere spiritual awakening, but a bodily one, as the same bodies that were buried will be brought forth from the graves. This demonstrates the remarkable power of Christ's voice, which will have the capacity to summon and restore life to every individual.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Marvel not at thisâ€”this committal of all judgment to the Son of man." 
2. "For the hour is comingâ€”He adds not in this case (as in John 5:25), 'and now is,' because this was not to be till the close of the whole dispensation of mercy."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The phrase 'all that are in the graves' does not prove that the same particles of matter will be raised up, but it is equivalent to saying 'all the dead.'"
2. "He will restore them to life, and command them to appear before him. This is a most sublime description, and this will be a wonderful display of almighty power."
3. "None but God can 'see' all the dead, none but he could remould their frames, and none else could command them to return to life."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Two words are used in the New Testament for the place of burial, tafov, and mnhmeion or mnhma."
2. "The former emphasizes the idea of burial (qaptw, to bury); the latter of preserving the memory of the dead; from mimnhskw, to remind."

### John Calvin:
1. "We may be apt to think that he reasons inconclusively, in drawing from the last resurrection a confirmation of what he had said; for it is not an instance of greater power to raise up bodies than to raise up minds."
2. "Hence it arises that they pass by the resurrection of the soul with little concern, while the resurrection of the body excites in them greater admiration."
3. "And among ungodly men, what would be reckoned more ridiculous than to prove a thing unknown by a thing less known? I reply, Christ here boasts of his power over the reprobate, so as to testify that the Father has committed to him the full restoration of all things; as if he had said, 'What I now tell you that I have commenced, I will one day finish before your eyes."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Marvel not at this. Jesus has been speaking of works at which they may well marvel; but great as these may be, there is yet a greater." 
2. "Because an hour cometh, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice. That the future alone is spoken of is clear from the omission of the words â€˜and now isâ€™ found in John 5:25."
3. "The consummation of the work of Jesus is the general resurrection both of the righteous and the wicked. Now all shall hear His voice, to which before some only had given heed. All shall go forth, but not all to a resurrection of life."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "They will hear his voice and come out. A general judgement and a general bodily resurrection we have here for both good and bad."
3. "In John 6:39 Jesus asserts that he will raise up the righteous."

### John Gill:
1. "Marvel not at this,.... Either at the cure of the man that had been diseased thirty and eight years... or rather at the dead hearing the voice of the Son of God, and living upon it... for the hour is coming, in which all that are in their graves shall hear his voice." 
2. "This is also a proof of the resurrection of the same body; for what else are in the graves but bodies? and what else can come forth from them but the same bodies?"
3. "Certain it is, that this voice of Christ will be attended with almighty power, as the effect following upon it will show."

### John Wesley:
1. The time is coming â€” When not two or three, but all shall rise.
