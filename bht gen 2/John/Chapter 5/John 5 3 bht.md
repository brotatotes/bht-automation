# John 5:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The sick folk at the porches represent humanity under the burden of the law, weak and incapable of saving themselves. They are blind to spiritual truths, lacking knowledge of God and the depth of their own sinfulness. Without God's grace, they are left in a state of hopelessness and despair. This passage serves as a poignant reminder of our utter dependence on God for salvation and the dire consequences of trying to rely on our own efforts. It highlights the desperate need for God's intervention and the transformative power of His saving grace in our lives.

2. "Halt - Lame."
3. "Moving of the water - It appears that this pool had medicinal properties only when it was 'agitated' or 'stirred.'

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:

3. "For nothing is more magnificent than when an unwonted power of God corrects and restores the defects of nature; and nothing is more beautiful or more delightful than when, through his boundless goodness, he relieves the distresses of men."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The general term 'sick folk' receives its explanation afterwards as consisting of those who were blind, or lame, or whose bodies or limbs were wasted."
2. "The phenomena are those of an intermittent spring; and the various circumstances described, the concourse of sick, the eager expectation, the implicit faith in the healing virtue of the waters and in the recurring supernatural agency, find too many parallels in history to make it necessary to suppose that there was any supernatural virtue in the pool."
3. "The angel‚Äôs visit was not looked for ‚Äòat a certain season‚Äô (as if after some fixed and regular interval), but 'at seasons,' from time to time."
