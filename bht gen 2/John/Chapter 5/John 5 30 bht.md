# John 5:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Son, in perfect unity with the Father, does nothing apart from Him and His will. He relies on the Father's guidance and judgment, claiming no separate authority or interest. His actions are always in alignment with the Father, and His judgments are just. It is through this deep connection and unity that He has been entrusted with the task of judgment. Truly, the Son's identity and purpose are rooted in His relationship with the Father, and it is in this unity that His power and authority lie. (John 5:19)

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "As the Son does nothing of Himself, but His working and His judgment all spring from His deep unity of will and being with the Father, this His great and last judgment, and all His other ones, will be just and holy."
2. "His witness given of Himself, and called by them blasphemy, is true and holy also."
3. "Observe, the discourse here passes into the first person, which was understood before, because he had called himself the Son of God, but is henceforth used expressly."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Apart from the Father, or in any interest than My own."
2. "My judgments are all anticipated in the bosom of My Father, to which I have immediate access, and by Me only responded to and reflected."
3. "They cannot therefore err, as I live for one end only, to carry into effect the will of Him that sent Me."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Messiah, the Mediator, does nothing without the concurrence and the authority of God."
2. "Whatever he does, he does according to the will of God."
3. "He came not to aggrandize himself, or to promote his own views, but he came to do the will of God."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "The Son justly claims for himself all that can be ascribed to the Father, from whom he takes his commencement, with respect to his person."
2. "Christ speaks concerning himself, he claims only that which belongs to man... For the same reason, he ascribes to the Father whatever is higher than man."
3. "Whatever is from God is right and true, and it is impossible for God not to be true in all his words, just and right in all his actions."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just." This verse is the dividing line of the discourse, summing up what has gone before and leading on to the new subject which occupies the remainder of the chapter.
2. "From the beginning of the discourse, Jesus has spoken of the Father and the Son. Now He directly fixes the eyes of His hearers upon Himself (‘I can,’ ‘I hear,’ ‘I judge’); and this mode of speech is retained to the very end of the chapter."
3. "His action is never separate from that of the Father, there can be no variance: His will is ever the will of His Father, there can be no self-seeking. It was because the opposite spirit dwelt and reigned in the Jews that they were rejecting Him, and bringing judgment on themselves."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The reason [the Son's judgements] is plain (οτ, because), the guiding principle with the Son being the will of the Father who sent him and made him Judge."
2. "Judges often have difficulty in knowing what is law and what is right, but the Son's task as Judge is simple enough, the will of the Father which he knows."

### John Gill:
1. "I am the Son that can do nothing separate from the Father, and contrary to his will, but do all things in conjunction with him."
2. "I am the Son that quickens whom he pleases, and to whom all judgment is committed, and have the same honour the Father has."
3. "I did not seek to gratify my own will, as distinct from his Father's, or in opposition to it; for he had no private end to answer, or separate interest, or advantage to pursue."

### John Wesley:
1. "I can do nothing of myself — It is impossible I should do any thing separately from my Father."
2. "As I hear — Of the Father, and see, so I judge and do; because I am essentially united to him."
3. "See John 5:19."
