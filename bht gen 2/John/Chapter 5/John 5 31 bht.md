# John 5:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If I alone bear witness about myself, my testimony is not sufficient or valid according to the Jewish laws and customs. It is understood that a person cannot testify in their own case and be considered credible. Jesus recognizes this and acknowledges that his testimony alone cannot be fully accepted. Therefore, he relies on other testimonies and evidence to validate his claims.
