# John 5:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Even though there were doubts about Jesus and his message, there was another witness to his truth. The Father himself testified to the authenticity and righteousness of Jesus, which was even recognized by those who considered John the Baptist to be a reliable prophet. This validation of Jesus' testimony by the Father served to reaffirm his divinity and strengthen his spirit in the face of opposition.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The reason why our Lord mentions John is not ‘as ascending from the lesser witness to the greater,’ but purposely to remove the idea that He meant him only or principally by these words, and to set his testimony in its right place."
2. "This is the Son’s testimony to the Father’s truth: see ch. (Joh 3:33) John 7:28; John 8:26; John 8:55. It testifies to the full consciousness on the part of the Son, even in the days of his humiliation, of the righteousness of the Father."
3. "It [the Son's testimony] also [testifies] to His distinct recognition and approval of psalm and type and prophecy, as applied to Himself and His work."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "It testifies to the full consciousness on the part of the Son, even in the days of His humiliation, of the righteousness of the Father."
3. "And thus He cheered His spirit under the cloud of human opposition which was already gathering over His head."

### Albert Barnes:
1. There is another - That is, God. See John 5:36.

### Philip Schaff:
