# John 5:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ Himself said, I do not depend for proof of my Messiahship on the testimony of men, nor do I pride myself on the commendations or flattery of men. The witness which I receive is not from man. However, he acknowledged the value of John's testimony, using it to lead people to salvation. Men often fail to realize the divine testimony they seek, but Jesus desired to promote the benefit of mankind through his gospel. Despite this, many did not apprehend the true witness and were not saved.
