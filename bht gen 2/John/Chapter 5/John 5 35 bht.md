# John 5:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
John the Baptist was not the Light himself, but a lamp shining in the darkness. He burned with strong love and affection for Christ, and the souls of men, and had a flaming zeal for the honor of God. When John first appeared, the people were fond and even proud of him. They gloried in the fact that such an exceptionally gifted and holy man was raised up among them. However, their acceptance of John was only temporary. They were like stony ground hearers, initially enthusiastic but quickly turning against him when he told them the truth.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This ἦν shows, as Stier rightly observes, that John was now cast into prison, if not executed."
2. "ὁ λύχνος: The article has been taken by some to point to the prophecies concerning John... We may... believe that those words represent or gave rise to a common way of speaking of Elias, as certain Rabbis were called 'The candle of the Law,' &c."
3. "καιόμενος, not καίων, as it is ὁ λύχνος, not τὸ φῶς: lumen illuminatum, not lumen illuminans: see note on Matthew 5:14. καὶ φαίνων (lit up), and shining. The description sets forth the derived, and transitory nature of John’s light."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He was a burning and a shining light—literally, 'the burning and shining lamp' (or torch):—that is, 'the great light of his day.'"
2. "Christ is never called by the humble word here applied to John—a light-bearer—studiously used to distinguish him from his Master, but ever the Light in the most absolute sense."

2. "God did not intend that you should go astray; for he appointed John to be a lamp, that he might direct you by his brightness."
3. "By these words Christ accuses the Jews, and at the same time conveys to all of us a warning that, when God sends faithful teachers to guide us in the right way, we should take care not to abuse them by wandering in every direction."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "John’s great work had been to bear witness of Jesus, to point to Him." 
2. "The lamp too burns as it shines; its light is transitory, and may well be so, because in proportion as its purpose is accomplished may the light diminish."
