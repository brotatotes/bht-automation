# John 5:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ's witness is greater than the testimony of John, as expressed in the Persic version. The works that the Father assigned to Jesus are evidence that confirm the truth of his divinity and his divine sonship. These miracles performed by Jesus serve as demonstrations and proofs to humanity that he is indeed the Son of God.
