# John 5:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus confidently declares that the Father himself has borne witness of him. This witness is not limited to the voice from heaven at his baptism, but encompasses the entirety of his ministry. The Jews, however, fail to recognize this testimony because they have not truly known God. They have overlooked the evidence in the Scriptures and have not grasped the true nature of Jesus' identity. Thus, Jesus challenges them to open their hearts and understand that they are unfamiliar with the one whom he speaks of.
