# John 5:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The rejection of Jesus by the Jews is evidence that they did not regard or obey the word of God, which had been proclaimed through the prophets. Their lack of spiritual aptitude and failure to meditate on the prophecies and the testimony of God's voice further contributed to their disbelief. In contrast, those who believe in Jesus have the word of the Father abiding in them, deeply ingrained in their hearts, leading them to receive and embrace Him as the divine Son sent by God.
