# John 5:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Scriptures, which were divinely inspired and authoritative, are often referenced by Christ and the apostles as they contain the truth of God's message. The religious leaders, being well-versed in the Scriptures, were knowledgeable about the passages that spoke about the Messiah. However, despite their access to the Scriptures and regular exposure to their teachings, they mistakenly believed that inheriting eternal life was solely dependent on their study and adherence to the Scriptures. Jesus reminds them that the Scriptures themselves bear witness to Him, and it is through faith in Him that one finds eternal life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In the Scriptures ye find your charter of eternal life go search them then, and you will find that I am the Great Burden of their testimony; yet ye will not come to Me for that life eternal which you profess to find there, and of which they tell you I am the appointed Dispenser."
2. "How touching and gracious are these last words!"
3. "Observe here (1) The honor which Christ gives to the Scriptures, as a record which all have a right and are bound to search—the reverse of which the Church of Rome teaches; (2) The opposite extreme is, resting in the mere Book without the living Christ, to direct the soul to whom is its main use and chiefest glory."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Search the scriptures - The word translated 'search' here means to 'search diligently' or 'search anxiously.' It was applied to miners, who search for precious metals - who look anxiously for the 'bed' of the ore with an intensity or anxiety proportionate to 'their sense' of the value of the metal."
2. "The scriptures - The writings or books of the Old Testament, for those were all the books of revelation that they then possessed."
3. "They are they ... - They bear witness to the Messiah. They predict his coming, and the manner of his life and death, Isaiah 53:1-12; Daniel 9:26-27, etc."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Jesus is appealing to a familiar practice of which for in them ye think is explanatory." 
2. "The scriptures...possibly with a hint at the contrast with the word."
3. "They...those very scriptures."

### John Calvin:
1. "For he does not absolutely blame them for seeking life in the Scriptures, since they were given to us for that end and use, but because the Jews thought that the Scriptures gave them life, while they were widely opposed to its natural meaning, and — what is worse — while they quenched the light of life which was contained in them."
2. "First, then, we ought to believe that Christ cannot be properly known in any other way than from the Scriptures; and if it be so, it follows that we ought to read the Scriptures with the express design of finding Christ in them."
3. "Consequently, the deep abhorrence of Christ which is entertained by the Jews, who have the Law constantly in their hands, must be imputed to their indolence."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Ye search the Scriptures... it is they which bear witness concerning me." 
2. "To the Jews indeed it might seem that He intended to speak of these alone; and that He should deny Jews the glory which they esteemed most highly... increase their condemnation."
3. "Jesus allows them the praise that was their due, but shows also that the very possession of which they boasted had been so used by them as to increase their condemnation."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The form here can be either present active indicative second person plural or the present active imperative second person plural. Only the context can decide. Either makes sense here, but the reason given 'because ye think' (οτ υμεις δοκειτε, clearly indicative), supports the indicative rather than the imperative."
2. "The plural with the article refers to the well-known collection in the Old Testament (Matthew 21:42; Luke 24:27). Elsewhere in John the singular refers to a particular passage."
3. "The true value of the Scriptures is in their witness to Christ (of me, περ εμου)."

### John Gill:
1. "The writings of Moses, and the prophets, which were of divine inspiration and authority, and are often appealed unto by Christ, and his apostles, for the truth of what they delivered."
2. "The chief priests, Scribes, and elders, or the sanhedrim, were very much versed in the Scriptures, and could readily refer to those which concerned the Messiah."
3. "They imagined, by having these writings in their hands, and by their reading them, and hearing them expounded every sabbath day, they should obtain and inherit everlasting life."

### John Wesley:
1. "Search the Scriptures — A plain command to all men."
2. "In them ye are assured ye have eternal life — Ye know they show you the way to eternal life."
3. "And these very Scriptures testify of me."
