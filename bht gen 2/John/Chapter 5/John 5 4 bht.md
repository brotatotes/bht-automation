# John 5:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
People may have thought the healing was purely natural, but in reality, it was the work of an angel and a divine intervention. This miraculous healing occurred periodically, at a certain time, during the paschal week, to raise anticipation and demonstrate that God had not forgotten his people. While this miracle healed only one person at a time, Jesus, the Son of God, had the power to heal many multitudes.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This miracle differed in two points from all other miracles recorded in Scripture: (1) It was not one, but a succession of miracles periodically wrought: (2) As it was only wrought 'when the waters were troubled,' so only upon one patient at a time, and that the patient 'who first stepped in after the troubling of the waters.'"
2. "Any of these peculiarities—much more all taken together—must have proclaimed the supernatural character of the cures wrought."
3. "The want of :- and part of John 5:3 in some good manuscripts, and the use of some unusual words in the passage, are more easily accounted for than the evidence in their favor if they were not originally in the text."

### Albert Barnes:
"Nor can it be shown to be absurd or improbable that such blessings should be imparted to man by the ministry of an angel."
"It is not implied that this was done instantaneously or by a miracle."
"The Jews regarded such a provision as proof of the mercy of God."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is, therefore, wicked and shameful to imagine any thing as belonging to the angels, or to constitute them the medium of communication between us and God, so as to obscure the glory of God."
2. "We ought to come direct to Christ, that, by his guidance, protection, and command, we may have the angels as assistants and ministers of our salvation."
3. "Nothing is more unreasonable than that men should subject the works of God to their own judgment; for pray, what assistance or relief could be expected from troubled water?"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "All of this verse is wanting in the oldest and best manuscripts..."
2. "It is undoubtedly added, like the clause in verse John 5:3, to make clearer the statement in verse John 5:7."
3. "It is a relief to many to know that the verse is spurious."

### John Gill:
1. "This angel may represent a minister of the Gospel, for such are called angels, being called of God, and sent by him, with messages of grace to the sons of men."
2. "The preaching of the Gospel by such, may be aptly signified by the troubling of the waters, as it is by the shaking of heaven, earth, and sea."
3. "Whoever now, upon the preaching of the Gospel, are enabled to step forth and come to Christ, and believe in him, are cured of all their soul maladies and diseases, be they what they will."

### John Wesley:
1. "An angel — Yet many undoubtedly thought the whole thing to be purely natural."
2. "At certain times — Perhaps at a certain hour of the day, during this paschal week, went down - The Greek word implies that he had ceased going down, before the time of St. John's writing this. God might design this to raise expectation of the acceptable time approaching, to add a greater lustre to his Son's miracles, and to show that his ancient people were not entirely forgotten of him."
3. "The first — Whereas the Son of God healed every day not one only, but whole multitudes that resorted to him."
