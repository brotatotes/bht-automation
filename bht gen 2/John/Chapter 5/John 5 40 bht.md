# John 5:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Though the Scriptures bear witness to me as the Messiah and offer the way to eternal life, you refuse to come to me. The reason for your rejection lies in your own wickedness and obstinacy. The tragedy is that you prefer darkness over light and have wrongly made the Scriptures an end in themselves instead of leading you to me. The Scriptures bear witness to me, and it is in me alone that true life is found.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I would connect these words with the former, and regard them as describing the inconsistency of those who think that they ζωὴν ἔχειν in the Scriptures, and yet will not come to Him of whom they testify, ἵνα ζωὴν ἔχωσιν."
2. "So that καί will be spoken in a fine irony, And ye will not come to Me!"
3. "Observe, this command to the Jews to search their Scriptures, applies à fortiori to Christians; who are yet, like them, in danger of idolizing a mere written book, believing that in the Bible they have eternal life, and missing the personal knowledge of Him of whom the Scriptures testify."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Though the Old Testament bears evidence that I am the Messiah; though you professedly search it to learn the way to life, and though my works prove it, yet you will not come to me to obtain life."
2. "From this we may learn: 1. That life is to be obtained in Christ. He is the way, the truth, and the life, and he only can save us."
3. "3. That the reason why sinners are not saved lies in the will. 'The only reason why sinners die is because ‘they will not come’ to Christ for life and happiness: it is not because they ‘cannot,’ but because they ‘will not’” (Henry)."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "More than a simple copula. Rather and yet."
2. "Indicating stubborn determination."

### John Calvin:

2. "When he says that they will not, he imputes the cause of their ignorance and blindness to wickedness and obstinacy."
3. "Christ justly reproves them with greater severity when they intentionally fled from the light, and even desired to extinguish the sun by the darkness of their unbelief."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Had they entered into their spirit, they would have joyfully welcomed Him; yet they refused to come to Him for life."
2. "What was designed as a means had been made by them an end; what should have led them to Christ detained them from Him."
3. "To the Scriptures the highest honour is assigned, for Jesus says, 'it is they which bear witness concerning me.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This is the tragedy of the rejection of Messiah by the Messianic race" (Bernard).

3. "There is life only in Christ Jesus."

### John Gill:
1. "Those who come aright to Christ, come to him as the alone, able, suitable, and sufficient Savior."
2. "These men did not see themselves as sinners and ready to perish; for they thought they had eternal life elsewhere."
3. "Their depravity, perverseness, and stubbornness of their wills had no inclination, desire, and will to come to Christ, any more than power; which is an argument against, and not for the free will of man."

### John Wesley:
1. Yet ye will not come unto me — As they direct you.
