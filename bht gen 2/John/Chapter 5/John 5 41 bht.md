# John 5:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Though humans may give me honor, that is not my purpose or goal. I do not seek praise or recognition from people, for my purpose is not to please or impress them, but to fulfill the will of the Father and bring glory to Him. My focus is on seeking the honor that comes from God alone, and it is in His acceptance and approval that I find true fulfillment and satisfaction.
