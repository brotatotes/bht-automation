# John 5:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The knowledge of personal experience comes from the omniscient God who knows not only our persons but also the thoughts and desires of our hearts. Without love for God, all our actions are meaningless, and yet the Jews overlooked this crucial matter. Instead, they loved themselves, the world, and worldly possessions, neglecting the love of the Father. This is why Jesus spoke with the utmost compassion, realizing that their hearts needed to be pierced with the truth.
