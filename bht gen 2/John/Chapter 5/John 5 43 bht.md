# John 5:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus cautions his disciples about the imminent arrival of false messiahs who will emerge in their own name. These individuals will assert authority, but unlike Jesus, they will lack divine commission. It is essential for Jesus' followers to discern the true messiah from these imposters, embracing the teachings of Jesus and not being deceived by those who seek their own ends.
