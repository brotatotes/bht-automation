# John 5:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The individuals in question were so preoccupied with seeking honor and praise from one another that it hindered their ability to truly believe in Jesus. Their attachment to human honors, pride, and ambition prevented them from embracing the teachings of Christ. Instead of seeking the glory that comes from the only God, they were focused on receiving approval and recognition from men. This misplaced emphasis on their own reputation and the commendation of others prevented them from experiencing the true recompense and approval that comes from God alone.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The words œÑŒø·ø¶ ŒºœåŒΩŒøœÖ Œ∏ŒµŒø·ø¶ are very important, because they form the point of passage to the next verses; in which the Jews are accused of not believing the writings of Moses, the very pith and kernel of which was the unity of God, and the having no other gods but Him."
2. "From the only God: in contradistinction to the idolatry of the natural heart, which is ever setting up for itself other sources of honour, worshipping man, or self, or even, as in the case alluded to in the last verse, Satan, instead of God."
3. "œÄŒ±œÅ·Ω∞ œÑŒø·ø¶ ŒºœåŒΩŒøœÖ Œ∏ŒµŒø·ø¶, not 'from God only' (E. V. and De Wette), which is ungrammatical, [...] but from the only God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The 'will not' of John 5:40, and 'cannot' here are just different features of the same awful state of the human heart."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The great reason why multitudes do not believe is their attachment to human honors, or their pride, and vanity, and ambition."
2. "Great numbers are deterred from being Christians by pride and ambition. Probably there is no single thing that prevents so really young men from becoming Christians as this passion."
3. "Seek not the honour - The praise, the glory, the approbation of God. The honor which comes from men is their praise, flattery, commendation; the honor that comes from God is his approbation for doing his will."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Ye believe. Again the emphatic ye, the reason for the emphasis being given in the succeeding clause."
2. "Literally, receiving (as ye do): seeing that ye receive."
3. "And the glory that cometh from the only God ye seek not."

### John Calvin:
1. "Never is a man prepared to obey the heavenly doctrine, until he is convinced that his principal object, throughout his whole life, ought to be, that he may be approved by God."
2. "He who in reality presents himself before God as his Judge, must, of necessity, fall down humbled and dismayed, and finding nothing in himself on which he can place reliance."
3. "So, then, in order that any man may seek glory from God alone, he must be overwhelmed with shame, and flee to the undeserved mercy of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Such love of honour from men is altogether inconsistent with the ‚Äòbelieving‚Äô of which our Lord speaks."
2. "He is not referring to a merely intellectual act, but to an act which is also moral, not to believing an assertion, but to believing in Him."
3. "With such aims it was impossible to please Him, and thus they missed the recompense which comes from ‚Äòthe only God,‚Äô who is the ‚Äòonly‚Äô dispenser of true glory."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "How can ye believe?" - Emphasis on "ye," ye being what ye are. They were not true Jews who cared for the glory of God, but they prefer the praise of men like the Pharisees who feared to confess Christ.
2. "From the only God" - B and W omit Œ∏ŒµŒøœÖ which is certainly meant even if not genuine here. See John 17:3; Romans 16:27; 1 Timothy 6:15.

### John Gill:
1. "How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another?"
2. "Doing all they did to be seen of men, and to gain applause among them."
3. "Many who were convinced that he was the Messiah, durst not confess him, lest they should lose their honour and respect among men, which they preferred to the praise of God."

### John Wesley:
1. "While ye receive honour ‚Äî That is, while ye seek the praise of men rather than the praise of God."
2. "At the feast of pentecost, kept in commemoration of the giving the law from Mount Sinai, their sermons used to be full of the praises of the law, and of the people to whom it was given."
3. "How mortifying then must the following words of our Lord be to them, while they were thus exulting in Moses and his law!"
