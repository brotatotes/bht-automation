# John 5:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Though Christ does not come to condemn or accuse, there is one that does - the Law itself. The Law, in which the Jews placed their hope, stands as an accuser, charging them with the violation of its precepts. Sin, as a transgression of the law, brings about the accusations brought forth by the very law they have trusted in. Christ, however, offers salvation and does not seek to condemn, exemplifying his role as a Surety, Saviour, Advocate, and Judge.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

### John Calvin:
1. "There are few persons, indeed, who openly mock God, but there are very many who, believing that God, whom they oppose as enemies, is gracious to them, amuse themselves at their ease with empty flatteries."
2. "Thus, in the present day, our Giants, though they wickedly trample under foot the whole doctrine of Christ, haughtily plume themselves on being the intimate friends of God."
3. "Let us also learn from it, that we ought not to glory in the Scriptures without a good reason; for if we do not honor the Son of God by the true obedience of faith, all whom God hath raised up to be his witnesses will rise up against us as accusers at the last day."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Think not (μη δοκειτε). Prohibition with μη and the present imperative. See on verse John 5:39 for δοκεω for mistaken opinions in John."
2. "I will accuse you (εγω κατηγορησω υμων). Emphasis on εγω (I). Future active indicative of κατηγορεω (κατα, against, αγορευω, to speak in the assembly αγορα, to bring an accusation in court, a public accusation). See Romans 3:9 for προαιτιαομα for making previous charge and Luke 16:1 for διαβαλλω, a secret malicious accusation, and Romans 8:33 for εγκαλεω, for public charge, not necessarily before tribunal."
3. "On whom ye have set your hope (εις ον υμεις ηλπικατε). Perfect active indicative of ελπιζω, state of repose in Moses. Only example of ελπιζω in John. See 2 Corinthians 1:10 for use of εις with ελπιζω instead of the usual επ (1 Timothy 4:10)."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ is no accuser of men no, not of the worst of men... to be an accuser is not agreeable to his characters of a Surety, a Saviour, an Advocate, and Judge."
2. "Though he hints these things to them, he would not have them think that he accused them of them to the Father... there were enough to accuse these persons of."
3. "There is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust... sin being a transgression of the law, this same law brings charges against them, and accuses them of the breach of the several precepts of it."

### John Wesley:
1. There is one that accuseth you — By his writings.
