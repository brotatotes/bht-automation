# John 5:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The authority of Moses in the Old Testament was highly regarded among the Jews, and they firmly believed that his writings were the word of God. However, despite their reverence for these writings, they did not truly believe in the truths regarding Christ that were contained within them. Jesus acknowledges this tension and emphasizes that while Moses was a faithful servant, He Himself is the Son who holds a greater position in God's house. It is understandable that they would be more willing to accept what Moses had written, given their disdain for Jesus of Nazareth.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Men give greater weight to what is written and published, the letter of a book, than to mere word of mouth."
2. "If then you believe not what he has written, which comes down to you hallowed by the reverence of ages, how can you believe the words which are uttered by Me, to whom you are hostile?"
3. "If your unbelief has stopped the path, how shall you arrive at Him to whom it leads?"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "A remarkable contrast, not absolutely exalting Old Testament Scripture above His own words, but pointing to the office of those venerable documents to prepare Christ's way, to the necessity universally felt for documentary testimony in revealed religion."
2. "Perhaps (as STIER adds) to the relation which the comparative 'letter' of the Old Testament holds to the more flowing 'words' of 'spirit and life' which characterize the New Testament."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If ye believe not his writings - If you do not credit what he has written which you profess to believe, it is not to be expected that you will believe my declarations."
2. "We have in this chapter an instance of the profound and masterly manner in which Jesus could meet and silence his enemies."
3. "No one can read this without being struck with his profound wisdom; and it is scarcely possible to conceive that there could be a more distinct declaration and proof that he was equal with God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "It is important to understand the precise sense of this word, because it goes to determine whether Jesus intended an antithesis between Moses' writings and His own words, or simply between Moses and Himself." 
2. "The tendency of such exegesis was often toward mystical and allegorical interpretation, degenerating into a petty ingenuity in fixing new and recondite meanings upon the old and familiar forms."
3. "It seems to me, therefore, that the antithesis between the writings of Moses, superstitiously reverenced in the letter, and minutely and critically searched and expounded by the Jews, and the living words, is to be recognized."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ appears here to claim less authority for himself than for Moses; and yet we know that heaven and earth have been shaken by the voice of the Gospel."
2. "But Christ accommodates his discourse to those to whom he speaks; for the authority of the Law was, beyond all controversy, held sacred among the Jews; and thus it was impossible that Christ should be inferior to Moses."
3. "To the same purpose is the contrast between writings and words; for he shows their unbelief to be more aggravated, because the truth of God, recorded in an authentic form, has no authority with them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If however they did not truly believe the written word, which was constantly in their hands, which was the object of so much reverence, which, as written, could be studied again and again for the removal of every difficulty and the investigation of every claim..." 
2. "Then might it well be expected that they would refuse to receive the words which Jesus spoke."
