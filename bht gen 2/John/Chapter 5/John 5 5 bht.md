# John 5:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This man had been weak for thirty-eight years, a long duration that had left him without hope for a cure. It is unclear what specifically caused his weakness, but it disabled him from walking and had been present for a significant period of time. The pool of Bethesda, although known for its healing properties, had lost its effectiveness due to the Israelites' blasphemy of the Lord. Nonetheless, the sudden transformation of this man's condition through the power of Christ serves to captivate and move the witnesses who beheld it.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There are two ways of taking the construction of ἔχων: (1) to regard ἔχων ἐν τῇ ἀσθ. as = ἀσθενῶς ἔχων, and τριάκοντα ὀκτὼ ἔτη as the accus. of duration; which is objectionable on account of the article τῇ, (not on account of the present participle, as De Wette, for it is often found with duration of time,) and as being alien from John’s usage"  (2) to place ἔχω in this sense with an accusative of the time: see reff., and John 5:6."
2. "So that the construction is ἔχων τριάκ. ὀκτὼ ἔτη ἐν τῇ ἀσθ."
