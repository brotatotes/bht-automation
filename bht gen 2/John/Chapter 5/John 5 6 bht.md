# John 5:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our Lord, having superhuman knowledge, singled out the man lying helplessly and in desperate need of healing. He knew the circumstances and previous history of his case. Jesus, with compassion in His heart, asked the man if he truly desired to be made well. This question was not meant to doubt but to ignite hope and expectation in the man's despondent heart. Jesus' address was pertinent, sympathetic, and aimed at deepening the man's sense of helplessness and desire for healing.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Our Lord singled him out, being conscious of the circumstances under which he lay there, by that superhuman knowledge of which we had so striking an example in the case of the woman of Samaria."
2. "The question is one of those by which He so frequently testified his compassion, and established (so to speak) a point of connexion between the spirit of the person addressed and his own gracious purposes."
3. "Possibly it may have conveyed to the mind of the poor cripple the idea that at length a compassionate person had come, who might put him in at the next troubling of the water."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He doubtless visited the spot just to perform this cure, so He knows where to find His patient, and the whole previous history of his case."
2. "Could anyone doubt that a sick man would like to be made whole, or that the patients came thither, and this man had returned again and again, just in hope of a cure? But our Lord asked the question."
