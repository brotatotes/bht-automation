# John 5:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The man's response to the question subtly indicates his desire to be healed, while also explaining the hindrance he faced in obtaining his cure. Despite his efforts, he lacked the assistance or means required to be the first one to enter the troubled waters, which was believed to bring healing. This demonstrates the man's helpless state and his longing for someone to come to his aid.

### John Calvin:

2. "He displays his hand from hidden places, and thus shows how far his goodness goes beyond the narrow limits of our faith."
3. "However long, therefore, we may be held in suspense, though we groan under our distresses, let us never be discouraged by the tediousness of the lengthened period; for, when our afflictions are long continued, though we discover no termination of them, still we ought always to believe that God is a wonderful deliverer."

3. "The very extremity of his need rendered unavailing his repeated efforts to be the first to reach the waters when the mysterious troubling had taken place."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "When the water is troubled (οταν ταραχθη το υδωρ). Indefinite temporal clause with οταν and the first aorist passive subjunctive of ταρασσω, old verb to agitate (Matthew 2:3)."
2. "The popular belief was that, at each outflow of this intermittent spring, there was healing power in the water for the first one getting in."

### John Wesley:
1. "The sick man answered — Giving the reason why he was not made whole, notwithstanding his desire."
