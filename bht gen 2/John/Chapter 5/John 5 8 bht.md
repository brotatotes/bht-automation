# John 5:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus commanded the man to rise from his bed where he lay in one of the porches. By saying Take up thy bed and walk, Jesus demonstrated his divine power, just as when he called Lazarus out of his grave. These words had a profound effect on the man, who was previously weak and helpless. Through this miracle, Jesus not only physically healed him but also strengthened his faith.
