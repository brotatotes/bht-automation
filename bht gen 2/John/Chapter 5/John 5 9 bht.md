# John 5:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The man, once paralyzed, took up his bed and walked, demonstrating both the power of Jesus' healing and the man's immediate obedience to His command. This action not only showcased the immediate restoration of the man's health, but also symbolized taking up the cross, carrying the burden of sin and death, and walking by faith in Christ. This intentional act performed on the Sabbath further emphasized Jesus' authority and His willingness to challenge societal norms for the sake of displaying God's glory.
