# John 6:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After a series of events in Jerusalem, Jesus traveled to the sea of Galilee, also known as the lake of Gennesaret. This lake, described by Pliny as sixteen miles long and six broad, was adorned with charming towns. It was from the city of Tiberias, constructed by Herod and named after Tiberius Caesar, that the sea derived its name. This specific location is emphasized by Luke, who distinguishes it as the eastern Bethsaida, or Julias, rather than the western Bethsaida mentioned in Mark 6:45.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The fragmentary character of this Gospel as relates to mere narration...His Ministry principally took place in Galilee."
2. "The last appellation is probably inserted for the sake of Gentile readers...more usually called...Γεννησάρ or Γεννησαρῖτις."
3. "But at all events we must not adopt the reading of [88] &c., εἰς τὰ μέρη τ. Τιβ., for the fact was just otherwise."

### Albert Barnes:

### John Calvin:
1. "The other Evangelists (Matthew 14:13; Mark 6:32; Luke 9:10) state that this happened shortly after the death of John the Baptist, by which circumstance of time they point out the cause of Christ’s departure; for when tyrants have once imbrued their hands in the blood of the godly, they kindle into greater cruelty, in the same manner as intemperate drinking aggravates the thirst of drunkards."
2. "Christ therefore intended to abate the rage of Herod by his absence."
3. "When he adds that it was called the Sea of Tiberias, he explains more fully the place to which Christ withdrew; for the whole lake did not bear that name, but only that part of it which lay contiguous to the bank on which Tiberias was situated."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The three Evangelists seem to have been led rather to give a full description of certain parts than an outline of the whole of our Lord’s ministry in Galilee." 
2. "To say nothing of the wonderful miracles wrought in Capernaum and in other places on the coast of the sea of Galilee, to this interval belong the appointment of the twelve apostles, the Sermon on the Mount, the Parables of the kingdom of heaven, the death of John the Baptist in the castle of Machaerus."
3. "Nothing, we may add, can more strikingly illustrate the twofold character of our Lord’s teaching, as addressed to ‘the Jews’ and the doctors of the law on the one hand and to the multitudes of Galilee on the other, than a comparison of the discourse in Jerusalem which we have just considered with the Sermon and the Parables spoken but a few days later."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A whole year may intervene between the events of chapter 5 in Jerusalem and those in chapter 6 in Galilee."
2. "The feeding of the five thousand is the only event before the last visit to Jerusalem recorded in all Four Gospels."
3. "Luke explains that it was the eastern Bethsaida (Julias) to which Jesus took the disciples, not the western Bethsaida of Mark 6:45 in Galilee."

### John Gill:
1. "After these things, in process of time, Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, the same with the lake of Gennesaret."
2. "Pliny, who calls it the lake of Genesara, says, 'it was sixteen miles long, and six broad, and was beset with very pleasant towns.'"
3. "And from the city of Tiberias built by Herod, and called so in honor of Tiberius Caesar, the sea took its name."
