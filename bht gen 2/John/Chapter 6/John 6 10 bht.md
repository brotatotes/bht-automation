# John 6:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples were directed by Christ to have the people sit down on the ground and arrange them in rows by hundreds and fifties, as if preparing for a meal. It was noted that there was plenty of green grass in the place, making it a comfortable spot to sit. Notably, the men were mentioned separately, indicating that they sat down first, while there were also women and children present. It is astonishing to think that with just one loaf, they managed to feed a multitude of over a thousand people.
