# John 6:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
And Jesus took the loaves and fishes in his hands, ready to feed the multitude with them. Then, he gave thanks for them, imploring a blessing upon the food so that it may nourish the bodies of those who partake in it, just as he used to do. Jesus then distributed the food to his disciples, and they, in turn, distributed it to those who were seated and waiting to be fed.

### Henry Alford:
1. "John describes the διάδοσις as being the act of the Lord Himself, and leaves the intervention of the disciples to be understood."

3. "John seems to connect with it the idea brought out by Luke, εὐλ. αὐτούς, i.e. τοὺς ἄρτους: see John 6:23."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "All the Synoptists relate his looking up to heaven and blessing."

### John Calvin:

2. "However done, the work of distribution was really His, and the Evangelist would fix our thoughts on Him alone."
3. "This would seem to show that the word is here used with intentional significance, probably with marked reference to the Paschal meal, at which thanksgiving played so important a part."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The loaves (τους αρτους). Those of verse John 6:9."
