# John 6:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the disciples were completely satisfied and had eaten as much as they wanted, Jesus spoke to them, telling them to gather up the remaining fragments so that nothing would be wasted. This command not only demonstrated the magnitude of the miracle, but also emphasized the importance of not being wasteful and being mindful of the abundance that God provides. It showed that even in times of plenty, we should be careful not to squander or lose the blessings that we have received.
