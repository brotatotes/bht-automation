# John 6:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples gathered the remaining fragments of the five barley loaves, filling twelve baskets, symbolizing the abundance and provision of God. The details of the gathering and the mention of the lad who provided the loaves emphasize the miraculous nature of the event. The use of sturdy baskets, in contrast to the softer baskets used in another miracle, points to the significance of the feeding of the five thousand. The immense multiplication of the loaves signifies the divine power and the blessing of God upon His people.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. "John goes into fuller detail than the Synoptists. Mark alone notes the gathering of the remains of the fishes." 
2. "John also uses ejgemisan, filled, for they took up, or were taken up, of the Synoptists." 
3. "Five barley loaves. A detail peculiar to John, emphasizing the identity of the fragments with the original loaves."

### John Calvin:
1. "Since, therefore, a smaller quantity is sufficient for a greater number of men, and since the quantity left is nearly double, hence we see more clearly of what value is that blessing of God, against the sight of which we deliberately shut our eyes."
2. "We ought also to observe, in passing, that though Christ commands them to fill the baskets for illustrating the miracle, yet he likewise exhorts his disciples to frugality, when he says, Gather the fragments which are left, that nothing may be lost; for the increase of the bounty of God ought not to be an excitement to luxury."
3. "Let those, therefore, who have abundance, remember that they will one day render an account of their immoderate wealth, if they do not carefully and faithfully apply their superfluity to purposes which are good, and of which God approves."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The repetition of the words, ‘the five barley loaves,’ is remarkable; the writer wishes to lay emphasis on the identity of the fragments with the loaves of the original supply." 
2. "Nor is it fanciful to see in this a token that what was symbolized by the precious bread was destined for each tribe of Israel."
3. "John’s agreement with the other Evangelists in so minute a point as the use of cophinus in connection with this miracle is interesting and important."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Twelve baskets (δωδεκα κοφινους). One for each of the apostles. What about the lad?"
2. "Stout wicker baskets (coffins, Wycliff) in distinction from the soft and frail σφυριδες used at the feeding of the four thousand."
3. "The same distinction between κοφινο and σφυριδες is preserved in the allusion to the incidents by Jesus."

### John Gill:
1. "The several broken bits of bread...which the people had left, after they had been sufficiently refreshed."
2. "Every disciple had a basket filled: with the fragments of the five barley loaves."
3. "Such a marvelous increase was there, through the power of Christ going along with them."
