# John 6:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the people witnessed the extraordinary miracle performed by Jesus, where He fed a multitude with a small amount of food and collected an abundance of leftovers, they began to recognize that He might be the long-awaited Prophet who was foretold by Moses in Deuteronomy 18:15. The ancient Jews understood this prophecy to refer to the Messiah, and they believed that Jesus fulfilled this expectation through the remarkable miracle He worked. In fact, they acknowledged that Jesus not only resembled Moses but was even greater than him, solidifying their belief that He was indeed the Prophet, the true Messiah.
