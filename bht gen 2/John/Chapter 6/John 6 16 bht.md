# John 6:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When evening came, the disciples were constrained by their Master to leave and go down to the sea. This was likely to disperse the crowd and to give Jesus an opportunity for solitary prayer. Reluctantly, the disciples embarked at night, leaving Jesus alone on the mountain. Delaying their departure in hopes of Jesus joining them, they let darkness fall. The late hour of evening was significant, distinguishing it from the mid-afternoon mentioned earlier. As the last of the evenings, night was approaching, and the disciples obediently went down to the sea.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ὀψία, here, will be during the time between the ὀψία of Matthew 14:15, and that of ib. Matthew 14:23. [The Jews commonly reckoned two evenings: see the introductory note on Matthew 26:17-19.]"
2. "κατέβησαν by the command of Jesus (Matt., Mark)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "constrained" to do so by their Master
(Matthew 14:22; Mark 6:45),
in order to put an end to the misdirected excitement in His favor
(John 6:15), into which the
disciples themselves may have been somewhat drawn.
2. The word
"constrained" implies reluctance on their part, perhaps
from unwillingness to part with their Master and embark at night,
leaving Him alone on the mountain.
3. They probably lingered in hopes of His still joining them,
and so let the darkness come on.

### Marvin Vincent:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Before Jesus retired to the mountain He had constrained His disciples to leave Him for the shore."
