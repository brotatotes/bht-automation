# John 6:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples found themselves in a difficult situation, with darkness falling and a storm brewing. As they waited for Jesus on the shore, they soon realized that he had not yet come to them. So, they made the decision to set sail without him, which must have been unsettling. The tense of the verses vividly captures the urgency and discomfort they experienced. They set their course from Bethsaida towards Capernaum, but little did they know what awaited them on their journey.

### Henry Alford:
1. "It would appear as if the disciples were lingering along shore with the expectation of taking in Jesus: but night had fallen, and He had not come to them, and the sea began to be stormy."
2. "Having therefore set out, and rowed, &c. The οὖν seems to me to render this supposition necessary, to bind their having rowed twenty-five or thirty stadia, with the fact that the Lord had not come, and it was dark, and the sea swelling into a storm."
3. "The lake is forty stadia wide: so that, as we can hardly assume the passage to have been to a point directly opposite, they were somewhere about μέσον τῆς θαλάσσης, Matthew 26:24."
