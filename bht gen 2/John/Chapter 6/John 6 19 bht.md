# John 6:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples found themselves in a difficult situation, battling against the contrary wind without the use of their sails and relying solely on their oars. Throughout the long night, they labored, rowing from the darkness until the early hours of the morning. It was during this time, as their strength waned, that they caught sight of Jesus walking on the sea, slipping closer and closer to their boat. Fear gripped their hearts as the unexpected presence of their Lord filled them with awe and trepidation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "What Job (Job 9:8) celebrates as the distinguishing prerogative of GOD, 'WHO ALONE spreadeth out the heavens, and TREADETH UPON THE WAVES OF THE SEA'—What AGUR challenges as GOD'S unapproachable prerogative, to 'GATHER THE WIND IN HIS FISTS, and BIND THE WATERS IN A GARMENT'—lo! this is here done in flesh, by 'THE SON OF MAN.'" 
2. "yet as though He 'would have passed by them,' Proverbs 30:4- : (compare Luke 24:28; Genesis 18:3; Genesis 18:5; Genesis 32:24-26)." 
3. "He would appear to them at first like a dark moving speck upon the waters; then as a human figure, but—in the dark tempestuous sky, and not dreaming that it could be their Lord—they take it for a spirit. (How often thus we miscall our chiefest mercies—not only thinking them distant when they are near, but thinking the best the worst!)"

### Marvin Vincent:
