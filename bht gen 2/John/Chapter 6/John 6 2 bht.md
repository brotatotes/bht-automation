# John 6:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The great multitude followed Jesus, not primarily for his teachings, but because they had seen the miracles he performed on the sick. Their motivation for following him was either curiosity or the desire to be healed in their bodies. Their actions reveal the tendency of human nature to seek physical well-being and immediate gratification rather than embracing the spiritual truths Jesus taught.
