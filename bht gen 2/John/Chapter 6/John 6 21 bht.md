# John 6:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples' initial fears turned into awe and joy as Jesus arrived, reassuring them with His voice. The remarkable timing of their arrival at the shore aligned perfectly with their desire to receive Him, and it was clear that this was no ordinary occurrence but a divine intervention. Their astonishment at this miraculous journey was further heightened by the fact that the ship had swiftly reached the exact destination they had intended. They were comforted by the knowledge that Jesus, who was both willing and capable, had come to their aid in their time of distress.

3. "The verb has the sense of retiring from something."

2. "Both Jesus and Peter climbed into the boat."
3. "Whither they were going (εις ην υπηγον). Progressive imperfect active, 'to which land they had been going' (intransitive use of υπαγω, to lead under, to go under or away as in verse John 6:67; John 7:33; John 12:11; John 18:8)."
