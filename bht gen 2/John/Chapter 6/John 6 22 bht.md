# John 6:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The crowd that had witnessed the miracle of the loaves and had remained near the scene of the miracle overnight eagerly awaited Jesus. Though they saw no boat on the shore, save a little one too small for the twelve disciples, they knew that Jesus had not gone across with his disciples. So they stayed behind, hoping to meet him in the morning. Their astonishment was great when they discovered that Jesus had made it to Capernaum miraculously.
