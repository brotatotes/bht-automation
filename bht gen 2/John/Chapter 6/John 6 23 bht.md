# John 6:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The multitude that had followed Jesus to the east side and been miraculously fed, came back from Tiberias in boats near the place of the previous day's miraculous feeding. These boats, which were from Tiberias, made it known that Jesus and His disciples had not traveled there. The place where the miracle of the loaves occurred would later become a renowned center of Jewish learning and the seat of the Sanhedrin. The multiplication of the bread and the nourishment it provided were brought about through the power of Christ and His blessing.
