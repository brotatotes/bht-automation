# John 6:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people, eagerly searching for Jesus, noticed that there was only one boat on the east side, the one the disciples had used, and Jesus had not gone on board. They acted on this information, going to the usual place of taking boats, realizing that Jesus had gone to Capernaum, His ordinary place of residence. They were motivated by curiosity and their hopes for another bountiful meal, as they had witnessed His power before. Their diligent search and observation of the disciples' movements revealed their desire to be close to Jesus, who had performed wonders in their midst.
