# John 6:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people, astonished at finding Jesus in Capernaum, addressed him as Rabbi, recognizing him as a revered teacher. They were perplexed, having searched for him on the other side of the lake and unable to comprehend how he could have arrived in Capernaum by ship or on foot so quickly. Their inquiry about the timing and means of his arrival reveals their eagerness to understand the miracle that had drawn them to follow him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "πέραν τ. θαλ. is now the west bank; we have been crossing the sea with the multitude."
2. "πότε, as Stier remarks, includes πῶς in its meaning."
3. "Our Lord leaves the question unanswered, because it was not for a sign to these people that He had miraculously crossed the lake."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Astonished at His being there, and wondering how He could have accomplished it..."
2. "They could not see how, unless He had travelled all night round the head of the lake alone, He could have reached Capernaum..."
3. "Even then, how He could have arrived before themselves."

### John Calvin:
1. "We must not understand him as if its position were directly across, but because, at the lower extremity, the lake made a large winding, and, on account of the bay that intervened, it was impossible to go by land without a very circuitous journey."
2. "The Evangelist therefore says, on the other side of the sea, adopting the mode of expression used by the common people, because the only direct and ordinary mode of conveyance was by a boat."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The ‘other side’ denotes the western coast. Their question on finding Jesus in Capernaum but partly expresses their thoughts, which would rest as much on the how as on the ‘when’ of His coming to this place."
2. "He had not left the eastern shore with His disciples; the storm of the night must have forbidden any attempt to make the passage then; and, as they well knew, He had not come to the western shore in their company."
3. "The question is not answered, but the eager search which it implied is made to lead the way to deeper instruction as to the miracle which had drawn them to follow Him."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "When they found him (ευροντες αυτον). Second aorist active participle of ευρισκω. Found him after search and in the synagogue as John explains (verse John 6:59) in Capernaum, perhaps that very synagogue built by a centurion (Luke 7:5)."
2. "Rabbi (Ραββε). See on John 1:38 for this courteous title."
3. "When camest thou hither? (ποτε ωδε γεγονασ;). Second perfect active indicative of γινομα. 'When hast thou come?' We sought you anxiously on the other side of the lake and could not see how you came across (verses John 6:22-24)."

### John Gill:
1. "They said unto him, Rabbi; or 'master', a name now much in use with the Jewish doctors, and by which they delighted to be called." 
2. "and these men being convinced by the miracle, that Christ was that prophet that should come, honour him with this title." 
3. "they could not devise how he should get there by shipping, and also how he should so soon get there on foot."
