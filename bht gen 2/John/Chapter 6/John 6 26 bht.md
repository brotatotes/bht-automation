# John 6:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
You do not seek me because you saw signs. What you saw in my works was only marvels, Jesus says. You did not see in them tokens of my divine power and mission. He rebukes those who sought Him for their own worldly advantage instead of the spiritual and everlasting good of their souls. Our Lord does not satisfy their curiosity but corrects the wrong motive they had in seeking Him. He desires to lead them to a deeper understanding of His character and work, prompting them to seek the kingdom of God and His righteousness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The seeking Him, on the part of these people, to Him, who saw the hearts, was merely a low desire to profit by His wonderful works, not a reasonable consequence of deduction from His miracles that He was the Saviour of the world."
2. "And from this low desire of mere satisfaction of their carnal appetite, He takes occasion in the following discourse to raise them to spiritual desire after HIMSELF, THE BREAD OF LIFE."
3. "The discourse forms a parallel with that in ch. 4."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Ye seek Me not because ye saw the miracles"â€”literally, "the signs," that is, supernatural tokens of a higher presence and a divine commission, "but because ye did eat of the loaves and were filled."
2. "We should have supposed all that follows to have been delivered by the wayside, or wherever they happened first to meet. But from John 6:59 we gather that they had probably met about the door of the synagogueâ€”"for that was the day in which they assembled in their synagogues" [LIGHTFOOT]â€”and that on being asked, at the close of the service, if He had any word of exhortation to the people, He had taken the two breads, the perishing and the living bread, for the subject of His profound and extraordinary discourse."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The miracles which Jesus performed were proofs that he came from God."
2. "To seek him because they had seen them, and were convinced by them that he was the Messiah, would have been proper; but to follow him simply because their wants were supplied was mere selfishness of a gross kind."
3. "Religion does not forbid our regarding our own happiness, or seeking it in any proper way; but when this is the only or the prevailing motive, it is evident that we have never yet sought God aright."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Jesus says: You do not seek me because you saw signs. What you saw in my works was only marvels."
2. "You did not see in them tokens of my divine power and mission."
3. "Were filled."

### John Calvin:
1. "His meaning was, that they did not profit by the works of God as they ought to have done; for the true way of profiting would have been to acknowledge Christ as the Messiah in such a manner as to surrender themselves to be taught and governed by him, and, under his guidance, to aspire to the heavenly kingdom of God."
2. "This is to rob Christ of his chief power; for the reason why he was given by the Father and revealed himself to men is, that he may form them anew after the image of God by giving them his Holy Spirit, and that he may conduct them to eternal life by clothing them with his righteousness."
3. "In seeking Christ, therefore, the chief point is, to despise the world and seek the kingdom of God and his righteousness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Those who had eaten of the loaves saw in the miracle the proof that Jesus was the Prophet who should come: they saw that the wonder was significant, but the words before us show that even this stood below the true perception of the â€˜sign.â€™"
2. "The design of the work in its relation to the Saviour was to manifest His glory as the Giver of the highest blessings; in its relation to the people, to fix their eyes on Him and to awaken their desire for that of which the bread had been the sign."
3. "He must now so complete their training that they may be led to leave the carnal and seek the spiritual, that they may be brought to behold in His deeds not merely the tokens of His power to satisfy every earthly desire of His followers, but the impress of His Divine character and work."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They had seen the 'signs' wrought by Jesus, but this one had led to wild fanaticism and complete failure to grasp the spiritual lessons." 
2. "Ye were filled. They were more concerned with hungry stomachs than with hungry souls. It was a sharp and deserved rebuke."

### John Gill:
1. "Not willing to gratify their curiosity; and knowing from what principles, and with what views they sought after him, and followed him; and willing to let them know that he knew them, being the searcher of hearts." 
2. "Their view being their own worldly advantages, and not the spiritual and everlasting good of their souls, and the real interest of a Redeemer."
3. "Hence the following advice."

### John Wesley:
1. "Our Lord does not satisfy their curiosity, but corrects the wrong motive they had in seeking him: because ye did eat - Merely for temporal advantage."
2. "Hitherto Christ had been gathering hearers: he now begins to try their sincerity, by a figurative discourse concerning his passion, and the fruit of it, to be received by faith."
