# John 6:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people inquired about what they should do to work the works of God, seeking to know what actions would be pleasing to Him. They understood that it was not about earthly matters, but about attaining something higher. It is important to note that doing something to merit salvation is a concept deeply ingrained in the human heart, and the people's question reflects this inclination. However, the response lies not in our own works, but in aligning ourselves with the works that are pleasing to God.
