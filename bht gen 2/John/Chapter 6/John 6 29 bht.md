# John 6:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believing in Jesus is the work that God desires from us, and it is the foundation of all other good works. It is the one thing that is most pleasing to God, and without it, all other works are in vain. Jesus teaches us that faith is not only the prerequisite to acceptable obedience, but it is also the proper spring of it. By believing in Jesus and putting our trust in Him, we are doing the work that God requires, and through this act of faith, we find salvation.

3. "It is idle sophistry, under the pretext of this passage, to maintain that we are justified by works if faith justifies because it is likewise called a work... faith brings nothing to God but, on the contrary, places man before God as empty and poor, that he may be filled with Christ and with his grace."
