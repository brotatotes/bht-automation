# John 6:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus went up the mountain, possibly the hill country by the shore of the lake, for multiple reasons. It was a place of retreat, offering both security from Herod's cruelty and privacy for conversation with his disciples. Sitting with his disciples, he followed the Jewish custom of teaching and instructing them. So, Jesus ascended the mountain to find refuge, connect with his disciples, and fulfill his purpose according to the will of God.
