# John 6:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Despite witnessing the miraculous signs performed by Jesus, the people doubted his claims and sought even greater proof of his authority. This lack of faith reflected their ingratitude towards God and their blindness to the power they had witnessed firsthand. Their request for another sign demonstrated their dismissive attitude towards the miracles they had already seen. It is astonishing that they would ask for additional evidence, considering the profound claims Jesus had just made.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But how could they ask 'a sign,' when many of them scarce a day before had witnessed such a 'sign' as had never till then been vouchsafed to men?" 
2. "The truth seems to be that they were confounded by the novel claims which our Lord had just advanced. In proposing to make Him a king, it was for far other purposes than dispensing to the world the bread of an everlasting life; and when He seemed to raise His claims even higher still, by representing it as the grand 'work of God,' that they should believe on Himself as His Sent One, they saw very clearly that He was making a demand upon them beyond anything they were prepared to accord to Him, and beyond all that man had ever before made."
3. "Hence their question, 'What dost Thou work?'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "What sign showest thou? - On the word sign, compare the notes at Isaiah 7:14. What miracle dost thou work to prove that thou art the Messiah?"
2. "It seems wonderful that they should so soon ask for further evidence that he was sent from God."
3. "Those men were continually asking for signs and proofs that he was the Messiah."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "This wickedness abundantly proves how truly it is said elsewhere, This wicked generation seeketh a sign... Whence came such sudden forgetfulness, but because they are ungrateful to God, and, through their own malice, are blind to his power, which is before their eyes?"
2. "Nor can it be doubted that they treat disdainfully all the miracles which they had already beheld, because Christ does not comply with their wishes, and because they do not find him to be what they imagined him to be."
3. "If he had given them expectation of earthly happiness, he would have been highly applauded by them; they would undoubtedly have hailed him as a Prophet, and the Messiah, and the Son of God; but now, because he blames them for being too much addicted to the flesh, they think that they ought not to listen to him any more."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The words of Jesus had now become too plain to be misunderstood."
2. "Such a claim no other prophet had ever made; such a claim can only be justified by some special sign which no one can challenge or mistake; and the sign must correspond with the claim."
3. "Before they can believe Him when He thus speaks... some sign equal to the greatest wrought by Moses, or even some greater sign, must be displayed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus had said that they did not understand his signs."
2. "It is hard to have patience with this superficial and almost sneering mob."
3. "They not simply depreciate the miracle of the day before, but set up a standard for Jesus."

### John Gill:
1. "The people of the Jews were always requiring signs and wonders, and when they had one and another shown them, they still sought for more, and were never satisfied."
2. "These men had lately seen various signs and miracles of Christ...yet now, at least some of them, begin to retract, and signify, that unless some other, and greater signs were shown, they should not believe in him as the Messiah."
3. "They seem to make light of the miracle of the loaves, or at least require some greater sign and miracle, to engage their belief in him as the Messiah."

### John Wesley:
1. What sign dost thou? â€” Amazing, after what they had just seen!
