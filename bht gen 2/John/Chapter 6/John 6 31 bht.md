# John 6:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jews objected to Jesus, claiming that while He fed five thousand with barley loaves and fish, their ancestors, numbering in the hundreds of thousands, were fed with the heavenly manna for forty years. They saw this miracle of Moses as superior to Jesus feeding them. However, Jesus clarifies that while Moses gave them earthly manna, He is the true bread from heaven, coming down from the highest heaven. He emphasizes this point multiple times to highlight His divine origin and the spiritual nourishment He offers.
