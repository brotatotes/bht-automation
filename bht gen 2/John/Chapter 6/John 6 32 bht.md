# John 6:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The true bread from heaven is not like the manna given by Moses, for that bread only nourishes the body, while the true bread from heaven is meant to sustain and save the soul. It is not a mere symbolic representation, but a real and heavenly provision given by the Father. This bread, which is Jesus Himself, is what gives true life and sets humanity apart from other creatures. It is a gift of pure grace, not earned through works or merits.

2. "In this passage, truth is not contrasted with shadows... but Christ considers what is the true life of man, or, in other words, what it is that makes him different from brute beasts, and excellent among the creatures."
3. "We see how variously Paul speaks about circumcision... [Christ] does not inquire what it was that was prefigured by the manna, but maintains that the bread with which Moses fed their bellies was not true bread."
