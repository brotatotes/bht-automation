# John 6:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The bread of God points out Christ himself - the bread of God, who is of God's providing. He gives life unto the world - both a spiritual life and eternal life. This offer is not limited to one people or generation, but extended to the whole world. Although Jesus doesn't explicitly say I am that bread, his words lead the Jews to respond respectfully.

### John Calvin:
1. "The heavenly bread is that which hath come down from heaven to give life to the world...and therefore, the manna was not the heavenly bread."
2. "In the coming down from heaven two things are worthy of observation; first, that we have a Divine life in Christ, because he has come from God to be the Author of life to us; secondly, that the heavenly life is near us, so that we do not need to fly above the clouds or to cross the sea."
3. "This passage teaches that the whole world is dead to God, except so far as Christ quickens it, because life will be found nowhere else than in him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The very word 'come down' is used in the account of the manna; and the answer of the multitude in John 6:34 seems to show that no new and (to them) strange thought has come in since the mention of the Father's gift." 
2. "In John 6:27 the Son of man is He who gives eternal life; here it is the bread of God that giveth life unto the world. The last word is very significant. The manna had been for 'the fathers;' the true bread is for the world."
