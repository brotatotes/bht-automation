# John 6:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Lord, evermore give us this bread; that is so divine and heavenly, and has such a quickening virtue in it. These words express the earnest desire of a soul that is aware of its famishing condition and its need for Christ, the bread of life. To those who have tasted how good this bread is, their longing is to always be supplied with it and to live upon it. Although the request for this bread may still be understood literally, it signifies that they are drawing closer to believing in its true significance as the sustenance that brings everlasting life.
