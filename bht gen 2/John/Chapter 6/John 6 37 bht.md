# John 6:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
All those who recognize their need for salvation and respond to the calling of the Father are given to the Son in a special way. Anyone who goes to Jesus and seeks him in faith will not be rejected, but instead will receive forgiveness, holiness, and the promise of eternal life. However, it is important to persevere and endure in this faith until the end, to continue rejoicing in the light of Christ's truth.

### Henry Alford:
1. "The whole body of believers on Christ are spoken of by Him, here and in ch. 17, as given to Him by the Father."
2. "Hinc illud in xvii. 2, ut omne quod dedisti ei, det eis vitam æternam."
3. "ἔξω does not refer here to the office of the Son of God as Judge; but is another way of expressing the grace and readiness with which He will receive all who come to Him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Though ye, as I told you, have no faith in Me, My errand into the world shall in no wise be defeated for all that the Father giveth Me shall infallibly come to Me."

3. "Only it is not the simply willing, but the actually coming, whom He will not cast out; for the word here employed usually denotes arrival."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Father giveth me - We here learn that those who come to Christ, and who will be saved, are given to him by God." 
2. "To come to one implies our need of help, our confidence that he can aid us, and our readiness to trust to him."
3. "This invitation is wide, and full, and free. It shows the unbounded mercy of God; and it shows, also, that the reason, and the only reason, why men are not saved, is that they will not come to Christ."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "All believers are regarded as one complete whole." 
2. "Emphasizing the idea of reaching or arriving."

### John Calvin:
1. "His intention, therefore, in distinguishing here between the elect and the reprobate is, that the authority of his doctrine may remain unimpaired, though there are many who do not believe it."
2. "Christ meets this offense, when he affirms, that all those who do not believe are not his own, and that we need not wonder if such persons have no relish for the word of God, but that it is embraced by all the children of God."
3. "This is added for the consolation of the godly, that they may be fully persuaded that they have free access to Christ by faith, and that, as soon as they have placed themselves under his protection and safeguard, they will be graciously received by him."

2. "The gift of the Father must not be understood by us in the sense of a predestinating decree. Both here and in the other passages of this Gospel where we read of the Father as giving to the Son His people, it is the moral and spiritual state of the heart that is thought of under the word."
3. "The test, then, of this work in the heart is the coming to Christ. The two words 'come' in this verse are different: in the first instance the meaning is 'shall reach me;' in the second we might almost render the words 'he that is coming towards me.'"

### John Gill:
1. "And though Christ here expresses this act of his Father's in the present tense, "giveth", perhaps to signify the continuance and unchangeableness of it; yet he delivers it in the past tense, in John 6:39, "hath given"; and so all the Oriental versions render it here."
2. "And it certainly respects an act of God, antecedent to coming to Christ, and believing in him, which is a fruit and effect of electing love, as is clear from what follows."
3. "Christ will never cast them out of his affections; nor out of his arms; nor out of that family that is named of him; nor out of, and from his church, which is his body, and of which they are members; nor out of a state of justification and salvation; and therefore they shall never perish, but have everlasting life."

### John Wesley:
1. "All that feel themselves lost, and follow the drawings of the Father, he in a peculiar manner giveth to the Son."
2. "And him that thus cometh to me, I will in nowise cast out - I will give him pardon, holiness, and heaven."
3. "If he endure to the end - to rejoice in his light."
