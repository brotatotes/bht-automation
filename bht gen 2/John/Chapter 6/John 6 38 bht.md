# John 6:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ's statement of coming down from heaven does not imply physical movement, as He is an omnipresent God who fills all places with His presence. Instead, it refers to His descent through the assumption of human nature, an extraordinary act of grace and condescension. By taking on our nature and dwelling on earth, He fulfilled the will of the Father, prioritizing His mission over His own desires.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This verse shows that he came for a specific purpose, which he states in the next verse, and means that, as he came to do his Father’s will, he would be faithful to the trust."
2. "Though his hearers should reject him, yet the will of God would be accomplished in the salvation of some who should come to Him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Because I have come down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me." - The previous verse was full of the power and energy of love; but even then Jesus expresses no feeling or purpose of His own as the motive of His acts. 
2. "It may be well, however, to observe that a different preposition from that in John 6:33 is here used: here ‘from,’ for it is the work of Jesus; there ‘out of,’ for it is the heavenliness of His origin that is the prominent thought."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I am come down." - Here απο is correct rather than εκ with του ουρανου. (καταβεβηκα). Perfect active indicative of καταβαινω.
2. "Not to do." - "Not that I keep on doing" (final clause with ινα and present active subjunctive of ποιεω).
3. "But the will." - Supply ινα ποιω after αλλα, "but that I keep on doing." This is the fulness of joy for Jesus, to do his Father's will.

### John Gill:
1. "Christ is the immense, infinite, and omnipresent God, and cannot be said properly to move from place to place; for he fills all places, even heaven and earth, with his presence."
2. "This descent was by the assumption of the human nature into union with his divine person, which was an instance of amazing grace and condescension."
3. "Christ may be said to descend from heaven by that marvellous work of his, taking upon him our nature, and walking up and down on earth in the form of a servant; and which was done with this view, as he says, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me."
