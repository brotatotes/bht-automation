# John 6:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus affirms that it is the will of the Father that He should lose none of those whom the Father has given Him. This expresses the secret will of the Father in the council and covenant of grace, that Christ should not lose any of the elect who were given to Him by the Father in eternal election. However, it is important to note that there are those who may not endure to the end, as seen in the example of Judas who did not remain faithful.
