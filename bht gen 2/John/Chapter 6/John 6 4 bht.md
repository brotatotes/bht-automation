## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This will account, not for so great a multitude coming to Him, but perhaps (?) for the circumstance that the people at that time were gathered in multitudes, ready to set out on their journey to Jerusalem."
2. "We must remember also that the reference of the following discourse to the Passover being so pointed, the remark would naturally be here inserted by the Evangelist."

2. "Jesus walks on the sea."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The passover - See the notes at Matthew 26:2, Matthew 26:17."
