# John 6:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people were confused and dissatisfied when Jesus spoke about himself as the true bread from God. They had misconceptions about the physical nature of the bread, not realizing that Jesus was speaking metaphorically about being nourished spiritually by faith. This spiritual concept was foreign to them, leading to their disappointment and dissatisfaction. Their reaction stemmed from their ignorance and lack of desire for the true greater blessing that Jesus offered. Their discontentment arose from their preconceived notions and inability to grasp the spiritual significance of Jesus' words.
