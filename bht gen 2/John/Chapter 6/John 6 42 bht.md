# John 6:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people cannot understand how Jesus could have come from heaven, as they wrongly assume that he must have had a birth different from ordinary humans. They ridicule and mock his claim to be divine by questioning his parentage and descent. They are unaware of his miraculous conception and incarnation, and do not comprehend how he can be both from heaven and made of a woman on earth. This perplexing claim of Jesus continues to puzzle skeptics even today.
