# John 6:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus tells the crowd not to murmur among themselves. He knows their secret murmurs and private cavils, but He does not directly address their objections. Instead, Jesus focuses on the bigger picture and the central message of His teachings. He warns them not to be startled or stumbled at His sayings, for divine teaching is needed to understand them. The crowd's lack of relish for His doctrine stems from their vitiated taste and their reprobate hearts. Jesus reproves those who murmur, as their spirit obstructs their ability to comprehend and submit to His teachings.
