# John 6:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
No one can come to me unless God draws them. This drawing is not a forceful compulsion, but rather the gentle yet powerful influence of God's grace. It is through God's drawing that he awakens good desires in us and grants us the power to believe in Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "That this ‘drawing is not irresistible grace, is confessed even by Augustine himself, in his Tractatus on this passage... trahitur animus et amore."
2. "The drawing towards Christ may be exemplified in the legal dispensation, which was to the Jews a παιδαγωγία εἰς χριστόν."
3. "This refrain, as Meyer well calls it, follows, as in John 6:39-40."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "can come to me—in the sense of John 6:35."
2. "except the Father which hath sent me—that is, the Father as the Sender of Me and to carry out the design of My mission."
3. "draw him—by an internal and efficacious operation; though by all the means of rational conviction, and in a way altogether consonant to their moral nature."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If any man believed, it was proof that God had inclined him."
2. "The difficulty in the case was not, therefore, a want of natural faculties, or of power to do their duty, but erroneous opinions, pride, obstinacy, self-conceit, and a deep-felt contempt for Jesus."
3. "In the conversion of the sinner God enlightens the mind, he inclines the will, and he influences the soul by motives, by just views of his law, by his love, his commands, and his threatenings; by a desire of happiness, and a consciousness of danger; by the Holy Spirit applying truth to the mind, and urging him to yield himself to the Saviour."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The drawing is not like that of the executioner, who draws the thief up the ladder to the gallows; but it is a gracious allurement, such as that of the man whom everybody loves, and to whom everybody willingly goes." 
2. "Both words are used of haling to justice."
3. "One distinction, however, is observed: surw is never used of Christ's attraction of men."

### John Calvin:
1. "He does not merely accuse them of wickedness, but likewise reminds them, that it is a peculiar gift of God to embrace the doctrine which is exhibited by him."
2. "The statement amounts to this, that we ought not to wonder if many refuse to embrace the Gospel; because no man will ever of himself be able to come to Christ, but God must first approach him by his Spirit."
3. "It is a false and profane assertion, therefore, that none are drawn but those who are willing to be drawn, as if man made himself obedient to God by his own efforts; for the willingness with which men follow God is what they already have from himself, who has formed their hearts to obey him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He speaks not of the ‘drawing’ of God, but of that of the ‘Father which sent’ Him. Only like can understand like."
2. "The ‘drawing’ is not precisely the same as the ‘giving’ of John 6:37, but describes, so to speak, the first stage of the ‘giving;’ he that ‘hath been drawn’ by the Father is he that is given to the Son."
3. "The Father draws and entrusts; the Son receives, keeps, imparts life, until the glorious consummation, the final resurrection."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Negative condition of third class with εαν μη and first aorist active subjunctive of ελκυω, older form ελκω, to drag like a net (John 21:6), or sword (John 18:10), or men (Acts 16:19), to draw by moral power (John 12:32), as in Jeremiah 31:3." 
2. "The approach of the soul to God is initiated by God, the other side of verse John 6:37."
3. "See Romans 8:7 for the same doctrine and use of ουδε δυνατα like ουδεις δυνατα here."

### John Gill:
1. "Coming to Christ and believing in Christ being the same thing, it is certain that faith is not of a man's self, it is the gift of God, and therefore efficacious grace must be exerted to enable a soul to come to Christ."
2. "This act of drawing is something distinct from, and superior to, both doctrine and miracles. Something more than these was necessary to their coming to [Christ], or savingly believing in him; even the powerful and efficacious grace of the Father in drawing."
3. "God in drawing the unwilling, makes willing in the day of his power: he enlightens the understanding, bends the will, gives a heart of flesh, sweetly allures by the power of his grace, and engages the soul to come to Christ, and give up itself to him."

### John Wesley:
1. "No man comes to me, unless my Father draw him — No man can believe in Christ, unless God give him power: he draws us first, by good desires."
2. "Not by compulsion, not by laying the will under any necessity; but by the strong and sweet, yet still resistible, motions of his heavenly grace."
