# John 6:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
All those whom God has ordained to eternal life, chosen in Christ, and called as His children will be specially taught by Him. This promise of being taught by God is not limited to a particular time but extends to the times of the Messiah. Our Lord emphasizes that all those whom the Father has given Him, whether Jews or Gentiles, will be taught by God in such a way that they are drawn and brought to Him. To believe in the secret voice of God is the mark of those who truly hear and respond.

3. "The end, he cometh to Christ here is the will acting on the whole man."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Our Lord thus falls back upon Scripture authority for this seemingly hard saying."

3. "Every man therefore, who hath been thus efficaciously taught of Him, cometh unto me."

### Albert Barnes:

1. "The passage which is here quoted is to be found in Isaiah 54:13, where, speaking of the restoration of the Church, he promises to her, sons taught by the instruction of God." 
2. "The way of teaching, of which the prophet speaks, does not consist merely in the external voice, but likewise in the secret operation of the Holy Spirit. In short, this teaching of God is the inward illumination of the heart."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The use of the plural ‘prophets’ has been thought to prove that the reference does not belong to any one passage; and we may certainly say that an inclusive expression like this may have been used designedly, as implying that there are many such promises, and that this tone of promise is characteristic of the book of the Prophets."
2. "The truth of that verse is set in a new light, presented on its human rather than on its Divine side. The ‘drawing’ is a ‘teaching:’ he that hath been drawn by the Father, is he that hath truly received the teaching of the Father."
3. "Not one allows us to think of compulsion or the forcing of man’s will: all with one voice give glory to the Father as the source of every impulse towards the light and the life."
