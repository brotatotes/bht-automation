# John 6:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Not that anyone can physically see God in a visible form, except for the Son who is uniquely from or with God in a more elevated way than any creature. The Son has intimate knowledge and communion with the Father, comprehending His perfections, glory, thoughts, purposes, and unreservedly declaring them to the world.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The mention of ἀκούσας παρὰ τοῦ πατρός might lead them to think of a personal communication from the Father to each man, and thus the necessity of the mission of the Son might be invalidated."
2. "This was the only way in which a Jew could misunderstand John 6:45; he could not dream of a seeing of the Father with bodily eyes."
3. "ὁ ὢν παρὰ τ. θεοῦ is Jesus Himself: see ch. John 7:29. His knowledge of the Father is complete and immediate; ours, partial, and derived through Him only."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Lest they should confound that 'hearing and learning of the Father,' to which believers are admitted by divine teaching, with His own immediate access to Him."
2. "He here throws in a parenthetical explanation stating, as explicitly as words could do it, how totally different the two cases were."
3. "Only He who is 'from God' hath this naked, immediate access to the Father."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Not that any man hath seen the Father - Jesus added this, evidently, to guard against mistake."
2. "They were not, therefore, to expect to see God, and his words were not to be perverted as if he meant to teach that."
3. "By his being of God is meant that he is the only-begotten Son of God, and sent as the Messiah into the world."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Father is not seen immediately, but through the Son."
2. "Of God [παρα του θεου] . More correctly, as Rev., from, with an idea of association with : from with God."
3. "Para is used of procession from a personal object, indicating it generally as the starting - point."

### John Calvin:
1. "Not that any man hath seen the Father. As he has hitherto magnified the grace of his Father, so now he earnestly directs believers to himself alone."
2. "For both must be joined together; that no knowledge of Christ can be obtained, until the Father enlighten by his Spirit those who are by nature blind; and yet that it is in vain to seek God, unless Christ go before; for the majesty of God is so lofty, that the senses of men cannot reach him."
3. "Nay, more, all that knowledge of God which men may think that they have attained out of Christ will be a deadly abyss. When he says that he alone hath known the Father, he means that it is an office which belongs peculiarly to himself, to manifest God to men, who would otherwise have been concealed."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Not that any one hath seen the Father, save he which is from God, he hath seen the Father."
2. "His saying that all who come to Him have first ‘heard from the Father’ might lead His hearers to infer that the descent out of heaven likewise implied nothing more than could be said of all. Such an inference this verse is intended to preclude."
3. "If they would really be ‘taught’ of the Father it can only be through Him."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "With the eyes no one has seen God save the Son who is 'from God' in origin."
2. "The only way for others to see God is to see Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "Not that any man hath seen the Father,.... save he which is of God..."
2. "...who is begotten of him, and of the same nature and perfections with him, though a distinct person from him..."
3. "...he hath seen the Father; has perfect knowledge of him, personal communion with him; has seen the perfections and glory of his person, and the thoughts, purposes, and counsels of his heart, his whole mind, and will, and all the grace, goodness, and mercy which is in him, and has declared it..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Not that any one must expect him to appear in a visible shape."
2. "He who is from or with God, in a more eminent manner than any creature."
