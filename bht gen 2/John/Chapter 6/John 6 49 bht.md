# John 6:49 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The bread from heaven, the manna, served as the sole sustenance for the Israelites during their wilderness journey. However, it could not shield them from physical death, let alone eternal death. Their reliance on this temporary food, without recognizing its deeper spiritual significance, ultimately led to their demise. In contrast, the new manna, Jesus himself, offers a different kind of sustenance. By partaking in him, believers are nourished with the bread of life that provides protection against spiritual death and offers eternal life.
