# John 6:51 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Whoever believes in Him will have eternal life. This belief goes beyond simply acknowledging His teachings; it is a deep trust and reliance on Jesus as the source of life. Those who continue in this faith until the end will receive salvation. It is important to note that this discourse on His flesh and blood primarily refers to His sacrificial death, rather than directly to the Lord's Supper. It is through His voluntary offering of Himself, for the sake of the world, that eternal life is made available to His chosen people.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Bread of Life is Himself: and, strictly treated, when we come to inquire what, of that body, soul, and spirit, which constituted Himself, this Bread specifically is, we have His answer that it is His Flesh which He will give (...) on behalf of the life of the world." 
2. "The very existence of all the created world is owing to, and held together by, that Resurrection-Body of the Lord. In Him all things are gathered together and reconciled to God." 
3. "To the ordinance itself, there is here no reference; nor could there well have been any. But the spiritual verity which underlies the ordinance is one and the same with that here insisted on; and so considered, the discourse is, as generally treated, most important towards a right understanding of the ordinance."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "THE BREAD WHICH I WILL GIVE IS MY FLESH, WHICH I WILL GIVE FOR THE LIFE OF THE WORLD." Here, for the first time in this high discourse, our Lord explicitly introduces His sacrificial death."
2. "From this time we hear no more (in this discourse) of 'Bread'; this figure is dropped, and the reality takes its place."
3. "The words 'I will give' may be compared with the words of institution at the Supper, 'This is My body which is given for you' (Luke 22:19), or in Paul's report of it, 'broken for you' (1 Corinthians 11:24)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The bread that I will give is by flesh - That is, his body would be offered as a sacrifice for sin."
2. "Life of the world - That sinners might, by his atoning sacrifice, be recovered from spiritual death, and be brought to eternal life."
3. "The use of the word world here shows that the sacrifice of Christ was full, free, ample, and designed for all men."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The living bread [ο αρτος ο ζων] . Literally, the bread the living (bread)." 
2. "I will give. The ejgw, I, is emphatic, in contrast with Moses (ver. 32)." 
3. "Which I will give. The best texts omit. Read, as Rev., my flesh for the life of the world."

### John Calvin:
1. "He claims for himself the designation of bread, in order to tear from our hearts all fallacious hopes of living."
2. "He exhorts us to faith, which alone enables us to enjoy this bread, so as to derive life from it."
3. "It is a wonderful purpose of God that he has exhibited life to us in that flesh, where formerly there was nothing but the cause of death."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For 'the bread of life' He says now 'the living bread:' for 'cometh down,' an expression which might seem a mere figure denoting heavenly origin, He says 'came down,' speaking of an actual historical descent out of heaven."
2. "The living bread' is a thought absolutely unique, and the words compel the thinks of the hearers to rest on the person of the Speaker, who in the possession of this life, and not as the precious but lifeless manna, descended out of heaven."
3. "The personal significance of the preceding words is now made even more direct, and the meaning intended cannot probably be mistaken. He gives; the bread He gives is His flesh; the gift is for the life of the world."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The bread the living." Repetition of the claim in John 6:35; John 6:41; John 6:48, but with a slight change from ζωης to ζων (present active participle of ζαω). It is alive and can give life. See John 4:10 for living water. In Revelation 1:17 Jesus calls himself the Living One (ο ζων).
2. I shall give  (εγω δωσω). Emphasis on εγω (I). Superior so to Moses.
3. For the life of the world  (υπερ της του κοσμου ζωης). Over, in behalf of, υπερ means, and in some connexions instead of as in John 11:50. See John 1:30 for the Baptist's picture of Christ as the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world. See also John 3:17; John 4:42; 1 John 3:16; Matthew 20:28; Galatians 3:13; 2 Corinthians 5:14; Romans 5:8. Jesus has here presented to this Galilean multitude the central fact of his atoning death for the spiritual life of the world.

### John Gill:
1. "I am the living bread which came down from heaven... and such is the virtue of this living and heavenly bread, that if any man eat of this bread he shall live for ever."
2. "Here our Lord explains more clearly and fully what he means, under the notion of bread; and which shows, that by bread he did not design merely his doctrine, but his flesh, his human nature; though not as abstracted from his deity, but as in union with it."
3. "Which I will give for the life of the world; and which he did by the offering up of his body, and making his soul, or giving himself an offering, a propitiatory sacrifice for sin; which was done in the most free and voluntary manner, in the room and stead of his people, to procure eternal life for them, even for the whole world of his elect."

### John Wesley:
1. "If any eat of this bread — That is, believe in me: he shall live for ever." 
2. "He that believeth to the end shall be saved."
3. "This whole discourse concerning his flesh and blood refers directly to his passion, and but remotely, if at all, to the Lord's Supper."
