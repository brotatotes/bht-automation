# John 6:53 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To truly partake of the life-giving grace of Christ, we must not only eat His flesh but also drink His blood, symbolizing the making of His redemption real in our lives through faith. These symbols, given in the Holy Communion, not only represent the spiritual process of faith but also assist us in experiencing the transformative power of Christ's sacrificial death. It is in Christ alone that true life is found, and by appropriating His life and the saving merit of His death, we can receive the spiritual and eternal life that He offers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Our Lord not only ratifies their φαγεῖν, but adds to it a more wonderful thing; that they must also do that against which a prohibition might seem to have existed from Noah downwards, drink His Blood."
2. "The eating of His Flesh and drinking of His Blood import the making to ourselves and using as objectively real, those two great Truths of our Redemption in Him, of which our Faith subjectively convinces us."
3. "And of this realizing of Faith He has been pleased to appoint certain symbols in the Holy Communion, which He has commanded to be received; to signify to us the spiritual process, and to assist us towards it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He says they must not only 'eat His flesh' but 'drink His blood,' which could not but suggest the idea of His death—implied in the separation of one's flesh from his blood."
2. "Yet the whole statement was certainly confounding, and beyond doubt was meant to be so."
3. "The truth really conveyed here is no other than that expressed in John 6:51, though in more emphatic terms—that He Himself, in the virtue of His sacrificial death, is the spiritual and eternal life of men."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "The vengeance that awaits all despisers of the grace of Christ is, that with their pride they miserably perish; and the reason why they must be urged with plainness and severity is, that they may not continue to flatter themselves."
2. "Despise me as much as you please, on account of the mean and despicable appearance of my flesh, still that despicable flesh contains life; and if you are destitute of it, you will nowhere else find anything else to quicken you."
3. "The ancients fell into a gross error by supposing that little children were deprived of eternal life if they did not dispense to them the Eucharist, that is, the Lord's Supper; for this discourse does not relate to the Lord's Supper, but to the uninterrupted communication of the flesh of Christ, which we obtain apart from the use of the Lord's Supper."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

### John Gill:
1. "The 'flesh' and 'blood' of Christ do not design those distinct parts of his body; much less as separate from each other; nor the whole body of Christ, but his whole human nature."
2. "To eat the flesh, and drink the blood of Christ, is to believe that Christ is come in the flesh, and is truly and really man; that his flesh is given for the life of his people, and his blood is shed for their sins, and this with some view and application to themselves."
3. "Without this [eating the flesh and drinking the blood of Christ], there, is no evidence of life in them not such live as feed on sinful pleasures, or on their own righteousness; only such that believe in Christ are living souls."

### John Wesley:
1. "Unless ye eat the flesh of the Son of Man — Spiritually: unless ye draw continual virtue from him by faith."
2. "Eating his flesh is only another expression for believing."
