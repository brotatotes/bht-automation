# John 6:54 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By eating and drinking spiritually through faith, one attains eternal life, as Christ has explained before. This life is not temporary or corruptible, but an incorruptible seed within us. It is a beginning, pledge, and guarantee of everlasting life. This life is not only for the soul, but also for the body, as it will be raised up at the last day to fully enjoy it.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It would have been hopeless confusion for these Jews if Jesus had used the symbolism of the Lord's Supper."
