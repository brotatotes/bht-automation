# John 6:55 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The soul of a believer is truly fed with the spiritual food and drink that Christ offers, just as the body is nourished with physical meat and drink. This spiritual sustenance is not a mere metaphor but a reality, providing refreshment, nourishment, and life to the inner being. It is a nourishment that is solid, substantial, and satisfying, unlike the fleeting satisfaction offered by the pleasures of the world. As believers partake in this true food, they experience its virtue, efficacy, and excellence, finding it to be soul quickening, strengthening, and delightful.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "My flesh is true meat, i.e. really TO BE EATEN, which they doubted."
2. "Food and drink are not here mere metaphors; rather are our common material food and drink mere shadows and imperfect types of this only real reception of refreshment and nourishment into the being."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And as He had already hinted that it was to be something very different from a natural death, saying, 'My flesh I will give for the life of the world' (John 6:51), it must have been pretty plain to candid hearers that He meant something above the gross idea which the bare terms expressed."
2. "Yet the whole statement was certainly confounding, and beyond doubt was meant to be so."
3. "The truth really conveyed here is no other than that expressed in John 6:51-52, though in more emphatic terms—that He Himself, in the virtue of His sacrificial death, is the spiritual and eternal life of men; and that unless men voluntarily appropriate to themselves this death, in its sacrificial virtue, so as to become the very life and nourishment of their inner man, they have no spiritual and eternal life at all."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Indeed [αληθως] . Literally, truly. The best texts read ajlhqhv, true : true meat, true drink.

### John Calvin:
1. "As the body is weakened and consumed by the want of food, so the soul, if it be not fed with heavenly bread, will soon perish with hunger."
2. "Thus we ought to boast, with Paul, that we reckon nothing to be excellent but Christ crucified; because, as soon as we have departed from the sacrifice of his death, we meet with nothing but death."
3. "...he did so in condescension to our weakness. For when he expressly mentions food and drink, he declares that the life which he bestows is complete in every respect, that we may not imagine to ourselves a life which is only half or imperfect."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Meat indeed  (αληθης βρωσις). So the best MSS., 'true food.' See on John 4:32 for βρωσις as equal to βρωμα (a thing eaten)."
2. "Drink indeed  (αληθης ποσις). Correct text, 'true drink.' For ποσις see Romans 14:17; Colossians 2:16 (only N.T. examples)."

### John Gill:
1. "They are both 'truly' meat and drink, as the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Ethiopic versions render it or are 'true' meat and drink, as the Arabic version."
2. "These phrases may denote the reality, substance, and solidity of that spiritual food believers have in Christ, in opposition to the imaginary food of sensual sinners."
3. "And these words may also be expressive of the virtue, efficacy, and excellency of this food, it being soul quickening, nourishing, strengthening, satisfying, and delightful food."

### John Wesley:
1. "With which the soul of a believer is as truly fed, as his body with meat and drink."
