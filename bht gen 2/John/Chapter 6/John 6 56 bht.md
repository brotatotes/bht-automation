# John 6:56 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers abide in Christ through faith, finding in Him a stronghold and a dwelling place. Christ, in turn, dwells in the hearts of believers, not merely in their heads and tongues, but through a continual mystical fellowship. This mutual indwelling is not limited to a specific time or ritual, but is the ongoing relationship between Christ and His people. Through this relationship, Christ becomes the habitation, or dwelling place, of believers, providing them with strength, defense, and a place to abide.
