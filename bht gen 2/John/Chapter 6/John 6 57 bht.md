# John 6:57 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The living Father, the source of life, sent me, the living Son, to communicate his life. As the Father lives by himself, so I live by the Father, because of our complete unity. In the same way, when one eats me, they receive the gift of life and shall live because of me. This spiritual nourishment and communion with Christ sustains believers and brings them to a life of glory in Him.
