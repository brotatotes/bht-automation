# John 6:58 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This bread is far greater than the manna your ancestors ate, which, even though it came from heaven, did not bring eternal life. It is the true bread that came down from the Father, the bread of life, the bread of God. Those who partake of this bread will not experience death but will live forever.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "When we attempt to strip the truth of these figures, figures though they be, it goes away from us, like water when the vessel is broken."
