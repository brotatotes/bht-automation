# John 6:59 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus boldly spoke these words openly and publicly in the synagogue, the place of divine worship where the Jews gathered. This shows the significance of His message and His willingness to teach in the midst of His powerful enemies. In the ruins of a synagogue, there have even been found carvings that remind us of the miraculous provision of manna and the symbolism of vine leaves and clusters of grapes. This emphasizes the importance of Jesus teaching in the synagogue as a central part of His ministry.
