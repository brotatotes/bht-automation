# John 6:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus asked Philip about the provision of food for the multitude not because He lacked knowledge, but to test Philip's faith and reveal the Divine plan. Jesus intended to perform a miracle and feed the crowd with the limited resources available. By questioning Philip, Jesus wanted to demonstrate the importance of faith and prepare the disciples for the upcoming miracle. This interaction highlights Jesus' desire to strengthen the faith of His followers before displaying His power.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Why Philip was addressed is a question often raised... there may be nothing important in the Master‚Äôs choice of the disciple whose faith He is to try." 
2. "Or there may have been something in the character of Philip‚Äôs mind that led to the special selection of him for trial."
3. "A more correct explanation may be that, intending to manifest Himself as the fulfilment of what is written in the law, Jesus turns first to one who had confessed Him as the subject of ‚Äòthe law and the prophets‚Äô (John 1:45). He would test him, and try whether he had entered into the full meaning of his own confession."
