# John 6:60 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The saying of Jesus in this passage was hard and offensive, causing His disciples to struggle to accept and understand it. The word hard refers to something that is not just difficult, but also disagreeable or insufferable. The disciples were not simply finding it challenging to comprehend the saying, but were rather scandalized by its strangeness. The doctrines that Jesus taught, such as His superiority over Moses and the necessity of His sacrifice for salvation, were offensive to many. As a result, they were unable to endure or accept these teachings.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'disciple' means 'learner.' It was applied to the followers of Christ because they were taught by him. It does not imply, of necessity, that those to whom it was given were real Christians, but simply that they were under his teaching, and were professed learners in his school." 
2. "The word 'hard' here means 'offensive, disagreeable' - that which they could not bear. Some have understood it to mean 'difficult to be understood,' but this meaning does not suit the connection."
3. "The doctrines which Jesus taught that were so offensive appear to have been: 1. That he was superior to Moses. 2. That God would save all that he had chosen and those only. 3. That he said he was the bread that came from heaven. 4. That it was necessary to partake of that; that it was necessary that an atonement should be made, and that they should be saved by that."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word ‘disciples’ is here used in a wide sense, including many more than the Twelve."
2. "The ‘saying’ can only be that of the preceding verses (John 6:53-57), and its hardness consisted in the fact that it pointed out one only way to life, eating the flesh and drinking the blood of the Son of man."
