## BHT:
Jesus, aware of the disciples' disbelief and lack of comprehension, questions them, saying, Doth this make you to stumble? He recognizes their murmurs and understands that they find his teachings absurd and contrary to reason. He challenges them to consider if they are unable to accept this, how will they be able to grasp and accept the more profound and unexpected truths that he will reveal in the future.
