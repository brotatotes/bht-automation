## BHT:
How much more will you find it unbelievable that Jesus would give you his flesh to eat if you already struggle to comprehend that he descended from heaven?

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But appealing to an event which they should witness, as a certain proof of one part of the σκληρὸς λόγος, with which indeed the rest of it was bound up, His having descended from heaven."
2. "All attempts (as those of Lücke, De Wette, and others) to explain this otherwise than of His ascent into heaven, are simply dishonest, and spring from laxity of belief in the historical reality of that event."
3. "The whole exegesis of the passage in the above-named Commentators is a remarkable instance of the warping of the judgment by unsoundness of belief in the historical truth of the evangelistic testimony."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jesus does not say that those who were then present would see him ascend, but he implies that he would ascend."
2. "Instead of explaining that away, he proceeds to state another doctrine quite as offensive to them - that he would reascend to heaven."
3. "As Jesus was to ascend to heaven, it was clear that he could not have intended literally that they should eat his flesh."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Literally, if then ye should behold, etc. - the completion would be, would not this still more cause you to stumble?"
2. "Rev., properly, renders the participle, ascending."
3. "But the correct reading is lelalhka, the perfect tense, I have spoken, or I have just spoken, referring to the preceding discourse."

### John Calvin:
1. "The mean and despicable condition of Christ which they saw before their eyes, while, clothed with flesh, he was not at all different from other men, prevented them from submitting to his Divine power..."
2. "... withdrawing, as it were, the veil — he calls them to behold his heavenly glory, as if he had said, 'Because I converse among men without honor, I am despised by you, and you recognize in me nothing that is Divine; but ere long God will adorn me with splendid power...'"
3. "...it plainly showed Christ to be the Son of God... the resurrection is brought forward as a proof from which that glory of Christ ought to be acknowledged, and his ascension to heaven was the completion of that glory."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Is the word that speaks of the descent from heaven, of the living bread that alone can give life, of the Son’s descent from heaven to give His flesh and His blood that the world may eat and drink and live, a stumbling-block to you?"
2. "If, when I am here before you, you cannot understand what is meant by eating my flesh and drinking my blood, cannot apprehend the spiritual meaning which such words must bear, how much more will you, in this your carnal apprehension of what I say, be made to stumble if you should see me ascending where I was before, to be no longer upon earth at all!"
3. "Then the sense they have put upon His words will indeed wholly break down: then at last they may come to see that the words can only be spiritually understood."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Clear statement of Christ's pre-existence in his own words as in John 3:13; John 17:5 (cf. John 1:1-18)." 
2. "Condition of third class with εαν and present active subjunctive, 'if ye then behold.'"
3. "Present active participle picturing the process."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ was, he existed before his incarnation, and he was in heaven before; not in his human nature, but as the word and Son of God." 
2. "He intimates, that when he had done his work, and the will of his Father, for which he came down from heaven, by the assumption of the human nature, he should ascend up thither again; and which would be seen, as it was, by his apostles."
3. "He hereby suggests, that if it was difficult to receive, and hard to be understood, and was surprising and incredible, that he should come down from heaven, as bread, to be eaten and fed upon; it would be much more so to them to be told, that he who was in so mean and lowly a form, should ascend up into heaven."

### John Wesley:
1. "How much more incredible will it then appear to you, that he should give you his flesh to eat?"
