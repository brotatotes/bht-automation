## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Such eating of My flesh as you imagine and find hard to listen to, could profit you nothing, for it will have ascended up... and besides, generally, it is only the Spirit that can vivify the spirit of man: the flesh (in whatever way used) can profit nothing towards this."
2. "He does not say 'My Flesh profiteth nothing,' but 'the flesh.' To make Him say this, as the Swiss anti-sacramentalists do, is to make Him contradict His own words in John 6:51."
3. "They are πνεῦμα and ζωή: spirit, not flesh only: living food, not carnal and perishable. This meaning has been missed by almost all commentators... and it seems to me beyond question the right one."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Flesh as such, mere flesh, could profit nothing, much less impart that life which the Holy Spirit alone communicates to the soul."
2. "The whole burden of the discourse is 'spirit,' not mere flesh, and 'life' in its highest, not its lowest sense."
3. "The words I have employed are to be interpreted solely in that sense."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "My doctrine is spiritual; it is fitted to quicken and nourish the soul. It is from heaven."
2. "Your doctrine or your views are earthly, and may be called flesh, or fleshly, as pertaining only to the support of the body."
3. "They are not to be understood literally, as if you were really to eat my flesh, but they are to be understood as denoting the need of that provision for the soul which God has made by my coming into the world."

### John Calvin:
1. "Whence has the flesh power to quicken, but because it is spiritual?... they who shall raise their eyes to the power of the Spirit, which is diffused over the flesh, will learn... that it is called quickening." 
2. "It is food, because by it life is procured for us... It profiteth not, if it be estimated by its origin and nature... because in it we have all the parts of salvation accomplished." 
3. "He now employs the word Spirit in a different sense... for it calls us upwards to seek Christ in his heavenly glory, through the guidance of the Spirit, by faith, and not by our carnal perception... for others will rather draw death from it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Jesus has spoken of ‘giving life,’ of the ‘eating of His flesh,’ as the means of gaining eternal life. In all this He has not the flesh but the spirit in view, not the material reception of the flesh by the flesh but the appropriation of His spirit by the spirit of man." 
2. "The emphasis which Jesus here and elsewhere lays upon His sayings is very remarkable. He is the Word, the expression of the Father’s nature and will; His sayings are to man the expression of Himself." 
3. "The words or sayings just spoken to these disciples are spirit and are life. This is their essential nature. They may be carnalised, wrongly understood, wilfully perverted; but wherever they find an entrance they manifest their true nature."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The breath of God and the life of God is in these words of Jesus."
2. "Never man spoke like Jesus."
3. "There is life in his words today."

### John Gill:
1. "And it is the Spirit of God that quickens dead sinners, by entering into them as the spirit of life, and causing them to live."
2. "It is that by, and on which they live, and by which their spiritual strength is renewed."
3. "The Gospel, and the truths of it, which are the means of conveying the Spirit of God, as a spirit of illumination and sanctification, into the hearts of men, and of quickening sinners dead in trespasses and sins."

### John Wesley:
1. "It is the Spirit — The spiritual meaning of these words, by which God giveth life."
2. "The flesh — The bare, carnal, literal meaning, profiteth nothing."
3. "The words which I have spoken, they are spirit — Are to be taken in a spiritual sense and, when they are so understood, they are life."
