# John 6:64 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Their lack of belief in Jesus is evident since they take His words in a shallow and superficial way, not grasping the deeper spiritual meaning. God's omniscience extends to His knowledge of future events, including human actions and choices. However, it is important to note that God's knowledge does not cause these actions or choices; they still remain the responsibility of humans.
