# John 6:65 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The necessity of divine teaching is evident, as some are strangers to it. The Father's drawing is an internal, efficacious operation that leads to true belief. Faith is a gift from God, given to those prepared to receive Jesus. However, not all can come to Jesus, only those to whom it is given by the Father. The impulse to faith comes from God, and it is not something that can be achieved by human power or free will. Ultimately, faith in Christ is a gift from God, given on His terms.

3. "Having resisted the drawing of the Father, they had lacked the due preparation of heart for receiving the words of Jesus."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
