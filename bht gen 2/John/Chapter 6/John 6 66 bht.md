# John 6:66 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
From that time, many who had followed him abruptly left and turned away, walking no more with Jesus. It is a dreadful thing that the light of Christ can repel and alienate minds. These half-hearted seekers who had once forsaken everything for Jesus now returned to their previous lives and abandoned him as their Savior. They sought their own righteousness and returned to the teachings of the Scribes and Pharisees. Nevertheless, we must not suppress the pure doctrine and continue to proclaim it, even if there are many who dislike it.
