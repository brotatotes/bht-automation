# John 6:67 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus poses a question, expecting a negative answer from those who have deserted him. He already knows that these individuals do not truly belong to him, lacking the truth of grace. He acknowledges the faith, love, and attachment of the remaining apostles, recognizing their genuine commitment. While the departure of others does not trouble him, the thought of his close friends and companions leaving would genuinely pain him as a man.
