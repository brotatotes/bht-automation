# John 6:68 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter's declaration, like his character, is quick and passionate, as he acknowledges Jesus as the source of eternal life. The disciples recognized that there was no other teacher to turn to, as the words of Jesus brought them abundant life. These words are not man-made teachings but the truths that lead to eternal life. To reject Jesus and seek elsewhere would lead to spiritual destruction, for only in Him is there salvation and the path to everlasting life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Peter answers quickly and earnestly for the rest, as in Matthew 16:16."
2. "What they had heard and seen had awakened in them the desire of being led on by some teacher towards eternal life; and to whom else should they go from Him who had, and brought out of His stores for their instruction, the words of eternal life?"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Shall we follow the rest, and give it up? But when it came to this, our light returned, and our hearts were reassured."
2. "For as soon as we thought of going away, there arose upon us that awful question, 'TO WHOM shall we go?'"
3. "Nay, Lord, we are shut up. They have none of that 'ETERNAL LIFE' to offer us whereof Thou hast been discoursing, in words rich and ravishing as well as in words staggering to human wisdom."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Simon Peter answered him - With characteristic ardor and promptness. Peter was probably one of the oldest of the apostles, and it was his character to be first and most ardent in his professions."
2. "There was no one else who could teach them. The Pharisees, the Sadducees, and the scribes were corrupt, and unable to guide them aright; and, though the doctrines of Jesus were mysterious, yet they were the only doctrines that could instruct and save them."
3. "That poor, lost, sinful man has nowhere else to go but to Jesus. He is the way, the truth, and the life, and if the sinner betakes himself to any other way he will wander and die."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Assailants of the authenticity of John's Gospel have asserted that it reveals an effort on the part of the writer to claim for the disciple whom Jesus loved a pre-eminance above Peter."
2. "Peter's replying for the twelve, in this passage, is a case in point."
3. "Words of life are words which carry life with them. Compare the phrases bread of life, light of life, water of life, tree of life."

1. "Peter first states the reason why he cheerfully adheres to Christ, along with his brethren; namely, because they feel that his doctrine is wholesome and quickening."
2. "It is a remarkable commendation bestowed on the Gospel, that it administers to us eternal life."
3. "Certain destruction, therefore, awaits all who, not satisfied with that Teacher, fly to the inventions of men."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Lord, to whom shall we go?" - Peter is the spokesman as usual and his words mean that, if such a thought as desertion crossed their minds when the crowd left, they dismissed it instantly. 
2. "They had made their choice." - They accepted these very words of Jesus that had caused the defection as "the words of eternal life."

### John Gill:
1. "Who was strong in the faith of Christ, and full of zeal for him, and love to him..."
2. "There is no other Saviour, but Christ, to look to; no other Mediator between God and man, to make use of..."
