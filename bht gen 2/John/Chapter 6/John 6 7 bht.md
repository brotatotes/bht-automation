# John 6:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them; two hundred Roman denarii would amount to a considerable sum of money. Philip raises the issue of practicality, emphasizing how improbable it would be for them to provide for such a large crowd. With the purchasing power of a denarius, a penny could buy enough bread for ten men, so two hundred pence would be enough for two thousand men. However, the total number of people present exceeded that amount, making it impossible to fulfill their needs with such a limited budget.

2. "Philip allots to each person about the sixth part of an English penny, to buy a little bread."
3. "He probably thought that there was a greater number of people present, and as the disciples were poor and ill supplied with money, Andrew intended to alarm Christ by the greatness of the sum, meaning that they were not wealthy enough to entertain so many people."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one may take a little." - As the number of the men alone proved to be five thousand, an expenditure of 200 ‘pence’ (i.e. 200 denarii) would allow less than a denarius, or about eight-pence of our money, to twenty-five persons, and that sum would not purchase in ordinary times more than five or six ounces of bread for each. Philip might well say that it was ‘not sufficient for them.’

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Two hundred pennyworth of bread (διακοσιων δηναριων αρτο). 'Loaves of two hundred denarii.'"
2. "The denarius was the usual pay for a day's labour (Matthew 20:2; Matthew 20:9; Matthew 20:13)."
3. "That every one may take a little (ινα εκαστος βραχυ λαβη). Final clause with ινα and second aorist active subjunctive of λαμβανω. This detail in John alone."

### John Gill:
1. "Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them. Two hundred pence, or 'Roman denarii', which may be here meant, amount to six pounds five shillings of our money."
2. "This may be said by Philip, to show how impracticable it was to provide for such a company; that supposing they had two hundred pence to lay out in this way; though where should they have that, he suggests?"
3. "A penny, with the Jews, would buy as much bread as would serve ten men; so that two hundred pence would buy bread enough for two thousand men; but here were three thousand more, besides women and children, who could not have been provided for with such a sum of money."
