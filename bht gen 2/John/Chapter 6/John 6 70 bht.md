# John 6:70 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus chose twelve disciples, not just to receive grace and glory, but to be apostles. However, even among these chosen ones, there was one who was like a devil - a deceiver, a liar, and a murderer. Jesus warned that not all of them had acted in a way that aligned with their knowledge. This warning came as a preparation for the fall of one of them, who should have repented instead of being influenced by the devil.
