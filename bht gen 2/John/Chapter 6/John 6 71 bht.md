# John 6:71 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, was the one Jesus spoke of. It was crucial for the evangelist to clarify his identity to prevent any confusion. It had been determined and foretold that Judas would be the one to betray Jesus, a fact that Jesus himself was well aware of. This revelation was made more severe by the fact that Judas was one of the twelve chosen apostles, which only added to the gravity of his crime.
