# John 6:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was from Bethsaida, just like Philip. He was not only a disciple of Christ but also played a crucial role in bringing his brother Simon to Jesus. Andrew, upon hearing Christ's conversation with Philip, responded with a similar lack of faith as Philip. However, despite their initial doubts, both Andrew and Philip were chosen by Jesus to be His disciples.
