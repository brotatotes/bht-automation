# John 6:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The lad in the story had a small supply of barley, an inferior sort of bread. This grain was grown abundantly in the land of Canaan and was often used due to its availability and lower cost. It is intriguing that with such a meager provision, it was able to feed the multitude of five thousand people. The lad's willingness to offer their little store reflects their faith in the possibility of such a miracle.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ὀψάρια = ἰχθύδια , Suidas, but of later Greek usage: at first used to signify any thing subsidiary to bread as a relish, such as meat of all kinds, and condiments."
2. "Later however, from fish being, in the deeply coast-indented country of Greece, the most common animal food, it came to be applied to that alone or principally."
3. "...it [ὀψάρια] came to be applied to that alone or principally (see art. Opsonium in the Dictionary of Gr. and Rom. Antiquities)."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Barley: A detail peculiar to John. An inferior sort of bread is indicated by the term."
2. "Fishes: The word means anything that is eaten with bread, and may apply to meat generally, or to what is eaten with bread as a relish."
3. "But what are they among so many? Peculiar to John, though the idea is implied in Luke 9:13."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "John shows Andrew as standing somewhat in advance of Philip, in that he does not hesitate to think that their little store may be set before the multitude, though he is perplexed at his own suggestion."
2. "This is in accordance with the fact that in the lists of the apostles Andrew takes precedence of Philip."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A lad here (παιδαριον ωδε). Old word, diminutive of παις, here only in N.T., not genuine in Matthew 11:16. How he came to have this small supply we do not know."
2. "Barley (κριθινους). Adjective, here and verse John 6:13 only in N.T., in the papyri, from κριθη, barley (Revelation 6:6). Considered an inferior sort of bread."
3. "Fishes (οψαρια). Late diminutive of οψον, common in papyri and inscriptions for delicacies with bread like fish. In N.T. only here, verse John 6:11; John 21:9-13. Synoptics have ιχθυας."

### John Gill:
1. "The land of Canaan was a land of barley, as well as wheat, Deuteronomy 8:8; this sort of grain grew there in plenty, and was in much use."
2. "It is an instance of the meanness and poverty of them."
3. "It is amazing, that five thousand persons should everyone have something of them, and enough."
