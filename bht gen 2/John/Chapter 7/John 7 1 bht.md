# John 7:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During this time, Jesus traveled throughout Galilee, continuing His ministry of teaching and healing. As He walked and walked about, He avoided staying in one place for too long, knowing that His enemies were seeking to kill Him. His constant movement allowed Him to reach as many people as possible with the Gospel and bring healing to their bodies and souls. This serves as a reminder that in times of danger, it is wise for faithful individuals to take necessary precautions to preserve their lives, enabling them to continue serving God and blessing others.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

2. "It contains an independent memoir of a miracle and discourse of our Lord in Galilee which actually happened in the interval, and only serves to shew us the character of this Gospel as made up of such memoirs, more or less connected with one another, and selected by the Evangelist for their higher spiritual import, and the discourses arising from them."
3. "I would understand this verse as merely carrying on the time from ch. 5 and ch. 6, and its contents as introductory to the account of Jesus not going up at first to the feast."

1. "After these things—that is, all that is recorded after John 5:18."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Its significance was twofold. It was a harvest - home festival, and hence was called the Feast of Ingathering, and it commemorated the dwelling of Israel in tents or booths in the wilderness."
2. "The association of the latter event with harvest was designed to remind the people in their prosperity of the days of their homeless wandering, that their hearts might not be lifted up and forget God, who delivered them from bondage."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "During that time Jesus ‘was walking in Galilee,’ for in Judea His enemies ‘were seeking to kill Him.’"
2. "The ministry in Galilee is in the main passed over, partly, no doubt, because the Evangelist well knew that the types of Gospel teaching that were most widely current chiefly presented the Saviour’s work in Galilee."
3. "The principal outward characteristics of this portion of our Lord’s public ministry are the wider range of His travels and the comparative privacy which He seems usually to have maintained."
