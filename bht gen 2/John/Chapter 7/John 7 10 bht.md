# John 7:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus did not join a typical caravan company on his journey, likely to avoid attracting attention. It is unclear if the Twelve disciples were with him, but it is possible. Jesus purposely went in secret, going against the advice of his brothers, to avoid the insincerity of others and fulfill all righteousness. His private journey to Jerusalem before his final visit was to escape those seeking to harm him, as his hour to suffer had not yet come. The next time he went to Jerusalem, he would experience suffering.
