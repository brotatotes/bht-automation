# John 7:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It was common knowledge among the people of Judea, especially those in Jerusalem, that Jesus would be present at the feast, and this caused division among them. Some sought to seize and kill him, while others desired to listen to his teachings and witness his miracles. Interestingly, the passage refrains from explicitly mentioning his name, possibly due to either contempt, fear, or simply because he was already widely recognized.
