## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἀγαθός ἐστιν would represent, as expressed mildly in protest against His enemies."
2. "πλανᾷ τὸν ὄχλον, possibly in reference to the feeding of and then the discourse to the multitude, which had given so much offence."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The much murmuring among the people - the multitudes; the natural expression of a Jewish writer, indicating without design the crowded state of Jerusalem at this festival."
2. "A good man . . . Nay . . . deceiveth the people - the two opposite views of His claims, that they were honest, and that they were an imposture."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Murmuring - Contention, disputing."
2. "He deceiveth the people - That is, he is deluding them, or drawing them away by pretending to be the Messiah."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The people were saying, 'Leadeth astray.'" (Commentary on Matthew 27:63)

### John Calvin:
1. "The diversity of opinion, which is here related, proves that it is not a new evil, that men should differ in their opinions about Christ, even in the very bosom of the Church."
2. "And as we do not hesitate to receive Christ, who was formerly condemned by the greater part of his own nation, so we ought to be armed with the same kind of shield, that the dissensions which we see daily may not disturb us."
3. "This passage shows likewise that in a great multitude, even when the whole body is in a state of confusion, there are always some who think aright; but those few persons, whose minds are well regulated, are swallowed up by the multitude of those whose understandings are bewildered."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "From the 'Jews' the Evangelist turns to the 'multitudes.' Amongst these is eager discussion concerning Jesus; the speculation, the hesitation, the inquiry, were general, but all outward expression was suppressed."
2. "The use of the plural 'multitudes' seems to point to crowds rather than individuals as the disputants."
3. "The word 'multitude,' however, at the close of the verse is not without a contemptuous force, it is the common crowd that He leads astray: possibly the multitudes of Jerusalem may be the speakers."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Much murmuring (γογγυσμος πολυς). This Ionic onomatopoetic word is from γογγυζω for which verb see John 6:41; John 6:61; John 7:32, for secret displeasure (Acts 6:1) or querulous discontent (Philippians 2:14)."
2. "Among the multitudes (εν τοις οχλοις). 'The multitudes' literally, plural here only in John. These different groups were visitors from Galilee and elsewhere and were divided in their opinion of Jesus as the Galileans had already become (John 6:66)."
3. "A good man (αγαθος). Pure in motive. See Mark 10:17; Romans 5:7 (absolute sense of God). Superior to δικαιος. Jesus had champions in these scattered groups in the temple courts."

### John Gill:
1. "There was a general whisper, and a private controversy and contention among the people about him."
2. "Some said he is a good man; a man of a good principle, of a good life and conversation."
3. "But he deceiveth the people; drawing them off from the law of Moses, teaching them to break the sabbath, setting himself up for the Messiah, and asserting himself to be the son of God."

### John Wesley:
1. "There was much murmuring among the multitude — Much whispering; many private debates with each other..."
2. "...among those who were come from distant parts."
