# John 7:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
No one spoke openly in favor of Jesus because they feared the Jews. There was an atmosphere of fear and opposition that prevented people from expressing their true thoughts about Jesus openly. The power and influence of the Jewish authorities intimidated those who believed in Jesus, causing them to remain silent and keep their faith hidden.
