# John 7:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The doctrine taught by Jesus in the temple is not His own, but that of the One who sent Him. His teaching is not self-originated, but a revelation from God. This divine teaching, coming directly from God Himself, is distinct from the teachings of men. It is not merely based on human wisdom or acquired through human learning, but it is from above, holy and heavenly in its nature. The authority and source of Jesus' teaching is divine, making it worthy of our utmost attention and reverence.
