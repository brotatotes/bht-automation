# John 7:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, as the true teacher sent by God, seeks only the glory of God and not his own. He speaks not of himself, but of what God has given him to say. In contrast to those who speak from themselves, Jesus is upright and faithful, bringing true doctrine. There is no deceit or falsehood in him. He perfectly fulfills the condition of seeking the glory of God, and in him, there is no unrighteousness or untruth.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This gives us the reason why he, who wishes to do God's will, will know of the teaching of Christ: viz. because both are seeking one aim - the glory of God."
2. "In its general sense, it asserts that self-exaltation and self-seeking necessarily accompany the unaided teaching of man, but that all true teaching is from God."
3. "But then we must remember that, simply taken, the latter part of the sentence is only true of the Holy One Himself; that owing to human infirmity, purity of motive is no sure guarantee for correctness of doctrine."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 18. seeketh his own glory—(See
	on John 5:41).

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That speaketh of himself - This does not mean about or concerning himself, but he that speaks by his own authority, without being sent by God, as mere human teachers do."
2. "Seeketh his own glory - His own praise, or seeks for reputation and applause. This is the case with mere human teachers, and as Jesus in his discourses manifestly sought to honor God, they ought to have supposed that he was sent by him."
3. "No unrighteousness - This word here means, evidently, there is no falsehood, no deception in him. He is not an impostor... It is true that there was no unrighteousness, no sin in Jesus Christ, but that is not the truth taught here. It is that he was not an impostor, and the evidence of this was that he sought not his own glory, but the honor of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "His own glory [την δοξαν την ιδιαν]: Literally, the glow which is His own; the second article throwing His own into sharp contrast with His that sent Him."
2. "The same [ουτος]: Notice the characteristic use of the pronoun taking up and emphasizing the principal subject of the sentence."
3. "Unrighteousness [αδικια]: See on 2 Peter 2:13."

### John Calvin:
1. "For every thing that displays the glory of God is holy and divine; but every thing that contributes to the ambition of men, and, by exalting them, obscures the glory of God, not only has no claim to be believed, but ought to be vehemently rejected."
2. "He who shall make the glory of God the object at which he aims will never go wrong; he who shall try and prove by this touchstone what is brought forward in the name of God will never be deceived by the semblance of right."
3. "We are also reminded by it that no man can faithfully discharge the office of teacher in the Church unless he be void of ambition, and resolve to make it his sole object to promote, to the utmost of his power, the glory of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If a man speaks from himself, giving out all that he says as coming from himself, it is clear that he is seeking the glory of no one but himself."
2. "But he that seeketh the glory of him that sent him, the same is true, and there is no unrighteousness in him."
3. "By Him the condition is completely fulfilled: of Him the freedom from unrighteousness is absolutely true."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This kind of teacher is self-taught, pushes his own ideas, presses his own claims for position and glory, 'blows his own horn' as we say."
2. "Jesus is the other type of teacher, seeks the glory of the one who sent him, whose herald and ambassador he is."
3. "Unrighteousness... in contrast with 'true.'"

### John Gill:
1. "He that speaketh of himself,..... What he himself has devised, and is a scheme of his own; for which he has no divine warrant and commission"
2. "he that seeketh his glory that sent him; that gave him in commission what he should say and speak, and his only"
3. "he is an upright and faithful man, and what he says is truth; he brings true doctrine along with him, and there is no fraud or imposture in him"

### John Wesley:
1. There is no unrighteousness in him — No deceit or falsehood.
