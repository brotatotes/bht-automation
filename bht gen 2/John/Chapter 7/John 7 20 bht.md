# John 7:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The crowd responded by accusing Jesus of being possessed or deranged, suggesting that he did not know what he was saying. They were unaware of the plots against him and believed that no one would be so wicked as to try to kill someone who did good. Their response reflects their ignorance of the rulers' intentions and their inability to comprehend the true purpose behind Jesus' words.
