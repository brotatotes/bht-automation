# John 7:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Moses gave you circumcision, not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers. The Jews, who observe the law of Moses so strictly, should not take issue with Jesus for healing a man on the Sabbath when circumcision, which is older than Moses, is also performed on the Sabbath. The command to circumcise on the eighth day, even on the Sabbath, is well-established in their own tradition. Therefore, Jesus' act of healing a man on the Sabbath should be understood as a work of great goodness and should not provoke their anger.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Moses on this account gave you circumcision, not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers; i.e. it is no part of the law of Moses, properly so called, but was adopted by Moses, and thereby becomes part of his law."
2. "If this may be done on the Sabbath: if an ordinance strictly Mosaic (which the Sabbath in its Jewish mode of observance was) may be set aside by another, Mosaic also, but more ancient, and borrowed from a more general and direct command of God (“circumcisio est antiquior rigido otio sabbati per Mosen imperato” Grotius), how much more may it by a deed of mercy, a benevolent exercise of divine power, the approval of which is anterior to and deeper than all ceremonial enactment?"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "How much less ought fault to be found with One who had made a man 'every whit whole'—or rather, 'a man's entire body whole'—on the sabbath-day?" 
2. "What a testimony to the reality of the miracle, none daring to meet the bold appeal."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Moses on this account gave you circumcision, not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers."
2. "Though Jesus spoke in accordance with the custom of the Jews, yet he is careful to remind them that it was in observance long before Moses."
3. "The law required that the child should be circumcised on the eighth day. If that day happened to be the Sabbath, yet they held that he was to be circumcised, as there was a positive law to that effect."

### John Calvin:
1. "circumcision was enjoined in such a manner that the practice of that symbolical rite was necessary even on the Sabbath-day"
2. "it has in this manner been sufficiently demonstrated to them, that the worship of the Sabbath is not violated by the works of God."
3. "Moses, who so rigidly demanded the keeping of the Sabbath, commanded that infants should be circumcised on the eighth day, even though it should fall on the day of Rest."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The very law was intended to teach them the fundamental principle upon which Jesus rested His defense, to look beyond the letter to the spirit, and to see that sometimes an ordinance is most honored when its letter is broken."
2. "They felt that to receive the sign of God's covenant, the token of consecration and of the removal of uncleanness could never be really inconsistent with any command of God."
3. "This passage is of great interest as showing that in many respects the law, even whilst seeming to deal in positive precepts only, was intended to become, and in some measure actually was, a discipline, preparing for the 'dispensation of the Spirit.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers. A parenthesis to explain that circumcision is older in origin than Moses." 
2. "And on the sabbath ye circumcise. Adversative use of κα=and yet as in John 7:19. That is to say, the Jews keep one law (circumcision) by violating another (on the Sabbath, the charge against him in chapter 5, healing on the Sabbath)."

### John Gill:
1. "The command to Abraham is so express, for the circumcision of his male offspring, Genesis 17:10; however, it being both of Moses and of the fathers, laid a very great obligation on the Jews to observe it."
2. "For the same reason, they also allow the sacrifice of the passover to be done on the sabbath day, because it is a command which went before the command of the sabbath."
3. "From all which it appears, that circumcision on the sabbath day, was a common practice, and which confirms the assertion of Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "Moses gave you circumcision — The sense is, because Moses enjoined you circumcision (though indeed it was far more ancient than him) you think it no harm to circumcise a man on the Sabbath."
2. "And are ye angry at me (which anger had now continued sixteen months) for doing so much greater a good, for healing a man, body and soul, on the Sabbath?"
