# John 7:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If circumcision, a form of surgery, was deemed lawful and performed on the Sabbath, then why are you angry at me for restoring an infirm man to full health on the Sabbath? Just as circumcision was considered necessary for religious purity, this man's complete healing—physically and spiritually—is of even greater importance. It seems that your zealous adherence to the Sabbath has blinded you to the compassion and mercy displayed through this miraculous act. Remember, the preservation of life always takes precedence over strict observance of the Sabbath.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "in order that the Law of Moses may not be broken, viz. that which (after the fathers) ordains circumcision on the eighth day."
2. "The distinction is between circumcision, which purified only part of a man, by which he received (ἔλαβεν) ceremonial cleanness, and that perfect and entire healing which the Lord bestowed on the cripple."
3. "The argument is especially addressed to them."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Taking no notice of the popular appeal, He recalls His cure of the impotent man, and the murderous rage it had kindled."
2. "By this fearless reference to [the event], exposing their hypocrisy and dark designs, He gave His position great moral strength."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That the law of Moses should not be broken - In order that the law requiring it to be done at a specified time, though that might occur on the Sabbath, should be kept."
2. "Are ye angry ... - The argument of Jesus is this: 'You yourselves, in interpreting the law about the Sabbath, allow a work of necessity to be done. You do that which is necessary as an ordinance of religion denoting separation from other nations, or external purity. As you allow this, you ought also, for the same reason, to allow that a man should be completely restored to health - that a work of much more importance should be done.'"
3. "Every whit whole - Literally, 'I have restored the whole man to health,' implying that the man’s whole body was diseased, and that he had been entirely restored to health."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The verb means to be full of bile, hence to be melancholy mad." 
2. "I made a whole man sound, in contrast with the rite of circumcision which affects only a single member."
3. "They practice on the Sabbath."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Their reverence for the law and their determination that it should not be broken led them to break the letter of the Fourth Commandment."
2. "He had performed a far more healing work than circumcision. He had given not merely a token of the removal of uncleanness, but complete freedom from the blight and woe which sin had brought on the 'whole man.'"
3. "The verse just quoted (chap. John 5:14), and the recollection of the figurative and spiritual application of the rite of circumcision with which the prophets had made the Jews familiar, warn us against limiting the miracle at the pool of Bethesda to the restoration of physical health."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They are punctilious about their Sabbath rules and about circumcision on the eighth day. When they clash, they drop the Sabbath rule and circumcise."
2. "Are ye wroth with me? Old word from bile, possibly from yellowish green. Only here in N.T. So to be mad. With dative. Vivid picture of bitter spleen against Jesus for healing a man on the Sabbath when they circumcise on the Sabbath."
3. "A man every whit whole. Literally, 'a whole man sound,' not just one member of the body mended."

### John Gill:
1. "If circumcision was administered on the sabbath day, 'without breaking the law of Moses', as some render the words, which commanded the observation of the sabbath, are ye angry at me; and pursue me with so much wrath and bitterness because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?"
2. "If it was no breach of the sabbath to make a wound, and lay a plaster on it, as in circumcision; it would be no violation of it, nor ought any to be offended with it, that Christ should heal a diseased man, who was so in every part of his body, and restore health to his soul likewise."
3. "Nothing is more common with the Jews than to say, the danger of life, and 'the preservation of the soul', or life, drive away the sabbath."
