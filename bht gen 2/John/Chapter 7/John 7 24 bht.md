# John 7:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment. Let your judgment be a just one, based on the truth and evidence of things, rather than superficial appearances. In all your judgments, seek to rise above the letter of the law and consider the spirit behind it. Look beyond what first presents itself and instead, candidly and fairly evaluate each situation, applying the appropriate judgment in light of the case at hand.
