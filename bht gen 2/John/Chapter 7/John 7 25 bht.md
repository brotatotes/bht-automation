# John 7:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people of Jerusalem, who were more knowledgeable about the schemes of the religious leaders, recognized Jesus and questioned if he was the one they were seeking to kill. They were aware of the long-standing plot against Jesus by the chief priests, Scribes, and elders. These city dwellers knew that the religious leaders were plotting to kill Jesus, even from the previous Passover. It was clear that the leaders had been consistently scheming against him and were now seeking an opportunity to apprehend and execute him.
