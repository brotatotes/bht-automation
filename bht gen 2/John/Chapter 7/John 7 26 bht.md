# John 7:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The townspeople are perplexed by Jesus' boldness in speaking, as if he had permission from the chief priests. They notice that Jesus speaks without restraint, even daring to criticize the Jewish leaders and suggesting their judgment is biased. The townspeople wonder if the rulers truly know that Jesus is the Messiah, and if so, have they changed their minds about him and altered their treatment of him?
