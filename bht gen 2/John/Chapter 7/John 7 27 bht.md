# John 7:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The statement, When Christ cometh, none knoweth whence he is, refers to the mystery surrounding the origin of Jesus as the Messiah. This Jewish tradition held some truth, as it pertained to his divine nature, which could not be fully understood or declared by anyone. However, this was not the case for his human nature, as both his family and the place of his birth were clearly prophesied. It is important to recognize the mysterious yet prophetic nature of Christ's coming, acknowledging his divine origin while also affirming his human lineage.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Perhaps they refer to the idea (see Justin Mart., Dial. c. Tryph. 8, 110, pp. 110, 203) that the Messiah would not be known (ἄγνωστός ἐστι καὶ οὐδὲ αὐτός πω ἑαυτὸν ἐπίσταται) until anointed by Elias, when He would suddenly come forth from obscurity." 
2. "They may allude to Isaiah 53:8."
3. "The place of the Messiah’s birth was known, John 7:42."
4. "At all events we see here, that the Jews regarded their Messiah not as a mere man, but one to be supernaturally sent into the world."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Messiah's origin would be mysterious (not altogether wrong)"
2. "They concluded that Jesus could not be He, since they knew all about His family at Nazareth."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We know this man whence he is - We know the place of his birth and residence."
2. "From Matthew 2:5, it appears that the common expectation of the Jews was that the Messiah would be born at Bethlehem; but they had also feigned that after his birth he would be hidden or taken away in some mysterious manner, and appear again from some unexpected quarter."
3. "The following extracts from Jewish writings show that this was the common expectation: 'The Redeemer shall manifest himself, and afterward be hid.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The knowing of the rulers is expressed by egnwsan; have they ascertained by searching and watching."
2. "The people's knowledge, oidamen, is that of settled conviction."
3. "Meyer says that while the popular belief that the immediate ancestry of the Messiah would be unknown when He came cannot further be historically proved, it is credible, partly from the belief in His divine origin, and partly from the obscurity into which the Davidic family had sunk."

### John Calvin:
1. "Here we see not only how great is the blindness of men, when they ought to judge about the things of God, but this vice is almost natural to them, to be ingenious in contriving what may hinder them from arriving at the knowledge of the truth."
2. "It is frequently, indeed, from the craft of Satan that offenses arise, which cause many to turn away from Christ; but though the road were plain and smooth, every man would contrive an offense for himself."
3. "On the mean condition of Christ in the flesh let us therefore learn to look in such a manner, that this state of humiliation, which is despised by wicked men, may raise us to his heavenly glory."

### Philip Schaff:

### John Gill:
1. "They pretended to know his extract, that he was the son of Joseph and Mary, that he was begotten in wedlock, and was born as other persons are; there was no difficulty with them in accounting for his coming into the world, no more than any other ordinary person."
2. "They knew he would come from Bethlehem, and they knew that he would come out of the seed of David; but then he was to be born of a virgin, according to Isaiah 7:14, and such a coming into the world was not to be known, reasoned upon, and accounted for."
3. "The modern Jews endeavour to explain away the sense of this phrase, 'another seed', as if it regarded strange seed; and that the sense of the expression is only, that the Messiah should spring from the family of Moab, and from Ruth the Moabitess."

### John Wesley:
1. "When Christ cometh, none knoweth whence he is" - This Jewish tradition was true, with regard to his Divine nature: in that respect none could declare his generation.
