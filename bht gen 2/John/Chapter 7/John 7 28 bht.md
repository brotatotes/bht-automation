# John 7:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, with a loud and earnest voice, acknowledged that the people knew both His human origin and His earthly identity. However, He pointed out that they lacked true knowledge of His divine nature and the fact that He was sent from God. Though the people thought they knew Him, they were unaware of the deeper truth and purpose behind His coming.
