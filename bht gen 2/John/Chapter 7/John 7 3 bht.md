# John 7:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During the feast of tabernacles, the brothers and cousins of Jesus urged him to go to Judea, hoping to be rid of him. Their desire to separate from him reflects the mindset of those who do not seek the presence of Christ or care for understanding his ways. They encouraged him to go among his enemies, who were seeking to harm him. By going to Judea, Jesus would have the opportunity to display his miracles to his followers from different regions, strengthening their faith in him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Thou hast many disciples in Judea here in Galilee they are fast dropping off; it is not like one who advances the claims Thou dost to linger so long here, away from the city of our solemnities, where surely 'the kingdom of our father David' is to be set up."
2. "seeking, as Thou dost, to be known openly, those miracles of Thine ought not to be confined to this distant corner, but submitted at headquarters to the inspection of 'the world.'"
3. "I am become a stranger to my brethren, an alien unto my mother's children!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "His brethren - See the notes at Matthew 12:47."
2. "Thy disciples - The disciples which he had made when he was before in Judea, John 4:1-3."
3. "The works - The miracles."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Thy disciples...both those who had been gained by former teaching in Judaea and Jerusalem."

### John Calvin:
1. "He says that they mocked at Christ, because he shunned to be seen or known, and concealed himself in a mean and despised district of Judea."
2. "But granting this, still it is evident that they ridicule him, because they do not think that his conduct is rational and judicious; and they even upbraid him with folly, because, while he wishes to be something, he wants confidence in himself, and does not venture to appear openly before men."
3. "When they say, 'that thy disciples also may see,' they mean not only his domestics, but all those whom he wished to procure out of the whole nation; for they add, 'Thou wishest to be known by all, and yet thou concealest thyself.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is important to keep this in mind if we would understand the position occupied by the brothers of Jesus."
2. "To these ‘brethren,’ then, brought up in the prevalent Messianic belief, there appeared an inconsistency between the loftiness of His claims and the comparatively limited display of what He offered as His credentials."
3. "At the feast the whole body of His disciples would be gathered together, and what might be done in Jerusalem would be conspicuous to all."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "His brethren (ο αδελφο αυτου). 'His brothers' (half-brothers actually), who 'were not believing on him' (ουδε επιστευον εις αυτον) as stated in verse John 7:5."
2. "It was impertinence on their part."
3. "Perhaps the brothers of Jesus may actually have been eager to rush Jesus into the hostile atmosphere of Jerusalem again."

### John Gill:
1. "The feast of tabernacles being at hand, they put him upon going up to it, being willing to be rid of him: saying, depart hence: which is the language of carnal men, who desire not the company of Christ, nor the knowledge of his ways."
2. "And go into Judea; among his most inveterate enemies, who sought to take away his life; and which doubtless they knew."
3. "Meaning not his twelve disciples, who were now with him, but the disciples he had made, and baptized in Judea, John 4:1. Or his disciples in the several parts of the land, who would all be at Jerusalem, at the feast of tabernacles; and so, should he go, would have an opportunity of seeing his miracles, and thereby be the more confirmed in the faith of him."

### John Wesley:
1. "His brethren - So called according to the Jewish way of speaking."
2. "They were his cousins, the sons of his mother's sister."
3. "Depart hence - From this obscure place."
