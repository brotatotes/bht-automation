# John 7:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They sought to take him because of his reproof and for professing to be the Messiah, yet they were impotent in their attempts. Their fear of the people and the appointed time set by God prevented them from laying hands on him. It is clear that there was a secondary hindrance, but it was ultimately God's providence that protected Jesus, as his hour had not yet come. As believers, we should trust in God's timing and not be led astray by fear, casting all our cares on Him and faithfully fulfilling our duties.
