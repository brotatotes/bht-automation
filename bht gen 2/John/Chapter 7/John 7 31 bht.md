# John 7:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is evident that faith in Christ and true religion often thrives among the common people, as we can see in the spread and growth of belief among the ordinary crowd. The Jews had a legitimate anticipation for numerous miracles from the Messiah, which is why their expectation was not without basis. However, it is worth noting that the present-day Jews have discarded such hopes and claim that they were not previously anticipated.
