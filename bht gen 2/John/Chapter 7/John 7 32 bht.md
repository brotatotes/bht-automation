# John 7:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people were murmuring among themselves, debating whether Jesus was the Messiah, as he had performed such wonderful miracles. However, the rulers rejected him, fearing that his growing popularity would undermine their principles, practices, and authority. This resistance from the Pharisees and other Jewish leaders ultimately led them to send officers to apprehend Jesus, as they did not want to risk losing their influence and control.
