# John 7:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After Jesus spoke these words, some of the hearers took them as referring to his going away among the Greeks, whom they did not think they could follow. But he meant that as the Son of God, he would ascend to the Father, in fulfillment of ancient prophecies, and then they would earnestly desire the coming of the Messiah, but it would be too late, for he would be in heaven, beyond their reach. Where I am refers to Christ's perpetual presence in heaven in his Divine nature, emphasizing his eternal existence and fellowship with the Father.
