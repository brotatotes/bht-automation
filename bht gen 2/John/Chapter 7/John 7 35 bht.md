# John 7:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jewish leaders mockingly question whether Jesus will go to a place where they cannot find him, perhaps to the Jews scattered among the Gentiles or even to the Greeks. Their contemptuous insinuations reveal their disbelief and disapproval of Jesus' teaching, which seems to reverse their cherished traditions and the established Jewish modes of thought. But little do they know that Jesus' words, spoken in scorn, actually foreshadow His purpose of teaching and gathering together the children of God, even those who are scattered abroad.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "They cannot comprehend Him, but seem awed by the solemn grandeur of His warning."
2. "He takes no notice, however, of their questions."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To the Jews scattered among the Gentiles, or living in distant parts of the earth."
2. "All those who were not Jews were called Greeks, because they were chiefly acquainted with those pagans only who spake the Greek language."
3. "He rather chose to turn off their minds from a speculation about the place to which he was going, to the great affairs of their own personal salvation."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Will He go. Literally, whither does this man intend to go, or whither is He thinking of going? The A. V. misses the contemptuous insinuation in this man."
2. "We shall not find him. The pronoun is emphatic; we, the religious leaders, the wise men, who scrutinize the claims of all professed teachers and keep a watchful eye on all impostors."
3. "The dispersed among the Gentiles. Literally, the dispersion of the Greeks. The Jews who remained in foreign lands after the return from the Captivity were called by two names: The Captivity... and The Dispersion."

### John Calvin:
1. "Thus not only are wicked men deaf to hear God’s instruction, but even dreadful threatenings are allowed by them to pass by in mockery, as if they were listening to a fable."
2. "The meaning of the words therefore is, 'Will he cross the sea, to go to Jews who dwell in a world unknown to us?'"
3. "But however that may be, we see that the severe threatening which Christ had uttered did not at all affect them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "His teaching has seemed to them a complete reversal of Jewish modes of thought. No learning of the schools prepared Him for His self-chosen office."
2. "The great difficulty of this verse is the use of such a phrase as ‘the Dispersion of the Greeks.’ An explanation is furnished by the thought already suggested, that the Jews, with irony and scorn, would show forth Jesus as reversing all their cherished instincts, beliefs, and usages."
3. "Words spoken in hate and scorn are an unconscious prophecy. He will teach and gather together the children of God that are scattered abroad, this is the very purpose of His coming."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "These Jewish leaders... talk among themselves about what Jesus said in a spirit of contempt."
2. "Negative answer expected in an ironical question, 'Is he about to go?'"
3. "Confessing his failure to teach the Jews in Palestine, 'thus ignorantly anticipating the course Christianity took; what seemed unlikely and impossible to them became actual'."

### John Gill:

2. "Will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles? or Greeks; and so may design the Jews, who were scattered abroad in the times of the Grecian monarchy, under the successors of Alexander, and particularly Antiochus, in distinction from the Babylonish dispersion."
3. "Or the Jews in general, wherever, and by whomsoever scattered, who might be thought to be more ignorant than the Jews in Judea, and therefore more easily to be imposed upon."

### John Wesley:
1. "Will he go to the dispersed among the Greeks — The Jews scattered abroad in heathen nations, Greece particularly."
2. "Or, Will he teach the Greeks? - The heathens themselves."
