# John 7:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This saying, though repeated by the Saviour, leaves us puzzled and uneasy, much like how the Jews and even Peter were perplexed and distressed by its meaning. It is not an easy statement to understand, as it raises the question of what Jesus could possibly mean by declaring that they will seek Him but not find Him, and that they are unable to come to where He is. These words challenge us to grapple with the enigmatic nature of His teaching.
