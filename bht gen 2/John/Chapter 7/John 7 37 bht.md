### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The generally joyous character of this feast broke out on this day into loud jubilation, particularly at the solemn moment when the priest, as was done on every day of this festival, brought forth, in golden vessels, water from the stream of Siloah, which flowed under the temple-mountain, and solemnly poured it upon the altar."
2. "If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink!â€”What an offer! The deepest cravings of the human spirit are here, as in the Old Testament, expressed by the figure of 'thirst,' and the eternal satisfaction of them by 'drinking.'"
3. "It is just Jehovah's ancient proclamation now sounding forth through human flesh, 'HO, EVERY ONE THAT THIRSTETH, COME YE TO THE WATERS, AND HE THAT HATH NO MONEY!'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "On the last day of the feast it was customary to perform a solemn ceremony in this manner: The priest filled a golden vial with water from the fount of Siloam (see the notes at John 9:7), which was borne with great solemnity, attended with the clangor of trumpets, through the gate of the temple, and being mixed with wine, was poured on the sacrifice on the altar."
2. "What was the origin of this custom is unknown. Some suppose, and not improbably, that it arose from an improper understanding of the passage in Isaiah 12:3; 'With joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.' It is certain that no such ceremony is commanded by Moses."
3. "Instead of depending on this ceremony of drawing water let him come to me, the Messiah, and he shall find an ever-abundant supply for all the wants of his soul."

### Philip Schaff:
