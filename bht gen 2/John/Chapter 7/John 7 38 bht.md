# John 7:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Scripture teaches that those who believe in Christ will have their souls filled with living water. This water represents the grace of the Spirit of God, which brings cleansing and purification. Not only will believers themselves be refreshed, but this grace will flow from them to bless others. This aligns with the passages in the Old Testament that speak of the outpouring of the Spirit by the Messiah as pouring out water. Faith in Christ not only satisfies the believer's own spiritual thirst but also enables them to be a source of blessing to others.

1. "Out of his belly, as the scripture hath said, shall flow" refers to passages such as Isaiah 58:11, Joel 3:18, Zechariah 14:8, and Ezekiel 47:1-12, where the idea is that of waters issuing from beneath the temple, to which our Lord compares Himself and those who believe in Him.
2. "Out of his belly" refers to the inner man, the soul, as in Ezekiel 47:1-26.
