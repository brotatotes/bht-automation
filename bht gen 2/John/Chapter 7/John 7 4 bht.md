# John 7:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For no man does anything, especially miracles, in secret but rather desires to be of public use and gain recognition. Therefore, if you truly perform these miracles as reported, it is better to reveal yourself openly to the world, so that all may bear witness to your works and be converted.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. "No man can assert the position which Christ claims, and at the same time keep secret the works which go to vindicate it."
2. "Openly [εν παρρησια] . Literally, in boldness."

### John Calvin:
1. "If thou dost these things, that is, if thou aspirest to such greatness that all may applaud thee, direct towards thee the eyes of all."
2. "If thou dost these things, that is, since thou art endued with so great power as to procure reputation for thyself by miracles, do not throw them away; for all that has been given to thee by God thou spendest here to no purpose."
3. "What is here told us concerning Christ happens in daily experience, that the children of God suffer greater annoyance from their near relations than from strangers; for they are instruments of Satan which tempt, sometimes to ambition, and sometimes to avarice, those who desire to serve God purely and faithfully."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "‘To be in boldness’ may seem a singular expression; the Greek words, however, will not admit of the rendering ‘to be known openly;’ and it is clear that the form of the phrase is chosen so as to be in correspondence with what precedes, ‘doeth anything in secret.’" 
2. "Working miracles in secret and a bold claim of personal dignity and office are, in the view of these men, things incompatible with one another."
3. "These words are very remarkable... but we cannot doubt that the Evangelist sees here the language of unconscious prophecy."

1. "Manifest thyself (φανερωσον σεαυτον). First aorist active imperative of φανεροω."
