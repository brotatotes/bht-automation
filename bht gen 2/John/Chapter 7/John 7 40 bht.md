# John 7:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Many people, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the prophet. They had some knowledge, though but small; and they spoke of him, though but as children in understanding. It’s clear that the prophet they are referring to is the one promised to Moses in Deuteronomy 18:15, as well as mentioned in the note on John 1:21. This shows the deep impression that Jesus had made on them and the anticipation they had for the coming of the Messiah.
