These individuals were divided in their beliefs about Jesus, with some recognizing and openly confessing that He is the true Messiah. However, others questioned whether the Messiah could come from Galilee. This division serves as a reminder that controversies and differing opinions are not uncommon even among those who claim to be followers of God. It is important to note that while some may dismiss Jesus based on His origins, they fail to see the greater truth that He is the long-awaited Savior.
