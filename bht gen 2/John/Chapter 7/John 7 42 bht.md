# John 7:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
From Bethlehem, how could they forget that Jesus was born there? It is certain that David was born there, and therefore it is called his city, and from there the Messiah was to come. How unfortunate that Herod's actions made it impossible to overlook the fact that Jesus was born in Bethlehem. It is clear that this fulfilled the prophecy in Micah 5:2.

### John Wesley:
