# John 7:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The multitude had a cruel and eager desire to seize Jesus, demonstrating the extent to which they despised and rejected Him. They aimed to not only belittle Him but also to harm Him. However, their efforts were in vain as the providence of God protected Jesus. His hour had not yet come, so He overcame all the dangers that came His way, relying on His Father's protection. Despite their strong will, the people were ultimately restrained from laying hands on Him by an unseen force.
