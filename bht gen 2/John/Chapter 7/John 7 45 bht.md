# John 7:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Sanhedrin, with their immense desire to seize Jesus, were infuriated when the officers they sent to arrest Him returned empty-handed. These officers, not siding with those who sought to forcefully apprehend Jesus or those who disputed His messiahship, aligned themselves with the belief that He was a prophet or even the Messiah. Their failure to carry out the orders of the Sanhedrin incited a violent outburst from the council, who had been eagerly anticipating the opportunity to question Him. The return of the officers without Jesus stunned and greatly enraged the Sanhedrin, amplifying their thirst for His blood.
