# John 7:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The words of Jesus had a powerful effect on the officers, as they were unlike anything they had ever heard before. His words carried a weight and authority that left them spellbound, even though they may not have fully grasped the profound meaning behind them. This unexpected response from the officers, who were not easily moved by public speeches, left the Sanhedrin disconcerted, as they realized that Jesus' words held a divine power that was beyond human comprehension.
