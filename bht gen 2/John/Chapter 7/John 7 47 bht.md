# John 7:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who have been long in service are reproved for quickly joining a deluded group without taking the time to seek the opinion of their superiors. This highlights the common belief that Christ and his followers were deceivers, leading people astray. However, those who follow Christ and his faithful ministers are not deceived, as they show the way of salvation.
