# John 7:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The question inquires whether any rulers or Pharisees have genuinely believed in Jesus, highlighting the association between authority and religious acceptance. This poses a challenge to the notion of religious judgment based on worldly status. The appeal likely carried a sting, unveiling the fading grasp on power. While the authority of rulers is necessary for maintaining order within the Church, it must be subordinate to God's word. This underscores the importance of revering the word of God, dismissing the empty allure of the world.
