# John 7:49 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Pharisees regarded the common people who followed Jesus with scorn and contempt, considering them to be an ignorant and cursed multitude. They believed that these individuals lacked knowledge of the law and were therefore deserving of condemnation. This attitude reflects the Pharisees' pride in their own supposed superior understanding of the scriptures, which they used to assert their authority over others. However, it is important to note that true knowledge of God's truth is not limited to a select few, but is accessible to all who humbly seek it, regardless of their social or educational status.
