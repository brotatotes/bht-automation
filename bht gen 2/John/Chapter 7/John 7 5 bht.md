# John 7:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Little regard should be given to carnal descent and alliance to men of faith, such as Abraham, unless one possesses the same grace and faith. It is insignificant if one has claimed to know Christ or is related to him in a physical sense, unless they are transformed into new creatures in him. Only those who are spiritually related to Christ are truly acknowledged by him.

2. "The imperfect, were believing; referring not to a single act of faith, but to faith as habitual and controlling."

### John Calvin:
1. "Hence we infer how small is the value of carnal relationship; for the Holy Spirit stamps with a perpetual mark of infamy the relations of Christ, because, though convinced by the testimonies of so many works, they did not even then believe."
2. "Therefore, whosoever wishes to be thought to be in Christ, as Paul says, let him be a new creature, for they who dedicate themselves wholly to God obtain the place of father, and mother, and brethren to Christ, and all others he utterly disavows."
3. "So much the more ridiculous is the superstition of Papists, who, disregarding everything else in the Virgin Mary, extol her only on the ground of relationship, bestowing on her the title of the Mother of Christ."

2. "The words of Paul in 1 Corinthians 15:7, 'Then He appeared to James,' make it very probable that it was by our Lord’s resurrection from the dead that the brothers were led to a true belief in that Divine mission."
3. "In spite of the earlier miracles they had witnessed, they had refused to accept."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For not even were his brothers believing on him." 
2. "The sad picture of the persistent refusal of the brothers of Jesus to believe in his Messianic assumptions."
3. "The brothers here are sarcastic."

### John Gill:
1. "Little regard is to be had, or confidence placed, in carnal descent from, or alliance to the best of men; as to Abraham, or any other true believer, if they have not the same grace, or the same faith as such have."
2. "It matters not if men have known Christ, or have been allied to him after the flesh, unless they are new creatures in him."
3. "It is only such who are so in a spiritual sense, that are regarded by him."
