# John 7:50 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Nicodemus, who previously sought Jesus at night but now with greater boldness, speaks up as a member of the council, challenging their condemnation of Jesus. He questions their disregard for the law, asking if it is just to pass judgment on someone without first hearing them. In this moment, Nicodemus exemplifies the importance of courageously defending the truth and upholding justice, even within influential assemblies.
