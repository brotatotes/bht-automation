# John 7:51 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish ruling council, questioned the actions of his fellow Pharisees. He wondered if their condemnation of Jesus without hearing his defense was in accordance with the law they were supposed to uphold. Nicodemus, though not openly expressing his support for Jesus, seemed to have a hidden admiration for him. Like a just judge, he wanted fairness and a legal process for Jesus, rather than a hasty judgment.
