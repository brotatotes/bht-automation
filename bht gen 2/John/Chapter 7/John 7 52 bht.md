# John 7:52 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These religious leaders responded to Nicodemus with scorn and personal attacks, rather than addressing his argument. They insulted him and claimed that no prophet could come from Galilee, but this is false. They conveniently ignored the fact that Jonah and Nahum both arose from Galilee, and even the town of Thisbe, the home of the prophet Elijah, was in Galilee. It is clear that their response was weak and they were aware that it would not hold up under scrutiny.

2. "The extreme violence to which they are excited against Nicodemus shows with what furious hatred they burned against Christ."
