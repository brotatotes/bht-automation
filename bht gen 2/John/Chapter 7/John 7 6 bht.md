# John 7:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus responds to his disciples, saying, My time is not yet come. This statement refers specifically to the timing of his journey to the feast, not to his death or exaltation. It is the appropriate and suitable occasion for him to manifest himself publicly as the Messiah. In contrast, the disciples have the freedom to go up to the feast at any time without facing danger or opposition. They are still in harmony with the world, whereas Jesus, being in essential antagonism with the world, must exercise caution in his movements.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "My time is not yet come‚Äîthat is, for showing Himself to the world."
2. "your time is always ready‚Äîthat is 'It matters little when we go up, for ye have no great plans in life, and nothing hangs upon your movements.'"
3. "With Me it is otherwise; on every movement of Mine there hangs what ye know not. The world has no quarrel with you, for ye bear no testimony against it, and so draw down upon yourselves none of its wrath; but I am here to lift up My voice against its hypocrisy, and denounce its abominations; therefore it cannot endure Me, and one false step might precipitate its fury on its Victim's head before the time. Away, therefore, to the feast as soon as it suits you; I follow at the fitting moment, but 'My time is not yet full come.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "My time ... - The proper time for my going up to the feast." 
2. "It makes no difference to you when you go up. Your going will excite no tumult or opposition; it will not attract attention, and will not endanger your lives."
3. "Jesus therefore chose to go up more privately, and to remain until the multitude had gone."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The appropriate season or juncture."
2. "The disciples might at any time associate with the world, with which they were still in sympathy."
3. "Not so Jesus, who was in essential antagonism to the world."

### John Calvin:
1. "My time is not yet come. There are some who erroneously interpret this as referring to the time of his death, for it denotes the time of his setting out on the journey to go to the feast." (181)
2. "He assures them that, in this respect, he differs from his relations. They may freely and without danger appear, at all hours, before the world, because the world is friendly and favorable to them; but he is in dread of his person, and justly, because the world is his mortal enemy." (181)
3. "By these words he means that they do wrong in giving advice on a matter which they do not understand." (181)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "My time is not yet present, but your time is always ready." 
2. "Here as there His time was at hand, but not yet ‚Äòpresent;' and until the moment appointed by the Father He whose will is one with that of the Father can do nothing."
3. "Such limitation did not apply to His brethren; they were not separated from the ‚Äòworld,‚Äô and with that world they might at any time associate."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Only use with verse John 7:8 of Œ∫Œ±ŒπœÅŒøœÇ in this Gospel, elsewhere œáœÅŒøŒΩŒøœÇ (John 5:6) or more often œâœÅŒ± (John 2:4) "the predestined hour" (Bernard)."
2. "Here Œ∫Œ±ŒπœÅŒøœÇ is the fitting or proper occasion for Christ's manifesting himself publicly to the authorities as Messiah as in verse John 7:8."
3. "The brothers of Jesus had the regular Jewish obligation to go up to the feast, but the precise day was a matter of indifference to them."


### John Gill:
1. "My time is not yet come; meaning, not the time of his death, or of his exaltation and glorification, or of the showing of himself forth unto the world; though all this was true..." 
2. "but of his going up to this feast; as appears from John 7:8" 
3. "but your time is always ready; intimating, they might go at any time; their lives were not in any danger, as his was..."

### John Wesley:
1. Jesus saith, Your time is always ready ‚Äî This or any time will suit you.
