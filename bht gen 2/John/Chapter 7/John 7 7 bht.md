# John 7:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The world does not hate those who are of the world because they share the same spirit and principles. However, those who testify against the wickedness of the world will inevitably face opposition and hatred. This is because the testimony of such individuals exposes the evil deeds and sinful nature of mankind.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "You profess no principles in opposition to the world. You do not excite its envy, or rouse against you the civil rulers."
2. "As you possess the same spirit and principles with the men of the world, they cannot be expected to hate you."
3. "We may expect that all who preach faithfully against the wickedness of men will excite opposition. Yet this is not to deter us from doing our duty, and, after the example of Jesus, from proclaiming to men their sins, whatever may be the result."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Cannot. Frequent in John, and expressing an inherent impossibility." 
2. "Evil [πονηρα]. See on Luke 3:19; Luke 7:21."

### John Calvin:
1. "But me it hateth, because I testify. The world here denotes men who are not born again, who retain their natural disposition; and accordingly he declares that all who have not yet been regenerated by the Spirit are Christ’s adversaries."
2. "And if we acquiesce in the decision of Christ, we are under the necessity of acknowledging that the whole nature of man is so sinful and wicked, that nothing right, or sincere, or good, can proceed from it."
3. "We learn from it also, that so great is the pride natural to men, that they flatter and applaud themselves in their vices; for they would not kindle into rage, when they are reproved, were it not that they are blinded by excessive love of themselves, and on that account flatter themselves in their sins."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Jesus takes up the word which they had used; but in His mouth it has a depth of solemn meaning of which they knew nothing."
2. "With them the world was the whole body of Israelites, with whom lay the acceptance or rejection of His claims; with Him the world was a hostile power, to which indeed He will manifest Himself, but which He has come to subdue."
3. "Jesus and His brothers stand in opposite relations to the world, they at one with it, He the Reprover of its wicked works."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Because of 'the law of moral correspondence', often in John for 'inherent impossibility'"
2. "The brothers of Jesus here belong to the unbelieving world which is unable to love Jesus"
3. "This unbelieving 'world' resented the exposure"

### John Gill:
1. "Because they were of the world, belonged to it; they were like unto it, and every like loves its like..."
2. "...wicked men not only take pleasure in sin, but in them that do it..."
3. "...Christ bore his testimony of these, that they were evil; being done either not according to the command of God, but the traditions of the elders; or not from a right principle, as of faith and love, nor to a right end, as the glory of God; but only to be seen of men..."

### John Wesley:
1. "The world cannot hate you—Because ye are of the world."
2. "But me it hateth—And all that bear the same testimony."
