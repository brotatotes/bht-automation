# John 7:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Though Jesus encouraged his brothers to go up to the feast, he chose to stay behind. The ceremonial law was still in effect, and even though his brothers did not understand the significance of the feast, they were still expected to observe it. Unbelievers should still attend to outward means of worship, such as hearing the word, as God may use it to enlighten their minds. Jesus made it clear that he would not go up to the feast now, indicating that he had an intention to go at a later time.
