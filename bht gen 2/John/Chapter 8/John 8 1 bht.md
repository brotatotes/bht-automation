# John 8:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus went to the Mount of Olives, perhaps to avoid danger and seek peace in contrast to the Sanhedrin's conduct. Staying with Lazarus, Martha, and Mary, it is possible that he sought recreation and communion with dear friends. Moreover, Jesus likely spent the night in private prayer to God for himself, his disciples, the spread of his Gospel, and the enlargement of his interest.
