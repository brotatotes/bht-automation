# John 8:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus rose and saw that no one remained to condemn her with a legal sentence, he asked the woman, 'Where are your accusers?' It became clear that no one had taken up the opportunity to cast a stone at her, indicating that none of them were free from sin or could execute the punishment they had demanded.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Conscious of her own guilt, and till now in the hands of men who had talked of stoning her, wondering at the skill with which her accusers had been dispersed, and the grace of the few words addressed to herself, she would be disposed to listen, with a reverence and teachableness before unknown, to our Lord's admonition."
2. "He simply leaves the matter where it was. He meddles not with the magistrate's office, nor acts the Judge in any sense. But in saying, 'Go and sin no more,' which had been before said to one who undoubtedly believed, more is probably implied than expressed."
3. "If brought suddenly to conviction of sin, admiration of her Deliverer, and a willingness to be admonished and guided by Him, this call to begin a new life may have carried with it what would ensure and naturally bring about a permanent change."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jesus had directed them, if innocent, to cast a stone, thus to condemn her, or to use the power which he gave them to condemn her."
2. "No one of them had done that. They had accused her, but they had not proceeded to the act expressive of judicial condemnation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word ‘condemn,’ for which it is not possible to substitute another, conveys most imperfectly the sense of the original Greek."
2. "The meaning is rather, ‘Doth no man doom thee to the sentence of which they spoke?’"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Lifted up himself (ανακυψας). First aorist active participle of ανακυπτω as in verse John 8:7."
2. "Where are they? (Που εισιν;). Jesus had kept on writing on the ground as the accusers had slipped away one by one."
3. "Did no man condemn thee? (ουδεις σε κατεκρινεν;). First aorist active indicative of κατακρινω, old and common verb to give judgment against (down on) one, but not in John. No one dared to cast a stone at the woman on Christ's terms."

### John Gill:
1. "When Jesus had lift himself up,.... From the earth, towards which he stooped, and on which he had been writing:and saw none but the woman..."
2. "...none of those that had brought her there, and had accused her to him:he said unto her, woman, where are those thine accusers?..."
3. "...has no one offered to do unto thee what I proposed? what, not one that could take up a stone, and cast at thee? was there not one of them free from this sin? could no man take upon him to execute this sentence?"

### John Wesley:
1. Hath no man condemned thee? — Hath no judicial sentence been passed upon thee?
