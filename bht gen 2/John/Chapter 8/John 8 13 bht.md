# John 8:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is often believed that a person's self-testimony cannot be trusted or considered valid. The objections raised against Jesus were no different, as they contended that His own witness of Himself was unreliable. However, Jesus declared that His testimony was not only valid but also supported by the Father. He affirmed His inseparable union with the Father, confirming the truth of His testimony. Jesus spoke with unwavering certainty about His divine origins and His ultimate destination, providing an unassailable testimony.
