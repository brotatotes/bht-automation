# John 8:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus acknowledges that according to human standards, one's own testimony may not be considered valid. However, in his case, his testimony is true, as he is speaking as a divine person in union with his Father. He alone knows his own consciousness and is able to authenticate his teachings and miracles through his divine authority.
