# John 8:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people judged Jesus based on their own limited perspectives and worldly standards, not recognizing that He is the Messiah. Jesus, however, refrained from passing judgment on them at that time. He came into the world not to condemn, but to save. His purpose was to bring light into their darkness, but they preferred to remain in ignorance and were blinded by the god of this age. Jesus did not come to exercise authority in earthly matters, for His mission was of a spiritual nature.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "By your preconceived opinions and prejudices you are determined not to believe that I am the Messiah."
2. "Jesus came not to condemn the world... This expression is to be understood as meaning that he judged no one after their manner; he did not come to censure and condemn men after the appearance, or in a harsh, biased, and unkind manner."

### John Calvin:
1. "For the flesh sometimes denotes the outward appearance of a man; and both meanings agree well with this passage, since wherever either the feelings of the flesh prevail, or a regard to the person regulates the judgment, neither truth nor justice dwells."
2. "I think that the meaning will be more certain if you contrast the flesh with the Spirit, understanding his meaning to be, that they are not lawful and competent judges because they have not the Spirit for their guide." 
3. "For in order the more fully to convict his enemies of pride, he employs this comparison, that they unjustly assume the liberty to judge, and yet cannot condemn him, while he merely teaches and abstains from performing the office of a judge."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They had judged Him by mere outward appearance, and according to their own merely human thoughts and wishes."
2. "Jesus judgeth no man... it is not He that judgeth, but rather the Father who judgeth in Him."
3. "The ‘I’ is thus emphatic, equivalent to ‘I by myself’ or ‘I without the Father.'"
