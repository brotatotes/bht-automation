# John 8:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
His judgment is sure and infallible, not based on outward appearance but on his knowledge of the heart. He is in perfect unity with the Father, making their judgment one and the same. And it is the Father who joins him in testifying and passing judgment, confirming the truth of his testimony and the certainty of his judgment.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "I though I form and utter My judgment of you, am not here to carry this into execution—that is reserved to a future day."
3. "The judgment I now pronounce and the witness I now bear is not Mine only as ye suppose, but His also that sent Me."

1. "My judgment is true - Is worthy to be regarded."
2. "For I am not alone - I concur with the Father who hath sent me."
3. "His judgment you admit would be right, and my judgment would accord with his."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. True [αληθης] . The best texts, however, read ajlhqinh, true to the perfect ideal of judgment.

### John Calvin:
1. "And if I judge, He adds this correction, that he may not appear entirely to surrender his right."
2. "For I am not alone...that he must be considered along with the office which was assigned to him by the Father."
3. "Still, the object of the discourse is, to show that all that he does and teaches ought to be accounted Divine."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Because in no action is He alone, even if He judges His judgment is true; it is a real judgment, a judgment corresponding, not to outward appearance, but to the eternal reality of things, because according to the Father’s will."
2. "The assertion of this verse, that the Father is ever with Him, corresponds to the words, ‘I know whence I came,’ in John 8:14: the link which binds together all these verses is His constant and perfect knowledge that the Father is with Him and in Him."
3. "In this lies the validity of His witness: in this is involved the condemnation of His foes."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Yea and if I judge (κα εαν κρινω δε εγω). 'And even if I pass judgment.'"
2. "True (althin). See John 1:9 for αληθινος, genuine, soundly based (cf. δικαια in John 5:30), 'satisfying our perfect conception' (Westcott), not merely true (αληθες) in the particular facts (verse John 8:14)."
3. "But I and the Father that sent me (αλλ εγω κα ο πεμψας με πατηρ). See John 16:32 for a like statement about the Father being with Christ. It is not certain that πατηρ is genuine here (omitted by Aleph D, but in B L W), but the Father is clearly meant as in John 7:18; John 7:33. Jesus gives the Father as the second witness."

### John Gill:
1. "Because he saw not as man did, nor looked unto, and judged according to the outward appearance of things; but looked into the heart, and knew what was in it, being the searcher and trier of it; to whom all things are naked and open, and therefore cannot be deceived or imposed upon; his judgment must be sure and infallible." 
2. "He was not separate from the Father, or at a distance from him, when he was here on earth; he was in his bosom, and in heaven, as the Son of God, when as the son of man, he was below."
3. "Nor was he alone in his testimony and judgment, the Father joined with him therein: and which is a further proof of the truth of his testimony, and the certainty of his judgment."

### John Wesley:
1. "His Father is in him, and he is in the Father" - His Father and he are not one and another God, but one God, (though distinct persons,) and so inseparable from each other.
2. "Christ did not leave the Father, nor the Father leave him" - Christ did not leave the Father, any more than God leaves heaven when he is said to come down to the earth.
