# John 8:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
According to Deuteronomy 19:15, the testimony of two witnesses is required to establish a fact in judicial matters. Jesus affirms this principle, stating that in the law, it is written that the witness of two men is true. He recognizes the significance of multiple witnesses in confirming the truthfulness of a testimony. This understanding aligns with the guidelines set forth in Deuteronomy, where it states that a matter shall be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses. Therefore, Jesus upholds the authority of the law while asserting the validity of his own testimony and that of his Father.
