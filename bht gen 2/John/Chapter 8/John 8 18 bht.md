# John 8:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The testimony of Jesus regarding himself is unique, as it is supported by the Father. While individuals in human courts are not allowed to testify in their own favor due to potential bias, the case of Jesus is different. The Father's testimony is demonstrated through the Holy Spirit's descent at his baptism, the voice from heaven, and the miracles he performed. Additionally, Jesus himself provides evidence of his sincerity and motives through self-denial, sacrifices, and a genuine life. When these aspects are considered, the credibility of Jesus' claims becomes apparent.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "In human courts a man is not allowed to bear witness of himself, because he has a personal interest in the case, and the court could have no proof of the impartiality of the evidence; but in the case of Jesus it was otherwise."
2. "When one has no party ends to serve; when he is willing to deny himself; when he makes great sacrifices; and when, by his life, he gives every evidence of sincerity, his own testimony may be admitted in evidence of his motives and designs."
3. "By the voice from heaven at his baptism Matthew 3:17, and by the miracles which Jesus performed, as well as by the prophecies of the Old Testament."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In all the Sonâ€™s witness concerning Himself, it is the Father that beareth witness concerning Him."
2. "He may mean either (1) that they should themselves have discerned in Him, over and above that which in a holy human prophet they would have accepted as â€˜witness,â€™ a higher presence which could only be Divine; and that, had they done this, they could never have thought of His word as standing alone."
3. "Jesus appeals to two facts which they ought to have known, that He was the expression of the Father, and that what He was the Father was."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Father. Clearly genuine here."
2. "So these are the two witnesses that Jesus presents to the Pharisees in defence of his claim to be the Light of the World."

### John Gill:
1. "And the Father that sent me, beareth witness of me; as he did, by the descent of the Spirit upon him at his baptism, and by a voice from heaven, both at that time, and at his transfiguration, and by the miracles which he wrought..."
2. "Here were two testifiers, his Father and himself; which show them to be two distinct divine persons, and equal to each other."
3. "If the testimony of two men is true, firm, and authentic, and to be depended upon and received, then much more the testimony of two divine persons."
