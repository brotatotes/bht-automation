# John 8:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus says, I go my way, he is talking about his inevitable death, a certain and voluntary event. At that time, the people will seek the Messiah as their deliverer, but it will be too late. Jesus makes it clear that they will never be able to go to the place he is going, which is heaven, where he will be with the Father, enjoying eternal happiness in his human nature. Their rejection of him will result in their eternal separation from God.
