# John 8:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jews, in their malicious and scornful questioning, insinuated the idea that Jesus might kill himself, a crime regarded as heinous and foolish. Their mockery displayed both their scorn and self-righteousness, as they saw Christ's absence as inconsequential and believed it would lead to their victory. Their ignorance of themselves was as profound as their ignorance of Jesus, as they foolishly drew wicked consequences from his words. In suggesting that Jesus go to the darkest and dreadfulest region, reserved for suicides, they imitated Satan and hoped to be freed from the difficulties caused by Jesus.
