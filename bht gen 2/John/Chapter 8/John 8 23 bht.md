# John 8:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The opposition between Jesus and his detractors is rooted in their different origins and nature. While his opponents are influenced by earthly passions, Jesus is of heavenly descent. This contrast highlights the disagreement between his divine message and the limited wisdom of human understanding. These proud individuals, born of darkness, reject Jesus' doctrine because they harbor an aversion toward the kingdom of God. Without being formed by the Spirit of Christ, no one can truly become his disciple. In declaring their earthly origins, Jesus underscores the profound disparity between their sinful inclinations and his divine nature.
