# John 8:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If we do not believe that Jesus is the Deliverer, we will die in our sins. Unbelief drives us away from Christ and deprives us of His grace, which we need for deliverance from our sins. True faith in Christ is not a general belief, but a personal reliance on Him. Jesus claims the divine name I AM, echoing the words of the God of Israel. The Jews, misunderstanding His statement, ask Him to clarify His true identity.
