# John 8:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, in his divine authority, had much to reveal and judge concerning the people's unbelief, knowing every detail of their lives. His purpose was not to condemn, but to offer salvation. He fearlessly spoke publicly to all - Jews, Gentiles, and those gathered in the temple - sharing the truths he received from the Father, who is faithful whether or not people choose to believe.
