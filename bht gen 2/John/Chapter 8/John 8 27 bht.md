# John 8:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They were so blinded by their own ignorance and unbelief that they failed to recognize that Jesus was speaking to them about God the Father. Their hearts were hardened and their understanding clouded, preventing them from grasping the message that Jesus was sent by God. Even though Jesus spoke plainly about the Father in other instances, their stubbornness and preconceived notions kept them from truly comprehending the depth and significance of his words. Once again, Jesus boldly asserted his divinity by proclaiming himself as the great I AM.
