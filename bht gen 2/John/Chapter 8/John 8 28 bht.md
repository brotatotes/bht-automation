# John 8:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When you have crucified me on the cross, you will come to understand the truth of my words. Despite their intentions to shame and humble me, they will unknowingly bring about my exaltation. In this way, they themselves will come to grasp the revelation that I am indeed the Messiah, one with the Father, and that all I do is in accordance with His will.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "When ye shall have been the instruments of accomplishing that death by which He shall enter into His glory."
2. "Perhaps, in different ways: some, by the power of the Holy Spirit poured out after the exaltation of Christ, and to their own salvation; others by the judgments which were to follow ere long, and to their own dismay and ruin."
3. "The interchange of ποιῶ and λαλῶ is remarkable. The construction is not elliptical, so that ποιῶ κ. λαλῶ should be understood in both cases; but the declaration of Joh 8:25 is still in the Lord’s mind, His ποιεῖν being all a declaration of the Father, a λαλεῖν in the widest sense."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The plainest intimation He had yet given in public of the manner and the authors of His death."
2. "Then shall ye know that I am he, &c.—that is, find out, or have sufficient evidence, how true was all He said, though they would be far from owning it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Then shall ye know... That I am he - Am the Messiah, which I have professed to be."
2. "And that I do nothing of myself - That is, you shall have proof that God has sent me; that I am the Messiah; and that God concurs with me and approves my doctrine."
3. "This proof was furnished by the miracles that attended the death of Jesus - the earthquake and darkness; but chiefly by his resurrection from the dead, which proved, beyond a doubt, that he was what he affirmed he was - the Messiah."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Ye shall know [γνωσεσθε] . Render, perceive, here as in ver. 27."
2. "The aorist tense, regarding the teaching as a single act."
3. "Not equivalent to so I speak (i. e., as the Father taught me), but an absolute declaration with reference to these present revelations."

### John Calvin:
1. "You now have all your senses — as it were — fascinated, and, therefore, you understand nothing of all that I say; but the time will yet come, when you shall know that a Prophet of God has lived among you, and has spoken to you."
2. "Yet that knowledge of Adam, which was in itself useless, turned to his advantage through the grace of God; but the reprobate, being overwhelmed with despair, have their eyes opened only for this purpose, that they may perceive their destruction."
3. "He tells them that they will be completely disappointed, and that the event will be altogether contrary to what they thus expect. He may, indeed, have intended to allude to the outward form of his death, that he was to be lifted up on the cross; but he looked chiefly to the glorious result of it, which soon afterwards followed, contrary to the expectation of all."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "When through their own deed the Son of man has been raised on high, their eyes will be opened, they will see what they have done, and will then know that His words were true." 
2. "The ‘lifting on high’ includes both the death and the glorification of Jesus... Some prefer to place a stop at the word am, and to take the clauses that follow as independent. This view, however, seems much less natural than the other."
3. "The three parallel clauses containing the thoughts of (1) pure existence, (2) continued dependence on the Father in all action, and (3) speaking in constant harmony with the Father’s will and teaching express the claims made by Jesus, the truth of which will be established when He is ‘lifted up on high.’"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is unnecessary to render the aorist subjunctive as if a future perfect, simply 'whenever ye lift up' (actually lift up, ingressive aorist)." 
2. "The knowledge from the facts like the fall of Jerusalem will come too late and will not bring a change of heart." 
3. "This fact marks Jesus off from the rabbis."

### John Gill:
1. "When ye have lift up the son of man; meaning himself, who was to be lifted up upon the cross, as the serpent was upon the pole, in the wilderness; and which signified the manner of death he should die, the death of the cross..." 
2. "...what the Jews designed for his reproach, shame, and abasement would be the way and means of his rise and exaltation..."
3. "...many of the Jews had not only a notional, but a true and spiritual knowledge of Jesus, as the Messiah; and upon the destruction of their temple, city, and nation... they did know that the true Messiah was come, and that Jesus of Nazareth was he..."

### John Wesley:
1. "When ye shall have lifted up — On the cross, ye shall know." 
2. "And so many of them did, that I AM - God over all." 
3. "And that I do nothing of myself - Being one with the Father."
