# John 8:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The religious leaders, eager to trap Jesus, bring a woman caught in adultery before Him. Her identity is unimportant, and claims from certain sources are likely fiction. Interestingly, this account is missing from some ancient copies and various versions. However, it is believed to be an authentic part of Scripture, serving as a powerful demonstration of Jesus' wisdom and mercy in the face of the religious authorities' malicious intent.
