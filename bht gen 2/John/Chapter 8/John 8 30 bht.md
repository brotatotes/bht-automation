# John 8:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Many were captivated and came to believe in him, as he spoke about his crucifixion and the knowledge the Jews would have of him at that time. His words carried an air of authority and power, revealing the excellence and divinity of his doctrine. These new believers recognized him as the Son of God and the true Messiah, their faith kindled by the profound impact of his teachings. However, Christ's audience was varied; while some rejected and disbelieved, there were others whose hearts and minds were opened, leading them to receive him and his words with understanding and faith.
