# John 8:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Remaining in the word of Jesus goes beyond simply obeying His teachings; it involves an inner conviction of the truth of His revelation. This continuation in His word is the true test of being His disciples. It is not enough to believe in Him superficially; true discipleship requires a steadfast faith that produces obedience and a genuine, transformative life. This perseverance in the word of Jesus distinguishes His followers from hypocrites and gives evidence of genuine faith. By abiding in His word, we not only receive His teachings but also experience His power and become true disciples of Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Remaining in His word is not merely obeying His teaching, but is the inner conviction of the truth of that revelation of Himself, which is his λαλιά or λόγος."

2. "Continuance in the faith, since then only were they His real disciples."
3. "They should experimentally 'know the truth,' and 'by the truth be made (spiritually) free.'"

### Albert Barnes:

3. "Jesus assures them that if their faith should abide the test, if it should produce obedience to his commandments and a truly life, it would be proof that their faith was genuine, for the tree is known by its fruit."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Believed on Him. Note the different phrase, distinguishing the Jews from the mixed company in ver. 30. Rev., rightly, believed Him."
2. "If ye continue. The emphasis is on the ye, addressed to those whose faith was rudimentary; who believed Him, but did not yet believe on Him. Rev., abide."
3. "In my word. Literally, in the word which is mine: peculiarly mine, characteristic of me. The expression is intentionally stronger than my word. Compare my love (xv. 9). Indeed. Literally, truly; as Rev. As those who believe on me, not as those who are moved by temporary excitement to admit my claims."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is not enough for anyone to have begun well, if their progress to the end do not correspond to it."
2. "He distinguishes his followers from hypocrites by this mark, that they who falsely boasted of faith give way as soon as they have entered into the course, or at least in the middle of it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The former denotes a true faith in Jesus, such an acceptance of Him as includes a surrender of the heart, the ‘self,’ to Him; the latter, an acceptance of His words as true."
2. "The impression produced by the last words spoken by Jesus appears to have been very great, bringing many to the position of full discipleship, and even convincing some of the hostile Jews themselves that they had been opposing one whose words were true, and whose claims on their obedience were just and right."
3. "They believed His word; if they abide in this word of His, clinging to it, continuing under its influence, the word will be to them a revelation of Jesus, and will assert its power."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They believed him (cf. John 6:30) as to his claims to being the Messiah with their own interpretation (John 6:15), but they did not commit themselves to him..." 
2. "If ye abide in my word (εαν υμεις μεινητε εν τω λογω τω εμω). Third-class condition with εαν and first aorist (constative) active subjunctive."
3. "Your future loyalty to my teaching will prove the reality of your present profession. So the conclusion of this future condition is put in the present tense. As then, so now. We accept church members on profession of trust in Christ. Continuance in the word (teaching) proves the sincerity or insincerity of the profession. It is the acid test of life."

### John Gill:
1. "And to continue in it, is having cordially received it, to abide by it, and hold it fast, and not to be moved from it, by the temptations of Satan; the cunning of those that lie in wait to deceive; nor by the revilings and persecutions, the frowns and flatteries of men."
2. "And when men continue thus steadfast in it, and faithful to it, it is an evidence that it has come with power, and has a place in their hearts, and that they are the true followers of Christ."
3. "For the genuine disciples of Christ continue in his Gospel, hold fast to him, the head, and remain with his people; which to do to the end, is an evidence, of their being disciples indeed."
