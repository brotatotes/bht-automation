# John 8:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They, the other Jews that were present, claimed to be Abraham's seed and therefore believed themselves to be free. However, their declaration that they were never enslaved to any man was a blatant falsehood. In reality, they were under the bondage of the Romans at that very moment, although they refused to acknowledge it.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "They had not yet become ἀληθῶς μαθηταί, were not yet distinct from the mass of the unbelieving; and therefore, in speaking to them, He ascribes to them the sins of their race, and addresses them as part of that race."
2. "The assertion οὐδενὶ δεδουλεύκαμεν, was so contrary to historical truth, that we must suppose some technical meaning to have been attached to δεδουλεύκαμεν, in which it may have been correct. The words cannot be meant of that generation only, for πώποτε connects with σπέρμα Ἀβ . ἐσ ., and generalizes the assertion."
3. "As usual, they take the words of our Lord in their outward literal sense. Perhaps this was not always an unintentional misunderstanding."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Talk of freedom to us? Pray when or to whom were we ever in bondage?"
2. "Had they forgotten their long and bitter bondage in Egypt? their dreary captivity in Babylon? their present bondage to the Roman yoke, and their restless eagerness to throw it off?"
3. "Our Lord, therefore, though He knew what slaves they were in this sense, drives the ploughshare somewhat deeper than this, to a bondage they little dreamt of."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We be Abraham's seed - We are the children or descendants of Abraham. Abraham was not a slave, and they pretended that they were his real descendants, inheriting his freedom as well as his spirit." 
2. "Were never in bondage to any, man - This is a most remarkable declaration, and one evidently false. Their fathers had been slaves in Egypt; their nation had been enslaved in Babylon; it had repeatedly been subject to the Assyrians; it was enslaved by Herod the Great; and was, at the very time they spoke, groaning under the grievous and insupportable bondage of the Romans."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Have never yet been in bondage; thus giving the force of the perfect tense, never up to this time, and of the pw, yet." 
2. "In their reply to Jesus they ignore alike the Egyptian, Babylonian, and Syrian bondage, through which the nation had successively passed, as well as their present subjection to Rome, treating these merely as bondage which, though a fact, was not bondage by right, or bondage to which they had ever willingly submitted, and, therefore, not bondage in any real sense."
3. "Beside the fact that their words were the utterance of strong passion, it is to be remembered that the Romans, from motives of policy, had left them the semblance of political independence."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is a mode of expression very customary in Scripture, whenever the body of a people is mentioned, to ascribe generally to all what belongs only to a part."
2. "They think, therefore, that they are insulted, when freedom is exhibited to them as a blessing which they do not yet possess."
3. "And yet this pride is spread over the whole world, so that there is scarcely one person in a hundred who feels that he needs the grace of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The promise 'shall make you free' cannot but imply that now they have no freedom, but are slaves."
2. "To be of Abraham's seed and to be a slave were discordant ideas."
3. "Their's was a religious pre-eminence above all nations of the world, a freedom which no external circumstances could affect."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "We are Abraham's seed, the proudest boast of the Jews, of Sarah the freewoman and not of Hagar the bondwoman." 
2. "God made Gentiles the spiritual children of Abraham by faith."
3. "These poor believers soon come to the end of their faith."

### John Gill:
1. "we be Abraham's seed; this the Jews always valued themselves upon, and reckoned themselves, on this account, upon a level with the nobles and the princes of the earth."
2. "and were never in bondage to any man; which is a very great falsehood, for it was declared to Abraham himself, that his seed should serve in a land not theirs, and be afflicted four hundred years, as they were; and as the preface to the law which the Jews gloried in shows, which says, that the Lord their God brought them out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage; and they were frequently overcome by their neighbours..."
3. "how sayest thou, ye shall be made free? when they thought themselves, and would fain have been thought by others, to have been free already, and so to stand in no need of being made free."

### John Wesley:
1. "They — The other Jews that were by, (not those that believed,) as appears by the whole tenor of the conversation."
2. "We were never enslaved to any man — A bold, notorious untruth."
3. "At that very time they were enslaved to the Romans."
