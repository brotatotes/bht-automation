# John 8:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who engage in sinful behavior are ultimately enslaved by it, held captive by their own actions. This truth challenges the claims of those who boast of their freedom, as they fail to recognize their bondage to the desires of the flesh. Jesus addresses their objections, highlighting their misconception of freedom and their reliance on their lineage. In response, Jesus emphasizes the significance of being set free by Him, emphasizing that He alone has the power to release us from the chains of sin.
