# John 8:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The contrasting positions of the son and the slave in the house highlight the temporary nature of the slave's tenure. While the slave can be cast out at any moment, the son is the heir and has an enduring place. This reminds us that there may be those who claim to be part of God's house or church, but if they are merely servants of sin, they will not remain there forever. Only the Son of God, Jesus Christ, as the true Son, will always continue in His own house, as its Lord and high priest.
