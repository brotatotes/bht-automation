# John 8:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They claimed to be descendants of Abraham, but Jesus challenged their claim, highlighting that their actions showed no resemblance to Abraham's spirit. They were unable to receive and embrace His teachings because their hearts were closed off with ignorance, enmity, and unbelief. Despite being physically connected to Abraham, they lacked his faith and righteousness. Therefore, the word of Jesus found no entrance or progress in their lives and had no impact on their hearts. Their refusal to accept the truth was rooted in their pride, prejudice, and resistance to spiritual transformation.
