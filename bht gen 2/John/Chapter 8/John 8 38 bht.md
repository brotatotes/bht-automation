# John 8:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
You have seen and heard the words of Jesus, who speaks with authority from His Father. His word has the power to ignite fury in those who oppose it, as it reveals the opposition between the children of God and the children of the devil. While Jesus faithfully teaches the truth from His Father, His adversaries reject and seek to extinguish His doctrine. But let the word of God penetrate your hearts, and may you be faithful to receive His truth, for in doing so, you will experience the freedom and blessings of being children of God.

### Henry Alford:
1. "The speaking and doing were in each case from the father of each. But Jesus was πρὸς τὸν θεόν, in a relation of abiding unity with His Father: they were ἐκ τοῦ πατρὸς τοῦ διαβ., he was the suggester of their course, the originator of their acts." 
2. "Jesus was the υἱός, who remains in the house and sees the father's acts: they the δοῦλοι, merely prescribed to and under bondage."
3. "The οὐν implies accordingly, by the same rule."

### John Calvin:

2. "He says that he speaks, and they do, because he discharged the office of a teacher, while they labored strenuously to extinguish his doctrine."
3. "At the same time, he protects the Gospel against contempt, by showing that it is not wonderful if it be opposed by the children of the devil."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "His word had entered their heart but had made no way: let them give it free course now."
2. "He, the Son, who alone can give them freedom and sonship by the truth revealed in His word, has in that word spoken to them the things which He saw with the Father."
3. "The Son has been faithful to His mission, this the first clause declares: let them therefore be faithful to their part, and the blessing will be theirs."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Locative case of πατηρ and article used as possessive (common idiom), 'by the side of my Father,' picture of intimate fellowship like προς τον θεον (face to face with God) in John 1:1."
2. "Ablative case with παρα (from the side of) and same possessive use of του in each instance, though 'the' will really answer both times."
3. "But ο πατηρ does not mean the same person. Christ's Father by contrast is not their father."

### John Gill:
1. "This is an aggravation of the sin of the Jews, in seeking to kill Christ, on account of his doctrine, since it was not his own, but his Father's."

3. "They acted so much under his influence, and according to his will, as if they had close and intimate consultation with him, and took their plan of operation from him."
