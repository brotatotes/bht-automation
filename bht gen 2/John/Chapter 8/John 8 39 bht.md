# John 8:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If they truly were Abraham's children, they would be following in his footsteps of faith, charity, justice, and piety. Abraham was known for his mercy, charity, and hospitality, and those who display these qualities are the genuine offspring of Abraham. The true children of Abraham are recognized by their merciful treatment of others. This distinction is not made to separate themselves from others who claimed lineage from Abraham, but rather to distinguish those among the Jews who were religious and virtuous from those who were not.

2. "But carnal descent, without faith, is nothing more than a false pretense."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Had they been willing to recognise the true meaning of ‘the Father’... they might have seen what the same Name implied for them..." (John 8:39)
