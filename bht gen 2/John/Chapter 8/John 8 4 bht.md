# John 8:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The accusers had a cunning plan to trap Jesus by approaching him in a seemingly respectful manner. They claimed that the woman was caught in the act of adultery, which required at least two witnesses for a legal accusation. The phrase in the very act suggests that the woman was caught in the act of stealing, highlighting the sinful nature of adultery as a theft of one's property. The situation was undeniable, and there was no possibility of denying the grievous sin.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The difficulty is even greater than the last, to say, in what sense this was a temptation, to lead to His accusation."
2. "The principal solutions of it have been, (1) that the command of the law had fallen into disuse from the frequency of the crime, and to re-assert it would be contrary to the known mildness of Jesus."
3. "Since Jesus seems to avoid every kind of decision on the question put to Him, it follows that He found in it no reference to the great subjects of His teaching, but treated it as a purely civil or political matter, with which in His ministry He had no concern."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Moses... commanded... should be stoned—simply put to death."
2. "But what sayest thou—hoping, whatever He might answer, to put Him in the wrong."
3. "But these cunning hypocrites were overmatched."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Not only was the sin grievous: the point is that there was no possibility of denying it."
2. "No process of proof was necessary: there was no need to summon witnesses."
3. "We may even well believe that the very countenance of the woman would betray her own consciousness of her shame."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Hath been taken (κατειληπτα). Perfect passive indicative of καταλαμβανω (see verse John 8:3), caught and still guilty."
2. "In adultery (μοιχευομενη). Present passive participle of μοιχευω, 'herself suffering adultery' (Matthew 5:32). Used of married people. Not in John."
3. "In the very act (επ' αυτοφωρω). Old adjective (αυτοφωροσ, αυτος, self, and φωρ, thief) caught in the act of theft, then extended to any crime in which one is caught. Old idiom, but not elsewhere in the Greek Bible. One example in a Berlin papyrus."

### John Gill:
1. "They applied to him in a handsome and respectful manner, the better to cover their ill design."
2. "This woman was taken in adultery; by two persons at least, who could be witnesses of it; otherwise the accusation was not legal."
3. "In the very act; or 'in the theft itself', for adultery is a theft; it is an unlawful use of another's property."
