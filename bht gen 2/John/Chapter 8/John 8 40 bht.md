# John 8:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In seeking to kill an innocent man who spoke the truth from God, these individuals displayed a complete opposition to the spirit of Abraham. Abraham, renowned for his loving-kindness, never rejected any truth revealed to him, let alone sought to take the life of anyone who brought the truth to him. By contrast, the actions of those seeking to kill Jesus showed not only their rejection of the truth but also their enmity towards it. Jesus, though not explicitly calling himself God, acknowledged his divine nature, evident in his words and deeds.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath spoken to you the truth, which I heard from God: this did not Abraham." - The assertions of John 8:37-38 are reiterated, but now with a simple directness that cannot be misunderstood, and with a distinct expression of the contrast (‘this did not Abraham’) which in John 8:37 has been merely implied. True kindred to Abraham is therefore impossible in their case.
