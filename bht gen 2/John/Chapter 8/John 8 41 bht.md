# John 8:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Ye do the deeds of your father, though he is not Abraham. They proudly claim that they are not born of fornication, either literally or figuratively as idolaters. Yet, when they assert that God is their Father, Jesus identifies their true father as the devil.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "They now let fall Abraham as their father, being convicted of unlikeness to him. They see that a spiritual paternity must be meant, and accordingly refer to God as their Father."
2. "And spiritually the τέκνα πορνείας, ref. Hosea, are idolaters."
3. "There may possibly be a reference to the Samaritans (Joh 8:48), who completely answered in the spiritual sense to the children of fornication."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "We be not born of fornication."
2. "We have one Father, God."
3. "They were not an illegitimate race in point of religion, pretending only to be God's people, but were descended from His own chosen Abraham."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "When the Saviour delivered an awful or an offensive truth, he always approached the mind so that the truth might make the deepest impression."
2. "We be not born of fornication - The people still professed not to understand him; and since Jesus had denied that they were the children of Abraham, they affected to suppose that he meant they were a mixed, spurious race."
3. "To be children of fornication is an expression denoting in the Scriptures idolatry, or the worship of other gods than the true God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Ye do. Or, are doing. Fornication [πορνειας] . From pernhmi, to sell.

### John Calvin:
1. "They who have corrupted the seed of life are at the farthest remove from being the children of God, though, according to the flesh, they are not bastards, but pretend a right to the plausible title of the Church."
2. "Let them go about the bush as much as they please, still they will never avoid the discovery that the only ground of their arrogant boasting is, 'We have succeeded the holy fathers; therefore, we are the Church.'"
3. "Never indeed will hypocrites cease to employ the name of God falsely, with most wicked effrontery; but those false grounds of boasting, on which they plume themselves, will never cease to appear ridiculous in the eyes of all who shall abide by the decision of Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The words of Jesus have made two things clear: (1) He is not referring to national origin, but to spiritual descent; and (2) the father whose sons Jesus declares them to be is not good but evil."
2. "Their spiritual is as undoubted as their natural descent. ‘Whatever may be the case with others (the word “we” is strongly emphatic), there is no stain on our origin.’"
3. "And if we bear in mind the regular meaning which the word ‘fornication’ bears in Old Testament prophecy, when used in such a connection as this, viz. the unholy alliance with idols instead of Jehovah (Jeremiah 3:1, etc.), it will appear very probable that John 8:48 gives the clue to the meaning here."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Ye do the works of your father. Who is not Abraham and not God as Jesus plainly indicates."
2. "We were not born of fornication. This they said as a proud boast. Jesus had admitted that they were physical descendants of Abraham, but now denies that they are spiritual children of Abraham."
3. "We have one Father, even God. This in direct reply to the implication of Jesus that God was not their spiritual Father."

### John Gill:
1. "Ye do the deeds of your father,... Not Abraham, but the devil."
2. "we be not born of fornication: meaning either literally, that they were not a brood of bastards, children of whoredom, illegitimately begotten in unlawful copulation, or wedlock; or figuratively, that they were not the children of idolaters, idolatry being called fornication in Scripture"
3. "we have one Father, [even] God; Israel being called by God his Son, and firstborn to them belonged the adoption, in a national sense, and of this they boasted"

### John Wesley:
1. "Ye do the deeds of your father — He is not named yet."
2. "But when they presumed to call God their Father, then he is expressly called the devil, John 8:44."
