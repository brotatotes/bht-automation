# John 8:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Ye are of your father the devil, imitating and being influenced by him. He is a murderer, not only in action, but in inclination from the very beginning of his existence as a devil. The devil has been a killer of men since the creation, actively seeking their ruin. When he lies, he speaks from his own nature, for he is the source and creator of falsehood and evil as a whole. The connection between the devil and his children is one of imitation, authority, and influence, resulting in a life contrary to the will of God.
