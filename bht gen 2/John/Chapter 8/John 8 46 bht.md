# John 8:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In challenging his enemies to find any fault in him, Jesus affirms his absolute sinlessness in every aspect of his life. He asserts that if his opponents cannot prove him guilty of sin, then they should believe in his words. By questioning their disbelief despite the absence of any evidence against him, Jesus exposes their baseless prejudice and refusal to accept the truth. Thus, his unwavering innocence validates the credibility of his teachings.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The words amount to a declaration of His absolute sinlessness, in thought, word, and deed."
2. "And if it be thence (from the impossibility of convicting me of sin) evident, that I speak the truth, why do ye not believe Me?"
3. "This verse is cited 1 John 4:6."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Convict Me of sin, and reject Me: If not, why stand ye out against My claims?" 
2. "Of course, they could only be supposed to impeach His life; but in One who had already passed through unparalleled complications, and had continually to deal with friends and foes of every sort and degree, such a challenge thrown wide among His bitterest enemies, can amount to nothing short of a claim to absolute sinlessness."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Which of you convinceth me? - To convince, with us, means to satisfy a man’s own mind of the truth of anything; but this is not its meaning here. It rather means to convict."
2. "Which of you can prove that I am guilty of sin? Of sin - The word 'sin' here evidently means 'error, falsehood, or imposture.' It stands opposed to truth."
3. "The argument of the Saviour is this: A doctrine might be rejected if it could be proved that he that delivered it was an impostor; but as you cannot prove this of me, you are bound to receive my words."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Convinceth. Sin. The truth."

### John Calvin:
1. "Knowing that they could not justly bring any reproach against him, he glories over his enemies, as having obtained a victory."
2. "He means that no crime dwells in him... nothing could be brought forward to show that he was not a faithful servant of God."
3. "He is rather defending his doctrine than his person."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "No charge of sin could any one of them bring home to Him, no responsive consciousness of sin could any one awaken in His breast. These words are implicitly an assertion of His perfect sinlessness; and His enemies are silent."
2. "Their knowledge of His sinless life took from them all pretext for their disbelief. We know that His words brought their own evidence to those who loved the truth."
3. "The true answer to this question then must be that they loved falsehood. But this answer they would never give. The tone of this verse clearly shows that what has been said of their father the devil related not to necessity of nature, but to deliberate choice (see note on John 8:23), for such an appeal was intended, and would be understood, to imply condemnation of those who thus wilfully refused to believe."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The use of αμαρτια as in John 1:29 means sin in general, not particular sins."
2. "The rhetorical question which receives no answer involves sinlessness (Hebrews 4:15) without specifically saying so."
3. "This question drives home the irrationality of their hostility to Jesus. It was based on prejudice and predilection."

### John Gill:
1. "Which of you convinceth me of sin?.... Of any immorality in life, or of any imposture, corruption, or deceit in doctrine."
2. "They called him a wine bibber, and a glutton; gave out they knew he was a sinner; charged him with blasphemy and sedition; sought to bring proof of it, but failed in their attempt."
3. "And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me? since as no sin in life, so no corruption in doctrine, could be proved against him, what he said must be truth; and therefore it was a most unreasonable thing in them, and showed invincible obstinacy, not to believe him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Which of you convicteth me of sin?" 
2. "Is not my life as unreprovable as my doctrine?" 
3. "Does not my whole behaviour confirm the truth of what I teach?"
