# John 8:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A person who belongs to God listens to His words with joy and reverence. They have eyes to see the beauty, excellence, and usefulness of God's teachings, and they have ears to hear and a heart to understand them. They distinguish God's words from the words of man and embrace them with love and faith, putting them into practice. However, those who do not listen to the words of God prove that they do not belong to Him.
