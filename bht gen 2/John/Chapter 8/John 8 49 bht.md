# John 8:49 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
I ignore the false accusation that I am a Samaritan, for it is widely known I am not. Rather, I seek to honor my Father by attributing my words and actions to Him, and in doing so, I show that I am not in league with the devil. It is not only the Jews who dishonor me, but also those who bear my name but act in ways that bring shame upon me. Ultimately, my goal is to honor my Father, for His glory is of utmost importance.
