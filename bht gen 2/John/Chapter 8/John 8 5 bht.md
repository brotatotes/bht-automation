# John 8:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Adultery was a serious offense, punishable by death according to the law commanded by Moses. The specific punishment, however, varied depending on the circumstances. While the law specified stoning for a betrothed woman guilty of adultery, other cases of adultery were punished by strangling. Additionally, the Jewish traditions acknowledged that a betrothed woman, but not a married one, should be stoned for committing adultery. Adultery was rampant among the people, and the severity of the punishment reflected the seriousness of the sin.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The very fact of their questioning thus, ‘Moses commanded, … but what sayest Thou?' belongs to the last days of the Lord's ministry."
2. "The command here mentioned is not to be found unless 'putting to death' generally is to be interpreted as stoning."
3. "I would rather suppose that from Deuteronomy 22:21, an inference was drawn what kind of death was intended in Deuteronomy 22:22."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The punishment of adultery commanded by Moses was death..."
2. "The particular manner of the death was not specified in the law."
3. "The punishment for adultery varied. In some cases it was strangling. In the time of Ezekiel it was stoning and being thrust through with a sword."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The words ‘concerning her,’ which do not occur in the Authorised Version, but which the best authorities lead us to accept, throw light upon the scene."
2. "It is not a mere abstract contrast between Moses and a new Lawgiver that is before us: it is a special case."
3. "We need thus have no hesitation in believing that the same mode of punishment would be applied to all sins similar in character to that which alone has the penalty of stoning expressly attached to it."

1. "Stoning was specified for the case of a betrothed woman guilty of adultery."

### John Gill:
1. "Not in Leviticus 20:10; for though according to the law there, an adulteress, one that was a married woman, and so an adulterer, that was a married man, were to be put to death; yet the death was not stoning, but strangling."
2. "And with this agree the traditions of the Jews; 'a daughter of Israel must be stoned, who is betrothed, but not married.'"
3. "The Jews have also a saying, that 'if all adulterers were punished with stoning, according to the law, the stones would be consumed; but they would not be consumed'; adultery was so common with that people."
