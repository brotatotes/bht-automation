## BHT:
He did not seek his own honor, but sought the glory of the Father who sent him. The judgment between him and his opposers rests in the hands of God, who seeks his honor and will give him glory. We should not be concerned about our own reputation, but trust in God to vindicate us and seek our welfare and honor. Ultimately, it is God who seeks and judges, deciding between truth and falsehood, and we should commit our cause into his hands.
