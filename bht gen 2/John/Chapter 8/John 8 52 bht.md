# John 8:52 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The critics in this passage accuse Jesus of having a demon and being out of his mind. They were convinced that he was under diabolical influence and possessed by the devil. Their disbelief stemmed from the fact that Jesus claimed that Abraham and the prophets had died, and they could not fathom anyone speaking this way. However, the truth is that Abraham and the prophets, even though they shared great teachings, were unable to protect themselves from death. These skeptics were blind to the idea that Jesus, unlike them, possessed the power to grant eternal life and defy death.
