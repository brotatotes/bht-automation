# John 8:53 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jews questioned Jesus, asking whom he claimed to be. They challenged him, insinuating that he could not possibly be greater than Abraham and the prophets who had all died. Yet, Jesus, being the Messiah, was indeed greater than them. He would be exalted above Abraham, Moses, and even the ministering angels. The Jews failed to understand that Jesus was not claiming equality with God, but rather fulfilling the prophecies and promises given by God. Despite their contempt and disbelief, Jesus remained steadfast in his mission to offer eternal life to all who believed in him.
