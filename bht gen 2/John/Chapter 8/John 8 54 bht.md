# John 8:54 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus said, If I honour myself, he was responding to those who questioned his authority, asking him, Whom makest thou thyself? Jesus emphasized that true honor and glory do not come from self-promotion or self-commendation. Instead, he identified his Father as the one who truly honors him. Jesus recognized that his Father glorified him through the voice from heaven, the miracles he performed, and his resurrection and ascension. This reminds us that seeking the honor of God, rather than seeking self-glory, is the path to true significance and impact.
