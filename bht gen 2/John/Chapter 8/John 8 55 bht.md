# John 8:55 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus confronts the Jews, exposing their lack of true knowledge of God. The world and hostile Jews failed to truly know God, while Jesus possesses unique intimate knowledge of the Father. With a sudden jolt, Jesus charges that anyone rejecting His words risks becoming a liar, aligned with the father of lies. Authentic knowledge of God comes solely through Jesus, who reveals the Father selectively. As followers of Christ, our aim is to intimately know God and faithfully align ourselves with His will to bring Him pleasure.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Rising to the summit of holy, naked severity."
2. "Draw this long dialogue to a head."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Saying [Î»Î¿Î³Î¿Î½] . Properly, word, as ver. 51. So Rev.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "And ye have not known him." - Adversative use again of ÎºÎ±="and yet." Perfect active indicative of Î³Î¹Î½Ï‰ÏƒÎºÏ‰, the verb for experiential knowledge. This was true of the ÎºÎ¿ÏƒÎ¼Î¿Ï‚ (John 1:10; John 17:25) and of the hostile Jews (John 16:3).
2. "But I know him." - Equipped by eternal fellowship to reveal the Father (John 1:1-18). This peculiar intimate knowledge Jesus had already claimed (John 7:29).
3. "I shall be like you a liar." - Apodosis of the condition. HÎ¿Î¼Î¿Î¹Î¿Ï‚ (like) is followed by the associative-instrumental case Ï…Î¼Î¹Î½. The word ÏˆÎµÏ…ÏƒÏ„Î·Ï‚ (liar), in spite of the statement that they are the children of the devil, the father of lying (John 8:44), comes with a sudden jolt because it is a direct charge.

### John Gill:
1. "Not as the Father of Christ, nor as in Christ, whom to know is life eternal."
2. "Nor did, or does any know the Father, but the Son, and he to whom he is pleased to reveal him."
3. "But I know him, and keep his saying: do his will, and always the things that please him."
