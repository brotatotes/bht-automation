# John 8:56 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Abraham's deep desire to see the day of Christ was fulfilled in his faith in the promise that through his seed all nations would be blessed. He not only saw the Messiah prefigured in types and figures, such as the binding of Isaac and the sacrifice of the ram, but he possibly also had a unique revelation of Christ's coming. Abraham's faith in the midst of obscurity allows us to appreciate the anticipation and joy he had in the fulfillment of God's promise.
