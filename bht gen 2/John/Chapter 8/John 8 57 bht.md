# John 8:57 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jews tried to refute Jesus' words by pointing out that he could not have seen Abraham since he was not yet fifty years old, which was considered the completion of manhood. However, Jesus was not claiming to have physically seen Abraham, but rather that Abraham had seen his day. The discrepancy may have arisen because Jesus appeared older due to the gravity of his countenance and the trials he had endured. They misunderstood his words, deliberately misquoting him to suggest that he claimed to have seen Abraham.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "No inference can be drawn from this verse as to the age of our Lord at the time, according to the flesh."
2. "Fifty years was with the Jews the completion of manhood."
3. "The reading τεσσαράκοντα found in Cod. [139], and read by Chrys., of which Euthym [140] says, ὅπερ δοκεῖ ἀκριβέστερον, has probably been introduced for that very reason."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "No inference can be drawn from this as to the age of our Lord at the time as man. Fifty years was with the Jews the completion of manhood."
2. "He had said Abraham saw Him, as being his peculiar privilege. They give the opposite turn to it—'Hast Thou seen Abraham?' as an honor too great for Him to pretend to."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is remarkable that when he was so young they should have mentioned the number 50, but they probably designed to prevent the possibility of a reply."
2. "His affirmation was not that he had seen Abraham, but that Abraham had seen his day. The design of Jesus was to show that he was greater than Abraham."
3. "The Jews perverted this, and affirmed that it was impossible that he and Abraham should have seen each other."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Thou art not yet fifty years old." - The age of completed manhood.
2. "Hast thou seen." - Misquoting the Lord's words.

### John Calvin:
1. "Thou art not yet fifty years old. They endeavor to refute Christ’s saying, by showing that he had asserted what was impossible, when he who was not yet fifty years of age makes himself equal to Abraham, who died many centuries before."
2. "Though Christ was not yet thirty-four years of age, yet they allow him to be somewhat older, that they may not appear to be too rigid and exact in dealing with him; as if they had said, 'Thou certainly wilt not make thyself so old, though thou wert to boast that thou art already fifty years of age.'"
3. "Consequently, those who conjecture that he looked older than he actually was, or that the years mentioned in this passage are not solar years, in either case labor to no purpose."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Jews understand ‘my day’ to mean the time of His life; and His knowing that Abraham has witnessed this with joy must certainly imply that He has seen Abraham."
2. "How can this be, since He is not yet fifty years of age?"
3. "Some have supposed from this verse that sorrow had given to Him the appearance of premature age."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Thou art not yet fifty years old. Literally, 'Thou hast not yet fifty years.' Not meaning that Jesus was near that age at all. It was the crisis of completed manhood and a round number."
2. "And hast thou seen Abraham? So A C D and B W Theta have εωρακες, both second person singular of the perfect active indicative of οραω. But Aleph, Sin-syr., Coptic versions (accepted by Bernard) have κα Αβρααμ εωρακε σε? 'Has Abraam seen thee?' Either makes sense here."

### John Gill:
1. "The reason of their fixing on this age of fifty might be, because Christ might look like such an one, being a man of sorrows and acquainted with griefs, as well as of great gravity."
2. "Moreover, this age of fifty is often spoken of by the Jews, and much observed."
3. "And if a man died before he was fifty, this was called the death of cutting off, a violent death, a death inflicted by God, as a punishment."

### John Wesley:
1. "Perhaps the gravity of our Lord's countenance, together with his afflictions and labours, might make him appear older than he really was."
2. "Which they justly supposed must have been, if Abraham had seen him."
