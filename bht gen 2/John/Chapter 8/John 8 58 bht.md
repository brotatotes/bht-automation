It is a clear response to the objections raised by the Jews and highlights His superiority over Abraham.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "All unbiassed exegesis of these words must recognize in them a declaration of the essential præ-existence of Christ."
2. "The distinction between γενέσθαι and εἰμί is important. 'Antequam nasceretur Abraham, ego sum' (Erasmus). The present εἰμί expresses essential existence, as in reff., especially Colossians 1:17, and was often used by our Lord to assert His Divine Being."
3. "In this verse the God-head of Christ is involved; and this the Jews clearly understood, by their conduct to Him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The statement therefore is not that Christ came into existence before Abraham did (as Arians affirm is the meaning), but that He never came into being at all, but existed before Abraham had a being; in other words, existed before creation, or eternally."
2. "In that sense the Jews plainly understood Him, since 'then took they up stones to cast at Him,' just as they had before done when they saw that He made Himself equal with God."
3. "hid himself" (See on John 1:1).

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Verily, verily - This is an expression used only in John. It is a strong affirmation denoting particularly the great importance of what was about to be affirmed."
2. "The expression I am, though in the present tense, is clearly designed to refer to a past time. It denotes continued existence without respect to time, so far as God is concerned. He assumes it as his name."
3. "The passage proves that, while he was a man, he was also endowed with another nature existing before Abraham, and to which he applied the term I AM; and this declaration corresponds to the affirmation of John that he was in the beginning with God, and was God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Abraham's life was under the conditions of time, and therefore had a temporal beginning."
2. "Hence, Abraham came into being, or was born."
3. "Jesus' life was from and to eternity. Hence the formula for absolute, timeless existence, I am."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ reminds them that he has something greater and higher than human appearance, which is hidden from the senses of the flesh, and is perceived only by the eyes of faith."
2. "But by these words he excludes himself from the ordinary rank of men, and claims for himself a power more than human, a power heavenly and divine, the perception of which reached from the beginning of the world through all ages."
3. "And yet the efficacy which belonged, in all ages, to the grace of the Mediator depended on his eternal Divinity; so that this saying of Christ contains a remarkable testimony of his Divine essence."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In the clearest possible manner Jesus declares, not only His existence before Abraham, but also the essential distinction between His being and that of any man."
2. "He claims for Himself that absolute, unchanging existence which is the attribute of God alone."
3. "The thought is distinctly present in the Old Testament: see Psalms 102:27, but especially Psalms 90:2."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Before Abraham came into existence or was born."
2. "Jesus claims eternal existence."
3. "The contrast between the entrance into existence of Abraham and timeless being is complete."

### John Gill:
1. "Whether it will be believed or not, it is certainly fact: before Abraham was, I am."
2. "This is to be understood of the deity, eternity, and immutability of Christ."
3. "He is the invariable and unchangeable I am."

### John Wesley:
1. "Before Abraham was I AM — Even from everlasting to everlasting."
2. "This is a direct answer to the objection of the Jews, and shows how much greater he was than Abraham."
