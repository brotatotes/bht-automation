# John 8:59 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jews, filled with rage, grabbed stones, ready to carry out the punishment for blasphemy. Understanding that Jesus claimed to be divine, they saw his words as a form of blasphemy. In response, Jesus concealed himself, possibly by becoming invisible, and calmly passed on through the midst of them, escaping their hands as if no one was there.
