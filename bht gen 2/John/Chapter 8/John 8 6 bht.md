# John 8:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, in a deliberate and intentional act, stooped down and began to write on the ground. This action served to divert attention and signify his aversion to engaging in the matter at hand. It was a display of disinterest in the concerns of his accusers and a refusal to intermeddle in the civil affairs of the nation. By choosing to write on the ground, Jesus indicated his disdain for their accusations and demonstrated that they were unworthy of being heard. This silent gesture aimed to awaken their consciences and emphasize his purpose of salvation rather than condemnation.
