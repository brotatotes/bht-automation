# John 8:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The scribes and Pharisees, in their deceitful and malicious intent, were determined to force Jesus into a corner. Yet Jesus, in His wisdom, responded to them with a profound challenge. He lifted Himself up with poise and spoke the words that exposed the wickedness in their hearts. His answer not only convicted them all of sin before Him but also highlighted the fact that only one who is completely without sin could rightfully pronounce judgment. Jesus thus shattered their self-righteousness, reminding them of their own guilt and granting space for introspection and repentance.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Lord Jesus was not sent to be a ruler and a judge in this or that particular case of crime, but the Ruler and Judge of all: and His answer expresses this, by convicting them all of sin before Him."
2. "ἀναμάρτ is not here used in the general sense, 'without sin', nor in the strictest, 'free from the crime of adultery', but as ἁμαρτωλός, of the sin of uncleanness generally."
3. "τόν, if genuine, refers to the first stone, which by Deu 17:7 the witnesses were to cast."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He that is without sin—not meaning sinless altogether; nor yet, guiltless of a literal breach of the Seventh Commandment; but probably, he whose conscience acquits him of any such sin."
2. "cast a stone—"the stone," meaning the first one."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They were determined to extort an answer from him, and showed a perseverance in evil."
2. "He who has not himself been guilty of this very crime - for in this place the connection evidently demands this meaning."
3. "Jesus therefore put them to the test. Without pronouncing on her case, he directed them, if any of them were innocent, to perform the office of executioner."

### John Calvin:
1. "There are many who proceed rashly to overwhelm their brother by perjury, because they do not think that they inflict a deadly wound by their tongue."
2. "Yet there is this difference between the injunction of the Law and the words of Christ, that in the Law God merely enjoined that they should not condemn a man with the tongue unless they were permitted to put him to death with their own hands; but here Christ demands from the witnesses perfect innocence."
3. "Shall a single judge be found, who is not conscious of having something that is wrong? Shall a single witness be produced who is not chargeable with some fault? He appears, therefore, to forbid all witnesses to give public testimony, and all judges to occupy the judgment-seat."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Then Jesus lifted Himself up (as we may well believe) with slow and solemn dignity, and spoke the words recorded of Him with a glance which must have showed His hearers that He read their hearts."
2. "They had no official right to condemn the woman; and our Lord’s words embodied the truth, which finds always, as it found now, an answer in the heart of man, that we have no personal right to judge the guilty unless we ourselves are free from blame."
3. "There seems no reason to confine the thought of ‘sin’ here to the particular sin with which the woman was chargeable; the expression is quite general."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They saw that Jesus seemed embarrassed, but did not know that it was as much because of the brazen hardness of the prosecutors as because of the shame of the deed."
2. "He that is without sin, either one who has not sinned or one who cannot sin, not in the N.T."
3. "The nominative πρωτος means first before others, be the first to cast, not cast before he does something else. Jesus thus picks out the executioner in the case."

### John Gill:
1. "For observing that he put himself in such a posture, they concluded that they had puzzled and perplexed him, and that he knew not what to say..."
2. "He lift up himself and said unto them; having raised up himself, he looked wistly at them, and returned them this wise answer to their confusion..."
3. "And this agrees with their own account of the times of the Messiah, and the signs thereof, among which stands this: 'in the age in which the son of David comes, the house of assembly shall become a brothel house'."

### John Wesley:
1. "He that is without sin...let him cast the first stone at her."
