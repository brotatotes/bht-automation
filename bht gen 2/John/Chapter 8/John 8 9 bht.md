# John 8:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus was left alone as the accusers scattered, leaving behind their own conviction and shame. The power of Christ's words struck them, revealing the corruption of their hearts and the folly of their actions. Though the woman remained in the midst, it was Jesus who saw her heart and spoke to her directly, while others continued to witness the unfolding scene.
