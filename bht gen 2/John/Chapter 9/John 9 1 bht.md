# John 9:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Jesus passed by, he saw a man who was blind from his birth. This man serves as a symbol of God's elect, who are born in sin and blind to the truth. They lack a true understanding of God, sin, and salvation. However, Christ, in his love and mercy, looks upon his chosen ones and brings them enlightenment and spiritual life as he passes by them.
