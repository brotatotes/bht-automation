# John 9:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Where is he? The very question that arises in John 7:11, as Christ had purposely withdrawn himself, possibly to avoid the anger of the Jews or to humbly shun any personal glory. It is worth noting the tendency of some to exhibit enmity towards the conversion of sinners, rather than rejoicing. Moreover, it is not uncommon for Christ to momentarily withdraw after working a great work of grace in the heart, leaving the transformed sinner unsure of his presence. This is reminiscent of a similar scenario described in John 5:12-13.
