# John 9:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The neighbors, possibly driven by hostility towards Jesus, brought him to the Pharisees, who were sitting in council. Instead of examining the evidence that Jesus was from God, they intended to use this opportunity to accuse him of violating the Sabbath. Their actions, driven by their hatred of Jesus, revealed their stupidity and foolish superstition. Instead of honoring God, they adored the wicked tyrants of their religious institution. In contrast, the blind man, brought by the neighbors, displayed simplicity and openness to the truth, which continues to challenge the conflict between Jesus and the spirit of Judaism.
