# John 9:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On the Sabbath day, Jesus made clay and anointed the eyes of a blind man, which was seen as a violation of the Sabbath. The act of making clay was highlighted as a servile work, emphasizing the controversy it caused. It’s interesting to note that the blind man himself shares his personal experience of the healing, mentioning the sensation rather than the method used. Although the details of the spitting are not mentioned, the focus of the account is on the sensory experience of the man gaining sight.
