# John 9:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Pharisees, whom he knew to be his enemies, were questioning him about the miracle, and he chose to be concise and not go into too much detail. It is likely that he had already discussed the matter with them before, so he didn't feel the need to be more specific in his response. He did not mention Jesus by name, nor did he mention the details of how Jesus made the clay or directed him to the Pool of Siloam to wash.
