## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Among the latter party would be such as Nicodemus, Joseph, (Gamaliel?); who probably (Joseph certainly, Luk 23:51) at last withdrew, and left the majority to carry out their hate against Jesus."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This man is not of God."
2. "Others said, &c."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Men often assume their own interpretations of the Scriptures to be infallible, and then judge and condemn all others by those interpretations."
2. "The miracles were such as could not be denied, nor did even the enemies of Jesus attempt to deny them or to explain them away. They were open, public, frequent."
3. "It is scarcely possible to conceive of more conclusive proof that those miracles were really performed, and, if so, then the Lord Jesus was sent by God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A Rabbinical precept declares, 'It is forbidden to apply even fasting - spittle to the eyes on the Sabbath.'"
2. "The words in ver. 14, made the clay, also mark a specific point of offense."

### John Calvin:
1. "For they ought to have profited in the pure worship of God by the miracles of Christ; they ought to have been confirmed by them in the doctrine of the Law, and to have risen to the Messiah himself, who was the end of the Law."
2. "Let us then remember that we ought to seek God with a sincere disposition of heart, that he may reveal himself to us by the power of his Spirit; and that we ought to lend our ears submissively to his word, that he may clearly point out true prophets by miracles that are not delusive."
3. "All who do not yield obedience to the truth of God, therefore, rend the Church by schism. Yet it is better that men should differ among themselves, than that they should all, with one consent, revolt from the true religion."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The one party, taking as their starting-point the inviolability of the sabbatic law, deny to Jesus as a transgressor of this law any divine mission whatever; and from this logically follows the denial of the miracle."
2. "The others, setting out from the fact of the miracle, infer the holy character of Jesus, and implicitly deny the breaking of the sabbath."
3. "The choice of premiss depends in this case, as in all cases, upon the moral freedom; it is at this point of departure that the friends of light and the friends of darkness separate; the rest is simply a matter of logic."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Because he keepeth not the sabbath. This is reason enough. He violates our rules about the Sabbath and therefore is a Sabbath-breaker as charged when here before."
2. "How can a man that is a sinner do such signs? This was the argument of Nicodemus, himself a Pharisee and one of the Sanhedrin, long ago. It was a conundrum for the Pharisees."
3. "No wonder there was 'a division' as in John 7:43; John 10:19."

### John Gill:
1. "He is not sent of God, he does not come from him to do his will and work, nor does he seek his glory, nor is he on his side, or for his interest."

3. "Even in the sanhedrin, they could not agree about the character of the person that had done this miracle."
