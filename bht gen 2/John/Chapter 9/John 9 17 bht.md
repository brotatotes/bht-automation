# John 9:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The question posed to the man who was healed of his blindness was, What sayest thou of him, for that he hath opened thine eyes? The focus of this inquiry was to gather his personal interpretation and reaction to the miracle. In response, the man affirmed that Jesus was a prophet, acknowledging that the ability to perform such a miraculous act pointed to his prophetic credentials. The Jews had a tendency to associate miracles with the prophetic office, therefore this conclusion was in line with their understanding.
