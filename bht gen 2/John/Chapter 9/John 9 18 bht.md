# John 9:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When faced with the undeniable evidence of the man who had been blind gaining his sight, the religious leaders, driven by their own theological biases, refused to believe. So they called upon the man's parents, hoping to find some evidence of collusion between their son and Jesus. Their desperate attempts to unearth a fraud only served to highlight their own stubbornness and ignorance. They were so blinded by their preconceived notions that they failed to see the truth standing right before them.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The hostile party, disappointed at his direct testimony against them, betake themselves to sifting more closely the evidence of the fact."
2. "The parents are summoned as witnesses."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Foiled by the testimony of the young man himself, they hope to throw doubt on the fact by close questioning his parents, who, perceiving the snare laid for them, ingeniously escape it by testifying simply to the identity of their son, and his birth-blindness, leaving it to himself, as a competent witness, to speak as to the cure."
2. "They prevaricated, however, in saying they 'knew not who had opened his eyes,' for 'they feared the Jews,' who had come to an understanding. . . that whoever owned Him as the Christ would be put out of the synagogue—that is, not simply excluded, but excommunicated."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Jews represent that section which was hostile to Jesus."

3. "Properly, 'of the very one who had received.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "There are two things here which ought to be observed; that they do not believe that a miracle has been performed, and that, being wilfully blinded through a perverse hatred of Christ, they do not perceive what is manifest."
2. "For what prevents them from seeing an obvious work of God placed before their eyes; or, after having been fully convinced, what prevents them from believing what they already know, except that the inward malice of their heart keeps their eyes shut?"
3. "Warned by such examples, let us learn not to bring upon ourselves those obstacles which drive us away from the faith."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The change from 'the Pharisees' to 'the Jews' is very striking, and must have special significance."
2. "'The Jews' is not with John a designation of all the enemies of Jesus; it denotes the representatives of Jewish thought and action, the leaders of the people, who, alas! were leaders in the persecution of our Lord."
3. "So serious had the case become that the rulers themselves engaged in it: more than this, we have now done with inquiry in any true sense, and persecution has taken its place."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The facts told by the man, 'that he had been blind and had received his sight,' conflicted with their theological views of God and the Sabbath."
