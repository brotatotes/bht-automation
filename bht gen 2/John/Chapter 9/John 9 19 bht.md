# John 9:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Pharisees, in their cunning, presented the parents of the blind man with a series of entangled and captious questions. By doing so, they hoped to confuse them and discredit the miracle performed by Jesus. If the parents denied that the man was their son, the Pharisees could accuse him of lying. Alternatively, if they denied that he was born blind, it would undermine the magnitude of the miracle. The Pharisees were seeking to find any flaw in the man's words to accuse him and discredit Jesus as a transgressor of the law.
