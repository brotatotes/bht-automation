# John 9:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples were puzzled by the cause of the man's congenital blindness, questioning whether he had sinned before birth or if it was a punishment for his parents' sins. They were influenced by the common belief among Jews that calamities were the result of sin. It was also possible that they were influenced by the Jewish idea of the transmigration of souls, believing that a soul could sin in a previous existence. However, the true cause of the man's condition remained a mystery, as we cannot always pinpoint the reasons for the hardships people face.
