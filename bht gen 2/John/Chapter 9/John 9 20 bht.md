# John 9:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parents affirm, We know that this is our son, for though his receiving his sight made a considerable alteration in him, yet his features were the same. Even the neighbors, who may have disagreed about him, recognized him as the same person that had been blind and begged. The parents also confirm that he was born blind, ready and willing to attest to this fact. Their testimony further confirms the reality of the miracle and exposes the disbelief of the Pharisees.
