# John 9:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parents' strong emphasis on Jesus healing their son is evident in their response, as they refer to their son himself. They were careful to not testify to Jesus out of fear. In regards to the third question, they claim ignorance about how their son can now see, emphasizing their lack of knowledge about the details. Additionally, they state that their son, who is of age, can speak for himself and provide an account of his healing. They entrusted him to answer the question, confident in his adulthood and ability to explain the situation.
