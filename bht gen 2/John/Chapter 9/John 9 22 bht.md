# John 9:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The resolution to put him out of the synagogue is a form of excommunication, a practice that has been observed throughout history. It is a severe punishment that entails being banished from the religious community and deprived of fellowship and support. The parents of the blind man were afraid of this consequence, which shows the power and influence of the religious leaders of that time.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is not said when this resolution was come to; and this also speaks for an interval between ch. 7. 8., and this incident."
2. "Probably the first of the three stages of Jewish excommunication, the being shut out from the synagogue and household for thirty days, but without any anathema."
3. "Trench (Mirr. 299, edn. 2) regards the resolution not as a token that the Sanhedrim had pronounced Him a false Christ, but as shewing that they forbade a private man to anticipate their decision on this point by confessing Him (?)."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The literal rendering cannot be neatly given, as there is no English adjective corresponding to ajposunagwgov, which means excluded from the synagogue: as nearly as possible - that He should become banished from the synagogue."
2. "The man was to be as one dead. No intercourse was to be held with him; one must not show him the road, and though he might buy the necessaries of life, it was forbidden to eat and drink with him."
3. "These severer forms appear to have been of later introduction, so that the penalty which the blind man's parents feared was probably separation from all religious fellowship, and from ordinary intercourse of life for perhaps thirty days."

### John Calvin:
1. "This passage shows that the custom of excommunication is ancient, and has been observed in all ages; for excommunication was not then for the first time invented, but it was a custom which had been anciently used against apostates and despisers of the Law, and was turned against the disciples of Christ."
2. "We learn, therefore, that the practice of excommunication arose out of the most ancient discipline of the Church."
3. "The priests and scribes not only abused this power in a tyrannical manner to oppress innocent men; but at length they basely attacked God himself and his doctrine."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A continuing fear and not without reason."
2. "Jesus had made confession of himself before men the test of discipleship and denial the disproof."
3. "Small wonder then that here the parents cowered a bit."

### John Gill:
1. "The reason why they answered in the manner they did to the third, was because they feared the Jews."
2. "Excommunication with the Jews was not only on religious accounts, but on civil accounts; on account of money, or when a man would not pay his debts."
3. "This was done in order to inject terror both into those that were guilty, and also into the whole congregation of the people, that they might hear and fear."

### John Wesley:
1. He should be put out of the synagogue — That is be excommunicated.
