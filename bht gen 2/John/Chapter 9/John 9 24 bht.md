# John 9:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Pharisees try to make the blind man deny the miraculous healing by telling him to Give God the praise. This phrase serves as a form of urging him to tell the truth, acknowledging that God is present and listening. They want him to confess that the miracle was a fraud and not to give any credit to Jesus, whom they consider a sinner. However, the man's healing indeed occurred, and the Pharisees' attempts to deny it cannot hide God's work through unlikely instruments.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Not, ‘Give God the praise’ (E.V.), i.e. ‘the glory of thy healing:’ for the Pharisees want to overawe the man by their authority, and make him deny the miracle altogether."
2. "The words are a form of adjuration (see ref. Josh.), to tell the truth, q. d. ‘Remember that you are in God’s presence, and speak as unto Him.’"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Give God the praise; we know that this man is a sinner—not wishing him to own, even to the praise of God, that a miracle had been wrought upon him, but to show more regard to the honor of God than ascribe any such act to one who was a sinner."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Give God the praise - This expression seems to be a form of administering an oath." 
2. "The meaning here is not 'give God praise for healing you,' for they were not willing to admit that he had been cured John 9:18, but confess that there is imposture in the case."
3. "To induce him to do this, they added that they knew, or were satisfied that Jesus was a sinner. As they considered that point settled, they urged him to confess that he had attempted to impose on them."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Give God the praise [δος δοξαν τω θεω]." (Rev., give glory to God.) Compare Joshua 7:19; 1 Samuel 6:5. This phrase addressed to an offender implies that by some previous act or word he has done dishonor to God, and appeals to him to repair the dishonor by speaking the truth. 
2. In this case, it is also an appeal to the restored man to ascribe his cure directly to God and not to Jesus. 
3. We, the wise men and guardians of religion.

### John Calvin:
1. "There can be no doubt that they were constrained by shame to call the blind man, whom they had previously found to be too firm and steady."
2. "Give glory to God...though this adjuration may be referred to what is connected with the present cause...yet I rather agree with those who think that it was a solemn form, which was wont to be employed when an oath was administered to any person."
3. "Thus God drags to light their wicked designs, whatever attempts they may make to give them a plausible appearance, or to conceal them by hypocritical pretences."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Give glory to God" - "a formula used when a criminal who was thought to be concealing the truth was urged to make a full confession."
2. "We know" - "the authorities... know that Jesus is a breaker of the law, and therefore cannot have wrought a miracle."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It was really the third time... Now it was like a joke unless the Pharisees meant to imply that his previous story was untrue." 
2. "Give glory to God... This phrase does not mean gratitude to God... It is rather an adjuration to speak the truth."
3. "They can no longer deny the fact of the cure... He must accept their ecclesiastical authority as proving that Jesus had nothing to do with the cure since Jesus is a sinner."

### John Gill:
1. "Give God the praise; confess this fraud and imposture before the omniscient God, the searcher of hearts, and in so doing glorify that perfection of his." 
2. "If this really is matter of fact, that thou wast born blind, and hast received thy sight by the means of this man, give all the glory of it to God, to whom alone it is due, and not to him."
3. "God sometimes works by wicked instruments, when the glory of what is done ought not to be ascribed to them, but to him."
