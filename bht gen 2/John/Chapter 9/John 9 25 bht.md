# John 9:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The blind man does not engage in the debate over whether Jesus is a sinner, but instead focuses on the undeniable fact of his transformed sight. This reminds us of how those who have been enlightened spiritually may still be ignorant of many things, but they know the reality of their once blind state and their newfound spiritual sight. They now recognize the sinfulness of sin, the condition of their own hearts, and the sufficiency of Christ as their Savior.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Bear in mind, that ὤν must here be strictly kept to its present sense, as being joined with a present verb βλέπω: the rule for the construction of a pres. part. being, that it is contemporaneous with the verb which rules the time of the sentence." 
2. "So that we must render, not ‘whereas I WAS blind, now I see,’ as E. V.: but as A.V.R., being a blind man [or, though a blind man], now I see."
3. "He puts it to them as the problem, the fact of which he knows for certain but the reason of which it was for them to solve, that he, whom they all knew as a blind man, now saw."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Not that the man meant to insinuate any doubt in his own mind on the point of His being 'a sinner,' but as his opinion on such a point would be of no consequence to others..."
2. "...he would speak only to what he knew as fact in his own case."
3. "Whether he be a sinner or no..."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "By his saying that he did not know whether he was a sinner may be meant that though he might be a prophet, yet that he might not be perfect; or that it did not become him, being an obscure and unlearned man, to attempt to determine that question."
2. "What follows shows that he did not believe that he was a sinner, and these words were probably spoken in irony to deride the Pharisees."
3. "The man reminded them that the question was not whether Jesus was a sinner; that, though that might be, yet it did not settle the other question about opening his eyes, which was the chief point of the inquiry."

### John Calvin:
1. "The blind man appears not to have been at all prevented by fear from giving a sincere testimony."
2. "He suspends his judgment about the person, and brings forward the fact itself, so that, while he makes this admission in their favor, he is not free from ridiculing them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "His simplicity leaves them no real excuse for condemning."
2. "By his steel fast adherence to the one testimony which he alone was competent to render, he most effectually brings condemnation on his judges."
3. "Had they been sincere, would first have sought certain knowledge of the fact."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "One thing I know. This man is keen and quick and refuses to fall into the trap set for him. He passes by their quibbling about Jesus being a 'sinner' and clings to the one fact of his own experience."
2. "Whereas I was blind, now I see. Literally, 'Being blind I now see.' The present active participle of 'being' implies previous and past time."
3. "It must be borne in mind that the man did not at this stage know who Jesus was and so had not yet taken him as Saviour."

### John Gill:
1. "Whether he be a sinner or not, I know not... one thing I know, that whereas I was blind, now I see." 
2. "And so it is with persons enlightened in a spiritual sense, whatever things they may be ignorant of... yet this they know, that they were once blind, as to the knowledge of spiritual things."
3. "But now they are comfortably assured, they see the exceeding sinfulness of sin, the plague of their own hearts, the insufficiency of their righteousness to justify them before God, and the beauty, fulness, suitableness, and ability of Christ as a Saviour."
