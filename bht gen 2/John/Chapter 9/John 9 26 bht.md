# John 9:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This passage reveals the persistence of the individuals questioning the man whose eyes were opened by Jesus. Their repeated inquiries serve as attempts to catch him in a contradiction or to intimidate him into denying the truth of his healing. However, the man remains steadfast in his confession, not allowing himself to be shaken by their tactics. Their desire to know the specific details of how Jesus performed the miracle reveals their wicked hatred and their unwillingness to acknowledge the truth. Despite their efforts to discredit the man's testimony, he remains faithful and steadfast in his belief in Jesus.
