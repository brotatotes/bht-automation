# John 9:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The words ye did not hear indicate that they did not receive and believe what they had heard. However, the Jews, stung by His questions, retorted as if they were the disciples. Their obstinate enmity compelled Jesus to avow His own discipleship. Their eagerness to hear particulars about Him seemed to suggest that they were becoming His disciples. Jesus, in a tone of keen irony, treated their questions as those of anxious inquirers on the verge of discipleship.
