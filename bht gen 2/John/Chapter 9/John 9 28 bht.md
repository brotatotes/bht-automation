# John 9:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They vehemently criticized him, denouncing him as a sinner and rejecting any possibility of a miracle. Their devotion to Moses led them to question the authenticity of Jesus' actions and disregard the praise that God deserved. Their misguided perception of Jesus as a violator of the law led them to dismiss his followers as well. However, placing Moses above Christ and following the Pharisees' doctrines only served to distance them from the true essence of the law. Their contemptuous words reflected their strong allegiance to Moses and their refusal to acknowledge Jesus' authority.
