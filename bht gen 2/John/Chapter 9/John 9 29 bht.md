# John 9:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In their rejection of Jesus, the religious leaders claimed that they knew the origins and authority of Moses but dismissed Jesus, saying, We know not whence he is. They held to their interpretation of the law, believing it to be infallible, and condemned Jesus based on their assumption. However, the authority of Moses' words still stands, and by holding onto the law, they believed they were doing God's will. They failed to understand that Jesus' power and authority came from God and that he was the fulfillment of the law.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "λελάληκεν, not ἐλάλησεν, is important: it betokens the abiding finality of God’s revelation to Moses, in their estimation: q. d. ‘We stand by God’s revelation to Moses.’"
2. "πόθεν ‘whether from God or not.’ But see ch. John 7:27-28, where a very different reason is given for disbelieving Him to be the Christ."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We know that God commanded Moses to deliver the law. In that they were correct; but they assumed their interpretation of the law to be infallible, and, hence, condemned Jesus."
2. "The word 'fellow' is not in the original. It is simply 'this.' The word 'fellow' implies contempt, which it cannot be proved they intended to express."
3. "We know not his origin, his family, or his home. The contrast with the preceding member of the sentence shows that they intended to express their belief that he was not from God. They knew not whether he was mad, whether he was instigated by the devil, or whether he spoke of himself."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The authority of Moses' words therefore continues to the present." 
2. "Lalew is to talk, familiarly." 
3. "Whence he is."

### John Calvin:
1. "They refer not to his country or the place of his birth, but to the prophetical office." 
2. "They allege that they have no knowledge of his calling, so as to receive him as having proceeded from God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In holding by the law of Moses, then, they are safe and are assured that they are doing the will of God."
2. "If they do not know the origin of ‘this man,’ he can be worthy of no regard, certainly he cannot be from God!"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "We know that God hath spoken unto Moses." (ημεις οιδαμεν οτ Μωυσε λελαληκεν ο θεος) - Perfect active indicative of λαλεω, so still on record. See Exodus 33:11. For λαλεω used of God speaking see Hebrews 1:1.
2. "But as for this man, we do not know whence he is." (τουτον δε ουκ οιδαμεν ποθεν εστιν) - "This fellow" they mean by "τουτον" in emphatic position, we do not even know whence he is. Some of the people did (John 7:27), but in the higher sense none of the Jews knew (John 8:14). 
3. "These Pharisees neither knew nor cared." - These Pharisees neither knew nor cared.

### John Gill:
1. "We know that God spoke to Moses,.... Out of the bush, and told him who he was, and sent him to deliver the children of Israel out of Egyptian bondage..." 
2. "They mean, they knew that Moses had his mission, commission, and credentials from God." 
3. "As for this fellow; so they contemptuously called the Lord Jesus Christ, we know not from whence he is..."

### John Wesley:
1. We know not whence he is — By what power and authority he does these things.
