# John 9:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Has it ever been heard that someone has opened the eyes of a man born blind? This particular miracle performed by Jesus stands out as unprecedented and unique, not listed among the other miracles and signs recorded. In fact, Jesus has a greater confirmation of his divine mission from God than even Moses or the prophets had. This miraculous act of giving sight to a man born blind sets Jesus apart as the one who possesses the power and authority to do what no one else can.
