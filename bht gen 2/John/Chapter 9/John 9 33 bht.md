Jesus' ability to perform miracles was an undeniable proof of his divine commission from God. The fact that he could perform such extraordinary acts demonstrated his authority and assistance from God.

The miracles he performed served as tangible evidence that he was sent by God and had the full power and authority to carry out his mission.
