# John 9:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They forget that the charges against him do not agree together. The blind man bore the mark of God's anger in a blindness from birth, but now they accuse him of never having been blind at all. They cast him out, excommunicated him from the synagogue. The audacity of this sinful man, born in sin, teaching them! Yet God has chosen to use even the lowliest to impart wisdom and challenge our pride. This act of expulsion fulfilled the words of Isaiah, done in pretense of zeal for God's honor and glory.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "They forget that the two charges, one that he had never been born blind, and so was an impostor, the other, that he bore the mark of God’s anger in a blindness that reached back to his birth, will not agree together." (Trench, Mirr. 305, edn. 2, note.)
2. "They excommunicated him: see on John 9:22." 
3. "It cannot merely mean, 'they cast him out of the court' (Chrys., Mald., Grot., Fritzsche, Tholuck, Meyer); see next verse, where it would hardly be stated that Jesus heard of it unless it had been some public formal act."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Thou wast born in a state of blindness, a state which proved that either thou or thy parents had sinned, and that this was the punishment for it." 
2. "When people have no arguments, they attempt to supply their place by revilings."
3. "They cast him out - Out of the synagogue. They excommunicated him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In sins wast thou born, all of thee; and dost thou teach us?"
2. "Dost thou, thus born in sins, assume the office of teacher?"
3. "Cast him out. From the place where they were conversing."

### John Calvin:
1. "This undeserved censure ought to instruct us to be exceedingly cautious, not always to estimate the sins of any person by the chastisements of God; for, as we have already seen, God has various ends to accomplish, by inflicting calamities on men."
2. "But not only do those hypocrites insult the wretched man; they likewise reject disdainfully his warnings, though they are holy and good; as indeed it very frequently happens that one cannot endure to be taught by him whom he despises."
3. "For there is not a more dangerous plague than when pride stops our ears, so that we do not deign to hear those who warn us for our profit; and it frequently happens that God purposely selects vile and worthless persons to instruct and warn us, in order to subdue our pride."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The fact that in their passion they are thus acknowledging the reality of the miracle is no argument against such a reference: the man’s whole condition, as evinced by his spirit and his words, bears yet stronger testimony than his blindness, and shows that he was altogether born in sins."
2. "The meaning of the last clause is not quite clear. It probably refers to ejection from the place in which the inquiry was held; but the next verse seems to prove that excommunication followed this."
3. "Cast out by the rulers from their place of meeting, he was cast out from all intercourse with them, and (so far as their influence extended) from the community over which they ruled."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Thou wast altogether born in sin... teaches total depravity in this case beyond controversy, the Pharisees being judges."
2. "And dost thou teach us?... The audacity of it all. It was insufferable."
3. "And they cast him out... Probably not yet expulsion from the synagogue (John 9:22) which required a formal meeting of the Sanhedrin, but certainly forcible driving of the gifted upstart from their presence."

### John Gill:
1. "Certainly it was God that gave him a mouth and wisdom which these learned doctors could not resist" 
2. "Thou vile, sinful creature, who came into the world covered with sin, with the visible marks of having sinned" 
3. "And now in part was fulfilled, Isaiah 66:5, for this was done in pretence of zeal, for the honour and glory of God"

### John Wesley:
1. "Born in sin — And therefore, they supposed, born blind."
2. "They cast him out — Of the synagogue; excommunicated him."
