# John 9:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The blind man, though lacking clear understanding of Jesus, displays an eagerness to believe. He asks, Who is He, that I may believe? His response indicates a readiness to be led into complete faith and an implicit trust in Jesus. Despite not yet knowing the full identity of the Son of God, the blind man was disposed to believe and had a strong desire to see and hear Jesus. It is remarkable that Christ does great things for His people even before they fully know Him, while their interest and blessings from Him depend on knowledge and faith.
