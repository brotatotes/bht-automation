# John 9:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The purpose of Jesus coming into the world was not to judge, but rather to bring about a judgment as a result of His presence. This judgment consists of separating those who believe in Him from those who reject Him. Jesus came as a light into the world to reveal the truth to those who are in darkness of sin and unbelief, enabling them to recognize their true nature and the abundance of grace and salvation available to them. However, those who claim to have sight but reject Jesus will experience even greater blindness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The blind man had recovered sight in two senses, bodily and spiritual. And as our Lord always treats of the spiritual as paramount,  including the bodily, so here He proceeds to speak of spiritual sight."
2. "To know and confess this our blindness, is our first and only true  sight, out of which the grace of the Lord can afterwards bring about a complete receiving of sight."
3. "The 'becoming blind,' on the other hand, is partly an ironical expression for remaining blind, but partly also has a real meaning in the increasing darkening and hardening which takes place through unbelief."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Jesus said—perhaps at the same time, but after a crowd, including some of the skeptical and scornful rulers, had, on seeing Jesus talking with the healed youth, hastened to the spot."
2. "That they which see not might see, &c.—rising to that sight of which the natural vision communicated to the youth was but the symbol."
3. "That they which see might be made blind—judicially incapable of apprehending and receiving the truth, to which they have wilfully shut their eyes."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I came to declare the condition of men; to show them their duty and danger. My coming will have this effect, that some will be reformed and saved, and some more deeply condemned."
2. "He refers to those who are blind and ignorant by sin; whose minds have been darkened, but who are desirous of seeing."
3. "Such would be the effect of his preaching. It would exasperate them, and their pride and opposition to him would confirm them more and more in their erroneous views."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Judgment [krima]. Not the act of judgment, but its result."
2. "His very presence in the world constitutes a separation, which is the primitive idea of judgment."
3. "Between those who believe on Him and those who reject Him."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ calls it judgment, because he restores to proper order what was disordered and confused."
2. "The blindness which is here mentioned does not proceed so much from Christ as from the fault of men."
3. "Christ came into the world to give sight to the blind and to drive to madness those who think that they are wise."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He does not say that He came in order to judge, but that the necessary effect of His coming into this world, a world alienated from God, will be a judgment."
2. "Knowledge which has priceless value for pointing the way to Christ becomes accursed if put in His place as an object of trust."
3. "Thus both classes have a part in the 'judgment:' the one by appropriating as just the judgment of Jesus on their blindness apart from Him; the other by deliberately shutting their eyes to the true light."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This world is not the home of Jesus."
2. "The κριμα (judgement), a word nowhere else in John, is the result of the κρισις (sifting) from κρινω, to separate."
3. "The spiritually blind as well as the physically blind (Luke 4:18; Isaiah 42:18)."

### John Gill:
1. "For the judgment of this world I am come" - Jesus came to fulfill the purpose and decree of God in revealing truth to some and hiding it from others.
2. "Christ came as a light into the world, that those who are in the darkness of sin, ignorance, and unbelief... might see what they are by nature and what fulness of grace, life, righteousness, and salvation there is in him for them."
3. "Christ and his Gospel have different effects, as to illuminate and soften some, and blind and harden others."

### John Wesley:
1. "By the just judgment of God, while the blind in body and soul receive their sight."
