# John 9:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
While it is day, we are called to work. Jesus associates us with him in the task given to him by the Father, to manifest the works of God. As the day is the proper time for work, night represents death, which is swiftly approaching. We must not waste time, for this life is short and death will put a halt to all our work. However, we can take comfort in knowing that Christ, the light, can work always, even after the night of death has come.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There certainly seems to be some reference to its being the sabbath." 
2. "From ὅταν…, in John 9:5, it seems evident that ἡμέρα is the appointed course of the working of Jesus on earth, and νύξ the close of it."
3. "It is true, that, according to John’s universal diction, the death of Jesus is His glorification; but the similitude here regards the effect on the world."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He had a precise work to do upon earth, with every particular of it arranged and laid out to Him."
2. "All He did upon earth was just 'the works of God'—particularly 'going about doing good,' though not exclusively by miracles."
3. "Each work had its precise time and place in His programme of instructions."
4. "By letting any one service pass by its allotted time, the whole would be disarranged, marred, and driven beyond its destined period for completion."
5. "He acted ever under the impulse of these considerations, as man—'the night cometh when no man (or no one) can work.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The works of him ... - The works of beneficence and mercy which God has commissioned me to do, and which are expressive of his goodness and power."
2. "While it is day - The day is the proper time for work - night is not. This is the general, the universal sentiment. While the day lasts it is proper to labor."
3. "The night cometh - Night here represents death. It was drawing near, and he must therefore do what he had to do soon. It is not improbable, also, that this took place near the close of the Sabbath, as the sun was declining, and the shades of evening about to appear."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Literally, it is necessary for us to work." 
2. "The disciples are thus associated by Jesus with Himself."
3. "The Son sends the disciples, as the Father sends the Son."

### John Calvin:
1. "He now testifies that he has been sent for the purpose of manifesting the kindness of God in giving sight to the blind man."
2. "He borrows also a comparison from the ordinary custom of life; for, when the sun is risen, man rises to labor, but the night is allotted to repose."
3. "Hence too we ought to deduce a universal rule, that to every man the course of his life may be called his day...so, when we see that a short period of life is allotted to us, we ought to be ashamed of languishing in idleness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The substitution of ‘we’ for ‘I’ lends peculiar force and beauty to the verse... Jesus associates His disciples with Himself." 
2. "He does not say ‘Him that sent us,’ for it is the Son who sends His disciples, even as the Father sends the Son." 
3. "In a proverbial saying of this kind, the words must not be pressed too far. It is true that the Lord Jesus continues to work by His Spirit, and through His servants, though the ‘day’ of which He here speaks soon reached its close. But the work He intends is such work as is appointed for the ‘day,’ whether to Himself or to His people."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus associates us with him in the task committed to him by the Father."
2. "We are not able to fathom the depth of the necessity here involved in each life."
3. "The night cometh. 'Night is coming on,' and rapidly. Night was coming for Jesus and for each of us."

### John Wesley:
1. "The night is coming — Christ is the light."
2. "No man can do any thing toward working out his salvation after this life is ended."
3. "But Christ can work always."
