# John 9:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Are we also blind? They ask this question with indignation, perceiving that Jesus was referring to the Pharisees when he spoke about blindness. They took it as a great affront, as they saw themselves as wise, learned, and knowing men who should not be categorized with the ignorant and unlearned common people. This accusation brought to mind Isaiah 42:19, where God rebukes those who should have known better but were blinded by their own pride.
