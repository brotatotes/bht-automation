# John 9:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If you had truly been unaware of the light and unable to comprehend its significance, you would not bear the guilt of rejecting it. However, because you proclaim to have understanding and yet resist the truth, your sin remains firmly embedded. Your condemnation is rooted in the prideful assumption of knowledge while rejecting the very source of enlightenment.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "If ye were really blind (not, ‘confessed yourselves blind), ye would not have incurred guilt."
2. "Ye believe ye have the light, and boast that ye know and use the light; and therefore your guilt abideth, remaineth on you."
3. "Ye have incurred guilt, which makes it necessary to take the λέγετε ὅτι βλέπομεν as in a certain sense implying βλέπετε: viz. 'by the Scriptures being committed to you, by God’s grace, which ought to have led you to faith in me.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If ye were blind—wanted
	light to discern My claims, and only waited to receive it."
2. "ye should have no sin—none
	of the guilt of shutting out the light."
3. "ye say, We see; therefore
	your sin remaineth—Your claim to possess light, while rejecting
	Me, is that which seals you up in the guilt of unbelief."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Sin is measured by the capacities or ability of people, and by their opportunities of knowing the truth."
2. "This passage teaches conclusively: 1. That people are not condemned for what they cannot do. 2. That the reason why they are condemned is that they are not disposed to receive the truth. 3. That pride and self-confidence are the sources of condemnation. 4. That if people are condemned, they, and not God, will be to blame."
3. "People’s sins will always be unpardoned while they are proud, and self-sufficient, and confident of their own wisdom. If they will come with humble hearts and confess their ignorance, God will forgive, enlighten, and guide them in the path to heaven."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If ye were blind, ye would not have sin: but now ye say, We see; your sin abideth."

2. "If the Pharisees were born morally blind, they would, like idiots, be without responsibility."

### John Gill:
1. "if ye were blind,.... And sensible of it, and knew yourselves to be blind, and were desirous of light and knowledge,ye would have no sin"
