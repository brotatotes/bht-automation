# John 9:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The use of spittle and clay by Jesus to heal the blind man challenged the superstitions and legalistic interpretations of the religious leaders. Jesus' act demonstrated that the power of healing came solely from Him. The spittle, although regarded as having a peculiar virtue, did not contribute to the miraculous effect. Instead, it served as a test of faith for the blind man and as an example for others. By using unconventional means, Jesus showed that God can work through ordinary things and that faith, not external rituals, is the conduit for His miraculous power.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The virtue especially of the saliva jejuna, in cases of disorders of the eyes, was well known to antiquity. Pliny...says, 'Lippitudines matutina quotidie velut inunctione arceri.'" 
2. "The use of clay also for healing the eyes was not unknown. Serenus Samonicus...says: 'Si tumor insolitus typho se tollat inani, Turgentes oculos vili circumline cœno.'" 
3. "No rule can be laid down which our Lord may seem to have observed, as to using, or dispensing with, the ordinary human means of healing. He Himself determined by considerations which are hidden from us. Whatever the means used, the healing was not in them, but in Him alone. The 'conductor' of the miraculous power was generally the faith of the recipient: and if such means served to awaken that faith, their use would be accounted for."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "These operations were not so incongruous in their nature as might appear." 
2. "It were absurd to imagine that they contributed in the least degree to the effect which followed."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jesus, therefore, by making this spittle, showed them that their manner of keeping the day was superstitious, and that he dared to do a thing which they esteemed unlawful."
2. "He showed that their interpretation of the law of the Sabbath was contrary to the intention of God, and that his disciples were not bound by their notions of the sacredness of that day."
3. "Jesus by this act showed to the blind man that the power of healing came from him who anointed his eyes."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The spittle was regarded as having a peculiar virtue, not only as a remedy for diseases of the eye, but generally as a charm, so that it was employed in incantations."
2. "Persius, describing an old crone handling an infant, says: 'She takes the babe from the cradle, and with her middle finger moistens its forehead and lips with spittle to keep away the evil eye.'"
3. "Some editors read here ejpeqhken, put upon, for ejpecrisen, anointed."

### John Calvin:
1. "But in this way he intended to try the faith and obedience of the blind man, that he might be an example to all."
2. "It certainly was no ordinary proof of faith, that the blind man, relying on a bare word, is fully convinced that his sight will be restored to him, and with this conviction hastens to go to the place where he was commanded."
3. "Faith is instantly followed by a readiness to obey, so that he who is convinced that God will be his faithful guide calmly yields himself to the direction of God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "That Jesus supposed some virtue lay in the application of the clay is contradicted by the fact that in other cases of blindness He did not use it" (Dods).
2. "The kneading of the clay and spittle added another offence against the Sabbath rules of the rabbis."
3. "He spread the clay upon his eyes."

### John Gill:
1. "However, spittle, especially fasting spittle, might be thought proper in some disorder of the eyes, to be used, as it was by the Jews."
2. "This may be an emblem of the word of God, the eye salve of the Gospel; which is a very unlikely means in the opinion of a natural man, who counts it foolishness, of enlightening and saving sinners."
3. "And yet by this foolishness of preaching God does save those who believe."

### John Wesley:
1. "This might almost have blinded a man that had sight."
2. "But what could it do toward curing the blind?"
