# John 9:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This blind man, obediently following Jesus' command, went to wash his eyes in the pool of Siloam, even though it might have seemed unlikely to him that this action would bring about healing. However, he trusted in Jesus and was willing to use these unconventional means. In doing so, he became a witness to the power and authority of Jesus, highlighting the importance of belief and obedience in receiving blessings from the Lord. May we also humble ourselves before God's recovery grace and submit to His ways, trusting that His methods will bring about His purposes in our lives.

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ freely made use of those outward symbols, on various occasions, for adorning his miracles, either to accustom believers to the use of signs, or to show that all things were at his disposal, or to testify that every one of the creatures has as much power as he chooses to give them."
