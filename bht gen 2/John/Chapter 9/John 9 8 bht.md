# John 9:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The blind man was no stranger, but rather a native of Jerusalem, well-known to the people in a particular neighborhood. He had become a familiar sight, sitting in the same spot as blind beggars are accustomed to do. Therefore, when the people saw him with his sight restored, they questioned, 'Is this not he that sat and begged?'
