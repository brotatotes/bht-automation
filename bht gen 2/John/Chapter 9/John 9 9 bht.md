# John 9:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When someone experiences a profound transformation through grace and conversion, it often leads to discussions among those who know them. People question whether they have gone mad or become melancholic. In the case of the blind man who was healed, his neighbors were unsure if he was the same person or someone else entirely, pondering what could have caused such a change. Those who have been touched by the Spirit of God and called by his grace are often open and honest about their former state, acknowledging themselves as impoverished, blind, miserable, and unworthy beings.

### John Gill:
1. "This discourse of the neighbours concerning the blind man restored to sight, resembles the talk that generally is among relations, acquaintance, and neighbours, when anyone belonging to them is called by grace, and converted, saying, what is come to such an one? is he mad or melancholy?"
2. "He is scarcely the same; is it he, or another? what is the matter with him?"
3. "Persons enlightened by the Spirit of God, and effectually called by his grace, are very free and ready to acknowledge what they were before conversion, what poor, blind, and miserable, and contemptible creatures they were."
