# Jude 1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jude humbly identifies himself as the servant of Jesus Christ, expanding on the fact that being a Christian holds greater significance than any natural or familial relation. The call by God distinguishes believers, as they are set apart and sanctified by Him. Referred to as the elect of God, they are preserved and safeguarded through Jesus Christ, with the preservation serving as both the source and accomplishment of their salvation. This threefold blessing encompasses God's calling, regeneration through the Spirit, and the preservation of believers by the hand of Christ to prevent them from falling away from their salvation.
