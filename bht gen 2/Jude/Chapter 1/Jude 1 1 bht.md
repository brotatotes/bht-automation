## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Jude therefore calls himself modestly 'brother of James.'"
2. "The conclusion, Jude 1:21, corresponds, 'Keep yourselves in the love of God.'"
3. "Jude, beforehand, mentions the source and guarantee for the final accomplishment of believers’ salvation; lest they should be disheartened by the dreadful evils which he proceeds to announce [Bengel]."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We may learn from the fact that Jude merely calls himself 'the servant of the Lord Jesus'... it is a higher honor than any distinction arising from birth or family." 
2. "To those who are 'holy,' or who are 'saints.'... As the Epistle was probably 'sent' to Christians residing in a certain place, it was not necessary to designate them more particularly."
3. "The meaning is, that they owed their preservation wholly to him; and if they were brought to everlasting life, it would be only by him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He does not call himself an apostle, as Paul and Peter in their introductions, and seems to distinguish himself from the apostles." 
2. "That Jude does not allude to his relationship to the Lord may be explained by the fact that the natural relationship in his mind would be subordinate to the spiritual."
3. "Therefore for Jesus Christ; by the Father to whom Christ committed them. "

### John Calvin:
1. "Whosoever is not called, arrogates to himself presumptuously the right and authority of teaching."
2. "And brother of James...it is a confirmation to the faith, when the integrity of the man who undertakes the office of a teacher is made certain to us."
3. "Jude mentions here a threefold blessing, or favor of God, with regard to all the godly, — that he has made them by his calling partakers of the gospel; that he has regenerated them, by his Spirit, unto newness of life; and that he has preserved them by the hand of Christ, so that they might not fall away from salvation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If he were, as suggested in the Introduction, the brother of our Lord as well as of James, neither of whom speaks of his relation to Christ, the omission is probably owing to the fact that the human relation was temporary and entirely subordinate to the higher relation of spiritual fellowship."
2. "Our affection for Christians springs from their relation to Christ and their likeness to Him, as our love for God's children rests on the same grounds. This is the brotherly love of the Gospel as distinguished from the love of good-will."
3. "'God keeps us for Jesus Christ;' we 'keep ourselves in the love of God.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:

3. "They are preserved in the love of God; in the covenant of grace; in a state of justification and adoption; and in the paths of truth, faith, and holiness."

### John Wesley:
1. "The word servant, under the old covenant, was adapted to the spirit of fear and bondage that clave to that dispensation."
2. "His being a servant is the fruit and perfection of his being a son."
