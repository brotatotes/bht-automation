# Jude 10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These false teachers, motivated by their own desires and limited understanding, speak evil of things beyond their comprehension. They corrupt themselves by indulging in sensual pleasures and live solely for their own gratification. Their knowledge is shallow, only confined to what their senses can perceive, and their actions only serve to destroy them further. They lack the spiritual insight to comprehend the things of God, and instead, they mock and revile the very things they cannot understand.

3. "In these (in the element and region of these) they corrupt themselves."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Whatever things naturally (by natural, blind instinct), as the unreasoning animals, they know."  
2. "The Greek for the former 'know' implies deeper knowledge; the latter 'know,' the mere perception of the 'animal senses and faculties'."

3. "Naturally [φυσικως]. Only here in the New Testament."

### John Calvin:
1. "They had no taste for anything but what was gross, and as it were beastly, and therefore did not perceive what was worthy of honor."
2. "They feared not to condemn things above their comprehension."
3. "The instinct of nature alone rules in brute animals, but reason ought to govern men and to bridle their appetites."
