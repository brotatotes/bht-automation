# Jude 10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These individuals, in their ignorance, employ reproachful language towards things that lie wholly beyond their comprehension. They have no taste for anything but what is gross and beastly, leading them to not perceive what is truly honorable. They even dare to condemn things that are above their understanding and lack the ability to rise above their limited knowledge. As they indulge in sensual gratifications, they sink deeper and deeper into corruption. It is their instinctual nature that rules over them, contrasting with the restraint that reason should bring to human desires.
