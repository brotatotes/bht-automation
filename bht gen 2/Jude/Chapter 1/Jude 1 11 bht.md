# Jude 11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Woe to these individuals, for their actions have shown that they are proud, corrupt, and wicked. They have rushed after gain, just as Cain did with his envy and hatred towards the godly. Like Balaam, they have recklessly pursued their own selfish desires without regard for the consequences. In their rebellion against God's ordinances, they have become like Korah, despising His authority. Their character and doom are identified with these infamous figures, and they are warned of the inevitable judgment that awaits them.
