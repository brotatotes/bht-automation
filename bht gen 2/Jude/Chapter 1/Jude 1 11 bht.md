# Jude 11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Woe unto them, as St. Jude denounces, their actions have led them down a path similar to that of Cain, the murderer. Their disposition mirrors his wickedness. Furthermore, they have embraced the same error as Balaam, the covetous false prophet. Like those who came before them, these false teachers have chosen a destructive path.
