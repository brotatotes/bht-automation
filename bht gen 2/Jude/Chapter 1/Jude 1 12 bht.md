# Jude 12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These false teachers, referred to as 'spots' or 'blemishes,' were not only a danger but also a disgrace to the church. They had infiltrated the love feasts, which were meant to foster brotherly love and provide for the poor. Instead, they used these occasions to further their own agendas and indulge in excess without any fear of God. These unprincipled men appeared to be spiritually alive but were actually dead in sin, having rejected the truth and turned away from God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The reference to 'clouds... winds... waves of the sea,' accords with this image of rocks." 
2. "The love-feast accompanied the Lord’s Supper... so ministers in the Lord’s Supper have sought to make it a sacrifice, and themselves the sacrificing priests, usurping the function of our only Christian sacerdotal Priest, Christ Jesus. Let them beware of Korah’s doom!"
3. "Feasting is not faulty in itself, but it needs to be accompanied with fear of forgetting God... Sacred feasts especially ought to be celebrated with fear."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They were as dangerous in the church as hidden rocks are in the ocean" - These false teachers caused others to make shipwreck of their faith.
2. "The Lord’s Supper... revealed the love of Christ to the world... It was the means of strengthening the mutual love of the disciples: a festival which love originated, and where love reigned."
3. "They are useless as religious instructors - as much so as a tree is which produces no fruit... They are wholly worthless."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "These men were no longer mere blots, but elements of danger and wreck."
2. "Shepherds that feed themselves; further their own schemes and lusts instead of tending the flock of God."
3. "As clouds which seem to be charged with refreshing showers, but are born past and yield no rain."

### John Calvin:
1. "For he calls those feasts charities, (ἀγάπαις,) which the faithful had among themselves for the sake of testifying their brotherly unity."
2. "Some copies have, 'Feasting with you,' which reading, if approved, has this meaning, that they were not only a disgrace, but that they were also troublesome and expensive, as they crammed themselves without fear, at the public expense of the church."
3. "These unprincipled men, though promising much, were yet barren within and empty, like clouds driven by stormy winds, which give hope of rain, but soon vanish into nothing."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "These are they who are sunken rocks, seen indeed, but their true nature concealed, in your feasts of charity."
2. "clouds without water, empty, useless, easily carried along therefore by the wind, ostentatious and deceptive wherever they go."
3. "trees as they are in autumn, in ‘the sear and yellow leaf,’ with all their vigour gone, not because they have borne fruit, for they are fruitless, and have ever been so."

### John Gill:
1. "These here seem to be the Agapae, or love feasts, of the primitive Christians; the design of which was to maintain and promote brotherly love, from whence they took their name; and to refresh the poor saints, that they might have a full and comfortable meal now and then."
2. "Carried about of winds; either of false doctrines, or of their own lusts and passions, or of Satan's temptations."
3. "Twice dead; that is, entirely, thoroughly, and really dead in trespasses and sins, notwithstanding their pretensions to religion and godliness."

### John Wesley:
1. "These are spots — Blemishes."
2. "Feeding themselves without fear — Without any fear of God, or jealousy over themselves."
3. "Twice dead — In sin, first by nature, and afterwards by apostasy."
