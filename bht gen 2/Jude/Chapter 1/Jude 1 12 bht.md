# Jude 12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The church was warned about the presence of dangerous elements disguised within, like hidden rocks in the sea. These individuals caused shipwreck of faith and were seen as blemishes and spots in the church. They were self-serving, feeding themselves while neglecting the flock of God. These false teachers were like clouds without water, devoid of the true grace of God. They were twice dead, having fallen into sin and then apostasy, and their withered fruits revealed their true nature.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. The reference to “clouds...winds...waves of the sea” accords with this image of rocks.
2. The love-feast accompanied the Lord’s Supper...ministers in the Lord’s Supper have sought to make it a sacrifice, and themselves the sacrificing priests.
3. Feasting is not faulty in itself, but it needs to be accompanied with fear of forgetting God...clouds – from which one would expect refreshing rains – “wells without water”.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They were as dangerous in the church as hidden rocks are in the ocean."
2. "They were like hidden rocks to the mariner. As those rocks were the cause of shipwreck, so these false teachers caused others to make shipwreck of their faith."

### John Calvin:
1. "For he calls those feasts charities, (ἀγάπαις,) which the faithful had among themselves for the sake of testifying their brotherly unity."
2. "Some copies have, 'Feasting with you,' which reading, if approved, has this meaning, that they were not only a disgrace, but that they were also troublesome and expensive."
3. "they were trees fading, as the vigor of trees in autumn disappears."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "clouds without water, empty, useless, easily carried along therefore by the wind, ostentatious and deceptive wherever they go."
