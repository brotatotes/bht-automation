# Jude 13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
False teachers are like wild waves, constantly restless and untamed. They foam with arrogant and boastful words, spreading shame and filth. These wandering stars may appear radiant for a while, but they bring no true light and will ultimately be cast into eternal darkness. They are desperate in their wickedness, compared to the tumultuous elements of nature.
