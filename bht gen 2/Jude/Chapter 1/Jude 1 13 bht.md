# Jude 13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
False teachers are like wild and restless waves, casting up mire and dirt. Their teachings are as valueless and insubstantial as the foam of the ocean waves. They are wandering stars, moving aimlessly and offering no true guidance or light. Their inflated pride leads them to spew out empty and boastful words that only serve to further their own shame. These false teachers, like drifting comets or meteors, blaze temporarily before falling into eternal darkness. We must be cautious and reverent in studying the simplicity of Scripture, lest we become entangled in their deceptive doctrines and lead others astray.

3. "With the more care and reverence ought the simplicity of Scripture to be studied, lest, by reasoning more refinedly than is right, we should not draw men to heaven, but on the contrary be involved in manifold labyrinths."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "foaming out their own shame  their lusts â€˜disgraceful.â€™"
3. "wandering stars (comets or meteors, not planets), which neither light the world nor guide the mariner, but after blazing awhile drift into â€˜the blackness and darkness which is kept (â€˜in reserveâ€™) for them, and into which they sink and sink â€˜for ever.â€™"

### John Gill:
1. "False teachers are so called, for their swelling pride and vanity; which, as it is what prevails in human nature, is a governing vice in such persons, for knowledge without grace puffs up."
2. "Wrathful words, frothy and obscene language, and filthy doctrines; and which expresses the issue of their noisy and blustering ministry, which ends in uncleanness, shame, emptiness, and ruin."
3. "They wander about from house to house, as well as from one nation to another, and being never settled in their principles, nor at a point in religion; and wander also after their own carnal lusts, and cause others to wander likewise, and at last become falling stars."

### John Wesley:
1. "Wandering starsâ€”literally, planets, which shine for a time, but have no light in themselves, and will be soon cast into utter darkness."
