# Jude 14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Enoch, the seventh from Adam, preached about the Lord's coming and the resurrection of the dead. The book of Enoch, found in the Ethiopic Bible, contains prophecies about judgment and destruction. The Lord's coming is described as being accompanied by ten thousands of his saints, either glorified souls or angels. The prophecy of the Lord's coming has been known since ancient times, and the warning in Jude is not unique. Enoch had a unique relationship with God, as he walked intimately with Him and was taken to heaven without experiencing death. The certainty of Christ's coming is emphasized in these verses.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Holy Spirit, by Jude, has sealed the truth of this much of the matter contained in the book of Enoch."
2. "Enoch, in his translation without death, illustrated that truth which he all his life preached to the unbelieving world, the certainty of the Lordâ€™s coming, and the resurrection of the dead."
3. "Jude thus shows the antiquity of the prophecies. The seventh from Adam prophesied the things which shall close the seventh age of the world."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "On the character of Enoch, see the notes at Hebrews 11:5."
2. "There is no clear evidence that he quoted it from any book extant in his time."
3. "The Lord cometh - That is, the Lord will come."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Behold he comes with ten thousands of his saints, to execute judgment upon them, and to destroy the wicked, and to strive (at law) with all the carnal for everything which the sinful and ungodly have done and committed against him."
2. "The Book of Enoch, which was known to the fathers of the second century, was lost for some centuries with the exception of a few fragments, and was found entire in a copy of the Ethiopic Bible, in 1773, by Bruce... It was probably written in Hebrew."
3. "The book shows no Christian influence, is highly moral in tone, and imitates the Old Testament myths. The evident play upon the word ungodly can be rendered but clumsily into English... ungodliness being the key-note of the writer's thought."

### John Calvin:
1. "I rather think that this prophecy was unwritten, than that it was taken from an apocryphal book; for it may have been delivered down by memory to posterity by the ancients."
2. "He wished to repeat from the oldest antiquity what the Spirit had pronounced respecting them: and this is what the words intimate; for he says expressly that he was the seventh from Adam, in order to commend the antiquity of the prophecy, because it existed in the world before the flood."
3. "Behold, the Lord cometh, or came. The past tense, after the manner of the prophets, is used for the future."

1. "Nor is this warning the warning of Jude only."
2. "And to these also prophesied Enoch the seventh from Adam."
3. "The Lord cometh with ten thousands of his holy ones."

### John Gill:
1. "Enoch...walked with [God], and was translated by him, body and soul, to heaven, and did not see death." 
2. "He is said to be 'the seventh from Adam'; not the seventh man from him that was born into the world, for there were no doubt thousands born before him; but he was, as the Jews express it, 'the seventh generation' from him."
3. "The Lord cometh with ten thousand of his saints": "meaning either the souls of glorified saints...or else the holy angels...which will be both for the showing forth of his glory and majesty, and for service in gathering his elect together, as well as for terror to the wicked."

### John Wesley:
1. "The first coming of Christ was revealed to Adam; his second, glorious coming, to Enoch; and the seventh from Adam foretold the things which will conclude the seventh age of the world."
2. "St. Jude might know this either from some ancient book, or tradition, or immediate revelation."
3. "Behold â€” As if it were already done, the Lord cometh!"
