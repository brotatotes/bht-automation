# Jude 14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Enoch, the seventh from Adam, was trained and instructed in the true religion by his father. He walked with God and was taken to heaven without experiencing death. Through Enoch, the Lord revealed the events that will mark the conclusion of the seventh age of the world. Enoch's message included the promise of the first coming of Christ, as well as the glorious second coming, when the Lord will judge the living and the dead. This declaration of the Lord's imminent arrival carries a sense of certainty, as if it were already accomplished.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Holy Spirit, by Jude, has sealed the truth of this much of the matter contained in the book of Enoch, though probably that book, as well as Jude, derived it from tradition."
2. "Enoch, in his translation without death, illustrated that truth which he all his life preached to the unbelieving world, the certainty of the Lord's coming, and the resurrection of the dead, as the only effectual antidote to their skepticism and self-wise confidence in nature's permanence."
3. "In Enoch, freedom from death and the sacred number are combined: for every seventh object is most highly valued. Jude thus shows the antiquity of the prophecies."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The line of descent is Adam, Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahaleel, Jared, Enoch."
2. "There is no clear evidence that he quoted it from any book extant in his time."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Behold he comes with ten thousands of his saints, to execute judgment upon them, and to destroy the wicked, and to strive (at law) with all the carnal for everything which the sinful and ungodly have done and committed against him."
2. "The book shows no Christian influence, is highly moral in tone, and imitates the Old Testament myths."
3. "The evident play upon the word ungodly can be rendered but clumsily into English. Rev., translates, All the ungodly, of all their works of ungodliness which they have ungodly wrought, and of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against him."

### John Calvin:
1. "I wished to repeat from the oldest antiquity what the Spirit had pronounced respecting them." 
2. "He says, that the Lord would come with ten thousand of his saints...in order that, the multitude of the ungodly may not, like a violent sea, overwhelm the children of God."
3. "Behold, the Lord cometh, or came. The past tense, after the manner of the prophets, is used for the future."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To these also prophesied Enoch the seventh from Adam, i.e the seventh including Adam; a description added probably to mark his importance by the coincidence of the sacred number seven."

3. "The Lord cometh with ten thousands of his holy ones, the 'innumerable company' of Hebrews 12:22; 'saints' restricts the meaning to saved men."
