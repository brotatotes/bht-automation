# Jude 15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Enoch's prophetic speech, which some believe was composed in mockery of his earlier prophecy, anticipated the coming judgment by the Lord upon all people. This judgment will bring about definitive sentences, absolving the righteous and condemning the wicked. The purpose of this judgment is not simply to convince or convince but to reveal the guilt of the ungodly, particularly false teachers, and to expose their harsh and blasphemous words against God. Therefore, it is essential for the elect to stay watchful and aware, as the impending punishment for the wicked should inspire fear and vigilance.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Some think Lamech's speech, which is also in poetic parallelism, was composed in mockery of Enoch's prophecy."
2. "As Enoch foretold Jehovah's coming to judgment, so Lamech presumes on impunity in polygamy and murder."
3. "They who speak against God's children are regarded by God as speaking against Himself."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He shall come to judge all the dwellers upon the earth, good and bad."
2. "The purpose of the coming of the Lord will not be to convince men in that sense, though it is undoubtedly true that the wicked will see that their lives have been wrong; but it will be to pronounce a sentence on them as the result of the evidence of their guilt."
3. "All the wicked actions and words of men will be called into judgment."

### John Calvin:
1. "But the vengeance suspended over the wicked ought to keep the elect in fear and watchfulness."
2. "Their corrupters did much evil, not only by their wicked life, but also by their impure and false speech."
3. "Their words were hard, on account of the refractory audacity, by which, being elated, they acted insolently."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The characteristic of the antediluvians, as of those whom Jude addresses, is ungodliness: four times is this quality named, first and last and midst, in the description."
2. "The double meaning of the Greek word is only half represented by â€˜convince,â€™ and only half by â€˜convict;â€™ both meanings are in the word, though the second meaning is the predominant one here."
3. "The book contains many absurdities... and it differs in several particulars from Judeâ€™s statements. There is therefore no reason to suppose that Jude quotes it, though the prophecy of Enoch is found (with some important variations, however) in both."

### John Gill:
1. "To execute judgment upon all... to pass the definitive sentence on each, that of absolution, life, and happiness, on his own people, and that of condemnation, death, and misery, on the wicked..."
2. "To convince all that are ungodly among them; those who are without God, the fear of him love to him, or faith in him; who have lived without the worship of him, or in a false worship; and particularly false teachers..."
3. "And of all their hard [speeches], which ungodly sinners have spoken against him; either 'against' God, as the Vulgate Latin version reads, against his being, his perfections, his providence, his purposes, his word, and worship; or rather against Jesus Christ the Lord..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Enoch herein looked beyond the flood."
2. "Sinners, in general. And to convict all the ungodly, in particular, of all the grievous things which ungodly sinners have spoken against him."
3. "A sinner is bad; but the ungodly who sin without fear are worse."
