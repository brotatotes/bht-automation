# Jude 15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Enoch's prophecy, written in Hebrew poetic parallelism, speaks of the impending judgment on all people. The purpose of this judgment is not to convince individuals of their wrongdoing, but to pronounce a definitive sentence on each person, absolving the righteous and condemning the wicked. It warns the elect to remain vigilant, mindful of the vengeance that will come upon the ungodly. The prophecy also emphasizes the ungodliness of those who will be judged, their impure and false speech, and their insolent behavior. In this judgment, all the wrongful words and actions of the wicked will be brought into account.
