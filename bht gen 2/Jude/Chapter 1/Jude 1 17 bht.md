# Jude 17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Remember the words spoken before by the apostles, for the warnings they gave were not just for the reprobates. These admonitions were meant to be heard by the beloved, who were contemporaries of the apostles themselves. The memory of these words was recent, and the readers were urged to keep them in mind as they faced challenges and temptations. It is important to note that the writer does not exclude himself from the group of apostles, as he too was a messenger of these important truths.
