# Jude 17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Beloved, the apostle addresses the saints in this manner, to distinguish them from the false teachers. It is a remembrance of their words that serves as a preservative from error and provides relief even in the worst of times. By using this phrasing, the apostle is not exempting himself from the number of apostles, for in the next verse he states, they told you, not us. Truly, their predictions have been seen and verified, as all of this was foreseen and foretold.
