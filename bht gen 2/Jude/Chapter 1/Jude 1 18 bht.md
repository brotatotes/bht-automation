# Jude 18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the last time, there will be mockers who show their quality by displaying a profane and impious contempt for God, leading them into a brutal rejection of the Divine. These individuals reject any fear or reverence that would restrain them within the bounds of duty, and instead give in to their own lusts of ungodliness. They are Epicurean despisers of God, casting off all fear and mocking the entire doctrine of true religion as if it were mere fabrication. This verse emphasizes the characteristic quality of such scoffers and highlights the consequences of their rejection of the Divine.
