# Jude 18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
How can anyone deny that this is referring to the mockers mentioned earlier? Jude quotes the very words of Peter, showing that these words were spoken by the apostles to those reading Jude's letter. These mockers, or scoffers, are those who exhibit a contempt for God, disregarding the teachings of true religion. Their rejection of the Divine leads them to pursue their own ungodly lusts, resulting in aggravated immorality. This characteristic quality of scoffing at the truth is a clear warning about the mindset of these mockers in the last days.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "How Alford can deny that [2 Peter 3:3-4] is referred to (at least in part), I cannot imagine, seeing that Jude quotes the very words of Peter as the words which the apostles used to speak to his (Judeâ€™s) readers."
2. "mockersâ€” In the parallel, [2 Peter 3:3-4], the same Greek is translated, 'scoffers.' The word is found nowhere else in the New Testament."
3. "walk after their own ungodly lustsâ€” literally, 'after (according to) their own lusts of ungodliness.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Mockers. See on 2 Peter 3:3. Ungodly lusts [ÎµÏ€Î¹Î¸Ï…Î¼Î¹Î±Ï‚ Ï„Ï‰Î½ Î±ÏƒÎµÎ²ÎµÎ¹Ï‰Î½] . Lit., lusts of ungodlinesses.

### John Calvin:
1. "By the last time he means that in which the renewed condition of the Church received a fixed form till the end of the world; and it began at the first coming of Christ." 
2. "After the usual manner of Scripture, he calls them scoffers who, being inebriated with a profane and impious contempt of God, rush headlong into a brutal contempt of the Divine Being, so that no fear nor reverence keeps them any longer within the limits of duty."
3. "So at this day the world is full of Epicurean despisers of God, who having cast off every fear, madly scoff at the whole doctrine of true religion, regarding it as fabulous."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They show their quality in relation to the Second Coming of the Lord."
2. "Every lust rejecting the Divine that is opposed to it, and the rejection of what is Divine ending ever in aggravated immorality."
3. "The expression here used is no doubt intended to call up the characteristic quality already described in Jude 1:15."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  How that  (Î¿Ï„). Declarative Î¿Ï„ as in verse Jude 1:5. See discussion of 2 Peter 3:3 for differences, no ÎµÎ½ ÎµÎ¼Ï€Î±Î¹Î³Î¼Î¿Î½Î· here and no Ï„Ï‰Î½ Î±ÏƒÎµÎ²ÎµÎ¹Ï‰Î½ there. 

### John Gill:
1. How that they told you that there should be mockers in the last time,....  :-.
