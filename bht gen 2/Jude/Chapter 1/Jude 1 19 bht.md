# Jude 19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These teachers separate themselves from the church, causing divisions through heretical doctrine, an unloving spirit, and proud words. They prioritize their own desires over the obedience and unity of the body of believers. Their actions reflect a sensual, self-centered mindset, devoid of true spiritual renewal. They reject the authority of the church and corrupt its worship and ordinances. By promoting discord and pursuing worldly ends, they display a sense of superiority and seek their own glory. Such separation should not be commended but recognized as detrimental to the church's well-being and contrary to the teachings of Scripture.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "He who rests midway, thinking only of self and self's interests, whether animal or intellectual, is the ÏˆÏ…Ï‡Î¹ÎºÏŒÏ‚, the selfish man, the man in whom the spirit is sunk and degraded into subordination to the subordinate ÏˆÏ…Ï‡Î®."
3. "These men have not indeed ceased to have Ï€Î½Îµá¿¦Î¼Î±, as a part of their own tripartite nature: but they have ceased to possess it in any worthy sense: it is degraded beneath and under the power of the ÏˆÏ…Ï‡Î®, the personal life, so as to have no real vitality of its own."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Separate themselves from Church communion in its vital, spiritual reality."

### John Calvin:
1. "He means that they separated from the Church, because they would not bear the yoke of discipline, as they who indulge the flesh dislike spiritual life."
2. "The word sensual, or animal, stands opposed to spiritual, or to the renovation of grace; and hence it means the vicious or corrupt, such as men are when not regenerated."
3. "They were doing the same thing as those mentioned by Paul in Romans 16:17. They were producing discords in the Church, and not separations from it; and by continuing in it, they became 'spots and stains' to its members."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Separation is caused in Christian communities by three things: by heretical doctrine, by an unloving, selfish, exacting spirit, and by proud words and an ungodly life; and all three are characteristic of these teachers." 
2. "The word describes the man in whom the earthly natural life of the soul is supreme, the spiritual, with all its faculties, being subject; and the man himself is ever doing the â€˜desires of the flesh and of the mindâ€™ (Ephesians 2:3)."
3. "Their natural religious life, such as it is, is under the unbroken influence either of their flesh or of their lower earthly conceptions. They have neither the law nor the power of the really regenerate man."

2. "They separated themselves ... from the pure worship, ordinances, and discipline of God's house, by a perversion of them, and as being above them, or unwilling to be under any notice and government."
3. "They made divisions and separations among the churches, for worldly ends, and through pride and affectation of vain glory, as if they were more knowing, more holy, and more spiritual than other men."

### John Wesley:
1. "Having natural senses and understanding only, not the Spirit of God; otherwise they could not separate."
2. "By separating is understood, renouncing all religious intercourse with them; no longer joining with them in solemn prayer, or the other public offices of religion."
3. "We have no more authority from scripture to call even this schism, than to call it murder."
