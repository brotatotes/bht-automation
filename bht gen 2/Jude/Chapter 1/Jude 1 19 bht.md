# Jude 19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These individuals, driven by their own desires, separate themselves from the church's obedience, causing divisions and discord among believers. They possess a selfish mindset, disconnected from the spiritual reality of unity and love within the body of Christ. Their hearts and minds are focused solely on their own interests, whether physical or intellectual, devoid of the true spiritual vitality that comes from the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit.
