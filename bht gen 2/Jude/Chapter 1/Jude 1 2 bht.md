## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Mercy stands first; the mercy of Christ in a time of wretchedness."
2. "Peace in the Holy Ghost."
3. "Love of God; the three answer to the divine Trinity."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied" - This is not quite the form of salutation used by the other apostles, but it is one equally expressive of an earnest desire for their welfare. These things are mentioned as the choicest blessings which could be conferred on them.
2. "Mercy" - in the pardon of all their sins and acceptance with God; "peace" - with God, with their fellow-men, in their own consciences, and in the prospect of death; and "love" - to God, to the brethren, to all the world.
3. What blessings are there which these do not include?

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Love. Peculiar to Jude in salutation.

### John Calvin:
1. "Grace is properly the effect of mercy... there is no other reason why God has embraced us in love, but that he pitied our miseries."
2. "Love may be understood as that of God towards men, as well as that of men towards one another."
3. "If it be referred to God, the meaning is, that it might increase towards them, and that the assurance of divine love might be daily more confirmed in their hearts."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "‘Mercy’ is used in the salutation of the pastoral epistles only except here."
2. "‘Mercy’ is God’s feeling towards them; ‘peace’ is their condition as the result of it; ‘love’ is either their feeling Godward and manward as the effect of God’s grace or it is God’s love to them that are called."
3. "It is for the fullness of love he prays, as it is for abundance of mercy and peace."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Be multiplied  (πληθυνθειη). First aorist passive optative of πληθυνω as in 1 Peter 1:2; 2 Peter 1:2. 

### John Gill:
1. "Mercy is a perfection in God; and shows itself in a special manner towards the elect, in the covenant of grace, in the provision of Christ as a Saviour, in redemption by him, in the forgiveness of sin, in regeneration, and in their whole salvation."
2. "Moreover, herein is wished for a multiplication of 'peace' from Christ, in whom these chosen ones were preserved; and may design a fresh and enlarged view of peace being made for them by his blood, and an increase of conscience peace in their own hearts, as the effect of it."
3. "Likewise in the salutation, 'love', and a multiplication of it is wished for from the Spirit of God, by whom they were called; and may be understood of the love with which God loved them... and fresh manifestations of it are made unto them."
