## BHT:
May the mercy of Christ, peace in the Holy Ghost, and the love of God be multiplied unto you.

2. "These things are mentioned as the choicest blessings which could be conferred on them: 'mercy' - in the pardon of all their sins and acceptance with God; 'peace' - with God, with their fellow-men, in their own consciences, and in the prospect of death; and 'love' - to God, to the brethren, to all the world."
