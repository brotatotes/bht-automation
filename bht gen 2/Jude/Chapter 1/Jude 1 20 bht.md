# Jude 20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As believers, we are called to actively participate in the growth and development of our faith. This involves building ourselves up in our most holy faith, which is not only a foundation but also a means of edification. Through prayer in the Holy Spirit, we tap into the power that builds and establishes us in our faith. The interplay of faith, love, hope, and the presence of the Father, Son, and Spirit is what makes our faith vibrant and transformative. By continually engaging in these practices, we can strengthen our faith and live out the holiness that it inspires.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Building up yourselves" - the opposite to the “separate themselves,” as “in the Holy Ghost” is opposed to “having not the Spirit.”
2. "Building on THE FAITH is equivalent to building on Christ, the object of faith."
3. "None can pray aright save by being in the Spirit, that is, in the element of His influence."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They were to 'build up themselves;' that is, they were to act as moral and responsible agents in this, or were to put forth their own proper exertions to do it."
2. "Dependent, as we are, and as all persons with correct views will feel themselves to be, yet it is proper to endeavor to do the work of religion as if we had ample power of ourselves."
3. "The phrase 'most holy faith' here refers to the system of religion which was founded on faith; and the meaning is, that they should seek to establish themselves most firmly in the belief of the doctrines, and in the practice of the duties of that system of religion."

### John Calvin:
1. "He shews the manner in which they could overcome all the devices of Satan, that is, by having love connected with faith, and by standing on their guard as it were in their watch-tower, until the coming of Christ."
2. "The way of persevering is, when we are endued with the power of God. Hence whenever the question is respecting the constancy of faith, we must flee to prayer."
3. "No one can pray aright except he be roused by the Spirit of God; and that we are also so inclined to diffidence and trembling, that no one dares to call God his Father, except through the teaching of the same Spirit."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Building up (εποικοδομουντες). Present active participle of εποικοδομεω, old compound with metaphor of a house (οικος), common in Paul (1 Corinthians 3:9-17; Colossians 2:7; Ephesians 2:20)."
2. "On your most holy faith (τη αγιωτατη υμων πιστε). For the spiritual temple see also 1 Peter 2:3-5. See πιστις (faith) in this sense (cf. Hebrews 11:1) in 2 Peter 1:5 with the list of graces added. A true superlative here αγιωτατη, not elative."
3. "Praying in the Holy Spirit (εν πνευματ αγιω προσευχομενο). This is the way to build themselves up on their faith."

2. "The doctrine of faith, is a foundation to build upon, particularly what regards the person, offices, and grace of Christ, and is itself of an edifying nature."
3. "By attending on the ministry of the word, and by private conversation, with each other, and particularly by praying in the Holy Ghost; which is a special means of increase and establishment in the doctrine of faith."

### John Wesley:
1. "Building yourselves up in your most holy faith - Than which none can be more holy in itself, or more conducive to the most refined and exalted holiness."
2. "Praying through the Holy Spirit — Who alone is able to build you up, as he alone laid the foundation."
