# Jude 21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By relying on God's grace, diligently maintain your connection to His love. This perseverance is crucial, as there are warnings of the consequences for those who fail to do so. As believers, we should seek God's love as a fortress against sin, just as Joseph did. Although God's love cannot be lost, it is essential for us to actively cultivate and strengthen our love for Him and others through proper means. Ultimately, our hope lies in the eternal life that Jesus Christ has secured and will fully manifest when He returns.
