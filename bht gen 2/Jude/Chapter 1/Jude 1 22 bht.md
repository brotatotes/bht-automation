# Jude 22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Compassion is needed when dealing with those who have gone astray, are simple and ignorant, or who sin due to weakness and temptation. It is important to adapt our approach based on the individual's character and circumstances. Some require a gentle and kind approach, while others may need to be confronted more assertively. Ultimately, our goal is to save souls, and to do so effectively, we must consider the disposition of each person and act accordingly.
