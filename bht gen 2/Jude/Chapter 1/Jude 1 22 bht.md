# Jude 22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Compassion should be shown towards those who are in doubt, wavering in judgment, or staggered by evil reasoning. For those individuals, it is important to make a strong effort to convince them of the truth. On the other hand, some individuals may need to be forcefully snatched out of the fire of sin and temptation. However, it is also crucial to show compassion towards others in a gentler way, being cautious not to be influenced by their sins. The key is to love sinners while maintaining a strong aversion to their sins.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "The special feeling to be manifest toward a certain class of persons in seeking their salvation was tender affection and kindness."
2. "The direction then amounts to this, that while we are to seek to save all, we are to adapt ourselves wisely to the character and circumstances of those whom we seek to save."
3. "To be able to do this is one of the highest qualifications to be sought by one who endeavors to save souls, and is indispensable for a good minister of the gospel."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "On some have mercy who are in doubt."
2. "Some who are contentious rebuke."
3. "The Rev. rendering better suits what follows."

### John Calvin:
1. "He reminds them that such ought to be treated in different ways, every one according to his disposition: for to the meek and teachable we ought to use kindness; but others, who are hard and perverse, must be subdued by terror."
2. "The meaning then is, that if we wish to consult the well-being of such as go astray, we must consider the character and disposition of every one; so that they who are meek and tractable may in a kind manner be restored to the right way, as being objects of pity; but if any be perverse, he is to be corrected with more severity."
3. "When there is a danger of fire, we hesitate not to snatch away violently whom we desire to save; for it would not be enough to beckon with the finger, or kindly to stretch forth the hand."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "And on some (κα ους μεν). Demonstrative plural of ος μεν--ος δε (ους δε, below), not the relative ους, but by contrast (μεν, δε)." 
2. "Have mercy (ελεατε). Present active imperative of ελεαω (rare form in Romans 9:16 also for the usual ελεεω Matthew 9:27). But A C read ελεγχετε, refute, in place of ελεατε. The text of this verse is in much confusion."
3. "Who are in doubt (διακρινομενους). Present middle participle of διακρινω, in the accusative case agreeing with ους μεν, though K L P have the nominative. If the accusative and ελεατε is read, see James 1:6 for the idea (doubters). If ελεγχετε is read, see Jude 1:9 for the idea (disputers)."

### John Gill:
1. "Compassion is to be shown, by praying with them, and for them, with ardency and affection; instructing them in meekness; giving friendly and brotherly reproofs to them; expressing on all occasions a tender concern for their good; doing them all the good that can be done, both for their souls and bodies."
2. "Good reason there is why compassion should be shown them, because God is a God of compassion; Christ is a merciful high priest; a contrary spirit is grieving to the Holy Ghost; saints should consider what they themselves were, and what they now are, and that compassion has been shown to them, and they may want it again."
3. "Making a difference; between one and another; using some more tenderly, others more severely, as the nature and circumstances of their case appear to be."

### John Wesley:
1. "Some, that are wavering in judgment, staggered by others' or by their own evil reasoning, endeavour more deeply to convince of the whole truth as it is in Jesus."
2. "Some snatch, with a swift and strong hand, out of the fire of sin and temptation."
3. "On others show compassion in a milder and gentler way; though still with a jealous fear, lest yourselves be infected with the disease you endeavour to cure. See, therefore, that while you love the sinners, ye retain the utmost abhorrence of their sins, and of any the least degree of, or approach to, them."
