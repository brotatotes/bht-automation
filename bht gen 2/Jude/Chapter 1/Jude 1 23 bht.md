# Jude 23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christians are called to employ various means to save others, using sharp admonitions and severe language, and denouncing God's judgments to stir fear. They are to pull individuals out of the fire, rescuing them from soul-destroying doctrines and sinful desires. The focus is not only on saving souls but also avoiding any contamination from sin while rescuing others. It is crucial to show a strong dislike and resentment towards sin and its influence, excluding those who persist in it from church communion and avoiding close association with them.
