# Jude 23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Heeding the warnings, ministers and Christians should strive to save by using sharp admonitions, denouncing judgments, and inflicting censures. We must avoid contact with sin and loathe it, just as we would avoid a garment spotted with pollution. In our efforts to save sinners, we must be cautious not to be defiled by their sins and shun anything that borders on vice. As believers, it is dishonorable to be associated with anything spotted or tainted with sin during worship or on the Sabbath.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Ministers and Christians are said to 'save' those whom they are made the instruments of saving; the Greek for 'save' is present, therefore meaning 'try to save.'" 
2. "Your compassion is to be accompanied 'with fear' of being at all defiled by them." 
3. "Avoiding the most remote contact with sin, and hating that which borders on it. As garments of the apostles wrought miracles of good in healing, so the very garment of sinners metaphorically, that is, anything brought into contact with their pollution, is to be avoided."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The arguments on which they relied were to be drawn from the dangers of the persons referred to, or from the dread of future wrath."
2. "Every method is to be employed, in its proper place, that we 'by all means may save some.'"
3. "While we endeavor to save the 'sinner,' we cannot too deeply loathe his 'sins;' and in approaching some classes of sinners there is need of as much care to avoid being defiled by them, as there would be to escape the plague if we had any transaction with one who had it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Snatching them out of the fire." The writer has in mind Zechariah 3:2, a brand plucked from the burning.
2. "Compare Amos 4:11."
3. "Spotted [ÎµÏƒÏ€Î¹Î»Ï‰Î¼ÎµÎ½Î¿Î½]. Only here and James 3:6."

### John Calvin:
1. "He would have the faithful not only to beware of contact with vices, but that no contagion might reach them."
2. "He reminds them that everything that borders on vices and is near to them ought to be avoided."
3. "He does not allow evil to be cherished by indulgence, so he bids all preparations and all accessories... to be cut off."

### John Gill:
1. "Even such as these, means should be used to save, if possible, by sharp admonitions and severe language; by denouncing the awful judgments of God, which threaten them; by inflicting on them church censures in a terrible manner; by declaring the terrors of the Lord, and of hell, and of everlasting damnation."
2. "The allusion is not to garments defiled by profluvious persons, or menstruous women, as some think, but to garments spotted with nocturnal pollutions, or through unnatural lusts, which these persons were addicted to."
3. "It was reckoned very dishonourable for religious persons, in the time of divine service, or on a sabbath day, to have on a garment spotted with anything."
