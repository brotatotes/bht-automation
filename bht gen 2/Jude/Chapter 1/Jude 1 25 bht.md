# Jude 25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, it is clear that the word Saviour can appropriately be applied to the Lord Jesus Christ, as He is the only Savior and the one through whom we are reconciled to God. As we look forward to the establishment of His dominion over all the earth, we recognize that God's power and authority are supreme, both now and unto all the ages. Therefore, we should fix our affections and aspirations on Him, acknowledging His majesty and recognizing His power in all things - from creation to redemption to judgment.
