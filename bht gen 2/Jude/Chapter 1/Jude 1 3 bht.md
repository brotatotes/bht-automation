# Jude 3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Beloved, when I purposed to diligently write to you about our common salvation, I found it necessary to exhort you to contend earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints. This faith encompasses the whole scheme of evangelical truths that were delivered by God to Christ and then to the apostles. It is the unalterable doctrine that is to be believed, and it is of utmost importance for all believers to hold fast to it.
