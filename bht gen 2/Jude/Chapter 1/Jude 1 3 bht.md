# Jude 3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Beloved, I am writing to you about our common salvation, the salvation that is shared by all who believe in Christ. Although I originally planned to focus solely on this topic, I felt compelled to address the need to contend earnestly for the faith. This faith encompasses the fundamental truths that we hold dear, and it has been entrusted to us once for all. It is crucial for us to diligently strive to preserve and defend this faith, remaining steadfast in our commitment. Let us hold fast to the common salvation and be strong in our devotion to the faith.
