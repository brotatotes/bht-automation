# Jude 4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the passage, certain men have infiltrated the community who were prophesied about long ago. These individuals distorted the Christian doctrine and indulged in immoral behavior, denying both God and Jesus Christ. They slipped into the community unnoticed, having a hidden agenda to deceive and lead others astray. However, their true nature was eventually revealed, exposing their ungodly ways. God's grace was intended to empower believers to live righteous lives, yet these individuals perverted it, using it as an excuse for immoral behavior.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Crept in, certain men who have been of old written down in prophecy, openly, 'impious, changing the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Master, and our Lord Jesus Christ.'" 
2. "These persons are again brought up and designated; namely, the very men who have been of old written down in prophecy." 
3. "They made the state of grace and Christian liberty into a state of (moral) license and wantonness."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "God‚Äôs eternal character as the Punisher of sin, as set forth in Scripture 'of old,' is the ground on which such apostate characters are ordained to condemnation."
2. "Enoch‚Äôs prophecy comprises the 'ungodly men' of the last days before Christ‚Äôs coming to judgment, as well as their forerunners, the 'ungodly men' before the flood, the type of the last judgment."
3. "Translate as the Greek, 'the only Master'; here used of Jesus Christ, who is at once Master and 'Lord' (a different Greek word)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They professed to teach the Christian religion, when in fact they denied some of its fundamental doctrines; they professed to be holy, when in fact they were living most scandalous lives."
2. "The phrase 'of old' - œÄŒ±ÃÅŒªŒ±Œπ palai - means 'long ago,' implying that a considerable time had elapsed, though without determining how much."
3. "Their doctrines and practice tended as really to the denial of the true God as they did to the denial of the Lord Jesus."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The verb means to get in by the side, to slip in by a side-door."
2. "The meaning is in dispute. It seems better, on the whole, to take it here in the temporal sense, and to render written of beforehand, i.e., in prophecy..."
3. "God is omitted in the best texts."

### John Calvin:
1. "Satan now, he says, attacks and harasses you in a peculiar manner; it is therefore necessary to take up arms to resist him." 
2. "He teaches us that it is an intestine evil; for Satan in this respect also is crafty, as he raises up those who are of the flock to do mischief, in order that they may more easily creep in."
3. "But the grace of God has appeared for a far different purpose, even that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we may live soberly, righteously, and godly in this world."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But when their true character was seen, it was plain that they belonged to a class long before described in many an Old Testament passage."
2. "They came in by a side door; not that they crept in from without, being really no members of the Church; but only that they came in as members, and yet had in fact, as was now clear, sentiments and habits foreign to those of a Christian community, and ought never, therefore, to have entered it at all."
3. "Their character is further defined; they are ungodly men, with whom God‚Äôs holiness is no ground of reverence, nor His law their guide, who, having broken loose from His authority, show their ungodliness in all they do."

### John Gill:
1. "Present rigour and vigilance were necessary to be used."
2. "They are ordained and ordered for many valuable ends."
3. "God's act, and springs from his sovereignty, is agreeably to his justice and holiness; nor is it contrary to his goodness, and is for his glory."

### John Wesley:
1. "There are certain men crept in, who were of old described before ‚Äî Even as early as Enoch; of whom it was foretold, that by their wilful sins they would incur this condemnation."
2. "Turning the grace of God - Revealed in the gospel. Into lasciviousness ‚Äî Into an occasion of more abandoned wickedness."
