# Jude 5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse serves as a reminder of the fate of unbelieving Israel in the wilderness, reminding us to not take the knowledge we have already received for granted. It warns against presuming upon past mercies and highlights the need to walk watchfully in the fear of God. The example of God destroying those who did not believe, despite being saved from Egypt, serves as a clear warning against relying solely on outward privileges and professions. It signifies that God's justice will not let sin go unnoticed, and that we must live in a way that aligns with our calling.
