# Jude 5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is important for ministers to remind people of what they already know because of the tendency to forget and the weakness of some to retain information. Unbelief is a serious matter and God will not overlook it, regardless of outward privileges or professions. Even though God had done great things for the Israelites and delivered them from Egypt, it did not exempt them from destruction. This serves as a warning to not presume on past mercies or assume that one is out of danger.
