# Jude 6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The angels, having abandoned their own dignified habitation, face the consequences of their rebellion. Their earthly pursuit of power led to their fall from grace and subsequent binding in eternal darkness. This narrative alludes to the enigmatic mention of sons of God in the book of Genesis. These fallen beings serve as a warning, having already been cast out of heaven and now confined to the darkness of this present world. These rebellious spirits bear the weight of their own chains, forever enveloped in the darkness they have chosen.

2. "By attempting to rise higher; or by quitting their station and posts of honour, being unwilling to be subject to God, and especially to the Son of God...they were drove out of their native habitation, heaven; they were turned out of it, and cast down to hell."
3. "By these 'everlasting chains' may be meant the power and providence of God over them, which always abide upon them; or their sins, and the guilt of them upon their consciences, under which they are continually held...or the decrees and purposes of God concerning their final punishment and destruction...and from which there is no freeing themselves."

3. "But now he loves them no more; they are doomed to endless destruction. (for if he loved them still, he would love what is sinful:) and both his former love, and his present righteous and eternal displeasure towards the same work of his own hands, are because he changeth not; because he invariably loveth righteousness, and hateth iniquity."
