# Jude 6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The angels, originally assigned a high rank and dignity by the Son of God, chose to forsake their heavenly dwelling out of ambition. As a result, they incurred a severe punishment, being bound in eternal darkness. This serves as a solemn reminder for us to cherish God's grace and avoid following their destructive path. Their fall demonstrates the gravity of their rebellion and the just judgment that awaits them and all who reject God's goodness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Angels, those which kept not their own dignity, but left their own habitation, He hath kept against the judgment of the great day in eternal bonds under darkness."
2. "The fact alluded to is probably that which is obscurely indicated in Genesis 6:2."
3. "There is apparently a difference which we cannot explain, between the description of the rebel angels here and in 2 Peter, and that in the rest of the N. T., where the devil and his angels are said to be powers of the air, and to go about tempting men."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "'Their own' implies that, instead of being content with the dignity once for all assigned to them under the Son of God, they aspired higher."
2. "Even if Greek 'these' [referring to the angels]...their ambition, whereby their affections went away from God and they fell, is in God’s view a sin of like kind spiritually as Sodom’s going away from God’s order of nature after strange flesh."
3. "Their ambitious designs seem to have had a peculiar connection with this earth, of which Satan before his fall may have been God’s vicegerent, whence arises his subsequent connection with it as first the Tempter, then 'the prince of this world'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word rendered 'estate' (ἀρχὴν archēn) is, in the margin, 'principality.' The word properly means, 'beginning, commencement;' and then that which surpasses others, which is 'first,' etc., in point of rank and honor; or pre-eminence, priority, precedence, princedom."
2. "The word rendered 'habitation' (οἰκητήριον oikētērion) occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It means here that heaven was their native abode or dwelling-place. They left it by sin; but the expression here would seem possibly to mean that they became 'dissatisfied' with their abode, and voluntarily preferred to change it for another."
3. "That deep darkness always endures; there is no intermission; no light; it will exist forever."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Jews regarded the angels as having dominion over earthly creatures; and the angels are often spoken of in the New Testament as ajrcai, principalities; as Romans 8:38; Ephesians 1:21; so that this term would be appropriate to designate their dignity, which they forsook." 
2. "Under carries the sense of the darkness brooking over the fallen spirits."
3. "There the Titanian gods, to murky gloom Condemned by will of cloud - collecting Jove, Lie hid in region foul." Theogony, 5, 729.

### John Calvin:
1. "This punishment, inflicted on the inhabitants of heaven, and on such superior ministers of God, ought surely to be constantly before our eyes, so that we may at no time be led to despise God’s grace, and thus rush headlong into destruction."
2. "The word ἀρχὴ in this place, may be aptly taken for beginning as well as for principality or dominion. For Jude intimates that they suffered punishment, because they had despised the goodness of God and deserted their first vocation."
3. "We must also notice the atrocity of the punishment which the Apostle mentions. They are not only free spirits but celestial powers; they are now held bound by perpetual chains. They not only enjoyed the glorious light of God, but his brightness shone forth in them, so that from them, as by rays, it spread over all parts of the universe; now they are sunk in darkness."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "And angels (αγγελους δε)...Kept not (μη τηρησαντας)."
2. "Principality (αρχην)...Both Enoch and Philo (and Milton) discuss the fallen angels."
3. "But left (αλλα απολιποντας)...Their own proper habitation (το ιδιον οικητηριον)."

### John Gill:
1. "And the angels which kept not their first estate... stood in the relation of sons to God, and were, for the lustre of their nature, comparable to the morning stars; they were among the thrones, dominions, principalities, and powers." 
2. "they were drove out of their native habitation, heaven; they were turned out of it, and cast down to hell."
3. "the future and last 'judgment' of men and devils, which is certain, and will be universal, and executed with the strictest justice."

### John Wesley:
1. "And the angels, who kept not their first dignity — Once assigned them under the Son of God. But voluntarily left their own habitation - Then properly their own, by the free gift of God."
2. "He reserved — Delivered to be kept.In everlasting chains under darkness — O how unlike their own habitation!"
3. "When these fallen angels came out of the hands of God, they were holy; else God made that which was evil: and being holy, they were beloved of God; else he hated the image of his own spotless purity. But now he loves them no more; they are doomed to endless destruction."
