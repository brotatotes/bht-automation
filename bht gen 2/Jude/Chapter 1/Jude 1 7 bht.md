# Jude 7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The cities of Sodom and Gomorrah are presented as a cautionary tale, their sins of sexual immorality and perversion serving as a warning to all. Their actions went beyond the natural order, pursuing forbidden desires and departing from God's design. The punishment they received, as evidenced by the everlasting marks of fire that consumed them, serves as a striking symbol of the eternal fire that awaits those who persist in ungodliness. Through the example of Sodom and Gomorrah, we are reminded that God's punishment is just and without exception, regardless of our station or status.
