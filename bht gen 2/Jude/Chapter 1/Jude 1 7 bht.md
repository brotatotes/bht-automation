# Jude 7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The cities of Sodom and Gomorrha, along with the surrounding cities, are cited as an example of the severe punishment for giving themselves over to unnatural lusts and pursuing other flesh. Their fate serves as a warning to all, illustrating that God punishes the ungodly without exception. The destruction they faced through fire is a type of the eternal fire that signifies the intensity and severity of future punishment. This serves as a demonstration that God will indeed judge and penalize sin, even to the point of eternal consequences.
