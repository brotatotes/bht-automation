### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "Their speaking evil of dignities is because they are dreaming, and know not what they are speaking evil of."
3. "As a man dreaming seems to himself to be seeing and nearing many things, so the natural man's lusts are agitated by joy, distress, fear, and the other passions. But he is a stranger to self-command."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "Their doctrines were the fruits of mere imagination, foolish vagaries and fancies."

### Marvin Vincent:
