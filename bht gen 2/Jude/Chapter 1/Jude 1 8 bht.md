# Jude 8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These individuals, trapped in their perpetual state of dreaming, defile themselves and others through their sinful actions. Their disregard for authority and their contemptuous words towards those in positions of power reveal their rebellious nature. Their false teachings are the product of their foolish imaginations and they lead others astray with their distorted doctrines. Their behaviors not only harm themselves but also disrupt the unity of the church and pose a threat to the stability of society. These dreamers embody the dangerous combination of spiritual ignorance and moral corruption, bringing about their own destruction.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "These men in their dreams defile the flesh and despise lordship and speak evil of glories." 
2. "That state of dreaming in the sleep of sin, out of which men are so often called on to awake to righteousness and the light of Christ."
3. "The words should represent that state of dreaming in the sleep of sin, out of which men are so often called on to awake to righteousness and the light of Christ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The clause, 'these men dreaming' (that is, in their dreams), belongs to all the verbs, 'defile,' 'despise,' and 'speak evil.' All sinners are spiritually asleep, and their carnal activity is as it were a dream."
2. "Their speaking evil of dignities is because they are dreaming, and know not what they are speaking evil of."
3. "As a man dreaming seems to himself to be seeing and nearing many things, so the natural man's lusts are agitated by joy, distress, fear, and the other passions. But he is a stranger to self-command."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "What the apostle says is, that their character resembled that of the inhabitants of Sodom; the example which he adduces of the punishment which was brought on those sinners, leaves it to be clearly inferred that the persons of whom he was speaking would be punished in a similar manner."
2. "Their doctrines were the fruits of mere imagination, foolish vagaries and fancies."
3. "Pollute themselves; give indulgence to corrupt passions and appetites."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Though they have these fearful examples before them, yet they persist in their sin." 
2. "Some explain this passage and the one in Peter, of evil angels." 
3. "In Colossians the term is used with thrones, principalities, and powers, with reference to the orders of the celestial hierarchy as conceived by Gnostic teachers, and with a view to exalt Christ above all these."

### John Calvin:
1. "He only shews that they were vessels of wrath appointed to destruction, and that they could not escape the hand of God, but that he would some time or another make them examples of his vengeance."
2. "He intimates that they were so dull and stupid as to give up themselves without any shame to every kind of baseness."
3. "It appears from the second clause that they were seditious men, who sought anarchy, that, being loosed from the fear of the laws, they might sin more freely."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In their dreamings they defile the flesh, that of others as well as their own; they live in the feelings of their own perverted sense, and they corrupt others as well as themselves."
2. "They set at nought lordship, ownership, dominion, and rail at dignities, the splendour that belongs to those who are exalted."
3. "Licentiousness is closely connected with contempt for all authority: no other vice, indeed, so easily demoralizes the entire nature."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In their dreamings...defile with sin." 
2. "Both Œ∫œÖœÅŒπŒøœÑŒ∑œÇ (dominion) and Œ¥ŒøŒæŒ± (dignities) occur in 2 Peter 2:10."

### John Gill:
1. "False doctrines are dreams, and the teachers of them dreamers."
2. "Unclean practices follow upon erroneous principles."
3. "False teachers are injurious to themselves, disturbers of churches, and pernicious to civil government."

### John Wesley:
1. "In like manner these dreamers ‚Äî Sleeping and dreaming all their lives."
2. "Despise authority ‚Äî Those that are invested with it by Christ, and made by him the overseers of his flock."
3. "Rail at dignities ‚Äî The apostle does not seem to speak of worldly dignities. These they had 'in admiration for the sake of gain,' Jude 1:16; but those holy men, who for the purity of their lives, the soundness of their doctrine, and the greatness of their labours in the work of the ministry, were truly honourable before God and all good men."
