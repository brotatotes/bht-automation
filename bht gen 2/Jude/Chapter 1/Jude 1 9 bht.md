# Jude 9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the account of Michael the archangel contending with the devil over the body of Moses, we see a display of restraint and humility. This incident is presented as a matter of fact rather than as a personal attack. Michael, whose name means Who is like God?, is one of the seven archangels and is regarded as the special protector of the Hebrew nation. Instead of bringing an evil accusation against the devil, Michael simply said, The Lord rebuke you. This serves as a reminder to avoid engaging in harsh judgments and to trust in the Lord to handle contentious situations.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed concerning the body of Moses, dared not bring against him a judgment of evil speaking, but said, The Lord rebuke thee."
2. "The source of the tradition to which St. Jude here refers as familiar to his readers, is not known with any certainty."
3. "That the incident is related as matter of fact, and not as an 'argumentum ad hominem,' is evident by the very form of it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Nowhere in Scripture is the plural used, 'archangels'; but only ONE, 'archangel.' The only other passage in the New Testament where it occurs, is  :-, where Christ is distinguished from the archangel, with whose voice He shall descend to raise the dead; they therefore err who confound Christ with Michael." 
2. "That Moses' body was raised, appears from his presence with Elijah and Jesus (who were in the body) at the Transfiguration: the sample and earnest of the coming resurrection kingdom, to be ushered in by Michael's standing up for God's people." 
3. "Israel's, and all believers' full justification, and the accuser's being rebuked finally, is yet future."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The only material question then is, whether it is 'true.' And who can prove that it is not? What evidence is there that it is not? How is it possible to demonstrate that it is not?"
2. "Who can prove that such spirits never meet, never come in conflict, never encounter each other in executing their purposes? Good men meet bad men, and why is it any more absurd to suppose that good angels may encounter bad ones?"
3. "He disputed - Œ¥ŒπŒ±ŒªŒµÃÅŒ≥ŒøŒºŒ±Œπ dialegomai. 'This' word also would denote merely a controversy or contention of words... in which Michael, though provoked by the opposition of the worst being in the universe, still restrained himself from any outbreaking of passion, and used only the language of mild but firm rebuke."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "This reference to Michael was said by Origen to be founded on a Jewish work called 'The Assumption of Moses,' the first part of which was lately found in an old Latin translation at Milan; and this is the view of Davidson, so far at least as the words 'the Lord rebuke thee' are concerned."
2. "Angels are described in scripture as forming a society with different orders and dignities. This conception is developed in the books written during and after the exile, especially Daniel and Zechariah."
3. "Michael (Who is like God ?) is one of the seven archangels, and was regarded as the special protector of the Hebrew nation. He is mentioned three times in the Old Testament (Daniel 10:13, Daniel 10:21; Daniel 12:1), and twice in the New Testament (Jude 1:9; Revelation 12:7)."

### John Calvin:
1. "Angels, far more excellent than men, dare not bring forward a railing judgment." 
2. "Satan almost in all ages has been endeavoring to make the bodies of God‚Äôs saints idols to foolish men."
3. "Michael dared not to speak more severely against Satan (though a reprobate and condemned) than to deliver him to God to be restrained; but those men hesitated not to load with extreme reproaches the powers which God had adorned with peculiar honors."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They do against dignities what even the archangel would not do against Satan."
2. "The most probable explanation is that there was a Jewish tradition to which Jude appeals."
3. "The solution that God revealed these facts to Jude is of course possible, but it is not likely."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Michael is mentioned also in Daniel 10:13; Daniel 10:21; Daniel 12:1; Revelation 12:7."
2. "Present middle participle of Œ¥ŒπŒ±Œ∫œÅŒπŒΩœâ, to separate, to strive with as in Acts 11:2."
3. "These words occur in Zechariah 3:1-10 where the angel of the Lord replies to the charges of Satan."

### John Gill:
1. "By whom is meant, not a created angel, but an eternal one, the Lord Jesus Christ."
2. "Christ's conduct towards him, when tempted by him in the wilderness, and when in his agony with him in the garden, and amidst all his reproaches and sufferings on the cross."

### John Wesley:
1. "Yet Michael...acknowledged as such by them to whom he wrote."
2. "Concerning the body of Moses...which God for wise reasons had concealed."
3. "Durst not bring even against him a railing accusation...The Lord rebuke thee - I leave thee to the Judge of all."
