# Jude 9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Michael, the archangel mentioned in Jude, is said to have contended with the devil over the body of Moses. While some consider this story to be a Jewish fable, it was a prevalent tradition during Jude's time. Whether the story is true or not, it serves as a reminder that even the most superior beings, like angels, would not dare to bring a railing judgment against the devil. Instead, Michael chose to defer to the Lord, saying, The Lord rebuke thee. This highlights the humility and reverence that even the most powerful beings have towards God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Michael the archangel... when contending with the devil he disputed concerning the body of Moses, dared not bring against him a judgment of evil speaking, but said, The Lord rebuke thee."
2. "The source of the tradition to which St. Jude here refers as familiar to his readers is not known with any certainty... No such tradition is found in any apocryphal or rabbinical book now extant."
3. "The incident is related as a matter of fact, and not as an 'argumentum ad hominem.' That, being thus related as matter of fact, it is matter of fact, is a conclusion which will or will not be made, according as we are or are not persuaded of the authenticity of our Epistle as a part of canonical Scripture."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The name [Michael] means, Who is like God?"
2. "Thus in each dispensation a sample and pledge of the future resurrection was given: Enoch in the patriarchal dispensation, Moses in the Levitical, Elijah in the prophetical."
3. "As Satan accuses alike the Church collectively and 'the brethren' individually, so Christ pleads for us as our Advocate."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The difficulty has arisen from these two circumstances: (2)The improbability of the story itself, which looks like a mere Jewish fable."
2. "The sum of the matter, then, it seems to me is, that Jude has, as Paul did on another occasion, adopted a tradition which was prevalent in his time; that there is nothing necessarily absurd or impossible in the fact affirmed by the tradition, and that no one can possibly demonstrate that it is not true."
3. "The language is the same as that recorded in Zechariah 3:2, as used by 'the angel' respecting Satan."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "This reference to Michael was said by Origen to be founded on a Jewish work called 'The Assumption of Moses,' the first part of which was lately found in an old Latin translation at Milan."
2. "Angels are described in scripture as forming a society with different orders and dignities... Michael (Who is like God ?) is one of the seven archangels, and was regarded as the special protector of the Hebrew nation."
3. "A railing accusation (krisin blasfhmiav). Lit., a judgment of railing; a sentence savoring of impugning his dignity. Michael remembered the high estate from which he fell, and left his sentence to God."

### John Calvin:
1. "Peter gives this argument shorter, and states generally, that angels, far more excellent than men, dare not bring forward a railing judgment." 
2. "It is beyond controversy that Moses was buried by the Lord, that is, that his grave was concealed according to the known purpose of God."
3. "And doubtless we see that Satan almost in all ages has been endeavoring to make the bodies of Godâ€™s saints idols to foolish men."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They do against dignities what even the archangel would not do against Satan."
2. "The most probable explanation is that there was a Jewish tradition to which Jude appeals."
3. "The solution that God revealed these facts to Jude is of course possible, but it is not likely."

### John Gill:
1. "By whom is meant, not a created angel, but an eternal one, the Lord Jesus Christ; as appears from his name Michael, which signifies, 'who is as God': and who is as God, or like unto him, but the Son of God, who is equal with God?"
2. "But this is to be understood figuratively; and reference is had to the history in Zechariah 3:1."
3. "And now the argument is from the greater to the lesser, that if Christ, the Prince of angels, did not choose to give a railing word to the devil, who is so much inferior to him, and when there was so much reason and occasion for it; then how great is the insolence of these men, that speak evil of civil and ecclesiastical rulers, without any just cause at all?"

### John Wesley:
1. "Yet Michael â€” It does not appear whether St. Jude learned this by any revelation or from ancient tradition."
2. "Concerning the body of Moses â€” Possibly the devil would have discovered the place where it was buried, which God for wise reasons had concealed."
3. "Durst not bring even against him a railing accusation â€” Though so far beneath him in every respect. But simply said, (so great was his modesty!) The Lord rebuke thee - I leave thee to the Judge of all."
