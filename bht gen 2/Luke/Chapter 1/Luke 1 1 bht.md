# Luke 1:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The account of the birth, life, actions, doctrines, miracles, sufferings, death, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus Christ was undertaken by honest and well-meaning Christians who were firmly believed and confidently assured of these things. They drew from the teachings of the apostles and first ministers of the Gospel, as well as from their own conversations. Luke, inspired by the Spirit of God, was moved to write this narrative and completed it under the same divine influence.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "That such narratives should not have come down to us, is no matter of surprise."
2. "It is probable that in almost every Church where an eye-witness preached, his testimony would be taken down, and framed into some διήγησις, more or less complete, of the life and sayings of the Lord."
3. "This does not necessarily imply the insufficiency of such διηγήσεις, as Orig, Ambr, Theophyl., &c. have imagined."
4. "Nor is any such failure implied (as Bp. Wordsw.) in Acts 19:13, where the aorist also is used."
5. "The fact of that failure is indeed implied in Luke’s description of his own work but that, more because it possessed completeness (whereas they were fragmentary) than from any difference in kind."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 1. set forth in order—more
	simply, to draw up a narrative.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "His doctrines were original, bold, pure, and authoritative. His miracles had been extraordinary, clear, and awful. His life and death had been peculiar."
2. "It is not improbable - indeed it is highly probable that such broken accounts and narratives of detached facts would be preserved."
3. "His were to be regular and full."
4. "To compose a narrative."
5. "A narrative - an account of."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A difficult undertaking...implies that previous attempts have not been successful." 
2. "To set forth in order...draw up...something which leads the reader through the mass of facts."
3. "Many took in hand to draw up, not narratives, but a narrative, embracing the whole of the evangelic matter."
4. "Most surely believed...to bring full measure; to fulfill...these events happened in accordance with a preconceived design."
5. "Among us...who were eye witnesses and ministers."

### John Calvin:
1. "Luke adopted a conscientious and prudent course...for preserving the doctrine of godliness pure and uncontaminated from every corruption."
2. "God had a wonderful design in view of obtaining, by universal consent, the rejection of others, and thus securing undivided credit to those which reflect brightly his adorable majesty."
3. "He destroys the credit of others who give contrary statements...by claiming for himself the authority of a faithful witness."
4. "If the Word of God does not hold the first rank, faith will not be satisfied with any human testimonies."
5. "Luke’s meaning is this: 'that, since thou now hast those things committed faithfully to writing which thou hadst formerly learned by oral statements, thou mayest place a stronger reliance on the received doctrine.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Forasmuch as, a good translation of the full sounding Greek word (found only here in the N. T.)."

2. "Many such were doubtless in existence then, but being more or less fragmentary would not be preserved."

3. "Luke felt their labors to be insufficient not from incorrectness, but from the fragmentary character of their narratives."

4. "Not mere sayings, but sketches which aimed at completeness and order."

5. "The great facts of the life of Christ formed the substance of preaching in the Apostolic times."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Forasmuch as (επειδηπερ). Here alone in the N.T., though common in literary Attic."

2. "We know that Luke used the Logia of Jesus written by Matthew in Aramaic and Mark's Gospel. Undoubtedly he had other written sources."

3. "Luke does not mean to cast reflection on those who preceded him. Luke had secured fuller information and planned a book on a larger scale and did surpass them with the result that they all perished save Mark's Gospel and what Matthew and Luke possess of the Logia of Jesus."

4. "Luke means to say that those before him had made attempts to rehearse in orderly fashion various matters about Christ. 'The expression points to a connected series of narratives in some order (ταξις), topical or chronological rather than to isolated narratives' (Bruce). 'They had produced something more than mere notes or anecdotes' (Plummer)."

5. "Luke may refer to the matters connected with Christ's life which have been brought to a close among us or accomplished. Bruce argues plausibly that he means fulness of knowledge 'concerning the things which have become widely known among us Christians.' In modern Greek the verb means to inform. The careful language of Luke here really pays a tribute to those who had preceded him in their narratives concerning Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "They undertook to write and publish a very particular and exact narrative of the birth, life, actions, doctrines, miracles, sufferings, death, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus Christ."
2. "Things which Luke, and other Christians, had the fullest and strongest evidence, and were confidently assured of, and most firmly believed, even with a full assurance of faith."
3. "He seems to design some honest and well-meaning Christians, who undertook to write, and did write an account of the above things, which were firmly believed by all."
4. "And which they took from the apostles, and first ministers of the Gospel, from their sermons and discourses, and from conversation with them."
5. "The evangelist, moved and inspired by the Spirit of God, set about the following work, and under the same influence completed it."
