# Luke 1:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Luke acknowledges the efforts of those who came before him, recognizing their sincere intentions to write a comprehensive and accurate account of the life, teachings, miracles, sufferings, death, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus Christ. These individuals, who were well-meaning Christians and likely learned from the apostles themselves, diligently gathered information from sermons, discourses, and conversations. Although their narratives may have had their shortcomings, they were motivated by their firm belief in the truth of the events surrounding Jesus' life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "That such narratives should not have come down to us, is no matter of surprise: for (1) they would be absorbed by the more complete and sanctioned accounts of our present Evangelists; and (2) Church tradition has preserved very few fragments of authentic information of the apostolic age."
2. "The fact of that failure is indeed implied in Luke’s description of his own work but that, more because it possessed completeness (whereas they were fragmentary) than from any difference in kind."
3. "The use of the cognate noun πληροφορία supports this view: see 1 Thessalonians 1:5 ; Hebrews 6:11 . There does not appear to be any reference to the filling of the sails of a ship, as Bp. Wordsw. The word with its cognates occurs only in a figurative sense, derived from 'filling full' without any special reference."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 1. set forth in order—more
	simply, to draw up a narrative.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is clear, therefore, that other writings are meant than the gospels which we now have, but what they were is a matter of conjecture."
2. "His doctrines were original, bold, pure, and authoritative. His miracles had been extraordinary, clear, and awful. His life and death had been peculiar; and it is not improbable - indeed it is highly probable that such broken accounts and narratives of detached facts would be preserved."
3. "His were to be regular and full. Taken in hand - Undertaken, attempted. To set forth in order - To compose a narrative."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word carries the sense of a difficult undertaking (see Acts 19:13), and implies that previous attempts have not been successful."
2. "A declaration, embracing the whole of the evangelic matter. The word was particularly applied to a medical treatise."
3. "Render as Rev., have been fulfilled. The word is chosen to indicate that these events happened in accordance with a preconceived design."

### John Calvin:
1. "Luke dedicates his Gospel to Theophilus, that he might undertake the faithful preservation of it."
2. "He modestly denies their title to full and unshaken confidence."
3. "Luke’s meaning is this: 'that, since thou now hast those things committed faithfully to writing which thou hadst formerly learned by oral statements, thou mayest place a stronger reliance on the received doctrine.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Forasmuch as, a good translation of the full sounding Greek word (found only here in the N. T.)."
2. "To draw up a narrative, etc. Not mere sayings, but sketches which aimed at completeness and order."
3. "The facts were both established and accepted, since in an age when writing was not so common as now, many undertook to arrange these facts in a written narrative."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Luke means to say that those before him had made attempts to rehearse in orderly fashion various matters about Christ. 'The expression points to a connected series of narratives in some order (ταξις), topical or chronological rather than to isolated narratives'." 
2. "They had produced something more than mere notes or anecdotes." 
3. "Luke may refer to the matters connected with Christ's life which have been brought to a close among us or accomplished... Luke here really pays a tribute to those who had preceded him in their narratives concerning Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "They undertook to write and publish a very particular and exact narrative of the birth, life, actions, doctrines, miracles, sufferings, death, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus Christ."
2. "He seems to design some honest and well-meaning Christians, who undertook to write, and did write an account of the above things, which were firmly believed by all; and which they took from the apostles, and first ministers of the Gospel, from their sermons and discourses, and from conversation with them."
3. "No doubt, they acted an upright part, though attended with weakness."
