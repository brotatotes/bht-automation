# Luke 1:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people were praying outside, at the time of the incense, symbolizing the acceptableness of their prayers like the fragrant offering on the altar. Prayer is often compared to incense, and this may be why incense was used as a reminder of the sacrifice to come. Just as incense accompanies the prayers of the saints, our prayers are lifted up to God, a sweet-smelling savor before His throne.
