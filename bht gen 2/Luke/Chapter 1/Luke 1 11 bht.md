# Luke 1:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, an angelic appearance takes place at the altar of incense, separate from the large altar of burnt-offering. The angel, identified as Gabriel, is a messenger sent from God, just as he appeared to Daniel in the past to announce the coming of the Messiah. The presence of the angel at the temple, especially during a time of corruption, suggests the significance of this event. Despite attempts to explain it away, we must recognize the reality of this angelic manifestation, which holds a profound message for all.
