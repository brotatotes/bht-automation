# Luke 1:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The prayers of the righteous are heard and accepted by God. Even when it may seem hopeless, we should patiently wait for the Lord to answer in His perfect timing and manner. The name John carries the meaning of the grace or favor of Jehovah, fitting for someone who was favored by God and bestowed with abundant grace. As John opened the way to the glorious dispensation of grace in the Messiah's kingdom, we should trust in the grace of God to guide us in our own journey of faith.
