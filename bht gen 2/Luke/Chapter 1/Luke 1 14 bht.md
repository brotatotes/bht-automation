# Luke 1:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Many will rejoice at the birth of this son, for he will be the prophet of the Highest, going before the Lord to prepare His ways, bringing knowledge of salvation and light to those in darkness. This joy and gladness, as foretold by the angel, would be fulfilled in the words of Zacharias' song and witnessed by the neighbors and relatives. It is not just those who are familiar with him, but all who come to know of him as a prophet and the forerunner of the Messiah who will rejoice.
