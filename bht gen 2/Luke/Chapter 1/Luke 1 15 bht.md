# Luke 1:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
John was chosen by God for a remarkable purpose and would be esteemed highly in the Lord's eyes. He would be set apart like the Nazarites, abstaining from wine and strong drink, symbolizing his dedication and holiness. Even from his mother's womb, John's life would be marked by the extraordinary gifts and graces of the Holy Spirit, equipping him for his divine calling. His greatness would not be measured by worldly standards, but by the gifts and grace bestowed upon him by God.
