# Luke 1:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The role of John the Baptist was to go before Christ, much like Elijah, in the spirit and power of Elijah. John exhibited the same integrity, courage, austerity, and fervor. He was an instrument used by God to reconcile those who were at odds, turning the hearts of fathers to their children and bringing an end to bitter quarrels. Furthermore, John aimed to lead the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, calling sinners to true wisdom found only in righteousness before God.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The connection here leads us to suppose that the word 'him' refers to the 'Lord their God' in the previous verse. If so, then it will follow that the Messiah was the Lord God of Israel - a character abundantly given him in other parts of the New Testament."
2. "John came that he might allay these animosities and produce better feeling. By directing them all to 'one Master,' the Messiah, he would divert their attention from the causes of their difference and bring them to union."
3. "To make ready a people ... - To prepare them for his coming by announcing that the Messiah was about to appear, and by calling them to repentance. God has always required people to be pure in a special manner when he was about to appear among them."
