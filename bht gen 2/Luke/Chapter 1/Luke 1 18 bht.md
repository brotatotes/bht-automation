# Luke 1:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Zacharias, unlike Mary, doubted the truth of the announcement, seeking a sign for proof. In contrast, Mary did not doubt the fact but merely wanted to understand how it would happen. Zacharias questioned in a spirit of disbelief, while Mary's inquiry was out of curiosity.
