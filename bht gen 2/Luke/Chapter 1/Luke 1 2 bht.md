# Luke 1:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The birth, life, and death of Christ were faithfully handed down by the twelve apostles and seventy disciples, who were eyewitnesses of his incarnation, ministry, miracles, resurrection, and ascension. They not only saw and conversed with him themselves, but also entrusted these accounts to others, ensuring the authenticity and reliability of their message. Luke had access to both oral and written sources, accurately compiling these accounts in his Gospel. The ministers of the word, like the apostles and disciples, continue to proclaim this gospel message today.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Apostles, &c., delivered these matters orally to the Churches in their teaching and others drew up accounts from that catechetical instruction."
2. "He cannot therefore have seen (or, having seen, not recognized as such, which is highly improbable) the Gospel of Matthew."
3. "The word, 'the word preached: ' so that ὑπηρέτης τ . λόγ . = διάκονος τ . λόγ . Acts 6:4."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "From the beginning - From the commencement of these things - that is, from the birth of John, or perhaps from the beginning of the ministry of Jesus."
2. "Eye-witnesses - Who had seen those things themselves, and who were therefore proper witnesses."
3. "Ministers of the word - The term 'word' here means the 'gospel.' Luke never uses it, as John does, to denote the second Person of the Trinity."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Even as. Referring to the composition of the narrative. Delivered [παρεδοσαν] . Not necessarily excluding written traditions, but referring mainly to oral tradition."
2. "Eye witnesses [αυτοπται] . Only here in New Testament. Peter uses another word, ejpoptai (2 Peter 1:16). Frequent in medical writers, of a personal examination of disease or of the parts of the body. Compare the modern medical term autopsy."
3. "Ministers [υπηρεται] . See on Matthew 5:25. In medical language denoting the attendants or assistants of the principal physician."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They delivered them, or, ‘handed them down.’ The oral instruction of the Apostles is here referred to. From this (see Luke 1:4) the written accounts of the ‘many ‘were drawn up. Oral tradition came first, but this preface plainly implies its insufficiency."
2. "From the beginning, i.e., from the baptism of John (see Mark 1:1; Acts 1:21; John 15:27)."
3. "Eye-witnesses. The Apostles, perhaps the Seventy also. This implies that Luke was not a disciple during the lifetime of our Lord."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Luke means to say that the handing down was dependable, not mere wives' fables."
2. "Luke had access to both kinds [written and oral sources]."
3. "The word for 'ministers' ('υπηρετα), under rowers or servants...In the sense of a preacher of the gospel as here, it occurs also in Acts 26:16."

### John Gill:
1. "The twelve apostles, and seventy disciples handed down to others the accounts of the birth, life, and death of Christ."
2. "They were eyewitnesses of him, of the truth of his incarnation, and of his ministry and miracles."
3. "They saw, and conversed with him after his resurrection from the dead and beheld his ascension to heaven."
