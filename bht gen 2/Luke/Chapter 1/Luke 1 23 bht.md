# Luke 1:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The priest faithfully served in his ministration, dedicating himself to the work of God and remaining in service until his time of duty ended. Even though he faced physical challenges of deafness and dumbness, it did not prevent him from carrying out his priestly responsibilities. The duty of priests was to serve the people, just as they carried out their public service for the worship of God. After he had fulfilled his priestly duties, he returned to his own house, having faithfully discharged his responsibilities.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The week during which his course was on duty."
2. "A deaf and dumb person, we thus see, was not precluded from some of the sacerdotal ministrations."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "His piety prompted him to remain there in the service of God."
2. "It is the duty of ministers of religion to remain at their work until they are unfitted for it, and unable to serve God in their profession."
3. "But until that time, he that for trifling causes forsakes his post is guilty of unfaithfulness to his Master."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Ministration [λειτουργιας] . From leitov, belonging to the people, public, and ergon, a work. Hence service of the state in a public office."
2. "Trench observes that 'when the Christian Church was forming its terminology, which it did partly by shaping new words, and partly by elevating old ones to higher than their previous uses, of the latter it more readily adopted those before employed in civil and political life, than such as had played their part in religious matters.'"
3. "Hence it adopted this word, already in use in the Septuagint, as the constant word for performing priestly and ministerial functions; and so in the New Testament of the ministry of the apostles, prophets, and teachers."

### John Calvin:
1. "We are told that, when the time of his office had expired, Zacharias returned home. Hence we conclude that, so long as the priests were attending in their turns, they did not enter their own houses, that they might be entirely devoted and attached to the worship of God."
2. "It was proper also to withdraw every means of gratification, that they might devote themselves more unreservedly to their office."
3. "The full solution of the difficulty depends on the distinction between the law and the gospel. A priest stood in the presence of God, to expiate the sins of the people, to be, as it were, a mediator between God and men. He who sustained that character ought to have had something peculiar about him, that he might be distinguished from the common rank of men, and recognised as a figure of the true Mediator."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He continued to serve until the week of service expired."
2. "He did not feel himself absolved from his duty by his affliction."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Ministration...A common word in ancient Greek for public service, work for the people." 
2. "The service of the Egyptian priesthood as we see it in the LXX of Hebrew priests."
3. "Ministration...see also Hebrews 8:6; Hebrews 9:21; 2 Corinthians 9:12; Philippians 2:17; Philippians 2:30."

### John Gill:
1. "Deafness and dumbness excused persons from various duties but did not disqualify priests."
2. "Such was the work of the priests, that though deaf and dumb, they could discharge it; as cleansing the altar, trimming the lamps, carrying the parts to the altar, laying them upon it, and burning them, or offering any sacrifice."
3. "When he had fulfilled [his duties], he departed to his own house."
