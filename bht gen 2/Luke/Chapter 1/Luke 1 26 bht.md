# Luke 1:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the sixth month after Elisabeth's conception, the angel Gabriel, who had previously appeared to Zacharias, was sent by God as a messenger to Mary. This is significant because it shows that the divine timing and orchestration behind the birth of Jesus, as well as the preparation for His coming, were meticulously planned. It demonstrates how God used His heavenly messengers to communicate His will and reveal His divine purposes. The appearance of the angel to Mary in the sixth month indicates the progression and fulfillment of God's unfolding plan for the arrival of His Son.
