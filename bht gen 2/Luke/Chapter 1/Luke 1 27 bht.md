# Luke 1:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The mention of a pure virgin betrothed reminds us of the Jewish custom where marriage contracts were made before witnesses. It was important that the child to be born was of a pure virgin, so the wisdom of God orchestrated the union to be of one who was already betrothed. Interestingly, both the woman and her husband were from the esteemed lineage of David. Despite residing in the humble town of Nazareth in Galilee, it was decided that the child would have a reputed father, to avoid any potential reproach.
