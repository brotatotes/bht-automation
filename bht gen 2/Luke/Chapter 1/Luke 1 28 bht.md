# Luke 1:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Hail, thou highly favoured; the Lord is with thee; blessed art thou among women. This greeting to Mary not only acknowledges her favor and blessing, but also carries echoes of previous encounters where individuals were highly favored by God. This salutation links Mary's experience to the post-resurrection encounter with the women, as well as to the favor bestowed upon Noah, Moses, David, Gideon, and Jael throughout biblical history. It becomes evident that Mary's honor is not unique, but rather an extension of God's grace and favor upon chosen individuals throughout time.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "κεχαριτωμ  ., not ‘  gratiâ plena ,’ as the Vulg.; for, though χαριτόω is not found in classical writers, the analogy of all verbs in - όω must rule it to mean, the passing on of the action implied in the radical substantive to the object of the verb the ‘  conferring of grace or favour, upon .’"
2. "Thl. explains it as corresponding to εὗρες χάριν παρὰ τῷ θεῷ , Luke 1:30 : τοῦτο γάρ ἐστιν τὸ κεχαριτῶσθαι , τὸ εὑρεῖν χάριν παρὰ τῷ θεῷ ."
3. "ὁ κύρ  .   μετὰ σοῦ ] i.e. ἐστίν : see ref."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "highly favoured—a word only once used elsewhere (Ephesians 1:6, 'made accepted'): compare Ephesians 1:6- :, 'Thou hast found favour with God.'"
2. "The mistake of the Vulgate's rendering, 'full of grace,' has been taken abundant advantage of by the Romish Church."
3. "As the mother of our Lord, she was the most 'blessed among women' in external distinction; but let them listen to the Lord's own words. 'Nay, rather blessed are they that hear the word of God and keep it.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Hail - This word of salutation is equivalent to 'Peace be with thee,' or 'Joy be with thee;' a form of speech implying that she was signally favored, and expressing joy at meeting her."
2. "Highly favoured - By being the mother of the long-expected Messiah - the mother of the Redeemer of mankind. Long had he been predicted; long had the eyes of the nation been turned to him, and long had his coming been an object of intense desire."
3. "Blessed art thou among women - This passage is equivalent to saying 'thou art the most happy of women.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Thou that art highly favored [κεχαριτωμενη] . Lit., as Rev. in margin, endued with grace."
2. "The rendering full of grace, Vulgate, Wyc., and Tynd., is therefore wrong."
3. "Cast in her mind [διελογιζετο] . See on James 2:4. The imperfect tense, 'began to reason.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "A conviction of the Divine goodness is the entrance of faith, and the angel properly observes this order, that, after preparing the heart of the virgin by meditation on the grace of God, he may enlarge it to receive an incomprehensible mystery."
2. "To those on whom he has once bestowed his love God shows himself gracious and kind, follows and 'crowns them with loving-kindness.'"
3. "But if Mary’s happiness, righteousness, and life, flow from the undeserved love of God, if her virtues and all her excellence are nothing more than the Divine kindness, it is the height of absurdity to tell us that we should seek from her what she derives from another quarter in the same manner as ourselves."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To refer it to any human being, makes sheer non-sense of the account."
2. "She is here presented ‘not as the mother of grace, but as the daughter of grace.’"
3. "The Lord is with thee. This might mean’s ‘The Lord be with thee;’ an angelic benediction. But it is more probably a declaration of the Divine presence and blessing as already with her."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Highly favoured (κεχαριτωμενη). Perfect passive participle of χαριτοω and means endowed with grace (χαρις), enriched with grace as in Ephesians 1:6, non ut mater gratiae, sed ut filia gratiae (Bengel)."
2. "The Vulgate gratiae plena 'is right, if it means 'full of grace which thou hast received'; wrong, if it means 'full of grace which thou hast to bestow' (Plummer)."
3. "The oldest MSS. do not have 'Blessed art thou among women' here, but in verse Luke 1:42."

### John Gill:
1. "thou art highly favoured; or graciously accepted, or hast obtained grace..."
2. "to that special and particular favour, in being chosen and singled out from all other women, to be the mother of the Messiah..."
3. "thou art blessed among women; and will be pronounced so by other women..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Hail, thou highly favoured; the Lord is with thee; blessed art thou among women" - Hail is the salutation used by our Lord to the women after his resurrection.
2. "Thou art highly favoured, or hast found favour with God, Luke 1:30, is no more than was said of Noah, Moses, and David."
3. "The Lord is with thee, was said to Gideon, Judges 6:12; and blessed shall she be above women, of Jael, Judges 5:24."
