# Luke 1:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
St. Luke, moved by the Holy Ghost, meticulously sought knowledge and carefully researched all the events of Christ's life. He aimed to construct his own history from reliable sources, desiring to provide a full, authentic, and accurate account. While Luke claims chronological accuracy and systematic arrangement, he also acknowledges that he may not strictly adhere to the order of time in all details. As we delve into St. Luke's Gospel, we are presented with the orderly account of Christ's life, from his conception and birth to his resurrection and ascension.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Luke by this classes himself with these πολλοί, and shews that he intended no disparagement nor blame to them, and was going to construct his own history from similar sources."
2. "The παρηκ . ἄν . πᾶσιν ἀκρ . implies however a conscious superiority of his own qualification for the work."
3. "The idea of the name being not a proper, but a feigned one, designating ‘those who loved God,’ is far-fetched and improbable."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "from the very first—that is, from the very earliest events; referring to those precious details of the birth and early life, not only of our Lord, but of His forerunner, which we owe to Luke alone."
2. "in order—or 'consecutively'—in contrast, probably, with the disjointed productions to which he had referred. But this must not be pressed too far; for, on comparing it with the other Gospels, we see that in some particulars the strict chronological order is not observed in this Gospel."
3. "most excellent—or 'most noble'—a title of rank applied by this same writer twice to Felix and once to Festus. It is likely, therefore, that 'Theophilus' was chief magistrate of some city in Greece or Asia Minor."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It seemed 'to be called for' that there should be a full, authentic, and accurate account of these matters."
2. "Having had perfect understanding ... by diligent and careful investigation, 'followed up' everything to the 'source,' to obtain an accurate account of the matter."
3. "The title 'most excellent' has by some been supposed to be given to express his 'character,' but it is rather to be considered as denoting rank or office."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Rev. renders here having traced the course."
2. "Tynd., having searched out diligently."
3. "Hence to trace down to the last and minutest detail."

### John Calvin:
1. "Having carefully examined all things... Luke intended to express his close and laborious investigation."
2. "The Greek verb παρακολουθεῖν is taken metaphorically from those who tread in the footsteps of others."
3. "The old translator has it, having followed out all things... that nothing may escape them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The inspired writers were moved by the Holy Spirit, not as passive machines, but as rational and responsible persons, who exercised their memory, judgment, and used all means of information, under divine guidance."
2. "Luke lays claim to chronological accuracy in his Gospel, though his narrative in this respect plainly falls behind that of Mark. He claims at all events systematic arrangement."
3. "The name means 'lover of God,' and this had led some to the unsupported fancy, that the name was a feigned one, to designate believers."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Luke here claims fulness of knowledge before he began to write his book. He had the traditions of the eyewitnesses and ministers of the word and the narratives previously drawn up."
2. "Ακριβως (accurately) means going into minute details, from ακρον, the topmost point."
3. "He has made careful investigation and his work deserves serious consideration."

### John Gill:
1. "Being moved to it by the Holy Ghost... as well as by him assisted in it."
2. "Luke had diligently sought after, and had attained unto a perfect knowledge of all the affairs of Christ; having studiously got into the company of, and intimately conversed with all, or as many as he could, who had seen Christ in the flesh."
3. "The evangelist had his perfect knowledge of things by a revelation from above, by divine inspiration; and this moved him to write."

### John Wesley:
1. "To write in order — St. Luke describes in order of time; first, The Acts of Christ; his conception, birth, childhood, baptism, miracles, preaching, passion, resurrection, ascension: then, The Acts of the Apostles."
2. "But in many smaller circumstances he does not observe the order of time."
3. "After the preface St. Luke gives us the history of Christ, from his coming into the world to his ascension into heaven."
