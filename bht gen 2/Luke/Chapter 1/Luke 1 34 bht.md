# Luke 1:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The virgin Mary, filled with pure faith, did not doubt the truth of the angel's message like Zacharias did. Her initial question was not meant to challenge the promise, but to seek understanding of how such a miraculous conception could take place. Mary's words reflect her awe and desire to be informed of the extraordinary manner in which this fulfillment of prophecy would unfold. Her questioning was not a display of unbelief, but rather a humble request for further clarification and revelation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "How, &c.—not the unbelief of Zacharias, 'Whereby shall I know this?' but, taking the fact for granted, 'How is it to be, so contrary to the unbroken law of human birth?'"
2. "Instead of reproof, therefore, her question is answered in mysterious detail."

### John Calvin:
1. "We ought not to give ourselves very much trouble, to acquit her of all blame. She ought immediately to have risen by faith to the boundless power of God..."
2. "She readily embraced the promise... That persuasion of the kindness of God, which had been formed in the mind of the virgin, led her to admit, in the fullest manner, that she had received a message..."
3. "The probable and simple explanation is, that the greatness or rather majesty of the subject made so powerful an impression on the virgin, that all her senses were bound and locked up in astonishment."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "She simply expresses the natural objection of which she was conscious in her pure virgin heart."
2. "The instincts of maidenly purity combined with strong faith to show her the negative side of the mystery of the miraculous conception."
3. "It is altogether improper to understand this clause as implying a vow of perpetual virginity, or the purpose of such a vow, as many Romanist interpreters hold."

### John Gill:
1. "This she said not as doubting the truth of what was said; for she required no sign, as Zacharias did; nor is she charged with, and blamed for unbelief, as he was; yea, it is expressly said, Luke 1:45 that she believed." 
2. "Her words express her admiration at it, and also her desire to be informed of the manner how it should be." 
3. "She knew, by prophecy, that the Messiah was to be born of a virgin, and she perceived, by the angel's declaration, that she was that virgin, but could not imagine in what way this amazing thing should be effected."
