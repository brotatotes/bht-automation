# Luke 1:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Holy Ghost, as the power of the Highest, played a vital role in the birth of Jesus. Through the direct and gentle operation of divine power, the Holy Spirit created Jesus' body, which was pure and holy. This supernatural birth distinguishes Jesus as the Son of God and emphasizes his unique nature. The metaphor of a cloud is used to illustrate the secret and unseen operation of the Holy Spirit. Jesus' divine Sonship is not only derived from his eternal nature but is also a result of the extraordinary and supernatural manner of his birth.
