# Luke 1:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Mary and Elisabeth were relatives, possibly cousins or otherwise closely related. Intermarriage between the tribes of Levi and Judah was not uncommon and did not violate any specific laws. So when Mary went to visit Elisabeth, it was not just a casual visit between acquaintances, but a meeting between two women who were connected both by blood and by their significant roles in God's plan.
