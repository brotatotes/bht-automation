# Luke 1:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Mary's visit to a city in the hill country of Judah, possibly Hebron, was prompted by her sincere affection and desire to confirm her faith. She embarked on the journey with haste, disregarding any obstacles and recognizing the grace of God. It is likely that she sought to share and rejoice in the miraculous events that had taken place, not just to inquire about them. The specific city is uncertain, but it is believed to be a Levitical city, potentially Hebron, known for its proximity to Jerusalem and its significance to the priests.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Mary being betrothed to Joseph, had no communications with him, except through the pronubæ; who, on the first indications of her pregnancy, represented it to him." 
2. "So that we have five months, during which Elisabeth hid herself, plus the sixth month, during which takes place the Annunciation, the discovery of Mary’s pregnancy, her taking home by Joseph, plus three months visit of Mary, equals nine months, nearly her full time."
3. "It is not Jerusalem; for that would hardly have been described as in the hill country; and from Luke 1:23; Luke 1:65, the Evangelist clearly indicates some other place than Jerusalem as the residence of the parents of John."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "hill country - the mountainous tract running along the middle of Judea, from north to south"
2. "with haste - transported with the announcement to herself and with the tidings, now first made known to her, of Elisabeth's condition"
3. "a city of Juda - probably Hebron"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "And Mary arose - The word 'arose' here is equivalent to 'setting out,' or starting on a journey."
2. "The hill country - The region in the vicinity of Jerusalem, commonly called the hill country of Judea."
3. "City of Juda - What city is meant is not known. Some have supposed it to be Jerusalem, others Hebron; but all is conjecture. It was probably a Levitical city, and the residence of Zechariah when he was not employed in the temple."

### John Calvin:
1. "The haste indicates a sincere and strong affection. We may infer from it that the Virgin disregarded every thing else and formed a just estimate of this grace of God."
2. "It certainly was not made for the mere purpose of inquiry: for she cherished in her heart by faith the Son of God as already conceived in her womb."
3. "There is no absurdity in supposing, that she sought to confirm her faith by a view of the miracle, which had been adduced to her with no small effect by the angel."

### Philip Schaff:

3. "Most think it was Hebron, which was given to the sons of Aaron in the hill-country of Judah (Joshua 19:11), but this cannot certainly be inferred."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "Luke uses this adjective twice in this context (here and Luke 1:65) instead of το ορος, the mountains."
3. "The name of the city where Zacharias lived is not given unless Judah here means Juttah (Joshua 15:55)."

### John Gill:
1. "Partly to know the truth of things, and to make use of the sign which had been given her, for the further confirmation of her faith, which was very right and proper for her to do."
2. "To converse with Elisabeth about the great things which God had done for each of them, and to praise his name together."
3. "Hebron was a city peculiar to the priests; whereas Jerusalem was not; and it was in the hill country of Judea; it was remarkable for the goodness of its stones."
