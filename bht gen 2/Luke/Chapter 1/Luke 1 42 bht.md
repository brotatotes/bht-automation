# Luke 1:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
With great emotion, she proclaimed loudly for all to hear, acknowledging and reaffirming the blessedness of Mary among women. This blessing stemmed not just from her own qualities, but from the fact that she carried in her womb a truly blessed child, who was not only a divine person, but the source of all spiritual blessings in whom all nations would find their ultimate blessedness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "εὐλογ. has a double meaning: that of blessed, from above blessed among women, i.e. beyond other women."
2. "The former is the best rendering here: and then ἐν γ . will be the Hebrew superlative, as in Jeremiah 29:15 (49:15) and Song of Solomon 1:8."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "High as was the distinction conferred upon herself, Elisabeth loses sight of it altogether, in presence of one more honored still."
2. "Upon whom, with her unborn Babe, in an ecstasy of inspiration, she pronounces a benediction, feeling it to be a wonder unaccountable that 'the mother of her Lord should come to her.'"
3. "Turn this as we will, we shall never be able to see the propriety of calling an unborn child 'Lord,' but by supposing Elisabeth, like the prophets of old, enlightened to perceive the Messiah's Divine nature."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Blessed art thou among women - She here repeated nearly the words of the angel to Mary, esteeming it to be the highest honor among mothers to be the mother of the Messiah."
2. "See the notes at Luke 1:28."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "She lifted up her voice with a loud cry; thus rendering in the verb the force of ajna, up, besides picturing the fact more naturally."
2. "Elizabeth's sudden and violent emotion at the appearance of Mary, and the movement of the child, prompted an exclamation which was followed by words (eipen, said)."

### John Calvin:

2. "To carry Christ in her womb was not Mary's first blessedness, but was greatly inferior to the distinction of being born again by the Spirit of God to a new life."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
