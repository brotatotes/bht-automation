# Luke 1:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Elisabeth marvels at the great honor of having Mary visit her, being the mother of the Messiah and the future mother of the divine Lord. Mary is rightly called the mother of our Lord because she gave birth to the child who was in union with the true Lord and God. This is similar to how the Lord of life and glory was said to be crucified, and God is said to have purchased the church with his own blood. It is a profound mystery that Mary, a human woman, was chosen to bear the Son of God.
