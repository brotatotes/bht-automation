# Luke 1:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For as soon as I heard the sound of your greeting, the baby in my womb leaped for joy. This remarkable event served as confirmation to Elizabeth that Mary was indeed the mother of her Lord. It signifies the great privilege and joy that not only Elizabeth experienced, but also all unborn children who have the ability to recognize and respond to the presence of the Messiah. This beautiful display of longing and recognition mirrors the ancient belief among the Jews that even embryos in the womb can praise and worship God.
