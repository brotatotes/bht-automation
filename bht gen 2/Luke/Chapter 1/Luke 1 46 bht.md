# Luke 1:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Mary's praise and magnification of the Lord were not mere lip service, but a deep expression of her heart and soul. Through her hymn, she ascribed greatness to God and celebrated His perfections. Inspired by the prophetic style, Mary spoke of things that were happening or about to happen, even if she did not fully comprehend their significance at the time. Her song stood in contrast to the unbelief that silenced Zacharias. Mary's genuine and heartfelt praise was a testament to her faith, which was already rejoicing even before the fulfillment of God's promises.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Is it unnatural to suppose that the spirit of the blessed Virgin had been drawn beforehand into mysterious sympathy with the ideas and the tone of this hymn..."
2. "In both songs, those holy women, filled with wonder to behold 'the proud, the mighty, the rich,' passed by, and, in their persons the lowliest chosen to usher in the greatest events..."
3. "In both songs the strain dies away on CHRIST; in Hannah's under the name of 'Jehovah's King'—to whom, through all His line, from David onwards to Himself, He will 'give strength'; His 'Anointed,' whose horn He will exalt (1 Samuel 2:10); in the Virgin's song, it is as the 'Help' promised to Israel by all the prophets."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To 'magnify' means to 'make great,' and then to 'extol,' to 'praise,' to 'celebrate.'"
2. "It does not mean here strictly to 'make great,' but to increase 'in our estimation' - that is, to praise or extol."
3. "See Psalms 34:3; 2 Samuel 7:26."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Elizabeth's salutation was full of excitement, but Mary's hymn breathes a sentiment of deep inward repose."
2. "Hannah's song differs from Mary's in its sense of indignation and personal triumph compared with Mary's humility and calmness."
3. "The soul is the principle of individuality, the seat of personal impressions, having a side in contact with the material element of humanity, as well as with the spiritual element. It is thus the mediating organ between the spirit and the body, receiving impressions from without and from within, and transmitting them by word or sign. Spirit is the highest, deepest, noblest part of our humanity, the point of contact between God and man."

### John Calvin:
1. "Mary says that she praises God from an inward feeling of the mind. And certainly they who pronounce his glory, not from the mind, but with the tongue alone, do nothing more than profane his holy name."
2. "The excitement of the will of man to praise God must be preceded by a rejoicing of the spirit… Sadness and anxiety lock up the soul, and restrain the tongue from celebrating the goodness of God."
3. "Till God has been recognised as a Savior, the minds of men are not free to indulge in true and full joy, but will remain in doubt and anxiety... The first thing necessary for believers is, to be able to rejoice that they have their salvation in God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The angel’s visit was vouchsafed to Mary later than to Zacharias, yet her song of thanksgiving is uttered long before his: faith is already singing for joy, while unbelief is compelled to be silent."
2. "This song of Mary, called the MAGNIFICAT, from the first word of the old Latin version, is the unpremeditated outpouring of deep emotion, and may be divided into regular stanzas and lines."
3. "The grace of God (Luke 1:48), His omnipotence (Luke 1:49-51), His holiness (Luke 1:49; Luke 1:51; Luke 1:54), His justice (Luke 1:52-53), and especially His faithfulness (Luke 1:54-55), are here celebrated."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "She draws her material from the O.T. and sings in the noblest strain."
2. "Mary is correct."

### John Gill:
1. "And by 'magnifying' him is meant, not making him great, for he cannot be made greater than he is; but ascribing greatness to him, even all the perfections of the Deity, and praising him on account of them."
2. "Mary did [magnify the Lord], not in lip and word only, but with her whole heart and soul, and with all the powers and faculties of it."
3. "She all along speaks in the prophetic style, of things, as if they were done, which were doing, or would shortly be done."

### John Wesley:
1. And Mary said — Under a prophetic impulse, several things, which perhaps she herself did not then fully understand.
