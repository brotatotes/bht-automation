# Luke 1:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the days when the priests were divided into twenty-four courses, the course of Abia held the eighth position. Each course had a week-long duty in the temple, from Sabbath to Sabbath. During their assigned time, the priests would participate in the temple service, which was determined by lot. This order and rotation of service ensured that each priest had an opportunity to contribute to the worship and ministry of the temple.
