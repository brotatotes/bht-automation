# Luke 1:50 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's mercy is manifested to those who fear Him and keep His commandments. This fear is not a dread of punishment, but rather a reverential love and affection for God. Those who fear Him are the vessels of mercy, prepared beforehand for glory, and in their redemption, mercy and truth meet together. This mercy may also be seen in the incarnation of Christ, which is a reminder of God's promised mercy and comes through His tender love and compassion.
