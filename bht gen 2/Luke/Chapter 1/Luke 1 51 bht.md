# Luke 1:51 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Lord has displayed His power and might in bringing about salvation for His people. He has humbled the proud in their own lofty thoughts and plans. Even though they resist Him, God opposes them and confounds them in their pride. This can be seen throughout history, such as when the proud nations and individuals who opposed God were scattered and defeated. Ultimately, God's power and might will prevail over all forms of pride, both visible and invisible.
