# Luke 1:52 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He hath put down the mighty - The mighty here denotes princes, kings, or conquerors. These powerful figures are the ones that God has humbled or removed from their positions. It is through His providence and judgments that God brings down those who exalt themselves in their own strength and authority. As we see in the course of His providence, God often dethrones the mighty rulers and replaces them with His chosen ones. It is a reminder that God is the ultimate authority and has control over all rulers and kingdoms.
