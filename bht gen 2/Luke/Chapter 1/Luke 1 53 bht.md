# Luke 1:53 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's mercy is celebrated in filling the hungry with good things, encompassing both temporal and spiritual blessings. The sincere and humble receive a sense of salvation, forgiveness, and righteousness, while the proud and insatiable rich are often left empty-handed. When people approach God with self-centeredness, He may even take away their riches. It is important to recognize that approaching God is not solely for material gain but rather to seek a true and fulfilling relationship with Him. God eagerly satisfies the hunger of those who come to Him in authentic faith.
