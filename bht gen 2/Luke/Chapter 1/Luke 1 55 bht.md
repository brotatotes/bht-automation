# Luke 1:55 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's promises of mercy and salvation extend to all generations, not just to the physical descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Through the Messiah, all nations will be blessed and all true believers will be considered part of Abraham's spiritual seed. This promise is not limited to a specific time or place, but is eternal and universal in nature. God's mercy and grace are offered to all who put their faith in Him, regardless of nationality or heritage.
