# Luke 1:59 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The custom of naming children at circumcision originated from the change of names during the institution of the rite. The child would be named on the eighth day after birth, even if it fell on a Sabbath. Believers should select names that encourage godliness and serve as a reminder of faithful examples to follow. The imperfect tense conveys the intention or attempt to call the child. It was crucial to observe the exact timing for the rite and honor the prevailing customs by giving the child an appropriate name.
