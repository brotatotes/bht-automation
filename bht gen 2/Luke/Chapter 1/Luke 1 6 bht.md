## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "πορ. ἐν, a Hebraism, as also προβ. ἐν τ. ἡμέραις, Luke 1:7, and ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ἱερ... ἔλαχεν, Luke 1:8-9. This last is a construction frequent in Luke."
2. "In the phrase ἐντολαῖς κ. δικαιώμασιν (see reff.), we must not press any difference between the terms."
3. "δικαίωμα, as Bleek remarks, is used of an ordinance of God, laying down what is δίκαιον for men."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The commandments and ordinances express both moral and ceremonial obedience." 
2. "Hebrews 9:1- :, and other passages, put this beyond all reasonable doubt."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Both righteous - Both 'just' or holy... an honorable testimonial of their 'piety' toward God."
2. "Walking in ... - Keeping the commandments. To walk in the way that God commands is 'to obey.'"
3. "Blameless - That is, no fault or deficiency could be found in them... real love to God and sincere regard for his law."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Before God. A Hebrew expression. Compare Genesis 7:1; Acts 8:21.

### John Calvin:
1. "In ordering our life, our first study ought to be to approve ourselves to God; and we know that what he chiefly requires is a sincere heart and a pure conscience."
2. "Nor ought we to neglect this definition, that they are righteous who regulate their life by the commandments of the law; which intimates that, to the eye of God, all acts of worship are counterfeit, and the course of human life false and unsettled, so far as they depart from his law."
3. "The righteousness which is commended in them [Zacharias and Elisabeth] depends on the gracious forbearance of God, who does not reckon to them their remaining unrighteousness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Righteous before God. Not outwardly, but really, pious."
2. "The former probably refers to special commandments, the latter, as its derivation hints, to that by which God defines what is ‘righteous’ for men."
3. "They were ‘saints’ after the Old Testament pattern. The promise made to Abraham (Genesis 22:18) was about to be fulfilled, and the first revelation was made to one of the Abrahamic character."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Righteous before God (δικαιο εναντιον του θεου). Old Testament conception and idiom."
2. "Picture of 'noblest product of Old Testament education' (Ragg) is Zacharias and Elisabeth, Mary and Joseph, Simeon and Anna who were 'privileged to see with clear eyes the dawn of the New Testament revelation.'"

### John Gill:
1. "Not as the Pharisees, only righteous before men, but in the sight of God, who sees the heart, and whose judgment is according to truth."
2. "God beheld them in his Son, as clothed with that righteousness he engaged to bring in, and as cleansed from all sin in that blood of his which was to be shed."
3. "Walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord: this was not the matter of their righteousness before God, but the evidence of it before men."

1. Walking in all the moral commandments, and ceremonial ordinances, blameless — How admirable a character! May our behaviour be thus unblamable, and our obedience thus sincere and universal!
