# Luke 1:61 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we gain insights into the significance of ancestral names and the value placed on honoring one's parents and ancestors. The Israelites had a tradition of giving names to their children in remembrance of their forefathers, relatives, and even friends. This practice not only distinguished the various tribes and families but also served to maintain clarity in their genealogical records. Moreover, the name John, although not commonly found within Elizabeth's family or her husband's, reflected a cherished and respected heritage.
