# Luke 1:62 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
And they made signs to his father, who was deaf as well as dumb. This is evident because if he could hear, there would have been no need for them to communicate with him through signs. The method of using signs to convey information to a deaf person is directed in cases where a father is deaf and needs to confirm the status of his firstborn. They would examine him like they would in a divorce case, and if he makes signs or writes to confirm that this is his firstborn, then he would receive the double portion.
