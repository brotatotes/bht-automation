# Luke 1:67 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
And Zacharias, filled with the Holy Spirit, prophesied about the coming of Christ, emphasizing His role and importance. While he mentions his own son, John, it is in a secondary manner, as he focuses primarily on the Messiah and the fulfillment of God's promise and mercy to His people. This prophetic song, inspired by the Holy Spirit, reveals the deep understanding and anticipation that Zacharias had for the future events that were about to unfold.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "Filled with the Holy Ghost" - See Luke 1:15.
2. "And prophesied" - The word “prophesy" means: This song of Zechariah partakes of all. It is principally employed in the praises of God, but it also predicts the future character and preaching of John.

### John Calvin:
1. "Thus we read, that the Spirit was given to the prophets: not that on other occasions they wanted it, but that the power of the Spirit was more fully exerted in them, when the hand of God, as it were, brought them into public view, for the discharge of their office."
2. "We must observe, therefore, the manner in which Luke connects the two clauses: he was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied. This implies that divine inspiration, at that time, rested upon him in an extraordinary measure, in consequence of which he did not speak like a man or private person, but all that he uttered was heavenly instruction."
3. "This was a remarkable instance of the goodness of God, that not only did Zacharias recover the power of speech, which he had not enjoyed for nine months, but his tongue became the organ of the Holy Spirit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The BENEDICTUS presents, therefore, not only the faith of a pious Jewish priest, not only the result of the long months of silent reflection to which Zacharias had been subjected, but also these as guided, moved, and uttered under the immediate influence of the Holy Spirit."
2. "Without inspiration the pious priest would doubtless have adopted the same tone, the same Old Testament phraseology, but his words could not have been prophetic of the coming of the Messiah nor of the part to be taken by his own son."
3. "Taking it as an expression of religious feeling, we discover the hopes of the human educator of John the Baptist, and thus obtain a hint of the real views of John himself and of the character of his ministry."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Prophesied (επροφητευσεν). Under the guidance of the Holy Spirit."
2. "He, like Mary, was full of the Holy Spirit and had caught the Messianic message in its highest meaning."

### John Gill:
1. "And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost,.... With a spirit of prophecy, as his wife Elisabeth had been before..."
2. "...the following things, relating to the Messiah, his incarnation and redemption by him; to the accomplishing of the covenant, oath, promise and mercy of God to his people..."
3. "...the following song is of divine inspiration; and that Zacharias spake it as he was moved by the Holy Ghost, as the prophets of old did."

### John Wesley:
1. And Zacharias prophesied — Of things immediately to follow. But it is observable, he speaks of Christ chiefly; of John only, as it were, incidentally.
