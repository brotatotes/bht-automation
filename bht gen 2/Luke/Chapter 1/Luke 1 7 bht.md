# Luke 1:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
And though it was not uncommon for couples to be old and childless in those times, their barrenness was often seen as a reproach and a sign of God's judgment. However, in the case of these couples, there was a particular hand of God at work. The conception and birth of John, for instance, were extraordinary and even miraculous, making it even more difficult for people to believe. It was appointed by God to testify to His power and to the special purpose He had in mind.
