## BHT:
The mercy promised in the holy covenant refers to the salvation by Christ, which is a result of God's mercy. It is the fulfillment of God's promises and the redemption of transgressions under the first Testament. The act of raising up and sending Jesus as a Savior demonstrates God's faithfulness to the covenant and His redemption of His people. Through this covenant, God shows His kindness towards His people, both living and dead, and grants them salvation through Christ.
