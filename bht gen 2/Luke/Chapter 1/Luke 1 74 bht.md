# Luke 1:74 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
One principal end of deliverance from spiritual enemies by Christ is the service of God, which lays a greater obligation on men to glorify Him. The redeemed are called to a spiritual and evangelical service, without the fear brought by the law. This service is not of man's own power, but a grant from God, enabled by His Spirit and grace. It is a promise of living a life characterized by holiness and happiness, where every thought, word, and work is dedicated to loving and serving God joyfully.
