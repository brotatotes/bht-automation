# Luke 1:75 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We are called to a life of true holiness and righteousness, not merely outward observances or ceremonies. Our service to God should be genuine and rooted in a deep commitment to what is right and holy. It is not enough to appear righteous before others; our true righteousness should be before God. This is not a temporary or occasional calling, but a lifelong commitment to live in a way that pleases Him.
