# Luke 1:77 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
John's purpose in preparing the way for Christ was to bring knowledge of salvation. This knowledge encompasses the forgiveness of sins, which is the grand instrument of both present and eternal salvation. It is not merely a theoretical understanding, but an experiential and certain knowledge that comes through the remission of sins. The Gospel doctrine of salvation rests on this foundational truth, as it is through the forgiveness of sins, freely and fully provided by Christ's sacrificial death, that true and blessed salvation is attained.
