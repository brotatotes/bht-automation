# Luke 1:79 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The light of salvation shines upon those who are in darkness and guides them onto the path of peace. Without God, people find themselves in a state of unregeneracy, darkness, and ignorance, like sitting in the shadow of death. But when Christ, the great light, arises and shines upon them, they are led out of darkness and into the light. His sacrifice not only brings peace but also guides believers toward the true way of enjoying spiritual and eternal peace.
