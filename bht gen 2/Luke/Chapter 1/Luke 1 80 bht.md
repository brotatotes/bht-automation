# Luke 1:80 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage highlights the development and preparation of John the Baptist for his future role as the forerunner of Jesus. John grew physically and mentally, becoming strong in both body and spirit. He was not influenced by human teachings but rather educated by God in the wilderness, away from societal expectations. This allowed him to develop a unique relationship with God, distinct from Jesus, until the appointed time of their public ministries. John's growth and isolation in the deserts served to emphasize his divine calling and separation from worldly distractions.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "A very similar conclusion to those in ch. Luke 2:40; Luke 2:52, and denoting probably the termination of that record or document of the birth of the Baptist."
2. "The Old Testament spirit is stronger here, and the very phraseology more in unison with Hebrew usage."
3. "It cannot be supposed that the Essenes, dwelling in those parts, had any, or only the most general kind of influence over him, as their views were wholly different from his."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "A concluding paragraph, indicating, in strokes full of grandeur, the bodily and mental development of the Baptist and bringing his life up to the period of his public appearance."
2. "In the deserts—probably 'the wilderness of Judea,' whither he had retired early in life, in the Nazarite spirit, and where, free from rabbinical influences and alone with God, his spirit would be educated, like Moses in the desert, for his future high vocation."
3. "His showing unto Israel—the presentation of himself before his nation, as Messiah's forerunner."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Waxed strong in spirit - That is, in courage, understanding, and purposes of good, fitting him for his future work."
2. "Until the day of his showing - Until he entered on his public ministry, as recorded in Matthew 3:0 - that is, probably, until he was about 30 years of age."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The deserts [ταις ερημοις] . The article indicating a well known place."
2. "Shewing [ααδειξεως] . The word was used of the public announcement of an official nomination; hence of the public inauguration of John's ministry."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The mistake of monastic life consists in making the retirement permanent, leading to idleness or selfish piety; but Protestants often overlook the need of such temporary withdrawal, to gain time for calm reflection, rest from conflicts and cares, as well as strength for future work, in communing with God."
2. "This retirement was combined with abstemiousness (Matthew 3:4)."
3. "This conclusion, together with the peculiar style of the narrative (from Luke 1:5 to the close of the chapter), has led to the theory that the whole was taken from some trustworthy document found by Luke."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The child kept growing in strength of body and spirit."
2. "The boy, as he grew, may have gone up to the passover and may have seen the boy Jesus."
3. "So these two boys of destiny grew on with the years, each waiting for 'his shewing unto Israel'."

### John Gill:
1. "John...grew in stature of body, and increased in wisdom and knowledge, and fortitude in his soul." 
2. "He was not brought up in the schools of the prophets...that it might appear he was not taught and sent of men, but of God." 
3. "He dwelt in deserts...that it might be clear he had no knowledge of, nor correspondence with Jesus...until such time he did it."
