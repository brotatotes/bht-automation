# Luke 1:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was determined for the day's service. One of the most distinguished parts of this service was the burning of incense, which symbolized prayer and praise to God. The priest would enter the holy place, as if entering the presence of God, to make intercession for the people. The burning of incense was a reminder that our prayers ascend to heaven through the sacrifice of the Mediator. This moment of burning incense was a significant and sacred moment in the priest's life, filled with anticipation for the supernatural.
