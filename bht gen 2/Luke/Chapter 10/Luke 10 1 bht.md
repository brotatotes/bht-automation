# Luke 10:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus chose seventy other disciples to go before him and prepare the way for his arrival. This number of seventy may have been significant, symbolizing the seventy elders of Israel and the wider spread of his ministry among the nations. These chosen disciples were sent ahead of Jesus, tasked with proclaiming the coming of the kingdom of God and preparing the hearts of the people to receive him. They were to carry out this important work, knowing that Jesus himself would follow after them to continue his mission.
