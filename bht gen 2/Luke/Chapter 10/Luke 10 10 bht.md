# Luke 10:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When encountering resistance in a city, the followers of Jesus are instructed to take their message of peace to the streets, rather than seeking shelter in the inhospitable houses. They are to cast off the dust from their feet and boldly proclaim their message in the most public manner possible. The rejection by some may serve as a sign of the true peace-seekers, those who are inwardly prepared to embrace the message of peace.
