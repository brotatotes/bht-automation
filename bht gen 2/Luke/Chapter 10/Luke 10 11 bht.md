# Luke 10:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Notwithstanding their rejection, the kingdom of God was near to them, as the ministers of the Gospel had made it known to them. Even the very dust of their city that clung to the feet of the messengers served as an evidence against them, testifying to their refusal to accept the kingdom. Despite their disbelief, the opportunity for salvation was within their reach.

### John Wesley:
1. The kingdom of God is at hand — Though ye will not receive it.
