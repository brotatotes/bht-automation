# Luke 10:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In that day, the city will face a punishment more tolerable than that of Sodom, which sank through its vile pollutions and suffered the vengeance of eternal fire. Even though Sodom's iniquities were great and its punishment exemplary, the doom of a city that rejects the light of the Saviour, despite being surrounded by it, will be less endurable than that of Sodom. Such a city, having been favored with the Gospel and having despised it, will face a much worse fate than those consumed by fire from heaven.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Sodom sank through its vile pollutions."
2. "The doom of otherwise correct persons who, amidst a blaze of light, reject the Saviour, shall be less endurable than that of any of these."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  More tolerable  (ανεκτοτερον). Comparative of the verbal adjective ανεκτος from ανεχομα. An old adjective, but only the comparative in the N.T. and in this phrase (Matthew 10:15; Matthew 11:22; Matthew 11:24; Luke 10:12; Luke 10:14). 

### John Gill:
1. "It shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that city."
2. "Sodom was a very wicked city, and was destroyed by fire from heaven for its iniquity, and its inhabitants suffer the vengeance of eternal fire."
3. "Though the iniquities of Sodom and Gomorrha were very great, and their punishment very exemplary; yet, as there will be degrees of torment in hell, the case of such a city, which has been favoured with the Gospel, and has despised and rejected it, will be much worse than the case of those cities, which were devoured by fire from heaven."
