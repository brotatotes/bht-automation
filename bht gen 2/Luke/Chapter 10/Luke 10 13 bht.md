# Luke 10:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Woe to Chorazin and Bethsaida, fishing towns in Galilee, where Jesus performed many miracles. Woe is pronounced upon them for their impenitence and unbelief, as they did not repent despite witnessing these mighty works. The people of Tyre and Sidon, cities in Phoenicia, did not have the same opportunities to witness these miracles, yet if they had, they would have repented immediately. The inhabitants of Chorazin and Bethsaida were warned not to lose time, as their lack of repentance would lead to their downfall. (Matthew 11:21)
