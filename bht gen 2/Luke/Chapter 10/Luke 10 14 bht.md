## BHT:
In considering the judgment to come, it is worth noting that the punishment for Tyre and Sidon will be comparatively more bearable. However, the inhabitants of Chorazin and Bethsaida will face a more severe retribution. This is because their punishment will align with the magnitude of the light, privileges, and advantages they had but chose to disregard and rebel against.
