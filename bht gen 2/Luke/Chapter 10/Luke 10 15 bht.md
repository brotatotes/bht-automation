# Luke 10:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Capernaum, which was once exalted to heaven, was filled with pride and arrogance due to the blessings it received. However, it would be brought down to a lowly state, possibly referring to its destruction and current desolation. The city of Sodom, known for its wickedness, would have repented if it had seen the mighty works and miracles that were performed in Capernaum. Judgment would therefore be more severe for Capernaum compared to Sodom, highlighting the gravity of rejecting and failing to acknowledge the divine acts of God.
