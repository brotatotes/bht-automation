# Luke 10:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who hear and embrace the message of the disciples are receiving Christ himself, while those who despise and reject the disciples are despising and rejecting Christ. The honor and authority of the disciples come directly from the one who sent them, and by despising them, people are also despising the one who sent them. This warning serves as a solemn reminder of the responsibility to receive and respect those who come with the message of Christ.
