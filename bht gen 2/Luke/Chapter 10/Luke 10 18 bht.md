# Luke 10:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Jesus speaks of seeing Satan falling like lightning, His words encapsulate the entire conflict with and defeat of evil, from its first rebellion to the final victory accomplished through His own triumph. This vision is not merely symbolic but a literal depiction of the suddenness and brightness of the fallen angel. Through the power of the Gospel, Satan's dominion is shattered, and those who embrace its message experience the liberation from his bondage. The thunderous impact of the Gospel shatters Satan's rule, bringing about a swift and violent downfall.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

2. "And this ·ºêŒ∏ŒµœéœÅŒøœÖŒΩ belongs to the period before the foundation of the world when He abode in the bosom of the Father."

3.
