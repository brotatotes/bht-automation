# Luke 10:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ grants his disciples the authority to overcome the enemy, just as he did himself. This power extends not only to physical danger, but also to the spiritual realm, protecting them from the schemes and attacks of the devil. Despite any temporary harm that may be inflicted upon them, their eternal well-being and the work of God in their lives will ultimately be preserved.
