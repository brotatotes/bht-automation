# Luke 10:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The abundance of souls awaiting the gospel message is highlighted, yet there is a shortage of laborers to bring in the harvest. The disciples are encouraged to pray to the Lord of the harvest, who alone can send out more workers into this vast field. Although many disciples had been chosen and sent already, the sheer number of souls in need necessitated an ongoing supply of laborers. Jesus, therefore, emphasizes the significance of prayer as a means to seek divine intervention in raising up more preachers and laborers for this bountiful harvest.
