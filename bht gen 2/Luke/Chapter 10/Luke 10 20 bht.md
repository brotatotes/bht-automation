# Luke 10:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Rejoice not primarily in the power and influence you have, but rather, find your ultimate source of joy in the fact that your names are enrolled in the book of life. This is the foundation and assurance of all the blessings of grace and glory. So, let us not take pride in our abilities or achievements, but instead find true rejoicing in the eternal security that is granted to us through faith in Christ. May our names never be blotted out from the heavenly register.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "make not one particular department of it your cause of joy, nor indeed the mere subjection of evil to you at all but this, the positive and infinite side of God’s mercy and goodness to you, that He hath placed you among His redeemed ones."
2. "τὰ πνεύμ . is something different from τὰ δαιμόνια in those words above, and denotes a wider range of influence influence over spirit for good whereby the πνευματικὰ τῆς πονηρίας are subjected to the believers in Christ."
3. "the true cause of joy for you is, not the power shewn forth by or in you in My Name, but that you, your names, are in the book of life' as testified by the πνεῦμα which συμμαρτυρεῖ τῷ πν . ἡμῶν ὅτι ἐσμὲν τέκνα θεοῦ"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Rejoice not...not so much. So far from forbidding it, He takes occasion from it to tell them what had been passing in His own mind."
2. "But as power over demons was after all intoxicating, He gives them a higher joy to balance it."
3. "The joy of having their names in Heaven's register."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Though it was an honor to work miracles, though it is an honor to be endowed with talents, and influence, and learning, yet it is a subject of 'chief' joy that we are numbered among the people of God, and have a title to everlasting life."
2. "Names are written in heaven - The names of citizens of a city or state were accustomed to be written in a book or register, from which they were blotted out when they became unworthy, or forfeited the favor of their country."
3. "That their 'names were written in heaven,' means that they were 'citizens' of heaven; that they were friends of God and 'approved' by him, and would be permitted to dwell with him. This was of far more value than all 'earthly' honor, power, or wealth, and 'in' this people should rejoice more than in eminent endowments of influence, learning, talents, or possessions."

### John Calvin:
1. "He leads them to its origin and source, which is, that they were chosen by God and adopted as his children."

3. "The metaphorical expression, your names are written in heaven, means, that they were acknowledged by God as His children and heirs, as if they had been inscribed in a register."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Rejoice not in this... The power is great, and joy in such delegated power is dangerous, may be joined with pride and self-seeking."
2. "But rejoice... Here there is no such danger."
3. "The ground of the commanded joy is not our power, delegated as it is, but God's mercy and love in Christ. He will rejoice most, and most properly, who finds the sole ground there."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "As citizens possessing the full privileges of the commonwealth" (Plummer).

### John Gill:

2. "But rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven; in the book of life, called the Lamb's book of life, written from the foundation of the world." 
3. "That this is matter of the greatest job, since it is the foundation and security of all the blessings of grace and glory."
