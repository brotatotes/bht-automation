# Luke 10:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus expresses his joy and gratitude to the Father, acknowledging Him as the Lord of heaven and earth. His rejoicing stems from the revelation and application of the Gospel to ordinary people, while the wise and learned reject it. Jesus is thankful for the hiding of these things from the wise and prudent, as it highlights the sovereign and distinguishing grace of God towards His elect. In this, Jesus is exulting in the display of God's grace and ensuring that all glory for salvation is given to Him, while humbling the pride of man. (Matthew 11:25)

2. "I am convinced that our Lord did utter, on the two separate occasions, these weighty words; and I find in them a most instructive instance of the way in which such central sayings were repeated by Him."
3. "On Luke 10:21-22, see notes on Matthew 11:25-27, observing here the gradual narrowing of the circle to which our Lord addresses himself."

3. "This is one of those rare cases in which the veil is lifted from off the Redeemer's inner man, that, angel-like, we may 'look into it' for a moment.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This holy joy of Jesus was directly due to the Holy Spirit. It is joy in the work of his followers, their victories over Satan, and is akin to the joy felt by Jesus in John 4:32-38 when the vision of the harvest of the world stirred his heart."
