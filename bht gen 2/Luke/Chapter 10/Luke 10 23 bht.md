# Luke 10:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The grace of Christian love fulfills and exceeds legal obedience, as shown in the parable of the Good Samaritan. The circle of people that Jesus addresses gradually narrows, focusing specifically on His disciples. The true blessing lies not in what the disciples obtained, but in what they saw – the knowledge of God the Father and Jesus Christ His Son. Jesus often repeated His sayings and in this context, he emphasizes the privilege of those who see and recognize the things that the disciples see.
