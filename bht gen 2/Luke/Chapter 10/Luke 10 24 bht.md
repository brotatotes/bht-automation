# Luke 10:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The present condition of the Church surpasses the experiences of the holy fathers who lived under the Law. David and Solomon desired to see and hear the things that we now witness, but they were not granted the same privilege. They eagerly awaited the coming of the Redeemer, placing their trust in God's promises despite not fully understanding the details of their fulfillment. We can learn from their patient anticipation and unwavering faith as we embrace the abundance of blessings and revelation that has been made available to us today.
