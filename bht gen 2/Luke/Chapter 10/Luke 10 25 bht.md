# Luke 10:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The lawyer, who had a self-righteous spirit, approached Jesus with a desire to test Him and see if He would contradict any of the teachings of the law. However, Jesus, in His wisdom, recognized the lawyer's intentions and instead redirected him back to the Law that he himself was an expert in. This interaction highlights the self-righteousness inherent in Pharisaism, which can manifest as a conceit of orthodoxy or self-conceit.
