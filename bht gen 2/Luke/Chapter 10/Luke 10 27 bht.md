# Luke 10:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The lawyer's response to the question about the greatest commandment shows his intelligence and knowledge of the law. He quotes from the Shema, written on the phylacteries, emphasizing the importance of loving God with all his heart, soul, strength, and mind. This comprehensive love requires the unification of all faculties in rendering sincere, affectionate, resolute, and wise service to God. Though the specific meanings of each word can be debated, the general sense of these words is clear and holds significance for all believers.
