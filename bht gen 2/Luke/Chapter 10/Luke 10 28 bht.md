# Luke 10:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The answer given, Thou hast answered right; this do, and thou shalt live, is not ironic, but rather a profound truth. The emphasis on this indicates the challenging aspect of fulfilling the law's requirements. It is impossible for anyone to fully do what the law demands in terms of loving God and loving one's neighbor consistently. However, one who can and does love God and others in this way has already entered into a life that is characterized by the eternal.
