## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The questioner, having been by our Lord’s enquiry, πῶς ἀναγ., himself thrown into the position of the answerer, yet, θέλων δικ. ἑαν., wishing to carry out the purpose with which he asked at first, and to cover what otherwise would be his shame at being answered by so simple a reply, and that his own, asks τίς ἐστίν μου πλησίον;" 
2. "I may observe that we need not take the whole of this explanation, but may well suppose that δικαιῶσαι ἑαυτ.. may mean, 'to get himself out of the difficulty': viz. by throwing on Jesus the definition of ὁ πλησίον, which was very narrowly and technically interpreted among the Jews, excluding Samaritans and Gentiles."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "wishing, to get himself out of the difficulty"
2. "throwing on Jesus the definition of 'neighbor'"
3. "the Jews interpreted very narrowly and technically, as excluding Samaritans and Gentiles"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The man was desirous of showing that he had kept the law; or perhaps he was desirous of justifying himself for asking the question; of showing that it could not be so easily settled; that a mere reference to the 'words' of the law did not determine it."
2. "It was still a question what was meant by 'neighbor.' The Pharisees held that the 'Jews' only were to be regarded as such, and that the obligation did not extend at all to the Gentiles."
3. "Every sinner is desirous of 'justifying himself.' He seeks to do it by his own works. For this purpose he perverts the meaning of the law, destroys its spirituality, and brings 'down' the law to 'his' standard, rather than attempt to frame his life by 'its' requirements."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Willing [θελων] . Rev., desiring. See on Matthew 1:19. I think this is stronger than desiring; rather, determined. Neighbor [πλησιον] . See on Matthew 5:43.

### John Calvin:
1. "But if we recollect what was formerly stated, that the hypocrisy of men is elderly detected by means of the second table—for, while they pretend to be eminent worshippers of God, they openly violate charity towards their neighbors—it will be easy to infer from this, that the Pharisee practiced this evasion, in order that, concealed under the false mask of holiness, he might not be brought forth to light."
2. "So then, aware that the test of charity would prove unfavorable to him, he seeks concealment under the word neighbor, that he may not be discovered to be a transgressor of the Law."
3. "For the only method to which hypocrites can resort for avoiding the condemnation of themselves, is to turn away as far as they are able, that their life may not be tried by the judgment of the Law."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But he, wishing to justify himself, to declare himself righteous, over against the implied charge."
2. "The question did not involve direct hostility, but a half-awakened conscience and some willingness to be instructed, though a self-righteous desire ‘to get out of the difficulty’ was the leading motive."
3. "My question is not yet answered, the main point is, ‘who is my neighbor.’"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Desiring to justify himself (θελων δικαιωσα εαυτον). The lawyer saw at once that he had convicted himself of asking a question that he already knew."
2. "And who is my neighbour? (κα τις εστιν μου πλησιον?). The Jews split hairs over this question and excluded from 'neighbour' Gentiles and especially Samaritans."
3. "A neighbour is a nigh dweller to one, but the Jews made racial exceptions as many, alas, do today."

### John Gill:
1. "No wonder then that this man was desirous of justifying himself; and in order to which he said, and who is my neighbour?"
2. "For they will not allow a Gentile, no, not even a proselyte of the gate to be a neighbour."
3. "This notion Christ opposes and disproves in the following parable, which is an answer to the lawyer's question."

### John Wesley:
1. To justify himself — That is, to show he had done this. Leviticus 18:5.
