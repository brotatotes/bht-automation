# Luke 10:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves. This message urges believers to go into different places, making preparations for the Lord's work. The Seventy are not restricted from reaching out to Gentiles and Samaritans, and they are given prior knowledge of their route. As they embark on this mission, they are reminded of the risks and challenges they will face - like lambs among wolves. However, they are encouraged to embrace their vulnerability and carry a message of hope, grace, and peace to a world desperately in need.
