# Luke 10:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As the parable illustrates, even an enemy can demonstrate kindness and mercy towards someone in distress, challenging our understanding of who our neighbor truly is. The rocky and desolate road from Jerusalem to Jericho served as a notorious setting for robberies and violence, highlighting the cruel nature of humanity. The particular circumstances of the parable, taking place near Bethany on the outskirts of a desolate desert, reflect the timely and relevant teachings of Jesus. The incident itself conveys how essential it is for us to recognize and respond to the needs of others, regardless of our differences.
