# Luke 10:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parable highlights the unexpected nature of opportunities to do good, orchestrated by divine providence. The priest, possibly returning from temple duties, neglected mercy and passed by without examining the wounded man. Pride seemed to drive his actions as he disregarded compassion. This story serves as a reminder that true righteousness extends beyond religious duty, urging us to show kindness and empathy to all, even those considered outsiders or enemies. It challenges us to examine our motives, ensuring we do not fall into the trap of self-righteousness and neglecting those in need.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Many priests journeyed this way, for Jericho was a priestly city; this man is perhaps represented as having been up to Jerusalem in the order of his course, and returning.".
2. "The Law and Prophets enjoined the act of mercy which this priest refused (see Exodus 23:4-5; Deuteronomy 22:1-4; Isa 58:7); not, it is true, literally, and therefore he neglected it."
3. "ἀντιπαρῆλθεν, he did not even go up to him to examine him, but passed by on the opposite side of the road."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The two here mentioned are supposed, apparently, to be returning from temple duties, but they had not learnt what that meaneth, 'I will have mercy and not sacrifice' [TRENCH]."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "By chance - Accidentally, or as it happened. It means that he did not do it with a ‘design’ to aid the man that was wounded."
2. "A certain priest - It is said that not less than 12,000 priests and Levites dwelt at Jericho...Many of them constantly traveling on that road."
3. "Passed by on the other side - On the farther side of the way. Did not turn out of his course even to come and see him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "By chance [κατα συγκυριαν] . Only here in New Testament. The word means, literally, a coincidence. By coincidence of circumstances." 
2. "Passed by on the other side [αντιπαρηλθεν] . The verb occurs only here and ver. 32."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "As a fact, most opportunities of doing good come as it were 'by chance,' though providentially ordered of God."
2. "The naturalness of the parable is remarkable. Jericho was a priestly city, and the priests would go to and from Jerusalem to perform their duties in the order of their courses. The case is more pointed, if this one is regarded as coming from priestly duty in the house of God."
3. "Did not even stop to examine the man's condition. In the priest's case, pride seems prominent. In thus acting he disobeyed the spirit, though not the letter of the Mosaic law."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "By chance (κατα συγκυριαν). Here only in the N.T., meaning rather, 'by way of coincidence.' It is a rare word elsewhere and in late writers like Hippocrates."
2. "Passed by on the other side (αντιπαρηλθεν). Second aorist active indicative of αντιπαρερχομα, a late double compound here (verses Luke 10:31; Luke 10:32) only in the N.T., but in the papyri and late writers."
3. "It is the ingressive aorist (ηλθεν), came alongside (παρα), and then he stepped over to the opposite side (αντ) of the road to avoid ceremonial contamination with a stranger."

### John Gill:
1. "Nor was this a chance matter with respect to God, by whose providence all things are ordered, directed, and governed."
2. "When he saw him naked, and in such a bloody condition, he might take him for one really dead, and therefore crossed the way on purpose, lest he should any ways touch him, and be defiled by him, and so break the law, and incur the penalty of it."
3. "Or rather, through hardness of heart, and want of compassion."

### John Wesley:
1. "For if we speak strictly, there is no such thing in the universe as either chance or fortune."
2. "Is it not an emblem of many living characters, perhaps of some who bear the sacred office?"
3. "O house of Levi and of Aaron, is not the day coming, when the virtues of heathens and Samaritans will rise up in judgment against you?"
