# Luke 10:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
No mercy is offered by the law, as it demands perfection without compromise or allowance for human weakness. This does not change under the Gospel, where even imperfect but sincere obedience is insufficient. The law's purpose is to expose the wounds of sin, leaving one without healing or a solution. It is clear that the law alone cannot offer the redemption necessary for salvation.
