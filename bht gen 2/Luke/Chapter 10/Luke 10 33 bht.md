# Luke 10:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parable effectively illustrates the distress of the Jew and the mercy of the Samaritan. By portraying the Jew as the one in need, it highlights the compassion shown by the Samaritan. This scenario makes even the scribe realize the virtues of such conduct and leaves no room for prejudice to hinder the impact on the heart.
