# Luke 10:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The man is left in capable hands, just as Christ leaves his people to rely on him by faith. Baptism and the Lord's supper, two sacred practices entrusted to ministers by Christ, serve the good of the church. Faithful ministers invest themselves, enduring great expense and toil to care for the souls of men, and Christ assures them that their efforts will be repaid.
