# Luke 10:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The priest and Levite, who were supposed to be the religious leaders, did nothing to help the wounded man. In contrast, the despised Samaritan showed kindness and generosity by tending to his needs and going above and beyond to ensure his recovery. Jesus presents this scenario to challenge the lawyer's understanding of who truly acts as a neighbor in times of need.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The reason of this is to be found, partly in the relation of neighbourship being mutual, so that if this man is my neighbour, I am his also."
2. "Observe γεγονέναι, to have become neighbour. The neighbour Jews became strangers, the stranger Samaritan became neighbour, to the wounded traveller."
3. "It is not place, but love, which makes neighbourhood."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "Compelling the lawyer to give a reply very different from what he would like—not only condemning his own nation, but those of them who should be the most exemplary."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jesus in this beautiful narrative showed him who and what a neighbor was, and he did this in a way that disarmed his prejudice, deeply affected him in regard to his own duty, and evinced the beauty of religion."
 
2. "Had he 'at first' told him that a Samaritan might be a neighbor to a Jew and deserve his kindness, he would have been at once revolted at it; but when, by a beautiful and affecting narrative, he brought the 'man himself' to see that it might be, he was constrained to admit it."
 
3. "Here we see the beauty of a parable and its use. It disarmed prejudice, fixed the attention, took the mind gently yet irresistibly, and prevented the possibility of cavil or objection."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Jesus throws himself back to the time of the story."
2. "The neighbor Jews became strangers. The stranger Samaritan became neighbor to the wounded traveler."
