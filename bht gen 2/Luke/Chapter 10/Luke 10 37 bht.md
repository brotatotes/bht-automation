# Luke 10:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This parable reminds us that acts of charity and mercy are derived from the great act of mercy that Jesus came to perform. It challenges us to extend love and kindness to all, regardless of nationality or religion, and to break down barriers and prejudices. By showing compassion and care for others, we reflect the love of Christ and fulfill the command to love our neighbor as ourselves. Let us go and do likewise, treating every person as our neighbor and embracing a spirit of inclusivity, generosity, and selflessness.
