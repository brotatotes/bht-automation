# Luke 10:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Martha, the older sister and mistress of the house, warmly received Jesus into her home, showing her hospitality and belief in him as the true Messiah. This example reminds us that Jesus selflessly devoted himself to doing good and teaches us to humbly serve others in righteousness, without thinking more highly of ourselves.
