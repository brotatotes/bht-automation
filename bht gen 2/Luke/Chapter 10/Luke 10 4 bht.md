# Luke 10:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To ensure the prompt completion of their important mission, the messengers were instructed to avoid time-consuming greetings and salutations customary in the Orient. These salutations involved multiple embraces, inclinations, and even prostrations, which could lead to delays and distractions. By refraining from these rituals, the messengers could dedicate their time and attention to the urgent task at hand. The urgency of their mission required them to forego these common civilities and prioritize the swift delivery of their message. Efficiency and expediency were paramount, and they were encouraged to navigate past these customary exchanges in order to fulfill their calling.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "Salutations among the Orientals did not consist, as among us, of a slight bow or an extension of the hand, but was performed by many embraces and inclinations, and even prostrations of the body on the ground." 
2. "There is such an amount of insincerity, flattery, and falsehood in the terms of salutation prescribed by etiquette, that our Lord, who is truth itself, desired his representatives to dispense with them as far as possible, perhaps tacitly to rebuke them."
3. "The command of our Saviour strictly forbade all such loiterings. They would waste time, distract attention, and in many ways hinder the prompt and faithful discharge of their important mission."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Purse [Î²Î±Î»Î»Î±Î½Ï„Î¹Î¿Î½] . Used by Luke only. For money. Scrip (phran). For victuals."
