## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "περισπᾷ περὶ τὰς ἔξω στρατείας τὸν δῆμον" - It exactly answers to the Latin 'torqueor' used in the same connexion by Horace, Sat. ii. 8. 67, and to a midland provincial expression 'to be put about,' meaning to be 'distracted with officious care.'
2. "ἐπιστ., generally, but not always, used by Luke of a sudden coming into presence." - It looks here as if our Lord were teaching in another apartment from that where the διακονία was going on: this appears also in the κατέλειπεν.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "cumbered—"distracted."
2. "came to him—"presented herself before Him," as from another apartment, in which her sister had "left her to serve (or make preparation) alone."
3. "carest thou not . . . my sister, c.—"Lord, here am I with everything to do, and this sister of mine will not lay a hand to anything thus I miss something from Thy lips, and Thou from our hands."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Martha was cumbered about much serving - Was much distracted with the cares of the family, and providing suitably to entertain the Saviour."
2. "Her anxiety was to provide suitable entertainment for the Lord Jesus. As mistress of the family, this care properly devolved on her; and the only fault which can be charged on her was too earnest a desire to make such entertainment, when she might have sat with Mary at his feet."
3. "Dost thou not care ... - This was an improper reproof of our Lord, as if 'he' encouraged Mary in neglecting her duty."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Martha's attention, instead of centering around Jesus, was drawn hither and thither." 
2. "Came up to him, suddenly stopping in her hurry."
3. "Take hold and do her part along with me."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Bustling people are bustling in religion just as they are in the kitchen or work-shop."
2. "Busy, restless Christians are constantly thinking that the Lord approves their conduct more than that of the quieter class."
3. "This suggests that Mary had been helping her sister, but felt that she could use the time more profitably."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "One has sometimes seen women whose faces are literally drawn round with anxiety, with a permanent twist, distracted in mind and in looks."
2. "She came up to him... stepping up to or bursting in or upon Jesus. It is an explosive act as is the speech of Martha."
3. "Martha feels that Jesus is the key to Mary's help... a beautiful word, to take hold oneself (middle voice) at his end of the task (αντ) together with (συν) one."

### John Gill:
1. "Being taken up in providing for him, and those that came with him; in dressing food, or in ordering her servants, how she would have everything done."
2. "She did not sit down at his feet, as Mary did, to hear his word, but stood as about to go away again, after she had said what she came about."
3. "She seems to speak, not only by way of complaint of Mary, who had left her to prepare and serve up this entertainment alone; but even of Christ himself, in some sort, as if he had not showed that care and concern in this matter, which she thought was necessary."

### John Wesley:
1. "Martha was encumbered - [it] admirably expresses the situation of a mind, surrounded... with so many objects of care, that it hardly knows which to attend to first."
