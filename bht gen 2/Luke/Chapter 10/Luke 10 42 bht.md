# Luke 10:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:

It is an invitation to reflect upon your choices and to ensure that you are pursuing what truly matters in life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Short work and little of it suffices for Me" is the basis of something far loftier than any precept on economy.
2. Mary's choice was better than Martha's because it was spiritual and eternal, while Martha's services would die with her.
3. A Church full of Marys would be as great an evil as a Church full of Marthas. Both are needed, each to be the complement of the other.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "But one thing is needful - That is, religion, or piety. This is eminently and especially needful. Other things are of little importance. This should be secured first, and then all other things will be added."
2. "It is of more importance to attend to the instructions of the Lord Jesus than to be engaged in the affairs of the world. The one will abide forever; the other will be but for a little time."
3. "Piety is the chief thing needed. Other things will perish. We shall soon die. All that we can gain we must leave. But the 'soul' will live. There is a judgment-seat; there is a heaven; there is a hell; and 'all' that is needful to prepare us to die, and to make us happy forever, is to be a friend of Jesus, and to listen to his teaching."

### John Calvin:
1. "But Christ had quite another design, which was, that whatever believers may undertake to do, and in whatever employments they may engage, there is one object to which every thing ought to be referred."
2. "The hospitality of Martha was faulty in this respect, that she neglected the main business, and devoted herself entirely to household affairs."
3. "Mary hath chosen the good part...a holy and profitable employment, in which she ought not to be disturbed."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The contrast with the preceding verse shows that this clause means: one thing is needful as the proper object of the anxiety and carefulness which we may manifest in receiving the Lord."
2. "Mary’s choice proved what the ‘one thing’ was, and that anxiety about the ‘many’ others was unnecessary. ‘The good part’ chosen by her, in receiving the Saviour, was: undivided devotion to His word."
3. "The possession of this ‘part’ is eternal. Both of these women loved the Saviour; Martha is not the type of a worldly woman, nor is the ‘one thing’ conversion."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The good portion (την αγαθην μεριδα). The best dish on the table, fellowship with Jesus."
2. "Salvation is not 'the good portion' for Martha had that also."
3. "Jesus pointedly takes Mary's side against Martha's fussiness."

### John Gill:
1. "Ordinarily speaking, [hearing the word] is necessary to the knowledge of Christ, and salvation by him."
2. "Christ's meaning seems plainly to be, that Mary hearing the word from his mouth, and at his feet, was one necessary thing, in opposition to Martha's many unnecessary ones."
3. "The part she chose is, that which shall not be taken away from her; by men or devils: faith which comes by hearing of the word, and so every other grace of the Spirit is what can never be lost."

### John Wesley:
1. Mary hath chosen the good part — To save her soul. Reader, hast thou?
