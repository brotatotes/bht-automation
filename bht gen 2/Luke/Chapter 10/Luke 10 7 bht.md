# Luke 10:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do not be fickle and inconstant, going from house to house in search of better lodging and entertainment. Your diet is a debt, not a gratuity, and by staying in one house, you honor the worthiness of the laborer and the hospitality of the host. Be content with what is set before you and do not seek worldly indulgences, for the true reward lies not in material comforts but in the fulfillment of your mission. Trust in the providence of God, who sustains and provides for those who endeavor in His service.
