# Luke 10:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When faced with what is set before you, whether it be humble or unappealing, do not object but accept with gratitude. Remember not to consider yourself unworthy of something good or burdensome to others, but partake as if it were your own. Refrain from getting caught up in irrelevant details concerning cleanliness or proper procedures, but instead embrace and enjoy what is given to you without hesitation. Though these directions may seem simple and ordinary, they hold essential lessons for teachers and preachers, emphasizing the importance of gratitude, humility, and a focus on the true substance rather than superficial matters.
