# Luke 11:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus was in Galilee, He voluntarily provided instructions on prayer without being asked, but now in Judea, a disciple approached Him and requested guidance in prayer. This disciple recognized Jesus as the most qualified person to teach them, surpassing even John. It is likely that the disciples were inspired by Jesus' own prayer practices. Jesus, in response, shared a condensed version of the Model Prayer, emphasizing that it was not intended to be a ritual.
