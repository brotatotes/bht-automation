# Luke 11:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When someone prays with the right intentions, methods, and desired outcomes, regardless of who they are, God listens and grants their requests. If a person not only prays but also diligently seeks God through other means and ordinances, they will eventually find what their soul is searching for. Persistence is key in prayer, for even if there seems to be a delay, if one continues to knock on God's door, it will eventually be opened.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Gill:
1. "when a man is right in the object of prayer, and in the matter and manner of prayer, and in the end he proposes to himself, let him be what he will, of whatsoever nation, or ever mean a person, he has the petitions which he asks" 
2. "whoever not only prays, but makes use of means, as attendance on other ordinances, and is diligent in the use of them, sooner or later finds his account herein, and what his soul seeks for"
3. "who is importunate, and will have no denial; continues knocking; though there may be some time a seeming delay, yet the door will not always be shut to him; after much knocking it will be opened"
