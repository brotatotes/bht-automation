# Luke 11:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do any of you, who are fathers, understand the close and natural relationship between a father and a son? If your son were to ask you for a loaf of bread, would you give him a stone instead, demonstrating a heart that is as hard, or even harder, than the stone itself? It is difficult to imagine parents who could be so inhuman and brutish, yet some ancient manuscripts do not contain the references to the loaf and the stone, instead only mentioning the fish and the serpent, as well as the egg and the scorpion.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Of any of you [τινα]. The A. V. renders as though the pronoun were indefinite; but it is interrogative and commences the sentence."
2. "Rev., therefore, rightly, of which of you that is a father, etc."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The text of Westcott and Hort makes τον πατερα (the father) in apposition with τινα (of whom) and in the accusative the object of αιτησε (shall ask) which has also another accusative (both person and thing) 'a loaf.'"
2. "It is a very awkward piece of Greek and yet it is intelligible."
3. "Some of the old MSS. do not have the part about 'loaf' and 'stone,' but only the two remaining parts about 'fish' and 'serpent,' 'egg' and 'scorpion.' The same difficult construction is carried over into these questions also."

### John Gill:
1. "The relation between a father and a son is natural, and it is very near."
2. "Should he do so, he would show that his heart was as hard, or harder than the stone he gives."
3. "Such inhuman brutish parents are not surely to be found."
