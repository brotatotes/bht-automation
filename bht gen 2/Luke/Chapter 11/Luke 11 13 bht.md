# Luke 11:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
How much more beautiful is the gradation of blessings from our heavenly Father! Just as earthly parents know how to give good gifts to their children, our loving God is even more willing to give us the best gift of all - the Holy Spirit. He is a friend, a father, and the source of every good gift.
