# Luke 11:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus encountered a man who was both deaf and mute due to being possessed by a demon, he cast out the demon, restoring the man's ability to speak. This miraculous act caused amazement among the people, leading them to believe that Jesus must be the long-awaited Messiah, the son of David. This event is reminiscent of the similar instance mentioned in Matthew 12:22, where Jesus also casts out a demon from a man who was both deaf and mute, emphasizing the authority and power of Christ over demonic forces.
