# Luke 11:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is interesting to note that the Pharisees, who could not bear the thought of Jesus being the Messiah, put a negative spin on his miracles, attributing them to the power of Beelzebub, the lord of flies. This accusation was not only blasphemous, as seen in Judea and Galilee, but also absurd, as Jesus himself pointed out that it would make no sense for Satan to cast out Satan. The term Beelzebub carried significance both in heathen worship and Jewish culture, further emphasizing the depth of opposition against Jesus.
