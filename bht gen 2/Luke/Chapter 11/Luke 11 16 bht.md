# Luke 11:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
And others, seeking to put Jesus to the test, asked him for a sign from heaven. They were not truly seeking to understand and believe in Jesus, but rather they wanted to challenge him and find a reason to discredit him. Their demand for a sign from heaven was not driven by a genuine desire for faith, but rather by a desire to validate their doubts and continue in their unbelief.
