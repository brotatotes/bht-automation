# Luke 11:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus addresses the concept of division within Satan's kingdom, highlighting the contradiction in their accusations. By repeating the charge made against him, Jesus questions how Satan's kingdom can remain intact if it is divided. This statement reflects an adaptation of the parables or proverbial sentences and suggests that if Satan is against himself, his kingdom cannot endure. Thus, Jesus challenges the baseless accusation of casting out demons through Beelzebub, asserting the illogicality of Satan dividing against himself, which is not a reasonable assumption.
