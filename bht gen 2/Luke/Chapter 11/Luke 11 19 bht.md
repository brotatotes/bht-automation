# Luke 11:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, Jesus addresses a group of individuals who claim that he casts out demons through the power of Beelzebub. He challenges them by asking how their own sons are able to cast out demons and in whose name they do so. This raises the question of why they would attribute the casting out of demons by Christ to diabolical assistance. It's evident that Jesus is pointing out the absurdity of their accusation. Additionally, their own judgment will serve as evidence against them, ultimately condemning their flawed argument.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For sake of argument, Jesus here assumes that he casts out demons by Beelzebub."
2. "The conclusion is a reductio ad absurdum."
3. "The Jewish exorcists practiced incantations against demons (Acts 19:13)."

### John Gill:
1. "By whom do your sons cast them out? by whose help? or in whose name? [...] why should they ascribe the ejection of devils by Christ, to a diabolical assistance?" 
2. "Therefore shall they be your judges; or 'judges against you', as the Arabic version; or 'shall reprove you', as the Ethiopic; convict and condemn you."
