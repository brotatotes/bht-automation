# Luke 11:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus speaks to his disciples, his instructions apply to all of them. In this case, he gives them a prayer that is meant to be a model for all their prayers. It is not just a general teaching, but a specific formula to follow in their own conversations with God. The last petition from this prayer is omitted in the Latin version, but the original form includes it, emphasizing the importance of seeking deliverance from evil.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "On the prayer itself, see notes on Matthew 6:9-13."
2. "The clauses not found in the text could hardly by any possibility have been omitted by any, had they ever formed a part of it."
3. "The doxology was inserted there, because that was the form in general liturgical use, and not here, because this form was never used liturgically."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 2-4. (See on  :-).

### John Gill:
1. "Jesus directed his speech to all the disciples...the instructions Christ was about to give concerned them all."
