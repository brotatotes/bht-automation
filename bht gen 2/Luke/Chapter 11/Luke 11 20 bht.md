# Luke 11:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The power to cast out devils is a manifestation of the finger of God, the living Personal Agent of the power of God. This power is not achieved through the labor of human effort but rather by a power that is clearly divine. When the kingdom of God comes upon individuals, it often comes unexpectedly and without warning. The works done by the finger of God are a display of the hand of the Lord, a powerful and divine presence that cannot be overlooked.
