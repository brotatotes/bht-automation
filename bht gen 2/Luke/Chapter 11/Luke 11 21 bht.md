# Luke 11:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The strong man, who is the devil, is fully armed with his own temptations and the sins and lusts of men. He dwells in the corrupt heart of an unregenerate man, ruling over his desires and carnal affections. In this heart, there is no concern for sin or any sense of danger, and the person lives in a false sense of security. But we must be aware of the devil's power and not be deceived by his subtle tactics.
