# Luke 11:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ, the mighty God, has triumphed over sin, Satan, and the law, redeeming His people from their clutches. Through His victory, He weakens the power of sin and removes its dominion, ensuring that those who are called by His grace cannot be destroyed by sin or Satan. He spoils the heart of man, transforming it from a dwelling place for evil into a palace for Himself. His work in the hearts and minds of believers enlightens, awakens, and purges them, making them vessels for His glory.
