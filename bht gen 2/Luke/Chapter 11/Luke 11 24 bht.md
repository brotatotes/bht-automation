# Luke 11:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When a person is freed from an unclean spirit, the spirit seeks new dwelling places in impure hearts. Luke 11:24-26 compares this to evil spirits finding satisfaction in idols and superstitions, like goblins and Lilith. Luke excludes the mention of the fate awaiting the evil generation but reminds us of the seven demons that afflicted Mary Magdalene. Jesus warns of the danger of a heart freed from evil but failing to find true rest in Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The haunts of evil spirits... goblins shaped like goats... a remnant of the Egyptian worship of Mendes or Pan."
2. "The screech-owl shall rest there... the night-monster (Hebrew, Lilith)... a popular superstition that Lilith, Adam's first wife, forsook him and became a demon."
3. "Rest."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Luke 11:24-26 is almost verbatim like Matthew 12:43-45, which see."
2. "And Luke omits: 'Even so shall it be also unto this evil generation' of Matthew 12:45."
3. "The seven demons brought back remind one of the seven that afflicted Mary Magdalene (Luke 8:2)."

### John Gill:
1. "When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man.... whose hearts are unclean like himself, wherefore there he delights to dwell."
2. "He walketh through dry places...whither Satan might go, being disturbed in Judea...or rather leaving for a while the Scribes and Pharisees, who outwardly appeared righteous before men, he went to the Gentiles."
3. "He saith, I will return unto my house, whence I came out; to the Jews again, who were blinded and filled with rage and enmity to the Gospel by him."
