# Luke 11:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The emptiness of a life devoid of goodness is exposed, even in the midst of external appearances of righteousness. When one's heart is filled with anger and hostility towards Christ and His Gospel, it becomes a breeding ground for evil and becomes susceptible to the influence of Satan. This is a reflection of the state of the Jewish nation after Christ's death until the destruction of Jerusalem, illustrating the consequences of rejecting the truth and the subsequent vulnerability to spiritual darkness.
