# Luke 11:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The description of a man whose condition deteriorates from bad to worse is demonstrated in the account of the temple and the behavior of the Jews. As recorded by Josephus, their state of wickedness and misery escalated after the ascension of Christ, culminating in their eventual destruction by the Romans. This serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences that await when one turns away from God and succumbs to moral decline.

### John Wesley:
1.
