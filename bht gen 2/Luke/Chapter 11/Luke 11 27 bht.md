# Luke 11:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The woman exclaimed, Blessed is the womb that bore you, and the breasts at which you nursed! It is natural for a woman to express such admiration, highlighting the honorable role of being the mother of Jesus. Our Lord's response, though gentle, gently corrects her misperception.
