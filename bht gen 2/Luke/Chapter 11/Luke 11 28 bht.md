# Luke 11:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Blessed are those who hear the word of God and keep it, for this is a greater happiness than being related to Christ in the flesh. Though Mary was blessed in bearing such a son, it is even more blessed to hear and follow the word of God. Merely hearing and believing is not enough; it is necessary to put what is heard into practice. Mary's blessedness, like that of all humanity, comes from being among those who hear and keep the word of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "The ground of her blessedness, as in the case of all the human race, unto whom in the highest sense, ‘a child is born, a son is given,’ is that she too belonged to them that hear the word of God and keep it."
2. "This woman truly represents devout Roman Catholics in their Adoration of the Virgin. The Ave Maria, as they use it, is but a repetition of her words; and their religious enthusiasm too often manifests the same unintelligent wonder, which is here kindly reproved by our Lord."
3. "His answer gives prominence not to His own word, but to ‘the word of God;’ for though they are the same, the woman was thinking solely of His human birth, and not of His heavenly Father; and this mistake He would correct."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus in contrast turns attention to others and gives them a beatitude."
2. "The originality of Christ's reply guarantees its historical character."
3. "Such a comment is beyond the reach of an inventor."

### John Gill:
1. "Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God and keep it; intimating, that though his mother was happy in bearing and suckling such a son, yet it was a far greater happiness to hear the word of God."
2. "This is a greater happiness than to be related to Christ in the flesh, though ever so nearly."
3. "Barely to hear the word, and even give an assent to it, will be of little avail, unless what is heard and believed is put in practice."

### John Wesley:
1. "Yea, rather blessed are they that hear the word of God and keep it."
2. "For if even she that bare him had not done this, she would have forfeited all her blessedness."
