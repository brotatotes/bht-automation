# Luke 11:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage portrays a vivid picture of the crowds gathered around Jesus, possibly in expectation of a sign. However, instead of providing a miraculous sign, Jesus proclaims that the generation is evil. He confronts their desire for more signs, saying that only the sign of Jonah, the resurrection, will be given. This teaches us that seeking additional signs reveals a lack of faith in the sufficiency of Jesus' message.
