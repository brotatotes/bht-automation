# Luke 11:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Just as Jonah served as a sign to the Ninevites, so too will the Son of Man be a sign to the people of that generation. This sign refers to Jesus' resurrection after three days and nights in the heart of the earth, which confirms his identity as the Messiah and the Son of God. This miraculous sign is given to warn the unbelieving generation of the consequences of remaining impenitent and facing the full wrath of God.
