# Luke 11:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Luke 11:31, it is revealed that the sign given to this generation is even greater than what the queen of the South witnessed. When all rise from the dead on the last day, the queen of the South, a heathen, will stand alongside the men of the present generation among the Jews. Her actions will serve as evidence against them, intensifying their condemnation. She traveled from a far-off land to hear Solomon's wisdom, but now we have someone even greater than Solomon among us.
