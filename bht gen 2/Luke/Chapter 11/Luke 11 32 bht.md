# Luke 11:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The men of Nineveh shall rise up in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold a greater than Jonas is here. These men, though heathens and strangers to the covenants of promise, turned from their sins at the mere preaching of Jonah. However, their repentance was short-lived as they relapsed into wickedness before their eventual destruction. The comparison is telling, for even though the Jews had the Son of God himself among them, they remained impenitent and unbelieving, leading to their downfall just like the Ninevites.

2. "What in this case will aggravate the condemnation of the Jews in the day of judgment is, that these men were Heathens, aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, and were not used to have prophets sent to them; and yet as soon as Jonas, a mere man, came to them, and preached but one sermon among them, they repented of their sins, and turned from them."
