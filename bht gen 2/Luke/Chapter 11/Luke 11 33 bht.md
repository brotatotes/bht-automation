# Luke 11:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's word is like a light that illuminates the path of those who follow it. In the Bible, it is said that the light should not be hidden, but should shine brightly for all to see. Just as a candle should not be hidden under a bushel or a lamp placed under a bed, the message of the Gospel is meant to be shared openly and freely. It is through the clear and powerful ministry of Christ that this light is brought to the world. The Jews, however, failed to recognize and embrace this light, preferring darkness instead.
