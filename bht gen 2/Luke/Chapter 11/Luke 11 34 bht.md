# Luke 11:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When we aim our focus and desires away from God and towards worldly things, we are filled with folly, sin, and misery. However, when our eye is pure and directed towards God, our understanding is enlightened, bringing light, joy, and comfort to our souls. It is this understanding that serves as a guide for all the faculties of our being, leading us towards truth and righteousness. Ultimately, it is through the illumination of our understanding by the Spirit of God that we can experience the fullness of light and be freed from the darkened state of ignorance and blindness.
