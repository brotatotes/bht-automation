# Luke 11:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, in his usual manner of challenging religious traditions, disregarded the outward ceremonies of human invention. He willingly accepted the invitation to the morning meal, which was a common practice after morning prayers. By doing so, Jesus showed that God values spiritual righteousness over external cleanliness. Though aware that his actions might offend some, Jesus chose to prioritize the true intentions of the heart over superficial rituals.
