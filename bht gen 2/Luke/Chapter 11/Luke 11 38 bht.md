# Luke 11:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus was amazed that the Pharisees placed such importance on their tradition of ceremonial washing, even immersing their entire bodies in water. He found it perplexing that someone as religious and holy as a Pharisee would neglect a common custom, especially when in a crowd. Jesus defended the freedom of the people and opposed the unnecessary burden of this tradition, emphasizing the need to prioritize God's commands over man-made rituals. The act of washing hands, originally intended for purification, had been exaggerated by the Pharisees into a ceremonial obligation, rather than a practical act of cleanliness.
