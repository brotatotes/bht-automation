# Luke 11:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is important to understand that when we pray forgive us; for we forgive them, it is not a one-time act, but a continuous state of forgiving. This act of forgiveness is not the meritorious cause of our own pardon, but rather the removal of the hindrance that would otherwise make forgiveness impossible. It is through our willingness to continually forgive others that we open ourselves up to receiving God's forgiveness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The plea for the exercise of divine forgiveness to us, 'for it is our own practice also to forgive.'"
2. "The difference here is no ἁμαρτία between man and man, only the ordinary business word of this world."
3. "This varied expression may serve to show how far 'Luke's reporter' was from misunderstanding the words of the Lord, that reporter being no other than the Holy Spirit Himself."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "We pray, therefore, 'suffer us not to be drawn away by our own lusts: keep us out of the power of our own evil hearts." 
2. "Thou knowest our frame, and rememberest that we are dust. Remember our weakness."
3. "To pray that God will not bring us within the possibility of temptation, would be to ignore our manhood, or to pray to be taken out of the world. But we may pray, and will surely pray, the more keenly conscious we become of the weakness of our nature, that God will not suffer the trials of life to become temptations to evil."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For we ourselves also forgive, 'this is our own practice.' More strongly expressed than in Matthew."
2. "Every one that is indebted to us. We cannot forgive 'sins,' as such, that belongs to God; but only as obligations from man to man represented by the commercial phrase 'indebted.'"

### John Gill:
1. "The doxology there used, and the word 'Amen', are here omitted. Some of the petitions in this prayer are not delivered in the very same words as they are in Matthew."
2. "And these verbal variations, though the sense is the same, together with the omission of the doxology, and the word 'Amen', show, that this prayer was not designed to be an exact form, and to be so used, but as a directory of prayer."
3. "And though forms of prayer might not be in use among the Jews in the times of Christ, yet it is easy to account for it, how Christ came to be acquainted with the petitions in general use with good men." (129 words)

### John Wesley:
1. "Forgive us; for we forgive them — Not once, but continually."
2. "This does not denote the meritorious cause of our pardon; but the removal of that hinderance which otherwise would render it impossible."
