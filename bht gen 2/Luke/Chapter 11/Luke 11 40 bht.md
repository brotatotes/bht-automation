# Luke 11:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is not enough to focus on external cleanliness; we must also pay attention to what fills our hearts. Just as we clean the inside of a cup or platter, we should ensure that our thoughts and intentions are pure. This means not only adorning ourselves on the outside but also cleansing our inner being. Both our physical and spiritual cleanliness matter because it is God who not only made our bodies but also our souls. We should strive for inward righteousness along with a spirit of brotherly love in order to truly have a clean and pure heart.
