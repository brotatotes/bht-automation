# Luke 11:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Give generously to those in need, for by doing so, you demonstrate that your heart is pure. Rather than focusing solely on external rituals or appearances, embrace the inward righteousness that comes from a sincere and selfless love for others. When you give of your possessions to the poor, you exemplify a true repentance and reject any ill-gotten gains. Let your actions reflect the genuine transformation within and no longer be burdened by the consciousness of hoarding unjust wealth.
