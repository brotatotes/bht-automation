# Luke 11:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The deception of the Pharisees is likened to hidden graves or whited sepulchres, which appear clean and respectable on the surface, but hide inner corruption and defilement. Men, going about their daily lives, walk over these unseen tombs and soil themselves with unwitting contact. The comparison serves to highlight the discrepancy between the external display of righteousness and the true nature of the Pharisees' hearts. Their hypocrisy and false teachings can lead others astray, much like stumbling upon hidden graves without realizing the harm they can cause.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The point of comparison is different. There the sepulchres are whited, that men may not pass over them unawares: and the comparison is to the outside fairness, and inside abomination." 
2. "Here, the graves are not seen, and men thinking they are walking on clean ground are defiled by passing over them."
3. "Perhaps the difference of expression may have been occasioned by the greater wealth and splendour and display of the Pharisees in the metropolis."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "As one might unconsciously walk over a grave concealed from view, and thus contract ceremonial defilement, so the plausible exterior of the Pharisees kept people from perceiving the pollution they contracted from coming in contact with such corrupt characters."
2. "(See Psalms 5:9 Romans 3:13; a different illustration from Matthew 23:27)."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Tombs which appear not [œÑŒ± ŒºŒΩŒ∑ŒºŒµŒπŒ± œÑŒ± Œ±Œ¥Œ∑ŒªŒ±] . Lit., the tombs, the unseen ones." 
2. "That walk over [œÄŒµœÅŒπœÄŒ±œÑŒøœÖŒΩœÑŒµœÇ] . The participle, and without the article; and therefore better, as they walk; walk about [œÄŒµœÅŒπ] on their daily business." 
3. "Here they are not seen, and men walking on them are unconsciously defiled."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The ‚Äòwhited sepulchres‚Äô were those of the rich, and the application is to external beauty covering inner corruption."
2. "Here humbler tombs are spoken of, which in the course of time would be unnoticed by those passing over them, thus causing defilement."
3. "There the pretence of Pharisaism is brought out; here its insidiousness."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The tombs which appear not (œÑŒ± ŒºŒΩŒ∑ŒΩŒµŒπŒ± œÑŒ± Œ±Œ¥Œ∑ŒªŒ±). These hidden graves would give ceremonial defilement for seven days (Numbers 19:16)."
2. "Men do not know how rotten they are."
3. "These three woes cut to the quick and evidently made the Pharisees wince."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ compares the Pharisees, because of their hypocrisy, and secret iniquity, both to whited sepulchres, and to those that were not: to those that were, because, like them, they looked beautiful without, and righteous in the sight of men, and yet were inwardly full of all manner of pollution and sin."
2. "They did not appear to be what they were, and men were deceived by them; and under specious pretences to religion and holiness, were by their corrupt doctrines and practices unawares drawn into the commission of sin."
3. "Regard may not only be had to graves covered with grass, or not marked with lime, by which they might be known; but also to what the Jews call 'the grave of the abyss,' a grave that is not known no more than if it was in the bottomless pit."

### John Wesley:
1. "For ye are as graves which appear not... so that men are not aware, till they stumble upon them, and either hurt themselves, or at least are defiled by touching them."
2. "On another occasion Christ compared them to whited sepulchres, fair without, but foul within."
