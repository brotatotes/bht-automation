# Luke 11:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This man, a νομικός, whose duty was to interpret the law and not merely a common Pharisee, felt uneasy when he observed that Jesus reproached both the Pharisees and the Scribes. As a lawyer himself, he realized that Jesus' words applied to him as well. Jesus did not abuse or insult them, but faithfully reproved them and spoke the unvarnished truth, which can be uncomfortable to hear. Such faithfulness is rare, but it can elicit reactions of flinching or even rage when it is used.
