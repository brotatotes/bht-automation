# Luke 11:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Truly, you bear witness to the deeds of your fathers, acknowledging that they indeed killed the prophets. Yet, hypocritically, you build their tombs, pretending to honor them while continuing the same wicked disposition against the messengers of God. You claim to disapprove of the sins of your fathers, but in reality, you neglect and oppose the very teachings that the prophets brought, just as your forefathers did before you.

2. "The words in our text are not indeed a citation, but an amplification of Luk 11:19 there a paraphrase of them, giving the true sense of what the wisdom of God intended by them; enlarging the mere historical notice which laid hold of God’s purpose only by one thread let down to the earth, into the divine revelation of the whole purpose of God as the counsel of His will in heaven."
