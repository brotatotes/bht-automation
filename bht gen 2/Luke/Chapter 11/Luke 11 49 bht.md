The wisdom of God, agreeably to this, hath said that He will send them prophets and apostles, as mentioned in Matthew 23:34. Christ, both as God and as the mediator, possesses the essential wisdom of God and has the spirit of wisdom resting on Him, with the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden in Him. He speaks with confident knowledge of the Divine counsels, knowing that they will act as their fathers did and reject the messengers sent to them, just as they have throughout history.
