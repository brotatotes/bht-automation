# Luke 11:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parable is a reminder to believers not to be discouraged if their prayers are not immediately answered or if they encounter challenges in obtaining their desires. Just as selfish man can be won over by persistent prayer and importunity, we can be certain that our bountiful Lord will bestow his blessings upon us. We must persevere constantly in prayer, even when faced with difficulty or delay. The certainty that our prayers will be heard should give us the confidence to approach God with boldness and persistence.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Now follows a parable on continuing instant in prayer, of the same nature as that in ch. Luke 18:2 ff. In both parables, the argument is ‘à fortiori:’ 'if selfish man can be won by prayer and importunity to give, and unjust man to do right, much more certainly shall the bountiful Lord bestow, and the righteous Lord do justice.'"
2. "And, that we must remember that all reluctance on the part of God to answer our prayers is not real, but apparent only, and arises from deeper reasons working for our good: whereas the reluctance in these two parables is real, arising from selfishness and contempt of justice."
3. "The interrogative form continues to σοι, Luke 11:7, 'Who of you shall be in these supposed circumstances?' λέγω ὑμ.… κ. τ. λ."
