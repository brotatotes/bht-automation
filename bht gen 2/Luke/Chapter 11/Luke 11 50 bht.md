# Luke 11:50 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The punishment that awaits this generation is likened to the divine vengeance that befell the Amorites and the iniquities of Israel. Just as the iniquity of the Amorites and Israel reached its full measure before the wrath of God was unleashed, so too will the accumulated iniquity of this generation bring about the full force of divine judgment upon them. This teaches us the grave consequence of disobedience and serves as a warning for all generations to heed the word of God and turn away from wickedness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "As it was only in the last generation of them that 'the iniquity of the Amorites was full', and then the abominations of ages were at once completely and awfully avenged, so the iniquity of Israel was allowed to accumulate from age to age till in that generation it came to the full, and the whole collected vengeance of Heaven broke at once over its devoted head."
2. "In the first French Revolution the same awful principle was exemplified, and Christendom has not done with it yet."
3. "Prophets - in the New Testament sense."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Divinely ordered sequence, first aorist passive subjunctive of εκζητεω, a late and rare verb outside of LXX and N.T., requiring as a debt the blood of the prophets." 
2. "Perfect passive participle of εκχεω and εκχυννω (an Aeolic form appearing in the margin of Westcott and Hort here, εκχυννομενον, present passive participle)." 
3. "It is a bold metaphor for the purpose of God."

### John Gill:
1. "For there were prophets from the beginning, which prophesied of Christ."
2. "Abel, the son of the first man, was not only a righteous man but a prophet."
3. "Just as in Babylon will be found, when God makes inquisition for blood... the blood of the prophets and saints."

### John Wesley:
1. The blood of all shall be required of this generation — That is, shall be visibly and terribly punished upon it.
