# Luke 11:51 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Within forty years, the temple, the city, and the whole nation faced a dreadful destruction, fulfilling Jesus' prophecy. The mention of Zacharias, who perished between the altar and the temple, is not a reference to a recent murder, but rather the allusion to the murder of Zacharias as the last recorded and most suitable case for illustration. This serves as a reminder that he was the first righteous man to be slain and that his blood, along with that of Abel, would be required of that generation, just as it was at the time of the destruction of Jerusalem.
