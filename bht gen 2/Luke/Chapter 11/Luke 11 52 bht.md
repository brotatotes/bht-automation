# Luke 11:52 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The religious leaders had taken away the key of knowledge by distorting the true interpretation of the scriptures and hindering the people from understanding it correctly. They had arrogated the knowledge to themselves and by their false glosses, they had taken away the true sense of the scriptures from the people. As blind leaders of the blind, they not only refused to enter into the kingdom of heaven themselves but also prevented others from doing so. Their actions reflected a sinful desire to keep people in ignorance and prevent them from embracing the truth found in Jesus.
