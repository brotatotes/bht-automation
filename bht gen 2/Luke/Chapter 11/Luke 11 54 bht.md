# Luke 11:54 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The rabbis, full of anger and opposition, lay in wait for Jesus like hunters seeking to ensnare and entangle him. They watched his every word, diligently looking out for any opportunity to accuse him. Their intention was to catch him in a trap, either accusing him of heresy or sedition. Their rage and determination to silence Jesus can be seen vividly in their actions, treating him as if he were a dangerous beast of prey.
