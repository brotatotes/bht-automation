# Luke 11:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Shall I say Trouble me not like the aorist active deliberative subjunctive in Luke 11:5? Stop furnishing troubles to me by literally knocking at the door and causing me disturbance! The door is shut and cannot be opened without noise and inconvenience. I cannot rise without disturbing my family. I am hesitant to help, but the father represents the heavenly Father we should implore.
