# Luke 11:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If we are shameless in our persistence, not allowing refusal to deter us, then even a reluctant friend will rise to meet our needs. The parable teaches us the power of importunity, where friendship alone may not be enough. It encourages us to be constant and unwavering in our prayers, taking no denial from God and continuing to press on.
