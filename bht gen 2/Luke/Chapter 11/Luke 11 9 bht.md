# Luke 11:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When we ask, seek, and knock, we are not merely going through the motions, but engaging in a profound spiritual practice. Asking involves making specific requests of God, seeking requires diligent pursuit of Christ and divine knowledge, and knocking opens the doors of mercy, fellowship, the Gospel, and heaven itself. These commands reflect the unchanging law of God's Kingdom, assuring us that when we approach God in faith, He will provide what we need and open the way for us to enter into His presence and experience the depths of His grace.
