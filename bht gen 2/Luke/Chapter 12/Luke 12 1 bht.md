# Luke 12:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When a massive crowd gathered, so large that they were stepping on one another, Jesus addressed his disciples. It was crucial that they be cautious of the deceitful ways of the Pharisees. The leaven of the Pharisees, which represents hypocrisy, was a prevalent issue in their teaching and conduct. This hypocrisy, embedded in both their beliefs and actions, has the potential to contaminate and distort one's principles and behaviors over time.
