# Luke 12:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The man, not a disciple but a troubled hearer in the crowd, had been contemplating Jesus' words on Providence. Feeling oppressed by his brother and believing Jesus could set things right, he interrupted the teaching with his request. The intrusion showed a mix of absurdity and irreverence, as he sought Jesus' support in a personal dispute. In seeking Jesus' decision against his brother, he ignored the law's provision for a double portion to the elder and one-third to the younger. His covetousness led him to disregard right doctrine for personal gain.
