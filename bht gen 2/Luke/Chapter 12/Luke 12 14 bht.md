# Luke 12:14 Commentary Help Text

Jesus' response to the situation conveys a clear distinction between his role as a spiritual leader and the secular matters that the man is concerned with. By asking, Who made me a judge? Jesus highlights that his kingdom is not of this world and that he does not have the authority or desire to involve himself in worldly affairs. Instead, his purpose is to focus on preaching the Gospel and tending to the spiritual concerns of individuals.
