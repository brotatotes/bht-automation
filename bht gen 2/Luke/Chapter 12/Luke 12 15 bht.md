# Luke 12:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Beware of covetousness, the insidious inclination to acquire more. Christ's warning applies to all of us, to guard ourselves from this vice as it is the root of all evil. Remember, a person's life does not consist of material possessions, no matter how abundant they may be. True life lies in our connection with God, both in the present and for eternity. Therefore, do not be anxious about obtaining wealth, as it cannot prolong your life. Instead, focus on cultivating a heart that is ready to meet God, for it is in Him that true life is found.

"If we were convinced that riches, and any kind of abundance, are evils of the present life, which the Lord bestows upon us with his own hand, and the use of which is accompanied by his blessing, this single consideration would have a powerful influence in restraining all wicked desires; and this is what believers have come to learn from their own experience."
