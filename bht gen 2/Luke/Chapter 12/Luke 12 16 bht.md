## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Our Lord in this parable sets before us one arrived at the very height of worldly prosperity, and that by no unfair means."
2. "It was by God’s blessing that he became thus rich, which might have been a real blessing, if he had known how to use it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Why is this man called a 'fool?' Because he deemed a life of secure and abundant earthly enjoyment the summit of human felicity."
2. "Because, possessing the means of this, through prosperity in his calling, he flattered himself that he had a long lease of such enjoyment, and nothing to do but give himself up to it."
3. "Nothing else is laid to his charge."

### Albert Barnes:

### John Calvin:
1. "Since the life even of the richest men is taken away in a moment, what avails it that they have accumulated great wealth?"
2. "It is therefore necessary that all should immediately arouse themselves, lest, by imagining their happiness to consist in riches, they entangle themselves in the snares of covetousness."
3. "This parable shows us, first, that the present life is short and transitory. Secondly, it points out to us, that riches are of no avail for prolonging life. We must add a third, which is not expressed, but may easily be inferred from the other two; that it is a most excellent remedy for believers, to ask from the Lord their daily bread, and to rely on his providence alone, whether they are rich or poor."

### Philip Schaff:

3. "Brought forth plentifully (ευφορησεν). Late word from ευφορος (bearing well), in medical writers and Josephus, here only in the N.T."

### John Gill:
1. "Rich men are not always wise in things natural and civil; and very few of them are spiritually wise, or wise in spiritual things, in things which relate to the welfare of their souls."
2. "The word translated 'ground', signifies a 'region', or 'country', which expresses the more, the riches of this man, that he had not a common and ordinary farm, but a whole country as it were; at least a very large part of one, and all this fruitful."
