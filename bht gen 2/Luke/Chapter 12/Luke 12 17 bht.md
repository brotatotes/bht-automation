# Luke 12:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He reasoned within himself, pondering over his perplexity, completely forgetting about God and His role in his prosperity. Instead of considering the needs of others, he only consulted himself and his own selfish desires. Instead of asking what he could do for God, he only thought about what he could do with his earthly possessions. The rich man's focus on worldly wealth and his failure to acknowledge God's providence led him astray. Instead, he should have sought to store up treasures in heaven.
