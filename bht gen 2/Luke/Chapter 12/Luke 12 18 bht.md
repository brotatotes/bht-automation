# Luke 12:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage speaks about a person who plans to tear down their old granaries and build larger ones. This decision was made without seeking God's guidance and solely based on personal gain. The individual takes pride in their own diligence and hard work, attributing the increase of their wealth solely to themselves. With a mindset focused on self-gain, there is no consideration for God's purposes or the needs of others. This serves as a cautionary tale against placing our own desires and material wealth above God and the well-being of our fellow human beings.
