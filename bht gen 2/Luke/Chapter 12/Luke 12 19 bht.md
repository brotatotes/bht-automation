# Luke 12:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The man, consumed by his abundance, foolishly promises himself a long life, forgetting the uncertainty of tomorrow. His eagerness to indulge in earthly pleasures reveals a disregard for the higher pursuits of the soul. Yet riches are fleeting and cannot provide lasting security; they make themselves wings and fly away. One should never trouble themselves about the future, treating each day as it comes, embracing the present moment. Instead of solely seeking to satisfy sensual appetites, we should remember to cultivate our intellect, purify our hearts, and seek the salvation of our souls.

3. "Eat, drink, and be merry - This was just the doctrine of the ancient Epicureans and atheists... What a portion is this for an immortal soul! What folly to think that 'all' that a man lives for is to satisfy his sensual appetites; to forget that he has an intellect to be cultivated, a heart to be purified, a soul to be saved!"
