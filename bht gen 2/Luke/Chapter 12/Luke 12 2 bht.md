No sin can remain concealed forever, not even the most hidden acts of hypocrisy. God has full knowledge of all things and will bring everything into judgment, making the secrets of our hearts known.

It is important to speak and live the truth openly and fearlessly, knowing that all will be revealed in due time.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Covered up [συγκεκαλυμμενον] . Only here in New Testament : implying close concealment.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Covered up (συγκεκαλυμμενον εστιν). Periphrastic perfect passive indicative of συγκαλυπτω, an old verb, but here only in the N.T., to cover up on all sides and so completely."
2. "Verses Luke 12:2-9 here are parallel with Matthew 10:26-33 spoken to the Twelve on their tour of Galilee, illustrating again how often Jesus repeated his sayings unless we prefer to say that he never did so and that the Gospels have hopelessly jumbled them as to time and place."
3. "See the passage in Matthew for discussion of details."

### John Gill:
1. "No sin, be it ever so secret or privately done, as nothing is more covered than hypocrisy, but what shall be detected sooner or later."
2. "How careful soever men may be to hide their vices from others, they are known to God; who will bring every thing into judgment, and make manifest the secrets of all hearts."
3. "These were general sentences, which were used by Christ at different times, upon different occasions, and applied to particular cases."
