# Luke 12:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage highlights the folly of placing one's trust in earthly possessions and pursuits for ultimate satisfaction. The man's selfishness and foolishness are confronted with the truth of his imminent death, emphasizing the importance of personal reflection on the brevity of life. The parable serves as a reminder that one's soul cannot be satisfied with material wealth, as it will be demanded by God's messengers at the appointed time. The man's accumulation of riches proves futile, as it cannot be taken with him beyond death.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "By supposing merely a divine decree to be meant, without personal communication, we lose the impressive part of the parable, where the man’s selfishness and folly is brought into immediate contact with the solemn truth of his approaching death, which certainly our Lord intends us to contemplate."
2. "ἄφρων, opposed to his worldly prudence; ταύτῃ τῇ ν., to the ἔτη πολλά; the ψυχή in the one case, at its ease, eating, drinking, and making merry, to the ψυχή in the other, demanded, rendered up, judged."
3. "αἰτοῦσιν, not strictly impersonal; there are those whose business it is, even the angels, the ministers of the divine purposes: see ch. Luk 6:38 and note. The merely impersonal sense may be defended: cf. Luke 12:48: but this saying seems so solemn, as to require something more."
4. "ἃ ἡτοίμασας, which thou madest ready; but not for thyself."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This sudden cutting short of his career is designed to express not only the folly of building securely upon the future, but of throwing one's whole soul into what may at any moment be gone."
2. ""Thy soul shall be required of thee" is put in opposition to his own treatment of it, 'I will say to my soul, Soul,' &c."
3. "Compare Psalms 39:6, 'He heapeth up riches and knoweth not who shall gather them.'"

### Albert Barnes:

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Is required (ajpaitousin). Lit., they require; i.e., the messengers of God. The indefiniteness is impressive."
2. "God does not say, 'the things which thou hast or possessest.' The whole question of the tenure of his property is opened for the rich man. He had said my fruits and my goods. Now his proprietorship is ignored. They are not his. Whose shall they be? He is to be dispossessed at once."
3. "Zeus replies: 'In the first place, I will deprive men of the foreknowledge of death which they now have. In the second place, they shall be entirely stripped before they are judged, for they shall be judged when they are dead; and the judge, too, shall be naked; that is to say, dead.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "Formerly, the rich man addressed his soul as the seat of all the affections: but now, he speaks of the life itself, or the vital spirit."

2. "They are demanding thy soul from thee."

3. "For which a man is accountable to God, the Father of spirits; and which he requires at a man's hands at death, which is here designed; and shows, that a man has no power over it to retain it, but must give it up when it is called for, even that very instant, 'this night'."

### John Wesley:

2. "To depend on living many years! Yea, one day!"
