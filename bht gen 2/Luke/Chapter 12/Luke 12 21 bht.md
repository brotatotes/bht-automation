# Luke 12:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
One who is rich towards God is someone who places their hope and trust in Him, rather than in worldly riches. They acknowledge that all their wealth comes from God and use it for His glory and the benefit of others. This is in stark contrast to those who foolishly chase after earthly treasures, placing their confidence in uncertain riches. The only wealth that truly matters and lasts is the wealth found in faith, love, and good works towards God.
