## BHT:
Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat. This teaching of Jesus emphasizes the importance of relying on God's provision rather than being consumed by worry.

Instead, they were encouraged to trust in the Lord, who faithfully provides for His people. This passage underscores the confidence we can have in God's provision and reminds us to cast all our cares upon Him.
