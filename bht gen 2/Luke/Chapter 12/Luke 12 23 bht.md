# Luke 12:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Food and clothing are important for our physical well-being, but they should never be prioritized over the value of life itself. Just as life is more than just sustenance, the body is more valuable than the clothing it wears. It is easy for the world to overlook this truth, but it is the Creator who has intricately designed our bodies and will ensure that we have what is necessary. So, let us remember that life and the body are precious gifts that should not be overshadowed by the things that are meant to serve and support them.
