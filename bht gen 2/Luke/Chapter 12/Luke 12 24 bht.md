# Luke 12:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Consider the example of the ravens, which are seen as unclean and of little worth. Yet God takes care of them. Just as farmers sow their seed and gather their harvest into storehouses, God provides for the needs of His creation. If God cares for these insignificant creatures, even more so will He provide for His people. Therefore, there is no reason for the disciples of Christ to doubt the faithfulness of God's providence in their lives. Trust in His care and provision.
