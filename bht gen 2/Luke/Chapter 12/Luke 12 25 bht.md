# Luke 12:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Corroding solicitude will not bring the least of the things one frets about, doubling the evil of wanting them. If not the least, why vex oneself about things of more consequence? Stature, a measure of time, can also refer to the age and continuance of life. Adding a cubit to one's stature was a proverbial expression for making the least addition. Therefore, let go of anxieties and trust in God's provision, for worrying cannot add even the smallest measure to one's life.
