# Luke 12:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Even the smallest acts of control are beyond our ability, such as adding a cubit to one's height. This futility of our attempts to lengthen our lives highlights the point that we should not worry about sustaining our bodies or prolonging our existence. If we cannot extend our lives by our own efforts, how much less can we do so through worry and anxiety? Instead, we should trust in God's providence and focus on more meaningful aspects of life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "A cubit would be infinitesimally small when compared to his length of life, that life being contemplated as a course, or race, which he may attempt, but ineffectually, to prolong."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Not able to do even that which is least" (Î¿Ï…Î´Îµ ÎµÎ»Î±Ï‡Î¹ÏƒÏ„Î¿Î½ Î´Ï…Î½Î±ÏƒÎ¸Îµ). 
2. "Elative superlative, very small." 
3. "This verse not in Matthew and omitted in D."

### John Gill:
1. "If ye then be not able to do that which is least,.... As to make the smallest addition to a man's stature, or rather to add one moment to his days..." 
2. "...why take ye thought for the rest? which are much greater, as to preserve the body in its whole bulk, and all its parts, or for the feeding and clothing of it, or rather for the continuation and preservation of life to any length of time..."
3. "for if it cannot be by all a man's care and solicitude lengthened out one moment longer than is the pleasure of God, how should it be by such anxiety continued for months and years?"
