# Luke 12:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Consider the lilies and how they grow, for what is said next is true of any of them, but particularly of the lilies. They do not labor as humans do, tending to their own growth and beauty. The glory of a lily is natural to it, unlike Solomon's glory, which was only artificial and an imitation of nature.
