# Luke 12:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The grass, which includes all sorts of herbs and flowers, is used by Jesus here as a symbol of God's provision and care. Just as God clothes the grass and lilies with beauty and sustains their existence, how much more will He provide and care for us, His beloved children. We are of greater value and significance than these temporary creations, and our Heavenly Father, in His wisdom and love, will not fail to provide for our needs. Let us trust Him wholeheartedly and not be men of little faith.
