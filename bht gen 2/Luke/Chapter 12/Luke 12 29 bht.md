# Luke 12:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do not give in to anxious thoughts that leave your mind unsettled and fluctuating, like meteors in the air. Instead, dismiss the tormenting care and fickle instability that come with seeking after earthly needs. Let not your thoughts be consumed with worry, but trust in God's paternal care and do not let high thoughts distract you from the duty of dismissing anxiety.
