# Luke 12:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus' caution to His followers in Matthew 10:27 is a reminder that our private conversations have the potential to be exposed to the public eye. He emphasizes that what is shared in secrecy will eventually be brought to light, and that the truth will not remain hidden forever. This serves as a warning to be mindful of our words, even when spoken in the most private of settings, as they may one day be proclaimed openly for all to hear.
