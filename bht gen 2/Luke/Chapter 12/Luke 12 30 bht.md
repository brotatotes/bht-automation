# Luke 12:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As believers, we are reminded not to be consumed by an excessive worry for our basic needs such as food and clothing. It is a characteristic of the heathen mindset to be preoccupied with these concerns. We, on the other hand, should be mindful of our identity as disciples of Christ and the promises that come with it. We serve a God who knows our needs, both in this life and the next. Therefore, we can trust in His providence and let go of unnecessary anxiety surrounding these matters.

### John Gill:
1. "This is an argument used to dissuade from an immediate and anxious concern for food and raiment, because it is Heathenish, and therefore very unbecoming the disciples and followers of Christ."
2. "It need not be wondered at in those that know not God, and do not acknowledge his providence, and are strangers to his covenant and promises; but must be very unsuitable to the characters of such who know that godliness has the promise of this life, and of that which is to come."
3. "Your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things; and therefore it is needless to be so anxious about them."
