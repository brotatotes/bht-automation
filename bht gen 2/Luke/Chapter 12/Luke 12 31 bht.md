# Luke 12:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Seeking first the righteousness of God is the key to experiencing true peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. This means prioritizing the Kingdom of God and His righteousness over worldly concerns like material possessions and physical needs. By doing so, we align ourselves with the heavenly glory that the Gospel brings, as it ushers in the reign of Christ. This pursuit of righteousness, peace, and joy in God's kingdom is of great gain and leads to a life of contentment.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. See Matthew 6:33 for this verse. Luke does not have "first" nor "his righteousness" nor "all." 

### John Gill:
1. "The grace of God, which is not meat and drink, but righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Ghost..." 
2. "...or the heavenly glory; unless the Gospel, and the dispensation of it, which is the Messiah's kingdom, and which was then just ushering in, should rather be intended."
3. "...and godliness with these, and contentment with them, is great gain."
