# Luke 12:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom. As a shepherd cares for his flock, our Savior often refers to himself as the shepherd, and his followers as a flock. The disciples were a small and seemingly insignificant group, but they should not fear because their Father in heaven was their protector and provider. God's love and care for them far surpassed any worldly possessions or worries. They were called to focus on the eternal kingdom, not the fleeting possessions of this world.
