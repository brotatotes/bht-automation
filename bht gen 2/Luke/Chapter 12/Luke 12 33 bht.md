# Luke 12:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Sell what you have and give alms, for this direction was not given to all, but to a select group of disciples who were to be free from worldly entanglements. By selling their possessions and giving to the poor, they were able to focus on their spiritual mission and rely on God's provision. Furthermore, they were encouraged to store up treasures in heaven, where they would be safe from theft and decay, rather than accumulating wealth on earth, which is temporary and vulnerable.
