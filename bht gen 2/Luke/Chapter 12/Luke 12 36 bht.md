# Luke 12:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are encouraged to be ready and prepared for the coming of Christ, who is described as the bridegroom of the church. Just as a ship loosens its moorings to set sail, believers should be in a state of readiness, eagerly awaiting the return of Christ. When Christ, through the preaching of the Gospel and His grace, has united Himself with His chosen ones, He will ultimately descend from heaven to gather them to Himself. Those who are prepared will joyfully obey His call and find great pleasure in meeting Him.
