# Luke 12:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage refers to different watches of the night, symbolizing different times of readiness. Just as a faithful servant should always be prepared for their master's return, believers should be ready for the coming of Jesus at any moment. The symbolism of the watches emphasizes that we should be continually vigilant and prepared for the Lord's return, even in unexpected times. This readiness is what makes us truly blessed servants, eagerly anticipating the arrival of our Master.
