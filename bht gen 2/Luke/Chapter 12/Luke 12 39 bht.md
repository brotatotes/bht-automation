# Luke 12:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During the absence of our Lord, it is essential to remain watchful and attentive. Just as the owner of a house would be vigilant if he knew when a thief would come to rob him, we too should be cautious and prepared for Christ's unexpected return. We cannot predict the exact time, be it at the destruction of Jerusalem, death, or judgment, but if we knew, we would undoubtedly be on guard to avoid being caught off guard. Let this understanding guide us in our conduct until our Lord comes again.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Our Lord transfers, to shew the unexpected nature of his coming, and the necessity of watchfulness, the relation between  Himself and the  servants , to that between the  thief and the  οἰκοδεσπότης."
2. "For the purposes of this verse,  they represent the οἰκοδεσπότης collectively, as put in charge with the Lord’s house and household (thus the verse is intimately connected with Luk 12:42 )."
3. "That  he [the οἰκοδεσπότης] should be put in the place of the watching servants (  καὶ ὑμεῖς ) seems impossible: besides that the  πιστὸς οἰκονόμος below is this very οἰκοδ ., being such in the absence of his Lord, but the  οἰκονόμος when He appears."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Master returning from a wedding is replaced by a thief whose study it is to come to the house he means to plunder at an unexpected time."

### John Gill:
1. "Only take notice of this one thing, and it may be of some use to direct you in your conduct how to behave during the absence of your Lord, until the time he shall come again."
