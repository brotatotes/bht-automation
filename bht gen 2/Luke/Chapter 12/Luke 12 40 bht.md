# Luke 12:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Be ye therefore ready, not just as a habit but actively engaged in practicing grace and fulfilling your duties, prepared and watchful. This readiness can be understood in two ways: being prepared for the Lord's judgments, such as the destruction of Jerusalem, or being prepared for death and the final judgment, through the righteousness of Christ and His imparted grace. By having a proper understanding and experience of these events, we are motivated to actively engage in good works, making ourselves ready for the coming of Christ, regardless of the circumstances or timing.
