# Luke 12:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, Peter's question reflects his uncertainty regarding whether the discourse Jesus shared is applicable only to the apostles and disciples or to all believers. This inquiry underscores the authenticity of the conversation and the historicity of Jesus' teachings. By seeking clarification, Peter prompts Jesus to respond with a parabolic answer that addresses the waiting and watching depicted in both the master's situation at a wedding and the housekeeper's responsibility. This interaction highlights the significance of understanding the intended audience and the relevance of Jesus' teachings for all followers, both then and in the future.
