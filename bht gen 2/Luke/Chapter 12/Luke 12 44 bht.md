# Luke 12:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A faithful servant will be rewarded by being made ruler over all that he has. This is a firm declaration of truth and reflects the exaltation and authority given to Joseph by Pharaoh. The reward goes beyond earthly possessions, extending to reigning with Christ on earth for a thousand years and in heaven for eternity, where the servant will have full enjoyment of everything.
