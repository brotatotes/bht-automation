# Luke 12:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The servant in the passage delays, spending time and lingering, confident that his master's return will not be speedy. He throws off the role of a servant and treats the faithful ones who refuse to join him poorly. The servant had a notion of the coming of Christ but did not desire it. He supposed that Christ was slack concerning His promise and began to believe that He would not come at all. In his wicked and licentious lifestyle, he turned away from believing and obeying God's commands, becoming a violent persecutor of the saints and a debauchee.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In the confidence that his Lord's return will not be speedy, he throws off the role of servant and plays the master, maltreating those faithful servants who refuse to join him..."
2. "Seizing on and revelling in the fulness of his master's board intending, when he has got his fill, to resume the mask of fidelity ere his master appear."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Delayeth. The emphatic word, since the thought of the lord 's delay and of the postponement of the reckoning is uppermost in the servant 's thought.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Delayeth (χρονιζε). From χρονος, time, spends time, lingers."
2. "Shall say (ειπη). Second aorist subjunctive, with εαν, condition of the third class, undetermined, but with prospect of being determined."
3. "The menservants (τους παιδας) and the maidservants (κα τας παιδισκας). Παιδισκη is a diminutive of παις for a young female slave and occurs in the papyri, orginally just a damsel. Here παις can mean slave also though strictly just a boy."

### John Gill:
1. "Though a wicked servant, he calls Christ his Lord; but it is not saying Lord, Lord, that will be of any avail, but doing the will of God, by believing in Christ, and obeying his commands."
2. "He had a notion of the coming of Christ, though he did not desire it; and because he tarried longer than was expected, supposed him to be slack concerning his promise, and began to think, and hope, and at length to believe, that he would not come at all, and therefore gave himself up to a wicked and licentious way of living."
3. "Generally speaking, as professors of religion, when they turn apostates, are the most violent persecutors of the saints; so such persecutors of Christ's faithful followers are commonly drunkards and debauchees."
