# Luke 12:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The punishment for the unfaithful, unreliable, and hypocritical individuals is to be cut in sunder, a punishment commonly used in the East. It is crucial for everyone to remain watchful and anticipate the coming of Christ at any moment, so as not to be surprised. This includes those who have never heard of Christ, those who have rejected Him, and even those who deny the concept of revelation or mock the idea of His return. Ultimately, God will be the judge and assign each person their eternal fate, regardless of their previous faithfulness or lack thereof.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Cut him in sunderâ€”a punishment not unknown in the East."
2. "The unbelieversâ€”the unfaithful, those unworthy of trust."
3. "The hypocrites, falsely calling themselves 'servants'."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Unbelievers [Î±Ï€Î¹ÏƒÏ„Ï‰Î½] . Much better as Rev., the unfaithful; for it is of fidelity, not of faith, that Christ is speaking. Wyc., unfaithful men.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Shall cut him asunder (Î´Î¹Ï‡Î¿Ï„Î¿Î¼Î·ÏƒÎµ). An old and somewhat rare word from Î´Î¹Ï‡Î¿Ï„Î¿Î¼Î¿Ï‚ and that from Î´Î¹Ï‡Î± and Ï„ÎµÎ¼Î½Ï‰, to cut, to cut in two. Used literally here." 
2. "Not here 'the unbelieving' though that is a common meaning of Î±Ï€Î¹ÏƒÏ„Î¿Ï‚ (Î± privative and Ï€Î¹ÏƒÏ„Î¿Ï‚, from Ï€ÎµÎ¹Î¸Ï‰), but the unreliable, the untrustworthy."
3. "Clearly there Luke places the parable of the wise steward in this context while Matthew has it in the great eschatological discourse."

### John Gill:
1. "For, not coming as was expected, he gives over looking, and concludes he will not come at all; in which he will find himself mistaken."
2. "For as neither the day, nor hour of Christ's coming are known to any man, it becomes men to look for it every day and hour, lest it come upon them unawares."
3. "And by these are meant, not only the Heathens, who never heard of Christ; nor the Jews only, who disbelieved the Messiah, and rejected him when he came; but all deists and atheists, who deny revelation; even all unbelievers of, and scoffers at the coming of Christ, and who put away the evil day far from them."

### John Wesley:
1. The Lord will appoint him his portion â€” His everlasting portion, with the unfaithful - As faithful as he was once, God himself being the Judge!
