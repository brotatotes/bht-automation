# Luke 12:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage highlights the notion that individuals who are aware of God's expectations and choose to disregard them will be subject to harsher consequences. Merely possessing knowledge of God's will is insufficient; it must be accompanied by sincere adherence. The severity of the punishment is not contingent upon the extent of one's knowledge, but rather on the deliberate defiance of it. This serves as a cautionary reminder that those who possess a deep understanding of God's commands must also demonstrate obedience in their actions.
