# Luke 12:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who have limited knowledge of their faith may be held less accountable than those who have been given greater understanding and still fail to live according to it. The degree of punishment in the afterlife may vary, with those who possess more knowledge receiving greater condemnation. This emphasizes the responsibility that comes with receiving God's teachings and the need to diligently apply them in one's life. The expectation is that the more knowledge one has, the more actively they should use it to make a difference and produce good fruits.
