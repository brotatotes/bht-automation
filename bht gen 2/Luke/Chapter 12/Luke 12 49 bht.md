# Luke 12:49 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Gospel is compared to fire, which brings both light and warmth. It warms the hearts of believers and ignites a passion within them. Just as gold is refined in the fire, persecution tests the genuineness of one's faith. Christ anticipated the suffering he would endure and expressed his desire for it to be already kindled. His mission was to spread the fire of heavenly love throughout the world.
