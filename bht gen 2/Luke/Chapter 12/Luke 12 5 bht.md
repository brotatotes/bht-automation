# Luke 12:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Fear Him, for He is the one who has the power to cast into hell. This repetition of fear emphasizes the importance of directing our reverence towards God rather than fearing man. Both body and soul are subject to God's authority, and even His friends must be mindful of the consequences of disobedience. It is essential for believers to understand that fearing God's power to punish serves as a vital motivation for righteous action, reminding us of the reality of both eternal punishment and reward in the future.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Fear Him . . . Fear Him—how striking the repetition here! Only the one fear would effectually expel the other."
2. "To play false with one's convictions to save one's life, may fail of its end after all, for God can inflict a violent death in some other and equally formidable way. There is a hell, it seems, for the body as well as the soul, consequently, sufferings adapted to the one as well as the other."
3. "Fear of hell is a divinely authorized and needed motive of action even to Christ's 'friends.' As Christ's meekness and gentleness were not compromised by such harsh notes as these, so those servants of Christ lack their Master's spirit who soften down all such language to please ears 'polite'."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. I will forewarn [υποδειξω] . Rev., warn. See on warned, ch. 3 7. Hell. See on Matthew 5:22.

### John Calvin:
1. "When we give way to the dread of men, we pay no respect to God."
2. "If we fear God, we have an easy victory in our hands, so that no efforts of men will draw us aside from our duty."
3. "The experience of every age shows the great necessity of this exhortation to the ministers of Christ, and likewise to all believers in general."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Fear him who (φοβηθητε τον). First aorist passive imperative, differing from the preceding form only in the accent and governing the accusative also." 
2. "After he hath killed (μετα το αποκτεινα). Preposition μετα with the articular infinitive. Literally, 'After the killing'." 
3. "Gehenna is a transliteration of Ge-Hinnom, Valley of Hinnon where the children were thrown on to the red-hot arms of Molech. Josiah (2 Kings 23:10) abolished these abominations and then it was a place for all kinds of refuse which burned ceaselessly and became a symbol of punishment in the other world."

### John Gill:
1. "I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear, I will be your monitor, and direct you to the proper object of fear and reverence..."
2. "...fear him, which after he hath killed; your body, as the Persic version adds; hath taken away the life of it, by separating soul and body asunder, by sending one disease or another, or death in one shape or another..."
3. "...hath power to cast into hell; your soul, as the above version also adds; yea, to destroy both body and soul in hell..."
