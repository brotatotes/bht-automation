## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Baptism = Death. The figure in the Sacrament is the drowning, the burial, in the water, of the old man and the resurrection of the new man." 
2. "The Lord’s Baptism was His Death, in which the Body inherited from the first Adam was buried, and the new Body raised again." 
3. "And He was straitened (the best possible rendering) till this was accomplished: i.e. in anxiety and trouble of spirit."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But . . . a baptism, - clearly, His own bloody baptism, first to take place."
2. "How . . . straitened - not, 'how do I long for its accomplishment,' as many understand it, thus making it but a repetition of [a previous verse], but 'what a pressure of spirit is upon Me.'"
3. "Till it be accomplished - till it be over. Before a promiscuous audience, such obscure language was fit on a theme like this; but oh, what surges of mysterious emotion in the view of what was now so near at hand does it reveal!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A baptism - See the notes at Matthew 20:22."
2. "Am I straitened - How do I earnestly desire that it were passed!"
3. "Since these sufferings 'must' be endured, how anxious am I that the time should come!"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Am I straitened. See on ch. Luke 4:38, and compare 2 Corinthians 5:14; Philippians 1:23. Wyc., constrained.

### John Calvin:
1. "By these words our Lord asserts that there remains nothing but his last act, that by his death he may consecrate the renovation of the world."
2. "He compares death—as in other passages—to baptism, because the children of God, after having been immersed for a time by the death of the body, shortly afterwards rise again to life."
3. "He says that he is sorely pressed till that baptism has been accomplished, that he may encourage every one of us, by his example, both to bear the cross and to prefer death."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Our Lord here refers to His own sufferings, and especially to His death."
2. "Before we could be baptized with the Holy Spirit, this must come, for only thus was this new power bought for us."
3. "'What a weight is on me.' Anxiety, trouble of spirit, the human reluctance in view of fearful sufferings, here appear."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The one sets forth the result of his coming as it affects the world, the other as it affects himself. The world is lit up with flames and Christ is bathed in blood."
2. "We catch a glimpse of the tremendous passion in his soul that drove him on."
3. "The urge of the Cross is upon Jesus at the moment of these words."

### John Gill:
1. "he was as it were immersed, or plunged into them; and which almost all interpreters observe on the text, and by which they confess the true import and primary signification of the word used"
2. "these words express both the trouble and distress Christ was in, at the apprehension of his sufferings as man...and likewise they signify, his restless desire to have them accomplished"
3. "his death was the life of others, and the work required haste"

### John Wesley:
1. "I have a baptism to be baptized with."
2. "I must suffer first, before I can set up my kingdom."
3. "And how I long to fight my way through all!"
