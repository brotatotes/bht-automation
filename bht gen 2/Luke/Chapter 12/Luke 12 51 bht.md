# Luke 12:51 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ did not come to bring external peace among men, but rather to make peace with God and offer spiritual and eternal peace. The Gospel that He brings is like a sword of the Spirit, dividing and separating individuals from their old ways and even causing contention and discord among closest relations. His purpose is not to establish peace on earth, but to bring about a transformation that leads to true peace beyond worldly circumstances.
