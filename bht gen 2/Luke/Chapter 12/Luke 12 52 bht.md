# Luke 12:52 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To bring the element of life to earth and fill human hearts with warmth was the Redeemer's purpose. The effect of Christ's words would be evident after his baptism of sufferings and the preaching of the Gospel. Three would be divided against two, and two against three, illustrating the conflict between belief in Christ and unbelief. This separation would occur, with one being separated from two or three. The Spirit of Christ and the spirit of the world hold an irreconcilable enmity.
