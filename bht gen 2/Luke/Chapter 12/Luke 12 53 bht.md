# Luke 12:53 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, it is revealed that there will be a deep division within families, causing strife and discord. Those who reject Christ will even be alienated and opposed to their own family members who embrace Him. This highlights the sharp contrast between those who choose to follow Christ and those who refuse to do so, leading to a lack of harmony and agreement between the two. The fulfillment of this scripture can be observed in the ongoing conflict between Christ and the forces of darkness.
