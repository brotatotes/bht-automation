# Luke 12:56 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
How do you not discern this season? The signs of the Messiah's coming were plain and unmistakable, evident in the prophecies of the Old Testament and in the words of John the Baptist. It is a time of great significance, a time of salvation for those who receive and believe in the Messiah, and a time of judgment and destruction for those who reject him. It is astonishing that despite their ability to perceive signs in the sky and on earth, they failed to recognize the signs of the times.
