# Luke 12:58 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When faced with an urgent situation and the necessity of immediate decision, one should consider the seriousness of the matter at hand. As suggested, the urgency of repentance is likened to meeting a creditor on the way and making terms on the spot. It is important to diligently seek resolution with one's adversary before the matter reaches the court, as failure to do so may lead to facing the executioners of God's vengeance, resulting in everlasting ruin. Therefore, it is crucial to heed the warning and deliver oneself from such a fate without delay.
