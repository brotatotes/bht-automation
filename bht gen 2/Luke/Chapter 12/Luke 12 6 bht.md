# Luke 12:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Truly, a single sparrow may seem insignificant and of little worth, but let us not forget that even this small creature is noticed and cared for by our Lord. He provides for its needs, sustains its life, and offers it protection. Indeed, God's providence extends to the minutest creatures and things, and even more so to us, His beloved children. We should take comfort in knowing that if God takes notice of the sparrows, how much more will He provide for and guide those who trust and fear Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In Matthew 10:29 it is 'two for one farthing'; so if one took two farthings' worth, he got one in addition—of such small value were they."
2. "Not 'than millions of sparrows'; the charm and power of our Lord's teaching is very much in this simplicity."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Sparrows. See on Matthew 10:29. Fall. See on Matthew 10:29.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Is forgotten  (εστιν επιλελησμενον). Periphrastic perfect passive indicative of επιλανθανομα, common verb to forget. See Matthew 10:29 for a different construction. 

### John Gill:
1. "A single sparrow, a bird of little value and worth, is taken notice and care of by him; it has its life from him, and is provided for with food by him, and is under his protection."
2. "Nor does he ever forget it, nor can any thing be done to it, without his permission; it cannot be struck, so as to cause it to fall on the ground, or be taken in a snare, or be killed in any shape, without the knowledge of God."
3. "His providence reaches to the minutest creatures and things, and much more then to rational creatures, to men; and still more to his dear children, ministers, and apostles."

### John Wesley:
1. Are not five sparrows — But trust as well as fear him.
