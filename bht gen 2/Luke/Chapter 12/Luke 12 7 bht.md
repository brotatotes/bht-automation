# Luke 12:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Confess me implies a deeper understanding found in Matthew 10:30. Just as every minute detail, even the hairs on our heads, are accounted for by God (the 'Palmoni', or 'wonderful numberer'), so too should we confess our faith in Him. For God's providence extends not only to the sparrows of the world, but also to the lives of His people. Our lives are of great importance in His sight and should be acknowledged accordingly.
