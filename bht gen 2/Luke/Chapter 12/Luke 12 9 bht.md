# Luke 12:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who deny Christ before others, persisting in their denial, will themselves be denied by Christ before the angels of God. These deniers will not be admitted into heaven, but instead will be covered in shame and sent into everlasting torment. It is a solemn warning that the consequences of denying Christ publicly are grave and eternal.
