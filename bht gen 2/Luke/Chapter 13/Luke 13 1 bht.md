# Luke 13:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The incident mentioned in these quotes refers to a group of Galileans who were killed by Pilate while they were offering sacrifices. It is possible that these Galileans were followers of Judas Gaulonitis, who sought to rebel against the Roman government. The shocking nature of this event led some to believe that these Galileans were particularly sinful. However, Jesus does not focus on condemning Pilate, but instead uses this incident as a parable, urging his listeners to reflect on the uncertainty of life and their own conduct.

### Henry Alford:
1. "·ºêŒΩ Œ±·ΩêœÑ. œÑ. Œ∫Œ±ŒπœÅ. may mean at that very time viz. as He finished the foregoing discourse: but it is not necessary to interpret thus; for, Matthew 12:1; Matthew 14:1, the similar expression, ·ºêŒΩ ·ºêŒ∫ŒµŒØŒΩ·ø≥ œÑ. Œ∫. is certainly indefinite."
2. "œÄŒ±œÅ.‚Ä¶ ·ºÄœÄŒ±Œ≥Œ≥., came with the news, not, as Stier supposes, ‚Äòwere in the crowd, and remarked to the Lord concerning these Galil√¶ans,‚Äô in consequence of what He had said ch. Luke 12:57: such a finding of connexion is too fine-drawn, and is a fault which we may excuse in Stier, for his many services in interpreting our Lord‚Äôs discourses, but must not imitate."
3. "œÄŒµœÅ·Ω∂ œÑ. Œì.] The historical fact is otherwise unknown. The way of speaking here shews that it was well known to the writer." (150 words)

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "These men are not signal examples of divine vengeance, as you suppose, but every impenitent sinner‚Äîye yourselves, except ye repent‚Äîshall be like monuments of the judgment of Heaven, and in a more awful sense."
2. "The reference here to the impending destruction of Jerusalem is far from exhausting our Lord's weighty words; they manifestly point to a 'perdition' of a more awful kind‚Äîfuture, personal, remediless."


### Albert Barnes:
1. "The answer of Jesus is a reproof of their habit of hastily judging the character of others."
2. "The Galileans, in the time of Christ, were very wicked."
3. "It is likely that the Galileans excited a tumult in the temple, and that Pilate took occasion to come suddenly upon them, and show his opposition to them and Herod by slaying them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Galileans were riotous, and the occasion was undoubtedly some feast at Jerusalem."
2. "His soldiers probably fell on them and slew them while engaged in the temple-sacrifices."
3. "Those who told of the massacre thought that death under such circumstances was peculiarly terrible; and from this they inferred that these Galileans had been great sinners."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "These people had a piece of news for Jesus.Whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices" 
2. "The incident is recorded nowhere else, but is in entire harmony with Pilate's record for outrages." 
3. "Jesus comments on the incident, but not as the reporters had expected. Instead of denunciation of Pilate he turned it into a parable for their own conduct in the uncertainty of life."

### John Gill:
1. "These Galileans were very likely some of the followers of Judas Gaulonitis, or Judas of Galilee, who endeavored to draw off the Jews from the Roman government." 
2. "The phrase of mingling blood with blood is Jewish; it is said of one Trogianus the wicked that he slaughtered the Jews and mingled their blood with their blood." 
3. "The Jews have a notion that 'in the age in which the son of David comes, Galilee shall be destroyed.' Here was a great slaughter of the Galileans now, but there was a greater afterwards by the Romans."
