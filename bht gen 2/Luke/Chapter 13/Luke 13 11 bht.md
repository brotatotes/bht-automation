# Luke 13:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This woman's prolonged suffering from a spirit of infirmity, which caused her body to be bowed together, hints at a possible form of possession. Her faithful attendance at the synagogue demonstrates her search for solace in the sanctuary. Incapable of lifting herself up, modern physicians might even term her condition a nervous case. However, Jesus' remarkable healing miracle triumphed over the power of Satan and showcased his divine authority.

2. "We know that diseases of an unusual and extraordinary kind are, for the most part, inflicted on men through the agency of the devil; and this gave the more striking display of the divine power of Christ, which triumphed over Satan."
3. "Besides, as the Lord, from whom alone all our blessings flow, makes his glory to shine with peculiar brightness in those blessings which are more remarkable, and of rare occurrence; so, on the other hand, it is his will that the power and tyranny of Satan should be chiefly regarded in extraordinary chastisements, though his agency is likewise employed in those more gentle applications of the rod, which we experience from day to day."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A spirit of infirmity eighteen years. This suggests a form of demoniacal possession; and Luke 13:16 shows that Satanic influence was present in her case."
