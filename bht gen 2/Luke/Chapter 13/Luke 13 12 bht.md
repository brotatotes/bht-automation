# Luke 13:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The woman, without even asking for a cure, was called by Jesus to come to Him. With the laying on of His hands, He not only loosed her from her infirmity, but also released her muscles from the power that had bound them down for years. This act of healing demonstrated not only Jesus' power, but also His grace, as He came to grant relief to the wretched. His authoritative declaration of Thou art loosed showed that deliverance was within His control, and that He had the ability to drive away Satanic power with a mere word.
