# Luke 13:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The woman, who was held captive by Satan and bound by her crookedness just as a sinner is bound by iniquity, was immediately made straight by the touch of Jesus. This physical healing serves as a powerful metaphor for the spiritual healing that only Christ can provide. Just as the woman could not raise herself up, sinners cannot free themselves from the bondage of sin. However, when they come under the ministry of Christ, He manifests His power and grace to deliver them from their captivity and enable them to glorify God.
