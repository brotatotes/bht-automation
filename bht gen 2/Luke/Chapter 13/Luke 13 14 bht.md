# Luke 13:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is evident from these commentaries that the ruler who spoke to the multitude was filled with furious malice and envy towards Jesus for performing the miracle and gaining honor from it. Instead of directly attacking Jesus, he tried to belittle Him by questioning the legitimacy of the healing. It is ironic that the ruler misunderstood the Sabbath laws, wrongly thinking that works of mercy were forbidden on that day. He failed to recognize that the power of God is always at work, especially on the Sabbath, for the salvation of His people.
