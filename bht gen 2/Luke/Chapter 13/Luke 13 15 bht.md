2. "A man hardly could give forth a doctrine so at variance with common sense and common practice, without some by-end..."
3. "The instance chosen exactly fits the circumstances. A beast tied to the manger is confined down as this poor woman was."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

	hypocrite!—How "the
	faithful and true Witness" tears off the masks which men wear! 
	his ox, c.—(See on  :- and Luke 6:9).

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Thou hypocrite! - You condemn 'me' for an action, and yet you perform one exactly similar."
2. "You condemn 'me' for doing to a woman what you do to a beast."
3. "To her I have done good on the Sabbath; you provide for your cattle, and yet blame me for working a miracle to relieve a sufferer on that day."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Loose [λυει] . Compare thou art loosed, ver. 12. Stall. See on ch. Luke 2:7.

### John Calvin:
1. "If it be lawful on the Sabbath, to perform the offices of humanity to cattle, it is ridiculous to imagine that the due observance of it will prevent assistance from being granted to the children of God."
2. "You, who are so scrupulous about observing the Sabbath, venture to loose oxen and asses, and lead them away to watering. And why may not I be permitted to perform a similar office of kindness to the elect people of God; especially when the necessity is more urgent, when someone is to be delivered from the snares of Satan?"
3. "Christ never performed any work, however illustrious, which wicked men did not seize as an occasion for slander."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Lord. Perhaps with emphasis; as He had previously proclaimed Himself, ‘Lord even of the Sabbath’ (chap. Luke 6:5)."
2. "Ye hypocrites. Luke 13:17 shows that other antagonists were present. The plural agrees better with what follows. The hypocrisy is evident from the example our Lord quotes."
3. "Doth not each one of you, etc. This was confessedly permitted. In an important sense works of mercy are works of necessity. The beast tied to the manger aptly represents the case of this poor woman."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Lord answered him (απεκριθη δε αυτω ο Κυριος). Note use of 'the Lord' of Jesus again in Luke's narrative. Jesus answered the ruler of the synagogue who had spoken to the crowd, but about Jesus. It was a crushing and overwhelming reply."
2. "Hypocrites (υποκριτα). This pretentious faultfinder and all who agree with him."
3. "Each of you (εκαστος υμων). An argumentum ad hominen. These very critics of Jesus cared too much for an ox or an ass to leave it all the sabbath without water."

### John Gill:
1. "Thou hypocrite; the [man] who covered his malice and envy at Christ, with a show of zeal for the sabbath day."
2. "Doth not each one of you, on the sabbath day, loose his ox, or his ass, from the stall, or rack, where he is fastened with a rope; and lead him away to watering?"
3. "And therefore very justly does our Lord observe to the ruler of the synagogue their own practices towards a beast, in defense of his works of mercy to men."

### John Wesley:
1. Thou hypocrite — For the real motive of his speaking was envy, not (as he pretended) pure zeal for the glory of God.
