# Luke 13:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
And isn't it justifiable for this woman, a descendant of Abraham, to be freed from her affliction on the Sabbath? After all, if it is permitted to tend to the needs of animals on this holy day, how much more reasonable is it to address the suffering of a human being, especially one who belongs to the covenant people of God?

### Albert Barnes:
1. "She was therefore a Jewess; and the ruler of the synagogue, professing a special regard for the Jewish people, should have rejoiced that she was loosed from this infirmity." 
2. "By his 'binding' her is meant that he had inflicted this disease upon her."
3. "It is no more 'improbable' that God would suffer 'Satan' to inflict pain, than that he would suffer a wicked 'man' to do it; yet nothing is more common than for one 'man' to be the occasion of bringing on a disease in another which may terminate only with the life."

### Marvin Vincent:

3. "Whom Satan bound (ην εδησεν ο Σατανας). Definite statement that her disease was due to Satan."

2. "whom Satan hath bound, lo these eighteen years... a bodily distemper that none could loose her from..."
