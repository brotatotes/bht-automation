# Luke 13:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parable of 'the Leaven' highlights the inward growth of the kingdom, while 'the Mustard Seed' emphasizes its outward expansion. The three measures of meal mentioned may not symbolize specific divisions of our nature or the world, but rather the pervasive influence of the Gospel, penetrating and assimilating all aspects of life. The meaning of the word therefore in this context remains uncertain. Nevertheless, this parable poses a profound question about the nature of the kingdom of God and how best to grasp its essence.
