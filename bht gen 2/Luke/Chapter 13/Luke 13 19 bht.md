# Luke 13:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parable of the mustard seed teaches us that the kingdom of God starts small and grows tremendously. Just as a grain of mustard seed, which is tiny at first, can grow into a large tree, so too does God's kingdom expand and flourish. The seed represents the Gospel being planted in the hearts of believers, whether it be in the world as a whole or within the church. In this way, the word and grace of God take root and thrive, providing shelter and sustenance for those who seek refuge under its branches.

1. "A grain of mustard seed (κοκκω σιναπεως). Either the sinapis nigra or the salvadora persica, both of which have small seeds and grow to twelve feet at times."
2. "Given by Mark 4:30-32; Matthew 13:31 in the first great group of parables, but just the sort to be repeated."
3. "Became a tree (εγενετο εις δενδρον). Common Hebraism, very frequent in LXX, only in Luke in the N.T., but does appear in Koine though rare in papyri; this use of εις after words like ginomai."

### John Gill:
1. "It is like a grain of mustard seed,.... Both for its smallness at first, and its after increase."
2. "Which a man took and cast into his garden... by the place in the text, where this seed is cast, may be meant, either the 'field' of the world, where the Gospel is preached, and churches are raised; or the 'garden' of the church, where the word and ordinances are administered, and in the hearts of the members of it, the grace of God is implanted and increased."
3. "And the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it;... gracious men on earth, who sit under the shadow of a Gospel ministry with great delight; and 'make their nests', as the Persic version here renders the words, and take up their residence in Gospel churches."
