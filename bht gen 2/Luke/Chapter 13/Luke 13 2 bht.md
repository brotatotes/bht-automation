# Luke 13:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our Lord perceives their reasoning, neither approving nor condemning Pilate's action, but improving the instance for the conviction of his hearers. Sinners, such as the Galileans, cannot be denied, yet he does not bear hard upon them, but instead emphasizes the necessity of repentance. God's judgments are a great deep, orchestrated by divine providence for a purpose that may not be easily known. Love and hatred, the characters and states of men, cannot be determined solely based on the effects in providence.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "This passage is highly useful, were it for no other reason than that this disease is almost natural to us, to be too rigorous and severe in judging of others, and too much disposed to flatter our own faults."
2. "He shows, first, that those who are treated with severity are not the most wicked of all men; because God administers his judgments in such a manner, that some are instantly seized and punished, and others are permitted to remain long in the enjoyment of ease and luxury."
3. "Christ does not, however, forbid believers to consider attentively the judgments of God, but enjoins them to observe this order, to begin with their own sins. They will thus obtain the highest advantage; for they will avert God’s chastisements by voluntary repentance."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Our Lord perceives their reasoning, and first corrects the mistake they made, adding an appropriate warning."
2. "The verse directly opposes the very common habit of calling every calamity that befalls another a ‘judgment.’"
3. "Such a verdict has the air of piety, but it is generally the result of uncharitableness."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Sinners above all (αμαρτωλο παρα παντας). Παρα means 'beside,' placed beside all the Galileans, and so beyond or above (with the accusative)."
2. "Have suffered (πεπονθασιν). Second perfect active indicative third plural from πασχω, common verb, to experience, suffer. The tense notes that it is 'an irrevocable fact' (Bruce)."

### John Gill:
1. "Neither approving, nor condemning Pilate's action; and though he allowed the Galileans to be sinners, which could not be denied, he does not bear hard upon them, but improves the instance for the conviction of his hearers, and in order to show them the necessity of repentance, and to bring them to it."
2. "God's judgments are a great deep, and not to be fathomed by us, nor is it to be easily known when anything befalls persons in a way of judgment; there is nothing that comes by chance, but everything by the wise disposal of divine providence, to answer some end or another."
3. "Besides, love and hatred, the characters and states of men, are not to be known by these effects in providence."
