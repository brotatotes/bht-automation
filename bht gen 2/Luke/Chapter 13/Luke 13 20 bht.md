# Luke 13:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, in Luke, poses the question of how to illustrate the Kingdom of God, similar to Luke 13:18. This inquiry relates to the parable found in Matthew 13:33, which likens the Kingdom of God to leaven concealed within three measures of meal. Scholars suggest that this parable could symbolize various concepts like the Gospel of the kingdom, the mysteries of it, the church, or the grace of God in the heart. Nevertheless, it is widely agreed that the primary interpretation refers to the Gospel of the kingdom.
