# Luke 13:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The concept of leaven in Matthew 12:33 conveys several meanings. It symbolizes the modest beginnings and subsequent growth of the Gospel ministry, as well as the nature of God's grace. It also suggests the presence of false teaching and seduction within the Church, illustrated by the reference to that woman, Jezebel. Alternatively, leaven could represent the gradual emergence of deception and apostasy, exemplified by the errors and heresies that arose during the early days of the Church. Ultimately, the metaphor of leaven emphasizes how something initially hidden or obscured can eventually be revealed over time.
