# Luke 13:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The question posed, Are they few that be saved? may have stemmed from Jesus' teachings on the small beginnings of his kingdom and the idea that his Gospel would be initially received by only a few. However, it is possible that the question was purely speculative, as indicated by Jesus' response which redirected the focus to personal salvation rather than providing a direct answer. It is noteworthy that Jesus' response was not exclusively for the inquirer, but addressed the entire group present.
