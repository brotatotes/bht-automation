# Luke 13:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Strive to enter in at the strait gate, Jesus urges, using the word agonize. In other words, we are called to put forth a great effort and be determined, as if we are in an intense struggle. We cannot simply seek or desire to enter; it requires a focused and dedicated pursuit. The lesson is clear: mere seeking or surface-level efforts will not be enough. As mentioned in Matthew 7:13, the gate is narrow, and only those who strive and agonize in their pursuit of righteousness will enter.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The description of the broad and narrow ways is not here inserted, as probably by this time, ἡ στενὴ θύρα (or πύλη) was a familiar image."
2. "εἰς...κ...οὐκ ἰσχ... not, 'shall seek to enter by it, and shall not be able:' the emphasis of the command is, seek to enter at the strait door: for many shall seek to enter (elsewhere), and shall not be able."
3. "After εἰσελθ..., is to be supplied in both places, εἰς σωτηρίαν, or εἰς τ. βασ. τ. θεοῦ. This remark will dispose of the punctuation of Lachmann and Tischendorf in his earlier editions, who place only a comma at ἰσχύσουσιν, and connect it with ἀφʼ οὗ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Strive—The word signifies to 'contend' as for the mastery, to 'struggle,' expressive of the difficulty of being saved, as if one would have to force his way in."
2. "Strait gate—another figure of the same."
3. "For many... will seek 'desire,' that is, with a mere wish or slothful endeavor. And shall not be able—because it must be made a life-and-death struggle."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Strive - Literally, 'agonize.' The word is taken from the Grecian games. In their races, and wrestlings, and various athletic exercises, they 'strove or agonized,' or put forth all their powers to gain the victory."
2. "So Jesus says that we should strive to enter in; and he means by it that we should be diligent, be active, be earnest; that we should make it our first and chief business to overcome our sinful propensities, and to endeavor to enter into heaven."
3. "How important, then, to strive to enter in while we have opportunity, and before it shall be too late!"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Strive... conveying a sense of struggle." 
2. "The kindred noun, ajgwnia, agony, is used of Christ's struggle in Gethsemane." 
3. "The door of a house, and not a gate, is meant."

### John Calvin:
1. "For many will seek to enter... The flesh is willing to flatter itself, and many who now give themselves every indulgence, promise to themselves an easy entrance into life."
2. "Thus men practice mutual deception on each other, and fall asleep in wicked indifference."
3. "To shake off from his own people those flattering hopes, Christ declares that those who calculate that their possession of life is already certain, will be shut out."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Instead of such a question, remember that many will not obtain salvation, strive therefore to obtain it yourselves in the right way," 
2. "To do this the greatest earnestness is required."
3. "It is a moral impossibility to enter in any other way."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Strive (αγωνιζεσθε). Jesus makes short shrift of the question. He includes others ... our agonize."
2. "Originally it was to contend for a prize in the games."
3. "The narrow gate appears also in Matthew 7:13, only there it is an outside gate (πυλης) while here it is the entrance to the house, 'the narrow door' (θυρας)."

### John Gill:
1. "Strive to enter in at the strait gate.... To 'strive', is to be diligent in the use of means; to search the Scriptures with care; to attend on the preaching of the word with constancy, neglecting no opportunity; to pray earnestly for spiritual light, knowledge, and grace."
2. "The metaphor seems to be taken from the striving, wrestling, and combat in the Olympic games, for a corruptible crown."
3. "Many...will seek to enter in, and shall not be able: either when it is too late, when the door is shut; or else before, very faintly, in a superficial manner, from a mere natural affection, from a principle of self-love, which leads every one to desire happiness; and by very indirect and improper methods."

### John Wesley:
1. Strive to enter in — Agonize. Strive as in an agony. So the word signifies Otherwise none shall enter in. Barely seeking will not avail. Matthew 7:13.
