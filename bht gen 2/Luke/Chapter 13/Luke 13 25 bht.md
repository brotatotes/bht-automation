# Luke 13:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The gate will be shut on a day when the Master of the house rises and closes the door, signaling the end and no admittance. Even though some may hear about the closed door, they will still persist in trying to enter. Yet, they do not belong to the household and will be refused admission. It is important to understand the urgency of seeking entrance now, as a time will come when it will be impossible to enter. Faith, prayer, holiness, and obedience are key in agonizing for a place in the family and avoiding being left outside.

1. "As Christ had declared that to many, who shall desire to enter into heaven, the door will not be open, he now asserts, that they gain nothing by occupying a place in the church because God will at length arise in judgment, and shut out from his kingdom those who now lay claim to a place in his family."
2. "He employs the comparison of the master of a house, who, having learned that some wicked and dissolute persons among his own domestics steal out unperceived during the night, and expose the house to thieves, rises and shuts the door, and does not allow those night-prowlers to enter, who have been wandering through the public streets at unseasonable hours."
