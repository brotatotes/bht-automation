# Luke 13:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Though it may seem significant, the claim that we have eaten and drank in thy presence is not enough to secure a place in the kingdom of Christ. Mere personal acquaintance and profession of Him will not be sufficient on judgment day. Just as hearing Christ preached or having Him Himself preach will be meaningless unless there is faith in Him that is accompanied by love.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "As applied to the then assembled crowd, these words refer to the miracles of feeding, perhaps also to His having so often sat at meat in the houses of various persons..."; 
2. "Both these are ἐνώπιόν σου merely, in His presence; very different from the drinking μεθ ʼ ὑμῶν of which He speaks Matthew 26:29, and from the δειπνήσω μετ ʼ αὐτοῦ καὶ αὐτὸς μετ ʼ ἐμοῦ, Revelation 3:20."; 
3. "ἐν τ . πλ . ἡμ . ἐδ ., applicable directly to those to whom the words were spoken; and further, in its fuller sense, to all among whom the gospel is preached, even till the end."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "We have sat with Thee at the same table."
2. "Do we not remember listening in our own streets to Thy teaching? Surely we are not to be denied admittance?"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To have eaten with one is evidence of acquaintanceship or friendship."
2. "The figure is taken from the customs of people, and means simply that they had professed attachment, and perhaps supposed that Jesus was their friend."
3. "Thou hast taught - Thou didst favor us, as though thou didst love us. Thou didst not turn away from us, and we did not drive thee away. All this is alleged as proof of friendship."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. In thy presence [ενωπιον σου] . Not as beloved and familiar guests. Compare with you [μεθ υμων] , Matthew 26:29.

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ expressly states, that it will be of no advantage to the Jews, that he approached near to them, and permitted them to enjoy familiar intercourse with him, if, when called, they do not answer at the appointed day."
2. "He does not follow out his comparison: for, after having spoken about the master of a house, he now states, without a figure, that he is himself the judge."
3. "We now perceive his design, which was, to warn the Jews not to allow themselves to lose, by their own neglect, the salvation which it is in their power to obtain."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The plea is previous acquaintanceship. As applied to those then addressed, it refers to actual participation in ordinary meals with our Lord."
2. "More generally it refers to external connection with Christ, without actual communion with Him."
3. "The clause had a literal application then, but it also refers to all among whom the gospel is preached."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is grotesque to claim credit because Christ taught in their streets..."
2. "They are hard run for excuses and claims."
3. "The copyists had trouble with it."

### John Gill:
1. "we have eaten and drank in thy presence... will be insufficient to introduce men into the kingdom and glory of Christ"
2. "natural relation to Christ, personal acquaintance with him, and a bare profession of him, will be of no avail another day"
3. "it will signify nothing, to have heard Christ preached, or Christ himself preach, unless there is faith in him, which works by love"
