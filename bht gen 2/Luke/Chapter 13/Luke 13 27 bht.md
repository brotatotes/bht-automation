# Luke 13:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage in Matthew 7:23 serves as a striking revelation that there will be individuals who, despite their claims of righteousness and association with Christ, will ultimately be exposed as workers of unrighteousness. This resolute statement leaves no room for doubt or negotiation, emphasizing that mere external affiliation with Christ will not suffice. The severity of the situation is further highlighted by the image of being commanded to depart from Christ's presence, indicating that these individuals have been carrying out deceitful and unrighteous acts.
