# Luke 13:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These verses in Matthew 8 convey a sobering message about the fate of those who have departed from the faith and piety of their ancestors. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when they hear the sentence 'depart from me.' In their disappointment, they will realize that being born into a religious family does not guarantee eternal glory. Instead, they will be forever separated from the righteous and find themselves in the company of devils and damned spirits.
