# Luke 13:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's chosen ones, from all parts of the world and belonging to Christ, will gather together in his kingdom. They will sit down at a heavenly banquet, rejoicing and partaking in the joys of heaven. This includes not only the Gentiles, who are contrasted with the Jews, but also all those who come from the four quarters of the earth. In the kingdom of God, both the kingdom of grace and the kingdom of glory, they will find everlasting joy and the absence of sorrow and sighing.
