# Luke 13:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Heeding Jesus' warning, it becomes clear that personal repentance is essential. Jesus corrects the mistaken assumption that calamities befall solely upon others for their sins. Instead, he emphasizes that sin often leads to punishment in this world. This truth is reinforced by the tragic fate of the Galileans and the destruction of Jerusalem. Thousands perished in Jerusalem, including those within the temple. The fate of the Galileans mirrored that of the larger Jewish nation, serving as a stark reminder of the consequences of unbelief and sin. Therefore, personal repentance becomes crucial for all to avoid a similar fate.
