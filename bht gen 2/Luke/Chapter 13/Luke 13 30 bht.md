# Luke 13:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who were originally chosen and believed may lose their privileged position, while the Gentiles and Oriental Churches, who were initially cast off, can thrive. This challenges the Jews' assumption that their chosen status guarantees God's favor. Instead, the Gentiles, who were considered the lowest, will be greatly rewarded and share in the glory of the kingdom of heaven alongside patriarchs and prophets. Conversely, many of the Jews, who were first called, will receive no reward. This pattern of reversal is not limited to historical examples but is relevant to individuals, churches, and nations throughout history.
