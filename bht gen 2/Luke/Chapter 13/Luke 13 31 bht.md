# Luke 13:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Herod may have desired to kill Jesus but sent these Pharisees to warn Him under the guise of good intentions.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Haunted by guilty fears, probably, Herod wanted to get rid of Him, and seems, from our Lord's answer, to have sent these Pharisees, under pretense of a friendly hint, to persuade Him that the sooner He got beyond Herod's jurisdiction the better it would be for His own safety."
2. "Our Lord saw through both of them, and sends the cunning ruler a message couched in dignified and befitting irony."

### Albert Barnes:

3. "But we must also direct our attention to the first originator and contriver of this scheme, Satan; for, as he endeavored at that time to interrupt the progress of the Gospel, by terrifying the Son of God, so he constantly invents and hatches up new grounds of alarm, to strike the ministers of Christ with dismay, and to constrain them to turn aside."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Herod may not have wished to kill Jesus, but the desire, now to see Him and now to get Him out of his territory, agrees entirely with the character of that ruler."
