# Luke 13:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Behold, despite the cunning and cowardice of Herod, Jesus boldly declares that He will continue to carry out His mission of casting out devils and performing miracles. He acknowledges that his earthly ministry is reaching its completion, but it is not yet finished. He knows that there is still work to be done, and he is undeterred by the plots and schemes of those who oppose him. In just a short time, he will leave Galilee and head to Jerusalem, where he will face his ultimate sacrifice.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Behold, I cast out devils and I do cures; plot on and ply thy wiles."
2. "My works of mercy are nearing completion, but some yet remain; I have work for today and tomorrow too, and the third day; by that time I shall be where his jurisdiction reaches not."
3. "I finish my course, I attain completion."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A fox is an emblem of slyness, of cunning, and of artful mischief... Herod was a wicked man, but the 'particular thing' to which Jesus here alludes is not his 'vices,' but his 'cunning, his artifice,' in endeavoring to remove him out of his territory." 
2. "Announce to him the fact that I am working miracles in his territory, and that I shall continue to do it... I am engaged in my appropriate work, and shall continue to be as long as is proper, in spite of his arts and his threats." 
3. "I am doing no evil; I am not violating the laws. I only cure the sick, etc. In a little time this part of my work will be done, and I shall retire from his dominions."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "That fox. Herod. Describing his cunning and cowardice."
2. "The present tense: 'the present of the certain future' (Meyer). The meaning is, I come to an end: I have done."
3. "Expositors differ greatly. Some interpret, 'I end my career of healing,' etc.; others, my life."

### John Calvin:
1. "I do not think that the term, fox, is intended to refer generally to the cunning of his whole life, but rather to the insidious methods by which he labored to undermine the doctrine of the Gospel, when he did not venture to attack it openly."
2. "Christ tells him that, with all his craftiness, he will gain nothing by his schemes."
3. "Christ acknowledges, in the former part of his message, that on the third day—that is, within a very short time—he must die; and in this way shows, that he could not be deterred from his duty by any fear of death, to which he advanced boldly, with fixed purpose of mind."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "That fox. A figure of cunning and mischief. Herod deserved the name."

3. "The days must then be understood in the literal sense... I shall remain in your territory three days longer."

1. "That fox (τη αλωπεκ ταυτη). This epithet for the cunning and cowardice of Herod shows clearly that Jesus understood the real attitude and character of the man who had put John the Baptist to death."
2. "The message of Jesus means that he is independent of the plots and schemes of both Herod and the Pharisees. The preacher is often put in a tight place by politicians who are quite willing to see him shorn of all real power."
3. "Perfect humanity is a process and Jesus was passing through that, without sin, but not without temptation and suffering. It is the prophetic present with the sense of the future."

### John Gill:
1. "Herod, who it may be sent them, of which Christ was not ignorant, nor of his design in it; and who, as Nero, for his cruelty, is compared to a lion, so he for his subtlety in this instance, as well as in the whole of his conduct, to a fox."
2. "so the false prophets and teachers, are for their cunning, subtlety, and flattery, compared to foxes..."
3. "behold, I cast out devils; or 'I will cast out devils', as the Ethiopic version reads, in spite of him, let him do his worst: and I do cures today and tomorrow; and so for some time to come; and which was doing good, and was what Herod and the Pharisees, had they any humanity in them, would have rejoiced at..."

### John Wesley:
1. "With great propriety so called, for his subtilty and cowardice."
2. "Notwithstanding all that he can do, I shall for the short time I have left, do the works of him that sent me."
3. "The third day I am perfected - On the third day he left Galilee, and set out for Jerusalem, to die there."
