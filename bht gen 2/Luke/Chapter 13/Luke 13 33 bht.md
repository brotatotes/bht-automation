# Luke 13:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is simply unthinkable that a prophet would meet his end anywhere other than Jerusalem. The historical pattern reveals that Jerusalem, in its pride and arrogance, has become a hotbed for the destruction of God's messengers. The wickedness and savagery demonstrated in this city surpasses all others, making it the most fitting place for the rejection and martyrdom of the prophets.
