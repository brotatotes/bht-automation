# Luke 13:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
How often would I have gathered thy children together, O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets and stonest them that are sent unto thee! Jesus expressed his desire to gather the people of Jerusalem together, demonstrating his repeated visits to the city and his calling to bring them closer to him. Despite his willingness to protect and nurture them like a mother hen gathering her brood, they refused his offer. This plea from Jesus is a reflection of his love and longing to save his people, even in the face of rejection. (Matthew 23:37)
