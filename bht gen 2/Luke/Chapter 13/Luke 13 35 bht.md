# Luke 13:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Your dwelling place, once filled with the presence and favor of God, is now left desolate and abandoned, destined for destruction. Soon, you will not see me, but there will come a time when, through the trials and tribulations you will face, you will acknowledge the blessedness of the one who comes in the name of the Lord. This does not mean that they will physically see Jesus, but rather that they will eagerly long for the Messiah and be open to receiving anyone who claims to be him.

"When Christ shall come a second time, and every eye shall see him, these Jews, among the rest, shall behold him, whom they have pierced, and mourn; and wish themselves among those, that shall receive him with joyful acclamations; and however, will be obliged to own him as the Messiah, and to confess that he comes in the name, and with the authority of the Lord, and that he is blessed for evermore."

### John Wesley:
