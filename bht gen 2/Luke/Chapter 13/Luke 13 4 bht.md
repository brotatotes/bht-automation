# Luke 13:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Even the inhabitants of Jerusalem, who were considered people of religious standing, were not exempt from meeting tragic ends. Jesus uses these incidents to emphasize the importance of personal responsibility and to caution against making hasty judgments about others' spiritual state based on their circumstances. Just as sins are often referred to as debts, the term sinners here refers to those who owe a debt. Rather than assuming that these individuals were exceptionally sinful or deserving of their fate, it is a reminder that sin and suffering exist in all walks of life.

### Philip Schaff:

### John Gill:
1. "but even inhabitants of Jerusalem, died violent deaths, and came to untimely ends; and yet, as not in the former case, so neither in this was it to be concluded from hence, that they were sinners of a greater size, or their state worse than that of other men"
2. "think ye that they were sinners; or debtors; for as sins are called debts, Matthew 6:12 so sinners are called debtors"
3. "there might be, and doubtless there were, as great, or greater sinners, in that holy city, and among such that made great pretensions to religion and holiness, as they were."
