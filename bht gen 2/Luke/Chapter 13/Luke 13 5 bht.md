# Luke 13:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Although wickedness may prosper in this world, their true punishment awaits them in the future. The past destruction mentioned affected all, with the city filled with people from the provinces. The righteous suffer greatly, with multitudes perishing in the ruins. Urgent repentance is emphasized, as demonstrated by the phrase except ye repent. The moral lesson taught by Jesus is clear, as accidents may have different interpretations but serve as a reminder of the importance of repentance. The collapse of the tower and the destruction of the temple illustrate divine judgment. True equality will be established in the future world.
