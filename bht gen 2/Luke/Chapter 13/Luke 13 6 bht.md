# Luke 13:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the parable, the fig tree represents Israel, or all those within the visible Church of God. Just as a vineyard is a place carefully cultivated for fruit, God expects His people to bear the fruits of righteousness. Yet, despite God's patience and repeated calls for holiness, Israel proved unfruitful. This parable reminds us that God seeks the fruits of holiness and judgment from His people, and that there are consequences for unfruitfulness. It also points to the ongoing need for repentance and bearing fruits worthy of His kingdom.

### John Calvin:
1. "The wicked flattery, by which hypocrites are hardened, and become more obstinate, arises from this cause, that they do not think of their sins till they are compelled; and, therefore, so long as God winks at these, and delays his chastisements, they imagine that he is well satisfied with them."
