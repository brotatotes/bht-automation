# Luke 13:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The intercession of Christ encompasses various aspects - for the unconverted, the converted, their perseverance, and glorification. Similarly, the ministers of Christ engage in intercession, pleading for sinful nations, unfruitful churches, individuals, and seeking a brief respite. They employ various means to bring fruitfulness, just as Christ and His apostles did through their ministry. The goal is to nurture and enrich, like casting dung and manure to stimulate growth. These intercessors utilize a variety of methods to address the cases of spiritual barrenness and unproductive lives.
