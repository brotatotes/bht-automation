# Luke 13:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If believers produce fruit in their lives, it is a good thing both for themselves and for the community of believers. Good works have value and benefit others. Just as it is lawful to cut down a barren tree that causes harm to other trees, it is also righteous for God to discipline those who do not produce spiritual fruit. There is hope in the midst of judgment, as seen in Moses' intercession for Israel after their sin with the golden calf. God's patience allows for the possibility of repentance and the opportunity to bear good fruit. (84 words)
