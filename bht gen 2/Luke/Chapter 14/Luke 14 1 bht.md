# Luke 14:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On the Sabbath, the Jews traditionally celebrated with elaborate feasts, a day dedicated to honor and rest. The Pharisees closely observed Jesus, hoping to catch him doing something that would provide a reason to accuse him. However, Jesus did not seek to abolish the Sabbath, but rather emphasized that acts of God and acts of charity should not be considered violations of the holy rest commanded by the law. The Pharisees' intent to tempt Jesus through their watchful eyes was both foolish and wicked, as they were well aware of his actions in similar situations.
