# Luke 14:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Sit at the lowest seat, displaying humility and avoiding embarrassment, and you will be honored instead of being put to shame. This advice aligns with the wisdom given by Solomon in Proverbs 25:6 and holds true for the social customs of Jesus' time. By taking a position of lesser honor, you open yourself up to the possibility of being elevated to a higher place of distinction.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἵνα, not expressing the view with which thou art to do it (Meyer, bezeichnet die Abficht des ἀνάπεσε), but a consequence which may follow."
2. "the view with which the act, as an objective fact, happens: the effect, of which it is (however the actor may be unaware of this) the cause."
3. "the μήποτε in Luke 14:8."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Friend—said to the modest guest only, not the proud one." 
2. "The whole of this is but a reproduction of Proverbs 25:6; Proverbs 25:7."
3. "But it was reserved for the matchless Teacher to utter articulately, and apply to the regulation of the minutest features of social life, such great laws of the Kingdom of God, as that of Proverbs 25:7."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The lowest room - The lowest seat at the table; showing that you are not desirous of distinctions, or greedy of that honor which may properly belong to you."
2. "Shalt have worship - The word 'worship' here means 'honor.' They who are sitting with you shall treat you with respect."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Sit down [αναπεσε] . Lit., lay yourself back.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Our Lord does not bid them take a low place, for the purpose of being put higher. That would be false humility. This result is the purpose of God, who commands this conduct."
2. "Have honor, lit., 'glory,' in contrast with 'shame' (Luke 14:9). 'Worship' was intended to convey the same idea."
3. "There is nothing to warrant the idea that our Lord and His disciples were themselves in the lower places, and ought to have been invited to come up higher. Such hints about promotion at a Pharisee's feast would not come from our Lord."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Sit down (αναπεσε). Second aorist active imperative of αναπιπτω, to fall up or back, to lie back or down."
2. "He that hath bidden thee (ο κεκληκως σε). Perfect active participle as in verse Luke 14:12 (τω κεκληκοτ) with which compare ο καλεσας in verse Luke 14:9 (first aorist active participle)."
3. "Go up higher (προσαναβηθ). Second aorist active imperative second singular of προσαναβαινω, an old double compound verb, but here only in the N.T. Probably, 'Come up higher,' because the call comes from the host and because of προς."

### John Gill:
1. "Place thyself at the lower end of the table, or in the most inferior seat; which will show humility and lowliness of mind, and prevent shame and mortification."
2. "Then shalt thou have worship; or glory, as the word signifies; honour and esteem, instead of shame and blushing."
3. "Advice, like to this, is given by Solomon in Proverbs 25:6 and which is explained by the Jews in like manner as here..."
