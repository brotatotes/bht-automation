# Luke 14:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God opposes the exaltation of self and rewards those who humble themselves, as seen throughout Scripture. Boasting of God's gifts implies pride and self-exaltation, disregarding the truth of our dependence on Him. Jesus reiterates the principle of humbling oneself and being exalted, emphasizing its significance in the kingdom of God. Those who exalt themselves are ultimately cast down, while the humble find favor and exaltation. This principle is exemplified in Matthew 23:12 and echoed in various passages of Scripture. Humility, therefore, is the path to true exaltation in the eyes of God.
