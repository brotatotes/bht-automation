# Luke 14:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus said, Call not thy friends, He was not disregarding ordinary fellowship but rather emphasizing a higher duty. He wanted to reprove those who sought the company of the wealthy, highlighting that it is better to extend friendship to the poor who cannot repay. By inviting the poor, we show a kind spirit and a disposition to do good beyond what is expected. Jesus' message is to be generous without seeking anything in return, for true charity lies in helping those in need rather than those who can reciprocate our kindness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Jesus certainly did not mean us to dispense with the duties of ordinary fellowship, but, remitting these to their proper place, inculcates what is better."
2. "The meaning, however, is that no exercise of principle is involved in it, as selfishness itself will suffice to prompt to it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He intended, doubtless, to reprove those who sought the society of the wealthy, and particularly rich relatives, and those who claimed to be intimate with the great and honorable."
2. "He meant, also, to commend charity shown to the poor. The passage means, therefore, call 'not only' your friends, but call also the poor."
3. "Lest they feel themselves bound to treat you with the same kindness, and, in so doing, neither you nor they will show any kind spirit, or any disposition to do good beyond what is repaid."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Dinner - supper. See on Matthew 22:4. Supper [δειπνον] is the principal meal at evening, and corresponding to the modern late dinner."
2. "Call not thy friends, etc. A striking parallel occurs in Plato's 'Phaedrus,' 233. 'And, in general, when you make a feast, invite not your friend, but the beggar and the empty soul, for they will love you, and attend you, and come about your doors, and will be the best pleased, and the most grateful, and will invoke blessings on your head.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "Acts of civility, which are customary among men, are no proof whatever of charity."
2. "To perform any act, in the hope of a reward, to rich men, from whom we expect a similar return, is not generosity, but a system of commercial exchange."
3. "What then? You may spread a table for the rich, but, at the same time, you must not neglect the poor; you may feast with your friends and relatives, but you must not shut out strangers, if they shall happen to be poor, and if you shall have the means of relieving their wants."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Call not thy friends. ‘Call,’ here means more than ‘invite,’ it implies a loud calling, an ostentatious invitation, so that the whole town knows of the entertainment."
2. "What is forbidden is the thought that this is hospitality, or in itself praiseworthy."
3. "Feasts, etc., are largely mere matters of business, not of kindness. Taken in connection with Luke 14:14, this implies that everything of that kind, however allowable, has no high moral quality, results in no reward in the future world."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Call not (μη φωνε). Μη and the present imperative active, prohibiting the habit of inviting only friends."
2. "It is the exclusive invitation of such guests that Jesus condemns."
3. "Recompense (ανταποδομα). In the form of a return invitation."

### John Gill:
1. "his sense is, that not these only should be invited, to the neglect of poor friends, poor brethren, poor kinsmen, and poor neighbours; and who, comparatively speaking, should rather be invited than the former, as being what would be more serviceable to them, and of a greater advantage in the issue to the master of the feast himself."
2. "one feasting bout for another, so that there will be no obligation on either side; and this will be all the advantage that will be gained; the return is made here, and there will be no reward hereafter."

### John Wesley:
1. "I do not bid thee call thy friends or thy neighbours. Our Lord leaves these offices of humanity and courtesy as they were, and teaches a higher duty."
2. "But is it not implied herein, that we should be sparing in entertaining those that need it not, in order to assist those that do need, with all that is saved from those needless entertainments?"
3. "Lest a recompense be made - This fear is as much unknown to the world, as even the fear of riches."
