# Luke 14:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When hosting a feast or gathering, it is important to extend the invitation to those who are in need, such as the poor, the maimed, the lame, and the blind. This invitation should be extended in a humble and unassuming manner, as exemplified by Jesus in Luke 14:12. It is worth noting that the use of the terms poor, maimed, lame, and blind does not refer solely to physical conditions, but rather encompasses all individuals who are in indigent circumstances and are in need of support and assistance.
