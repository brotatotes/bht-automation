# Luke 14:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The man exclaims, Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God, hoping to partake in the grand feast of God's kingdom. This feast, anticipated by the Jews, is believed to be a lavish banquet with abundant food and drink. However, Jesus teaches that those who assume they are entitled to be welcomed to this feast, like the Pharisee, might have misconceptions about the true nature of God's kingdom. Rather than focusing on earthly desires and pleasures, Jesus reminds us to seek the spiritual banquet of heavenly bliss.
