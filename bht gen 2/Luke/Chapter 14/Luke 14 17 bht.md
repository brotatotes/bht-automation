# Luke 14:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The master sent his servant, who symbolizes the apostles and ministers of Christ, at the time of the supper to invite the Jews to partake in the Gospel message. This invitation was not the internal call of grace, but rather an external call to partake in the outward ordinances. The call was urgent, as refusing it would be seen as a grave insult and a declaration of war. The invitation emphasized that the present dispensation was perfect and the Gospel provisions were abundant, leaving nothing to be added.

3. "for all things are now ready;...the perfection of the present dispensation, and the large provisions of the Gospel, to which nothing is, or can be brought to be added to them, or qualify for them."
