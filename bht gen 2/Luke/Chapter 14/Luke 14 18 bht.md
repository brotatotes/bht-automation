# Luke 14:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Luke 14, individuals make excuses for not attending a banquet, prioritizing worldly matters over spiritual ones. One person claims to have bought property, using it as an excuse. Their excuses reveal selfishness and a lack of spiritual concern. They prioritize worldly cares and pleasures, neglecting God's call to seek His kingdom first. These excuses are unacceptable to God, who commands us to prioritize Him above all else. It serves as a reminder that urgent worldly affairs often distract us from recognizing God's gracious offers of salvation.
