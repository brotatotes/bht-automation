# Luke 14:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The man wanted to test the oxen he had bought, but the timing was not ideal. Going to the field in the evening to test the oxen would not give an accurate result; it would have been better to do it in the morning. Similarly, the man's actions symbolize those who prioritize earthly desires over spiritual matters. They are like the carnal and worldly Jews who choose temporal things over things of eternal value.
