# Luke 14:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A man with dropsy, a condition marked by the abnormal accumulation of water in the body, was in the presence of Jesus. Dropsy typically involves the buildup of fluid in various parts of the body and is often incurable. Interestingly, this is the only recorded instance in the New Testament where Jesus heals a person with dropsy. The presence of this individual might have been a deliberate setup by the Pharisees, seeking to challenge Jesus' actions on the Sabbath. Despite the challenging circumstances, Jesus exhibited both compassion and miraculous healing power in this encounter.
