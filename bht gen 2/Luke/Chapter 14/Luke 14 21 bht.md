### Albert Barnes:
1. "Being angry - Being angry at the people who had slighted his invitation; who had so insulted him by neglecting his feast, and preferring 'for such reasons' their own gratification to his friendship and hospitality. So it is no wonder that God is angry with the wicked every day."
