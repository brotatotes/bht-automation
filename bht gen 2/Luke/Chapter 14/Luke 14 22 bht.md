# Luke 14:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostles faithfully followed the commands of their Lord and observed his instructions. Even after many had declined the invitation, there was still room for others to enter, specifically the Gentiles who were now welcomed into the fold of the church. This reveals that there is room not only in the present community of believers, but also in the future heavenly glory that awaits all who respond to the invitation.
