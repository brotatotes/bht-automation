## BHT:
This parable speaks of the extension of the kingdom of God to all people, emphasizing that salvation is offered earnestly and willingly even to the most despised. It highlights the calling of the Gentiles, who were invited after the Jews rejected the gospel. The servants of God are commanded to urge and press on sinners the salvation of the gospel, using all means possible to bring them into the heavenly banquet. The message is clear: God's grace does not discriminate, but rather compels and constrains people to enter His kingdom, even the most reluctant.
