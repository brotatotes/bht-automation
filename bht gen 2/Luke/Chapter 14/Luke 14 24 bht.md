# Luke 14:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For the command to go out in Luke 14:23 is connected to the previous statement in Luke 14:22, where the master of the feast is summing up his reasons for his conduct. This emphasizes the seriousness and certainty of what the master is saying, as he affirms that those who were initially called and rejected his invitation will not have the opportunity to taste of his supper. Thus, the command to go out is a solemn declaration of the consequences for those who refuse to respond to the call of the Gospel.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I think with Stier (iii. 202, edn. 2), that our Lord here speaks in his own Person: ὑμῖν will fit no circumstance in the parable; for the householder and his servant are alone: the guests are not present."
2. "Our Lord speaks, with His usual λέγω γὰρ ὑμῖν, to the company present: and half continuing the parable, half expounding it, substitutes Himself for the master of the feast, leaving it hardly doubtful who ἄνδρες ἐκεῖνοι οἱ κεκλημένοι are."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Our Lord here appears to throw off the veil of the parable, and proclaim the Supper His own, intimating that when transferred and transformed into its final glorious form, and the refusers themselves would give all for another opportunity, He will not allow one of them to taste it."
2. "This parable must not be confounded with that of Proverbs 1:24-33; The Marriage Supper."
3. "ADDRESS TO GREAT MULTITUDES TRAVELLING WITH HIM."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We may here see how dangerous it is 'once' to reject the gospel; how dangerous to grieve away the Holy Spirit."
2. "How often God forsakes forever the sinner who has been once awakened, and who grieves the Holy Spirit."
3. "How important, then, is it to embrace the gospel 'at once;' to accept the gracious invitation, and enter without delay the path that conducts to heaven!"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The whole discourse gains greater vividness and point if we regard the parable as closed in Luke 14:23 and our Lord as directly applying it here."
2. "This is the eating Dread in the kingdom of God, to which you look forward; though it is God’s feast, to which God has invited, it is 'my supper,' given in my honor, though I have come 'in the form of a servant' to invite you; and none of you will enter because in refusing me, you refuse to obey the second summons of God who has before invited you through His word."
3. "This discourse probably increased the already pronounced hostility."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "My supper (μου του δειπνου). Here it is still the Master of the feast who is summing up his reasons for his conduct."


### John Gill:

2. "who first had the Gospel published to them, who are the many that were called, though few were chosen, and therefore came not; nor did, nor shall taste of my supper."
3. "nor had they so much as a superficial knowledge of the Gospel, of the truths, blessings, promises, and ordinances of it; being given up to judicial blindness and hardness of heart; and from whom, in a little while, the Gospel was wholly taken; and is not yet afforded to them as a body; nor will till the latter day, when the veil shall be taken away, and they shall turn to the Lord, and all Israel shall be saved."

### John Wesley:
1. For refers to Go out, Luke 14:23.
