# Luke 14:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the great multitudes surrounded Jesus, they were originally people on their way to the Passover, joining together to form a single mass around Him. Jesus, in a deliberate and dramatic act, turned and faced the crowd, wanting to redirect their thinking and prevent false expectations. He wanted them to understand that being His disciples required sacrificing everything and being prepared to endure hardships for His sake. With a serious expression, Jesus spoke solemnly and directly to make this clear to the masses.
