# Luke 14:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If any man comes to Christ, he must hold a supreme love for Him, even above his own family members. This doesn't mean that we are to actively and personally hate our loved ones, but rather recognize that our love for Christ should take precedence over any other attachments in our lives, including our deepest relationships. We must be willing to part with anything that competes with our loyalty and devotion to Christ, even if it means sacrificing our own comfort and desires.
