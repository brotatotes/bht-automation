# Luke 14:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To be a true disciple of Jesus, one must bear their own cross, accepting trials and difficulties that come their way. Bearing one's cross means taking up the challenges of life, even if they are disagreeable. Just as Jesus was about to bear his own cross, every disciple is called to a similar path. Without this willingness, one cannot truly be a disciple. It is through embracing these challenges that one can follow in the footsteps of Jesus and find true discipleship.
