# Luke 14:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Building a tower, like taking up the profession of Christ and his Gospel, must be done on a good foundation. It should be strong and steady, serving as a firm fortress against apostasy. Therefore, before embarking on this journey, it is crucial to consider the foundation upon which one is building. This includes examining one's personal faith, understanding the purpose of Gospel ordinances, evaluating the church and minister with whom they will walk, and recognizing the charge and cost of this commitment. It is not something to be undertaken lightly, but rather with a deliberate and well-considered approach.
