# Luke 14:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Beware, for there is a danger in starting something without being able to finish it. Just as a poorly laid foundation will not allow a building to reach completion, so too will a project that is begun but not progressed. Those who witness such unfinished works will be quick to ridicule and deride, mocking the lack of fulfillment. May we be diligent in our endeavors, ensuring that we have the ability and commitment to see them through to the end.
