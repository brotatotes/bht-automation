# Luke 14:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christian discipleship requires self-renunciation and forsaking all possessions and worldly attachments. It is not a literal call to abandon everything, but rather to hold all things loosely, giving God priority over them. The true self-denial lies in redirecting our affections and enjoying earthly things only in a way that leads us closer to God. When we do not forsake all that we have, we cannot truly be disciples of Christ.
