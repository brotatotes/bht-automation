# Luke 14:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Salt is good, as it signifies the role of every Christian, and particularly ministers, in bringing influence and preservation to the world (Matthew 5:13; Mark 9:50). Just as salt enhances flavor and preserves food, Christians are called to be a positive influence, conserving and seasoning the souls of others. It is essential for disciples to embrace self-renunciation and guard against selfishness, for by losing this distinctive quality, they would be ineffective in fulfilling their mission of preserving and enriching the lives of those around them.
