# Luke 14:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If you have an animal that has fallen into a pit on the Sabbath, would you not immediately rescue it? This is the very argument that Jesus is making to the lawyers and Pharisees, putting them on the defensive. It is only right and necessary that if we see a fellow human being, like the dropsical man who is drowning in his condition, we should extend the same care and compassion. Jesus uses a similar line of reasoning in this case.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There is a strict propriety in the comparison: the accident and disease are analogous."
2. "The point of comparison is the ownership, and consequent tender care, of the object in question. 'Those who are in your possession and care, whether belonging to your families, or your herds, are cared for, and rescued from perishing: am I (the possessor of heaven and earth, this lies in the background) to let mine perish without care or rescue?'"
3. "There may be in the words the meaning 'son, or even ox;' but I prefer rendering them simply."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Pit [φρεαρ] . The primary meaning is a well, as distinguished from a fountain. Pull out. More correctly up [ανα] .

### John Calvin:
1. "He shows that he did nothing inconsistent with the observance of the Sabbath."
2. "If we are at liberty to relieve brute animals on Sabbath, it would be unreasonable that we should not perform a similar office of kindness to man, who is formed after the image of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If on the Sabbath you help what is your own, then help others (love thy neighbor as thyself)."
2. "The common reading; 'an ass or an ox,' suggests the same argument as in chap. Luke 13:15-16; if you would do this for a dumb animal, much more for a human being."
3. "As in chap. Luke 13:15-16, we find here an analogy between the case cited and the condition of the dropsical man; the danger in the well was that of drowning."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The manuscripts are much divided between υιος (son) and ονος (ass) which in the abbreviated uncials looked much alike... The very form of the question is a powerful argument and puts the lawyers and the Pharisees hopelessly on the defensive."
2. "The sentence in the Greek reads literally thus: Whose ox or ass of you shall fall (πεσειτα, future middle of πιπτο) into a well and he (the man) will not straightway draw him up (ανασπασε, future active of ανασπαω) on the sabbath day?"
3. "The very form of the question is a powerful argument and puts the lawyers and the Pharisees hopelessly on the defensive."

### John Gill:
1. "Which of you shall have an ass, or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day?" 
2. "It must be much more right and necessary to cure a man, a reasonable creature, just drowning with a dropsy, as this man was." 
3. "A like kind of reasoning is used by Christ."
