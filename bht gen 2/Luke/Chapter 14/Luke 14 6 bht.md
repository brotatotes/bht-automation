# Luke 14:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The incident in Luke 14:6 demonstrates how the religious leaders were utterly defeated by Jesus' reasoning. They lacked the strength and ability to come up with a counter-argument, which left them silenced and frustrated. Their frustration likely stemmed from the fact that Jesus' reasoning exposed their hypocrisy and challenged their own beliefs and practices. Deep down, they resented the fact that they cared more about their own possessions and traditions than they did about the well-being of others. Ultimately, their inability to respond revealed the justice, equity, mercy, and humanity that radiated from Jesus' teachings.
