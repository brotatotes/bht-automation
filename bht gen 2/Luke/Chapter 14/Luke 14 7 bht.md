# Luke 14:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This parable teaches a deeper lesson than mere politeness or good manners. Jesus is instructing about humility at a feast, using the scenario of choosing the chief rooms. By exposing the ambition and envy of the Pharisees, who sought the highest places, Jesus warns against seeking petty distinctions. He shows that those who proudly exalt themselves will ultimately be humbled by God, while those who humble themselves will be exalted. This lesson applies not only to feasts but to all areas of life, where the proud will be brought low and the humble will be lifted up.
