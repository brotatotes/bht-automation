# Luke 14:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The allusion to a different kind of entertainment than the host's feast suggests a deeper meaning, linking it to the Kingdom of God. False humility is excluded in this parable, as the exaltation at the hands of the host follows true humility. Sitting in the highest place does not guarantee honor, as the host may have plans for a more honorable guest. It is important to consider the potential status of others who may be invited to the feast.

2. "All that false humility, by which men put themselves lowest and dispraise themselves of set purpose to be placed higher, is, by the very nature of our Lordâ€™s parable, excluded: for that is not bona fide Ï„Î±Ï€ÎµÎ¹Î½Î¿á¿¦Î½ á¼‘Î±Ï…Ï„ÏŒÎ½."
3. "The exaltation at the hands of the Host is not to be a subjective end to the guests, but will follow true humility."
