# Luke 14:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When attending a gathering, it is better to choose a lower place than to assume a higher position. By doing so, one avoids the shame and embarrassment that come with being asked to move to a lower seat. This action exposes any pride or vanity in seeking the most prestigious place and teaches the importance of humility. The one who was once in a prominent position will experience the humiliation of being moved to the lowest seat, in full view of all the guests.
