# Luke 15:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A multitude of people, including publicans and sinners, gathered around Jesus, drawn by His powerful teachings. The word all signifies the large number of individuals from surrounding cities and towns who came seeking Him. Their curiosity and perhaps a sense of remorse prompted them to listen to His message. This gathering occurred either when Jesus was at the Pharisee's house or upon His departure, attracting a crowd eager to be near Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "They were continually about Him, struck perhaps with penitence, found, by His seeking them: having come from the husks of a life of sin, to the bread of life; so the three parables seem to imply."
2. "A general term, admitting of course of exceptions."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Drawn around Him by the extraordinary adaptation of His teaching to their case, who, till He appearedâ€”at least His forerunnerâ€”might well say, 'No man careth for my soul.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. Publicans and sinners - See the notes at Matthew 9:10.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The only objection to this interpretation, arising in Luke 15:8, is answered by that verse itself, which indicates that the whole parable is borrowed from the actions of â€˜the sons of this world,â€™ and only partially applicable to â€˜the sons of the lightâ€™"
2. "Existing political circumstances may have suggested some points in the parable, but a direct application to these things is out of the question."
3. "The view that mammon is the lord, involves, here the strange idea that this waste is equivalent to entering the service of Christ, since they could not â€˜serve God and mammon.â€™ And so throughout the whole, this interpretation compels us to take the worst acts in the parable as representing the best in the application."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The publicans are put on the same level with the outcasts or sinners."
2. "The use of 'all' here may be hyperbole for very many or the reference may be to these two classes in the particular place where Jesus was from time to time."
3. "Periphrastic imperfect of ÎµÎ³Î³Î¹Î¶Ï‰, from ÎµÎ³Î³Ï…Ï‚ (near), late verb."

### John Gill:
1. "The word 'all' is omitted in the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, Persic, and Ethiopic versions; but the Arabic version has it, and the Greek copies; and signifies that there were a very large number of them, even all that were in that place, and in the adjacent cities and towns, that got together." 
2. "These having heard much of him; and it may be, might be under some remorse of conscience on account of their vicious lives, came to hear him preach."
3. "To 'Jesus', as the Persic and Ethiopic versions express it: this was on the sabbath day, and either when he was in the Pharisee's house, where he was invited to dinner, or rather when he came out of it, when the multitude, who could not come near him whilst there, took the opportunity of gathering about him."
