# Luke 15:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The presence of joy in the company of the angels of God is significant. This joy stems from the deliverance of someone from the hands of Satan and his angelic counterparts, who harbor a deep-rooted hostility. Moreover, the occasion for rejoicing is the addition of a new member to the divine family, prompting a shared celebration and communal worship. It is worth noting that the angels are not passive witnesses but active participants, standing as friends and neighbors of Christ.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "True to the idea of the parables, the Great Shepherd, the Great Owner Himself, is He whose the joy properly is over His own recovered property."
2. "In this sublime sense it is 'joy,' before 'or in the presence of the angels' they only 'catch the flying joy,' sharing it with Him!"
3. "Let the reader mark what sublime claims Himself our Lord covertly puts in here‚Äîas if in Him they beheld, all unknown to themselves, nothing less than heaven in the habiliments of earth, the Great Shepherd above, clothed in a garment of flesh, come 'to seek and to save that which was lost'!"

### John Calvin:
1. "If angels mutually rejoice with each other in heaven, when they see that what had wandered is restored to the fold, we too, who have the same cause in common with them, ought to be partakers of the same joy."
2. "Though it would be more agreeable to the wishes of angels (as it is also more desirable) that men should always remain in perfect integrity, yet as in the deliverance of a sinner, who had been already devoted to destruction, and had been cut off as a rotten member from the body, the mercy of God shines more brightly, he attributes to angels, after the manner of men, a greater joy arising out of an unexpected good."
3. "The word repentance is specially limited to the conversion of those who, having altogether turned aside from God, rise as it were from death to life." (134 words)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Lest it should seem strange that so much importance is attached to the proper use of perishing and unrighteous wealth, remember the great principle: ‚ÄòHe that is faithful,‚Äô etc."
2. "This refers to earthly possessions, and the faithfulness is the wise and prudent conduct suggested by the parable."
3. "This verse opposes the view that the service of mammon is meant in the parable, for according to that interpretation it is by being unfaithful to mammon that true fidelity is to be reached."

3. "The angels are in a sense the neighbours of God."

### John Gill:
