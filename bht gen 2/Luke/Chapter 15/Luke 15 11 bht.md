# Luke 15:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this parable, Jesus uses the characters of two sons to represent different groups of people. The elder son symbolizes the self-righteous and religious leaders, while the younger son represents the sinsners and outcasts. Through this story, Jesus shows that both groups are part of God's family and are in need of His grace and forgiveness. Just as the father eagerly welcomes back his wayward son, God extends His love and mercy to all who repent and turn to Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The two parties standing in the foreground of the parabolic mirror are, the Scribes and Pharisees as the elder son, the publicans and sinners as the younger; all, Jews: all belonging to God’s family."
2. "The mystery of the admission of the Gentiles into God’s Church was not yet made known in any such manner as that they should be represented as of one family with the Jews."
3. "The relations of elder and younger have a peculiar fitness for the characters to be filled by them, and are I believe chosen on that account."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jesus, to illustrate still farther the sentiment which he had uttered, and to show that it was proper to rejoice over repenting sinners, proceeds to show it by a most beautiful and instructive parable."
2. "We shall see its beauty and propriety by remembering that the ‘design’ of it was simply to ‘justify his conduct in receiving sinners,’ and to show that to rejoice over their return was proper."
3. "This he shows by the feelings of a ‘father’ rejoicing over the ‘return’ of an ungrateful and dissipated son."

### John Calvin:
1. "In the person of a young prodigal who, after having been reduced to the deepest poverty by luxury and extravagance, returns as a suppliant to his father, (521) to whom he had been disobedient and rebellious, Christ describes all sinners who, wearied of their folly, apply to the grace of God."
2. "To the kind father, (522) on the other hand, who not only pardons the crimes of his son, but of his own accord meets him when returning, he compares God, who is not satisfied with pardoning those who pray to him, but even advances to meet them with the compassion of a father."
3. "Let us now examine the parable in detail. (520)"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In your use of it, i.e., 'faithful in that which is least.'" 
2. "Such unfaithfulness proves us unfaithful in much (Luke 15:10), according to the judgment of God, who will not therefore entrust us with the true riches."
3. "The word 'riches' is properly supplied in the translation, although the literal sense is 'the true,' that which is real, as opposed to the deceitful nature of earthly wealth."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Here (verses Luke 15:11-32) we have the most famous of all the parables of Jesus, the Prodigal Son, which is in Luke alone."
2. "We have had the Lost Sheep, the Lost Coin, and now the Lost Son."
3. "Bruce notes that in the moral sphere there must be self-recovery to give ethical value to the rescue of the son who wandered away. That comes out beautifully in this allegory."

### John Gill:
1. "By the 'two sons' are meant, not angels and men... nor are the Jews and Gentiles... rather standing and fallen professors may be designed."
2. "The true sense... is, that by the elder son are meant, the Scribes and Pharisees, and self-righteous persons, among the Jews; and by the younger, the publicans and sinners among the same people."
3. "God's elect among them, even those that lay among publicans and sinners, were truly so; and that before conversion; for they were not only predestinated to the adoption of children, but were really taken into the relation of children, in the covenant of grace."
