# Luke 15:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This passage highlights a common human tendency to resist divine control and strive for independence. It represents a desire to be one's own master, a sin that encompasses all subsequent sins. The parable vividly illustrates the permission of free will given to mankind and warns against the dangers of seeking something better apart from God. It reminds us that departing from God leads to the exchange of a light yoke for a heavy one and abandoning a gracious Master for countless tyrants and lords.

### Henry Alford:
1. "Such a request as this is shown by Orientalists to have been known in the East, though not among the Jews."
2. "The parable sets before us very strikingly the permission of free will to man."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This is man impatient of divine control, desiring to be independent of God, seeking to be his own master that 'sin of sins, in which all subsequent sins are included as in their germ, for they are but the unfolding of this one'" [TRENCH].
2. "Thus 'God, when His service no longer appears a perfect freedom, and man promises himself something far better elsewhere, allows him to make the trial and he shall discover, if need be by saddest proof, that to depart from Him is not to throw off the yoke, but to exchange a light yoke for a heavy one, and one gracious Master for a thousand imperious tyrants and lords'" [TRENCH].

### Albert Barnes:
1. "By this younger son we are to understand the publicans and sinners to be represented. By the older, the Pharisees and scribes." 
2. "There is no impropriety in supposing that he was of age; and, as he chose to leave his fatherâ€™s house, it was proper that his father should, if he chose, give him the part of the estate which would be his."
3. "Among the ancient Romans and Syrophoenicians, it was customary, when a son came to the years of maturity, if he demanded his part of the inheritance, for the father to give it to him. This the son might claim by law."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "According to the Jewish law of inheritance, if there were but two sons, the elder would receive two portions, the younger the third of all movable property."
2. "A man might, during his lifetime, dispose of all his property by gift as he chose."
3. "The younger son thus was entitled by law to his share, though he had not right to claim it during his father's lifetime."

### John Calvin:
1. "Under this image our Lord unquestionably depicts to us the boundless goodness and inestimable forbearance of God, that no crimes, however aggravated, may deter us from the hope of obtaining pardon." 
2. "He afterwards describes the punishment which, in the righteous judgment of God, generally overtakes spendthrifts and prodigals...They are made to feel that they are unworthy to partake of human food; for it is swinish gluttony to squander wickedly what was given for the support of life."
3. "I understand the meaning to be, that no man pitied his poverty; for prodigals who throw away the whole of their property are persons whom no man thinks himself bound to relieve, â€” nay more, as they have been accustomed to squander everything, men think that nothing ought to be given to them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Earthly wealth is held in trust; the true riches are described as your own."
2. "Wealth can never form a part of our being, is never permanently in our possession."
3. "But that which God gives to us as true riches will form a part of our eternal being, is our inalienable possession."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The father did not have to abdicate in favour of the sons, but 'this very human parable here depicts the impatience of home restraints and the optimistic ambition of youth' (Ragg)." 
2. "The elder son got his share also of the 'substance' or property or estate (Ï„Î·Ï‚ Î¿Ï…ÏƒÎ¹Î±Ï‚), 'the living' (Ï„Î¿Î½ Î²Î¹Î¿Î½) as in Mark 12:44, not 'life' as in Luke 8:14."

### John Gill:
1. "God's chosen ones among the publicans and sinners, are fitly signified by the younger son, since man, as a sinner, is younger than man as righteous."
2. "The characters and conduct of young men agree with God's elect, in a state of nature who are imprudent and ignorant, without any knowledge of divine and spiritual things, and of themselves, their state and condition, and of Christ, and salvation by him."
3. "The request made by this younger son, is 'to his Father,' to God, who was his Father by creation, by providential care, and by national adoption, and by special grace; though as yet he knew it not, nor could he call him so in faith."

### John Wesley:
1. Give me the part of goods that falleth to me â€” See the root of all sin! A desire of disposing of ourselves; of independency on God!
