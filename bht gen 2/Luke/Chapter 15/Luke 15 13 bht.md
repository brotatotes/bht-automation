# Luke 15:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He embarked on a journey to a distant land, symbolizing his separation from God and his descent into a life of indulgence. In this distant land, he wasted his resources, squandering away all that he had been given. His reckless and extravagant lifestyle reflected his complete disregard for the value and purpose of his possessions. He lived in rebellion, far removed from the presence of the Father and the guidance of His love.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The images of both the preceding parables are united here: in ἀπεδήμησεν we have the straying sheep; in his state when he got into the far country, the lost piece of money. But in this case the search is to be carried on within him, we are now on higher ground than in those two parables." (Trench, in loc.)
2. "‘Regio longinqua est oblivio Dei,’ Augustine." (Trench, in loc.)
3. "ἀσώτως] The old English word retchlessly expresses perhaps best the meaning, which is not ‘unsparingly’ (in which sense of ‘saving money’ I doubt σώζω ever being used), but incorrigibly, past hope of reclaim: ἄσωτος, ὁ διʼ αὑτὸν ἀπολλύμενος, Aristot. Eth. iv. 1." (Trench, in loc.)

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Not many days—intoxicated with his new-found resources, and eager for the luxury of using them at will."
2. "A far country—beyond all danger of interference from home."
3. "Wasted, c.—So long as it lasted, the inward monitor would be silenced."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Gathered all together - Collected his property. If he had received flocks or grain, he sold them and converted them into money."
2. "Into a far country - A country far off from his father’s house. He went probably to trade or to seek his fortune, and in his wanderings came at last to this dissipated place, where his property was soon expended."
3. "Wasted his substance - Spent his property.In riotous living - Literally, 'Living without saving anything.' He lived extravagantly, and in the most dissolute company."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Everything was taken out of the father's hands."
2. "Wasted. The word used of winnowing grain."
3. "Living unsavingly. Only here in New Testament."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Since the proper use of wealth is for God, those who do not thus use it are slaves to Mammon."
2. "The last verse implies that wealth is not our own, this implies that when it is used as our own, the presumed owner not only does not own it, but himself belongs to it."
3. "There is not a word here capable of a communistic interpretation. Our Lord speaks of wealth as ‘that which is least,’ modern socialism regards money as the true riches."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He burned all his bridges behind him, gathering together all that he had."
2. "More exactly he scattered his property. It is the word used of winnowing grain."
3. "He went the limit of sinful excesses."

### John Gill:
1. "As soon as a man has the exercise of his reason, as soon as he can think and speak, nay, as soon as he is born, he goes astray from God, speaking lies."
2. "He is for living independent of God, and his providence; he is for gathering together all for himself, in order to spend it on his lusts, and at a distance from his father, the father of his mercies."
3. "The sinner is in a state of alienation, afar off from God, from the presence of God, and communion with him: from the knowledge of God, and desire after it; from love to him, or fear of him; and from the life of God, or a living soberly, righteously, and godly."

### John Wesley:
1. He took a journey into a far country — Far from God: God was not in all his thoughts: And squandered away his substance - All the grace he had received.
