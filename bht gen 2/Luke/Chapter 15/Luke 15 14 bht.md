# Luke 15:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The prodigal son's indulgence in sin led him down a path of emptiness and want, both materially and spiritually. The famine he experienced symbolized the consequences of his actions and the lack he felt in his soul. Sin has a way of stripping away all that is good, leaving one in a wretched and miserable state. This profound sense of need can push a person towards despair or repentance. It serves as a reminder that true fulfillment cannot be found in the pursuit of sin, but only through embracing God's grace and seeking spiritual redemption.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This famine is the shepherd seeking his stray sheep, the woman sweeping to find the lost."
2. "The famine, in the interpretation, is to be subjectively taken; he begins to be in want, to feel the emptiness of soul which precedes either utter abandonment or true penitence."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "a mighty famine—a mysterious providence holding back the famine till he was in circumstances to feel it in all its rigor."
2. "Thus, like Jonah, whom the storm did not overtake till on the mighty deep at the mercy of the waves, does the sinner feel as if 'the stars in their courses were fighting against' him."
3. "in want—the first stage of his bitter experience, and preparation for a change."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Famines were common in Eastern nations...caused by the failure of the crops...by a want of timely rains, a genial sun, or sometimes by the prevalence of the plague or of the pestilence..."
2. "In this case it is very naturally connected with the luxury, the indolence, and the dissipation of the people in that land."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Spent." See on cost, ch. 14 28.
2. "In that land." Want is characteristic of the "far country." The prodigal feels the evil of his environment. "He (with a shade of emphasis) began to be in want."
3. "To be in want [υστερεισθαι]." From usterov, behind. Compare our phrase of one in straitened circumstances, to fall behind.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The enjoyment of sin is brief."
2. "External circumstances hasten the consequences of sin, and are used by God to lead to repentance."
3. "Conscious emptiness of soul must lead one way or the other; to despair or to repentance."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "When he had spent (δαπανησαντος αυτου). Genitive absolute. The verb is here used in a bad sense as in James 4:3. See on δαπανη Luke 14:28."
2. "To be in want (υστερεισθα). The verb is from υστερος, behind or later (comparative). We use 'fall behind' (Vincent) of one in straitened circumstances."
3. "Plummer notes the coincidences of Providence. The very land was in a famine when the boy had spent all."

### John Gill:
1. "Sin strips a man of all that is good and valuable...hence man is in a wretched and miserable condition, he is poor, and blind, and naked."
2. "Sin brings men into a starving and famishing condition...unregenerate men have no desire to [the Gospel], but neglect and despise it."
3. "An unregenerate man is in want of every thing that is good; of wisdom and knowledge, of grace and holiness, of righteousness or clothing, of food, and of all the necessaries of life."

### John Wesley:
1. He began to be in want — All his worldly pleasures failing, he grew conscious of his want of real good.
