# Luke 15:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this story, a person, consumed by pride and unwilling to humble themselves, attaches themselves forcefully to a citizen who begrudgingly hires them. The individual is then assigned the degrading task of feeding swine, which not only carries physical repulsiveness but also cultural and religious disgrace. The parable serves as a vivid illustration of how sin can lead to a complete reversal of roles, turning the one who was once in control into a lowly servant. It highlights the destructive nature of sin and the consequences of seeking freedom apart from God's guidance.
