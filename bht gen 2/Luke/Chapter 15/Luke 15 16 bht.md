# Luke 15:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The son, desperate and hungry, longed to satisfy himself with the husks, the external things that have no substance or true satisfaction. But his striving to find fulfillment through his own works is like trying to fill his belly with the east wind; it can never truly satisfy, as it falls short of God's law and justice. In his misery, he sought for someone to give unto him, but only Christ can provide the true bread of life to the hungry and needy.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "These are not the husks or pods of some other fruit, as of peas or beans, but themselves a fruit, that of the carob tree."
2. "They are in shape something like a bean-pod, though larger and more curved, thence called κεράτιον or little horn, … they have a hard dark outside and a dull sweet taste … the shell or pod alone is eaten."
3. "We see him now in the depth of his misery, the sinner reaping the consequences of his sin in utter shame and extremity of need."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "The shell or pod alone is eaten. It grows in Southern Italy and Spain, and it is said that during the Peninsular War the horses of the British cavalry were often fed upon the pods." 
3. "It is also called Saint John's bread, from a tradition that the Baptist fed upon its fruit in the wilderness."

### Philip Schaff:

### John Gill:
1. "By these 'husks' are meant works of righteousness done by men; which are like husks, external things, done only before men; empty things that have nothing within them; mere trash, and not food; and which can give no satisfaction; mere sordid food, fit only to be cast to dogs or swine."
2. "He laboured hard to make his own righteousness do; which was but striving to fill his belly with the east wind; and is what can never satisfy, because it is not answerable to the law and justice of God."
3. "And no man gave unto him... and indeed none but Christ can give the true bread, the bread of life, to those that are hungry, and in want."

### John Wesley:
1. He would fain have filled his belly with the husks — He would fain have satisfied himself with worldly comforts. Vain, fruitless endeavour!
