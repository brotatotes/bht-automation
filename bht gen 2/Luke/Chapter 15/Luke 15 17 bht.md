# Luke 15:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When a person reaches a state of being beside himself, it signifies a type of madness or insanity caused by rebellion against God. However, there comes a moment of awakening where they come to their senses, recognizing the emptiness of their ways. This turning point is like a restoration of sound consciousness, a return to sanity. It is a reminder that folly and rebellion lead to destruction, but through repentance, we can find forgiveness and restore our connection with God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "The most dreadful torment of the lost, in fact that which constitutes their state of torment, will be this Œµ·º∞œÇ ·ºëŒ±œÖœÑ·Ω∏ŒΩ ·ºêŒªŒ∏Œµ·øñŒΩ, when too late for repentance."

2. "His heart being wholly estranged from home and steeped in selfish gratification, his father's house never came within the range of his vision, or but as another name for bondage and gloom."
3. "Now empty, desolate, withered, perishing, home, with all its peace, plenty, freedom, dignity, starts into view, fills all his visions as a warm and living reality, and breaks his heart."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He came to himself - This is a very expressive phrase. It is commonly applied to one who has been ‚Äúderanged,‚Äù and when he recovers we say he has 'come to himself.' In this place it denotes that the folly of the young man was a kind of derangement - that he was insane."
2. "So it is of every sinner. Madness is in their hearts; they are estranged from God, and led, by the influence of evil passions, contrary to their better judgment and the decisions of a sound mind."
3. "Hired servants - Those in a low condition of life - those who were not born to wealth, and who had no friends to provide for them."

1. "If of their own accord they were wise, and became submissive, he would draw them more gently; but as they never stoop to obedience, till they have been subdued by the rod, he chastises them severely."
2. "Instructed by this example, let us not imagine that God deals cruelly with us, if at any time he visits us with heavy afflictions; for in this manner those who were obstinate and intoxicated with mirth are taught by him to be obedient."
3. "It must also be observed, that the hope of bettering his condition, if he returned to his father, gave this young man courage to repent; for no severity of punishment will soften our depravity, or make us displeased with our sins, till we perceive some advantage."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A life of sin is in a certain sense irrational."
2. "Notice, that the man came to himself more readily among the swine than among the harlots."
3. "The contrast is made at every point. God‚Äôs Providential care is alluded to in this part of the parable."

2. "The self-righteous person trusts in his own heart, which is the greatest madness and folly in the world; he compasses himself about with sparks of his own kindling, and sacrifices to his own net."
3. "Rather therefore the meanest of the saints, and household of God, are here meant, who have the least degree of evangelical light, whose faith is weak, and their consolation small; and who, though they are sons, yet by reason of that legality and mercenariness that appear in their frames and services, differ little from servants."

### John Wesley:
1. And coming to himself ‚Äî For till then he was beside himself, as all men are, so long as they are without God in the world.
