# Luke 15:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The prodigal son made up his mind and immediately acted upon his resolution, ignoring any doubts or discouragements. He set off on his journey back to his father, not consulting with anyone or letting any obstacles deter him. In the meantime, the father eagerly watched, waiting for his son to return. Even when the son was still far away, the father spotted him and recognized him, showing his love and compassion from afar.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "our Father recognizes His own child in us, and bounds to meet us—not saying, Let him come to Me and sue for pardon first, but Himself taking the first step." 
3. "In all his filth? Yes. In all his rags? Yes. In all his haggard, shattered wretchedness? Yes. 'Our Father who art in heaven,' is this Thy portraiture? It is even so."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He did not 'run,' but came driven by his wants, and, as we may suppose, filled with shame, and even with some doubts whether his father would receive him."

### John Calvin:
1. "If men, who are by nature prone to revenge, and too tenacious of their own rights, are moved by fatherly love kindly to forgive their children, and freely to bring them back, when they are sunk in wretchedness, God, whose boundless goodness exceeds all the affection of parents, will not treat us more harshly." 
2. "As this father, therefore, is not merely pacified by the entreaties of his son, but meets him when he is coming, and before he has heard a word, embraces him, filthy and ugly as he is, so God does not wait for a long prayer, but of his own free will meets the sinner as soon as he proposes to confess his fault."
3. "It is wretched sophistry to infer from this, that the grace of God is not exhibited to sinners until they anticipate it by their repentance."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The father seems to have expected him; God certainly expects the penitent sinner."
2. "The father’s conduct is itself a seeking of the lost son. God is waiting to be gracious; He comes to meet us in His mercy; He manifests it before our penitent utterances."
3. "The token and seal of love. ‘The Saviour and mediator is concealed in the kiss’ (Riggenbach)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "To his father (προς τον πατερα εαυτου). Literally, to his own father. He acted at once on his decision."
2. "Yet afar off (ετ αυτου μακραν απεχοντος). Genitive absolute. Μακραν agrees with οδον understood: While he was yet holding off a distant way. This shows that the father had been looking for him to come back and was even looking at this very moment as he came in sight."
3. "Kissed (κατεφιλησεν). Note perfective use of κατα kissed him much, kissed him again and again. The verb occurs so in the older Greek."

2. "While he was yet a great way off, his father saw him."
