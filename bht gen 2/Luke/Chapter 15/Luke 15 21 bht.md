# Luke 15:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The prodigal son, burdened by his sins, begins his confession but is unable to finish it as the gracious father interrupts him. The son had planned to ask to be made as one of the hired servants, yet the father's overwhelming love prevents him from uttering these words. Instead, the son is completely embraced and affirmed by his father, shutting his mouth and realizing that being taken to the father's heart is more than enough. The genuine repentance and heartfelt confession of the son demonstrate the transforming power of God's grace and the father's unconditional love.
