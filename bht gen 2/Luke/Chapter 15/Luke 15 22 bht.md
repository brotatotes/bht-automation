# Luke 15:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The father's interruption of the son's planned speech is a profound demonstration of his overwhelming love and acceptance. Instead of allowing the son to finish his confession, the father quickly moves to express his forgiveness and restore his son's position. This interruption mirrors how God often cuts our confessions short through His mercy and grace, not fixating on our faults, but rather showering us with His love and acceptance. It is a reminder that God's forgiveness is immediate and His desire to restore us to a place of honor and privilege is unwavering.
