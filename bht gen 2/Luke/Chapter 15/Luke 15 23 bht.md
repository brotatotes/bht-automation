# Luke 15:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The significance of the fatted calf lies in its association with feasts and celebrations. It represents the joyous occasion of the son's return. Bringing the calf signifies the act of preaching and presenting Christ as the ultimate sustenance for believers. The act of feasting symbolizes the joy and merriment that should accompany partaking of Christ. This joy is not superficial, but stems from a sincere and profound gratitude for the abundant blessings and grace that God provides.
