# Luke 15:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He, who had once behaved so wickedly and judged himself unworthy, was brought back to life by the Spirit of adoption, witnessing his sonship to God. It was truly a reason for joy and mirth, as anyone quickened by the Spirit of God will never face condemnation or death again but live and reign with Christ eternally. This marked the beginning of abundant joy and pleasure for him, as he began to experience the true blessings of a restored relationship with God.
