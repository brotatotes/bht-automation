# Luke 15:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Self-righteous individuals like the Scribes and Pharisees in this passage lack understanding of the Gospel. They cannot comprehend the concept of God's unfailing love being extended to sinners, without promoting licentiousness. Their ignorance extends to salvation through Christ's righteousness, justification, peace, pardon, regeneration, and faith in Christ. They are unaware of the internal work of grace that brings about peace and joy, and they remain strangers to the person, offices, and grace of Christ.
