# Luke 15:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parable of the prodigal son reveals the deep-seated wrath of the self-righteous towards those who have strayed. The anger of the elder brother stems from his long-held resentment and suspicion of the father's partiality. However, it serves as a sobering reminder that pride can blind us to the abundant love and grace of God. The refusal of the elder brother to join in the celebration warns us of the danger of rejecting the message of salvation and shutting ourselves off from God's mercy and forgiveness.
