# Luke 15:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parable illustrates the contrast between the elder son's external, law-based service to his father and the genuine, heartfelt repentance of the younger son. By using the phrase not even once, the elder son expresses his dissatisfaction with the reward he receives, revealing the essential failure of a self-righteous mindset. This highlights the importance of experiencing true repentance and the joy that comes from being reconciled with God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἰδ. τοσ. ἔτη δουλ. σοι, the very manner of speech of a Pharisee: as is the continuation οὐδέπ. ἐντ. σου παρ. Could the Jewish nation be introduced saying this, even in the falsest hypocrisy?"
2. "ἐμοὶ οὐδέποτε ἔδωκας answers to the younger son’s δός μοι in Luke 15:12; it is a separation of the individual son from his father, and, as there pointed out, the very root and ground of sin."
3. "ἔριφον, of less value than a calf."
4. "τ. φίλ. μου who are these? this elder son also then has friends, who are not his father’s friends: see Matthew 22:16, τ. μαθητὰς αὐτῶν μετὰ τῶν Ἡρωδιανῶν."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He is merely contrasting his constancy of love and service with the conduct of his brother."
2. "Here lay his misapprehension. It was no entertainment for the gratification of the prodigal: it was a father's expression of the joy he felt at his recovery."
3. "How unworthy a reflection on the common father of both, for the one not only to disown the other, but fling him over upon his father, as if he should say, Take him, and have joy of him!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A kid - A young goat. This was of less value than the calf; and he complains that while his father had never given 'him' a thing of so little value as 'a kid,' he had now given his other son the 'fatted calf.'"
2. "Make merry with - Entertain them, give them a feast."
3. "This complaint was unreasonable, for his father had divided his property, and he 'might' have had his portion, and his father had uniformly treated him with kindness. But it serves to illustrate the conduct of the scribes and Pharisees, and the folly of their complaint."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Kid [εριφον] . Some read the diminutive, ejrifion, "a little kid." In any event a contrast is intended between the kid and the fatted calf.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The words of the elder son prove that his obedience in the past had not been hearty, and that he was now in opposition to his father's will."
2. "Self-righteousness is dissatisfied with the reward it receives. The essential failure of Pharisaism is its want of love to God despite its external obedience."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Progressive present tense of this old verb from δουλος (slave) which the elder son uses to picture his virtual slavery in staying at home and perhaps with longings to follow the younger son." 
2. "Not even once (aorist) in contrast with so many years of service (linear present)." 
3. "Final clause, first aorist passive subjunctive of the same verb used in verses Luke 15:23; Luke 15:25."

### John Gill:
1. "He served his father, not in the Gospel, but in the law, moral and ceremonial; in the letter of it, and not in the newness of the Spirit; externally, and not internally; from fear, and not from love; with mercenary views, and not freely." 
2. "He had never been under a work of the Spirit of God, who convinces of sin; and had never seen himself in a true light, in the glass of that law, he pretended to serve God in."
3. "He could not be a good man, for so to say, is contrary to the experience of all good men; to their groans, complaints, and confessions; to their prayers, for fresh application of pardoning grace; and to the observation of all wise and good men in all ages."

### John Wesley:
1. "How admirably therefore does this parable confirm that assertion!"
2. "Perhaps God does not usually give much joy to those who never felt the sorrows of repentance."
