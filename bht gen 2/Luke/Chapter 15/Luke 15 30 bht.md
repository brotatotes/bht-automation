# Luke 15:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The elder brother’s refusal to acknowledge his younger brother as his own reflects a great contempt and disregard for both his brother and his father. The elder brother would have preferred a harsher punishment and works-based salvation for his brother, while also suggesting that his father's actions were unbecoming and reflected negatively on his own sense of worth and righteousness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I will not count such an impure person my brother."
2. "A covert reproach of his father for having given it to him."
3. "Even supposing it a necessary inference from the kind of life which he had been leading, it was one which nothing but the bitterest jealousy would have uttered at such a time."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This is an expression of great contempt. He did not call him 'his brother,' but 'his father's son,' to show at once his contempt for his younger brother, and for his father for having received him as he did."
2. "Never was there a more striking instance of petty malice, or more unjustifiable disregard of a father's conduct and will."
3. "It was true that the younger son had been guilty, and foolish, and ungrateful; but he was penitent, and 'that' was of more consequence to the father than all his property."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "This thy son. Not my brother, but with the bitterest sarcasm."
2. "He says came, as of a stranger. Not returned."
3. "We say 'eat up;' the Greek said 'eat down'. The word is suggested, no doubt, by the mention of the calf, the kid, and the feasting."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In expressing contempt of his brother the greatest sin against his father is uttered; so Pharisees sin most heinously against God in their feelings and acts towards their fellow-men." (Luke 15:30)
2. "There is a reproach of the father implied here also." (Luke 15:30)
3. "It was preeminently Pharisaical to recall just then this fact." (Luke 15:30)

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This thy son (ο υιος σου ουτος). Contempt and sarcasm. He does not say: 'This my brother.'"
2. "Devoured (καταφαγων). We say, 'eaten up,' but the Greek has, 'eaten down' (perfective use of κατα-). Suggested by the feasting going on."
3. "With harlots (μετα πορνων). This may be true (verse Luke 15:13), but the elder son did not know it to be true. He may reflect what he would have done in like case."

### John Gill:
1. "He will not own him in the relation of a brother, though the father had owned him in that of a son"
2. "The elder brother would have had another method taken with this younger son: he would have had him soundly whipped with the rod of the law, for his former sins; and sent into the fields along with him to work out his salvation"
3. "For he thought such a conduct was unbecoming God, and his moral perfections; and what his brother was undeserving of; and opened a door to, licentiousness; and highly reflected on his services, as of no value and regard."
