# Luke 15:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parable teaches us that it is right for Jesus to receive sinners, despite the unreasonable reaction of the Pharisees. The younger son's wastefulness and subsequent return to a state of want and wretchedness represents the condition of sinners. The parable also highlights the importance of rejoicing when sinners repent and turn back to God, as the father did for the prodigal son. Ultimately, it reminds us that God's grace and forgiveness are available to all, and that the older son should not begrudge the Father's love and acceptance of the younger son.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "πάντοτε μ. ἐμ. εἶ, as a reason why no extraordinary joy should be shewn over him; other reasons might be assigned, and lie indeed in the background, suggested by his tone and words: but this is the soft answer to turn away wrath."
2. "πάντα τὰ ἑμὰ σά ἐσ., because the portion of goods which remained was his."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Son, listen to reason. What need for special, exuberant joy over thee? Didst thou say, 'Lo, these many years do I serve thee?' In that saidst thou truly but just for that reason do I not set the whole household a-rejoicing over thee."
2. "For thee is reserved what is higher still—a tranquil lifelong satisfaction in thee, as a true-hearted faithful son in thy father's house, nor of the inheritance reserved for thee is aught alienated by this festive and fitting joy over the once foolish but now wise and newly recovered one."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This instructive and beautiful parable was designed to vindicate the conduct of Jesus to show that it was right to receive sinners, and that the conduct of the Pharisees was unreasonable."
2. "Sinners waste their blessings, and reduce themselves to a state of want and wretchedness."
3. "We have here an impressive exhibition of the wants and woes of a sinner."


### John Calvin:

3. "Neither will he raise these to a state of glory equal to that of those who have always served him if they have, upon the whole, made a greater progress in inward as well as outward holiness."
