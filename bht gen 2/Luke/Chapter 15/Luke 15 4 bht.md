# Luke 15:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's diligent pursuit of the lost is exemplified in the parable of the lost sheep. Just as a shepherd leaves the ninety-nine sheep in the wilderness to find the one that is lost, God does not give up on sinners. The wilderness represents all uncultivated ground, reminding us that God's love extends to all who are lost, regardless of their circumstances. We are called to emulate God's compassion and actively seek out those who are in need of redemption, recognizing the value of every single soul.
