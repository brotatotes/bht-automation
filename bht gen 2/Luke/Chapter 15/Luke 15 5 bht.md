# Luke 15:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ finds his sheep in a most desolate state, in a pit of sin and wretchedness, helpless and naked. He speaks life into them, calling them by name and asserting his ownership. He rescues them from the clutches of Satan, washing, feeding, and beautifying them. This love was not a recent development but one that existed before the world began as evidenced by his death on their behalf. The safety of his sheep is secure, for being on his shoulders, they are protected from God's justice, Satan's schemes, and the danger of falling away.
