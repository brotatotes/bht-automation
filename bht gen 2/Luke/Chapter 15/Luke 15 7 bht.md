# Luke 15:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The joy in heaven over the repentance of sinners is not limited to angels or just men, but encompasses the joy of our blessed Lord himself. It is a representation of how a father rejoices when an extravagant child, who was thought to be completely lost, comes to a full realization of his responsibilities. This deep joy is a reflection of God's own readiness to forgive and receive those who have turned away from their sinful ways.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "On these δίκαιοι, see note at Matthew 9:12-13. They are the subjectively righteous, and this saying respects their own view of themselves."
2. "But we have yet to inquire, what sort of sinner this parable represents: for each of the three sets before us a different type of the sinner sunk in his sin."
3. "This one is the stupid and bewildered sinner, erring and straying away in ignorance and self-will from his Shepherd, but sought by the Shepherd, and fetched back with joy."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "ninety-nine just . . . needing no
	repentance—not angels, whose place in these parables is
	very different from this; but those represented by the prodigal's
	well-behaved brother"
2. "such as have grown up from childhood in the fear of God
	and as the sheep of His pasture"
3. "He leaves them to fill up the place of the other class, if they could."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is a principle of human nature that the 'recovery' of an object in danger of being lost, affords much more intense joy than the quiet 'possession' of many that are safe."
2. "If a sinner, he must perish unless he repents; and they rejoice at his repentance because it recovers him back to the love of God, and because it will save him from eternal death."
3. "He means merely that they rejoice more over the 'repentance' of one sinner than they do over many who have not fallen."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Repenteth. See on Matthew 3:2. THE PARABLES OF THE LOST COIN AND OF THE PRODIGAL SON. Peculiar to Luke. 8 - 32.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The variation in the amount deducted is without any special meaning. Still we may find in it a proof of the steward’s prudence." 
2. "He knew the men with whom he had to deal and acted accordingly. Christian men too often slight such knowledge, but this parable condemns putting a premium on ignorance."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The joy in heaven is in contrast with the grumbling Pharisees and scribes."
2. "Jesus does not mean to say that the Pharisees and the scribes do not need repentance or are perfect."
3. "He for the sake of argument accepts their claims about themselves and by their own words condemns them for their criticism of his efforts to save the lost sheep."

### John Gill:
1. "In the church below, and among the members of it... or in heaven above, and among the angels there."
2. "For the joy in heaven, is not over sinners as such... but as repenting sinners, who are truly so."
3. "The more joy over repenting sinners, than over these is, because the salvation of the one is before certain to them, and the other is unexpected."

### John Wesley:
1. "Joy shall be...First, in our blessed Lord himself, and then among the angels and spirits of just men..."
2. "The sum is, as a father peculiarly rejoices when an extravagant child, supposed to be utterly lost, comes to a thorough sense of his duty..."
3. "Yea, and God himself so readily forgives and receives them, that he may be represented as having part in the joy."
