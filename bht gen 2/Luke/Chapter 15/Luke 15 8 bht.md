# Luke 15:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parallelism between the steward's unjust behavior and the believer's passive role in conversion is expressed through the imagery of a coin. This coin, worth about eighteen cents, symbolizes the common currency. The passage also emphasizes the significance of the Gospel, likened to a candle, which provides illumination and serves as a guiding light for believers in their spiritual journey. The preaching of the Gospel often disrupts and stirs up opposition among non-believers due to the unfamiliarity and rejection of its teachings.

1. "The only instance in the N.T. of this old word for a coin of 65.5 grains about the value of the common Œ¥Œ∑ŒΩŒ±œÅŒπœÖœÇ (about eighteen cents), a quarter of a Jewish shekel."

2. "But by this candle is meant, the Gospel itself; which, like a candle, is lighted up in the evening of the world; and may be removed, as it sometimes is, from place to place; and where it is set, and blessed, it gives light, and is useful both to work and walk by."
3. "Moreover, when the Gospel is preached in purity and with power, and souls are converted, there is a great stir and uproar in the world, and among the men of it; because the doctrines of it are foolishness, and strange things to them; and oppose their sense of things, and strip them of what is valuable; and men are hereby distinguished from them, and taken from among them."
