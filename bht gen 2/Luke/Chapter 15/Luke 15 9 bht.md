# Luke 15:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If you search for wisdom as diligently as a man searches for a lost shekel or valuable rings within his house, you will surely find it. Just as someone would light up many lamps and candles until they find what is lost, so too should you pursue the words of the law as a hidden treasure. This pursuit of wisdom is compared to seeking after silver and precious gems, for it is something of great value that illuminates both the temporary life of this world and the life to come.
