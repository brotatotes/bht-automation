# Luke 16:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Faithfulness is not determined by the magnitude of the responsibility, but by the sense of responsibility itself. If someone is faithful in small matters, they can be trusted in larger ones as well. It is important to act faithfully even in the least significant things, for our actions in small matters can reflect our trustworthiness in more important aspects of life. We must remember that fidelity is required in all areas, whether they are of great significance or not.
