# Luke 16:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If you are not faithful in handling worldly possessions, how can God trust you with spiritual and eternal riches? Just as some have been unfaithful in accumulating wealth, if you are unfaithful in the use of unrighteous mammon, why should God entrust you with the true riches? The treasures of the Gospel are the true and lasting riches, far surpassing material wealth.
