# Luke 16:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are entrusted with earthly possessions, but they do not truly belong to us. We are merely stewards, accountable for how we manage God's resources. If we are not faithful in handling what is given to us on earth, how can we expect to receive the true riches of heaven? Let us not be attached to worldly wealth, but rather, focus on being rich toward God. Ultimately, our true inheritance lies in the eternal blessings of grace and glory that are reserved for us in heaven.
