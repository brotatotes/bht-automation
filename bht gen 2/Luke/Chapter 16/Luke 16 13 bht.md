# Luke 16:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
No one can serve two masters. This saying applies to both the Pharisees and the Publicans who, on the surface, appeared to serve God but were actually serving Mammon. It is a clear expression of the uncompromising hostility between love and hate, showing that they cannot coexist. This message challenges us to examine our own lives and ensure that we are not divided in our allegiance. We must wholeheartedly serve God and not allow ourselves to be entangled with the world.
