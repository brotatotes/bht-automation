# Luke 16:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage reveals individuals who were lovers of money, rejecting Jesus' teachings on wealth, and despising his call to accountability for their unjust stewardship. They revered worldly possessions and saw themselves as safe and happy in their pursuit of wealth, dismissing Jesus as weak and ignorant for speaking against their cherished beliefs. However, their affection for money blinded them to the true dangers it posed, leading them to mock and scorn Jesus' wisdom instead of engaging in a meaningful conversation about the true value of riches.
