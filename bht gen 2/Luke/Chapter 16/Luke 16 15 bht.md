# Luke 16:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These individuals, though skilled at presenting themselves as righteous before others, cannot hide their true intentions from God. While they may take pride in their outward appearance of righteousness, their hearts are filled with deceit, hypocrisy, and greed. Their actions may be highly esteemed by the world, but God sees through their façade and views their supposed holiness as abomination. May we be reminded that true righteousness comes from a genuine heart transformation and not from seeking the approval of men.
