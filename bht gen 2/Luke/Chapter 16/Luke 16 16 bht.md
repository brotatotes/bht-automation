# Luke 16:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
From the time of John the Baptist, the kingdom of God began to be proclaimed, and people from all walks of life, including tax collectors and sinners, eagerly embraced it. The Law and the Prophets, which were the foundation until then, were fulfilled by the arrival of John and the subsequent proclamation of the Gospel. This transition caused a great stir among the people, as multitudes flocked to John's ministry and now to the ministry of Jesus and His apostles, recognizing the urgency and significance of this new dispensation.
