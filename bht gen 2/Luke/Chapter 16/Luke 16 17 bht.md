# Luke 16:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Gospel does not abolish the law, as it may be mistakenly thought that the law and the prophets were only until John and are no longer relevant. However, the truth is that even if heaven and earth were to pass away, not a single detail, not even the smallest stroke, of the law will fail. The law and the prophets find their fulfillment in the person, miracles, obedience, sufferings, and death of Christ. (Matthew 5:18)
