# Luke 16:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our Lord's repeated saying regarding adultery reveals the misguided interpretations of the Jews. They distorted and undermined the true meaning of the law, causing it to lose its efficacy. This reminder from Jesus, given on various occasions, emphasizes that divorce and remarriage do not absolve one from adultery. A person who divorces their spouse for any reason other than marital unfaithfulness and subsequently marries another is guilty of adultery. Further, it is important to note that even in cases of divorce and subsequent remarriage, the original marriage bond remains intact.
