# Luke 16:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parable exposes the danger and misery of the Jews for rejecting the Messiah and highlights their contempt and unbelief. They boasted in their outward means and ordinances, considering themselves rich in spiritual and eternal matters. They lived an easy and carefree life, not realizing the gravity of their sin and the need for salvation. The rich man, likely a Pharisee, justified himself before others and was esteemed for his luxurious clothing and lavish feasting, further enhancing his reputation in society.
