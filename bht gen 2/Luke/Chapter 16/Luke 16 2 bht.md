# Luke 16:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who corrupt the word, are guilty of covetousness, rapine, theft, adultery, and idolatry, all which are violations of the law. They are asked to give an account for their stewardship, to show how they have utilized their gifts and taken care of God's vineyard, the Jewish church, and to present the fruits that should have been produced. This judgement was predicted by the prophets, who foretold that God would reject the unfaithful shepherds, symbolized by the idol shepherd, who could represent the Pharisees.
