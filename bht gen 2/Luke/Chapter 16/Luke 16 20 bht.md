# Luke 16:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This beggar, named Lazarus, should not be confused with the Lazarus of Bethany, for they had nothing in common other than the name. The beggar Lazarus, as indicated by his name and the subsequent events, was a God-fearing man who found himself cast down carelessly and left full of ulcers. These sores were not closed or bound up, revealing the severity of his suffering.
