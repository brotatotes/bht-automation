# Luke 16:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Lazarus, in his destitution and suffering, exemplifies patience and acceptance of God's will. He did not complain about his situation but submitted himself entirely to God. In a metaphorical sense, the crumbs that Lazarus desired can represent the small number of God's elect among the Jews, those who were chosen by His grace. And in the fullness of time, all of Christ's desires, prayers, and intercessions will be fulfilled.
