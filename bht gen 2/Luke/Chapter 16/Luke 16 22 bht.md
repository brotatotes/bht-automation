# Luke 16:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The beggar, worn out and destitute, died and was transported by angels to the blissful state of Abraham's bosom, symbolizing the joys of paradise. This contrasted with the rich man, whose extravagant burial drew attention but left his ultimate fate undisclosed. The concept of being in Abraham's bosom was highly valued among the Jews, signifying being in close proximity to this esteemed figure in the afterlife. This demonstrates the transient nature of earthly riches and emphasizes the significance of prioritizing spiritual riches and seeking the eternal blessings promised by God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The fact is, that in both cases the material corpse remains on this earth, buried or unburied; while that personality, to which universal consent rightly attributes sensibility to bliss and woe, and the feelings and parts of the body, the manâ€™s real self, is translated into the other world."
2. "Though it is unnatural to suppose that our Lord would in such a parable formally reveal any new truth respecting the state of the dead, yet, in conforming himself to the ordinary language current on these subjects, it is impossible to suppose that He, whose essence is Truth, could have assumed as existing anything which does not exist."
3. "The bearing of the spirits of the just into bliss by the holy angels is only analogous to their other employment."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "His burial was too unimportant to mention; while "the rich man died and was buried"â€”his carcass carried in pomp to its earthly resting-place."
2. "as if seen reclining next to Him at the heavenly feast."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Jews held the opinion that the spirits of the righteous were conveyed by angels to heaven at their death."
2. "Our Saviour speaks in accordance with this opinion; and as he expressly affirms the fact, it seems as proper that it should be taken literally."
3. "To be [Abraham's] friend was, in their view, the highest honor and happiness."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Abraham 's bosom. A Rabbinical phrase, equivalent to being with Abraham in Paradise. "To the Israelite Abraham seems the personal center and meeting - point of Paradise" (Goebel).

### John Calvin:
1. "To be after death carried by angels into Abrahamâ€™s bosom was a happiness more desirable than all the kingdoms of the world."
2. "In him the grace of God was so entirely hidden, and buried by the deformity and shame of the cross, that to the eye of the flesh nothing presented itself except the curse; and yet we see that in a body which was loathsome and full of rottenness there was lodged a soul unspeakably precious, which is carried by angels to a blessed life."
3. "Those who receive along with [Abraham] the fruit of the same faith are said, after death, to be collected into his bosom. The metaphor is taken from a father, in whose bosom, as it were, the children meet, when they all return home in the evening from the labors of the day."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "No mention is made of his funeral. A pauperâ€™s burial would attract no attention."
2. "And was borne away.  His soul is meant (so the Rabbins taught) in contrast to the burial of the body of the rich man."
3. "Into Abrahamâ€™s bosom.  This was, among the Jews, a metaphorical expression for the state of blessedness after death. It is not exactly equivalent to â€˜heaven,â€™ but rather to â€˜Paradiseâ€™ (Luke 23:43), the happy side of the  state of the dead."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "To be in Abraham's bosom is to the Jew to be in Paradise."
2. "Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are in heaven and welcome those who come."
3. "The beloved disciple reclined on the bosom of Jesus at the last passover and this fact indicates special favour."

### John Gill:
1. "The death of Christ was not a casual thing, a fortuitous event; it was agreed unto, and settled in the covenant of grace...so that this came to pass according to the decrees of God, the counsel, and covenant of peace, the will of Christ, and his predictions."
2. "By Abraham's bosom is meant heaven, a phrase well known to the Jews, by which they commonly expressed the happiness of the future state...Abraham's bosom came to signify the near and intimate enjoyment of happiness with him in the other world."
3. "The reason is, because Christ lay so short a time in the grave, and he was not left there, nor did he see corruption but in a very little while was raised from the dead, and delivered from the power of the grave; when, after some stay on earth, he was attended by angels to the highest heavens."

### John Wesley:
1. "And the beggar â€” Worn out with hunger, and pain, and want of all things, died: and was carried by angels (amazing change of the scene!) into Abraham's bosom..."
2. "So the Jews styled paradise; the place where the souls of good men remain from death to the resurrection."
3. "The rich man also died, and was buried â€” Doubtless with pomp enough, though we do not read of his lying in state; that stupid, senseless pageantry, that shocking insult on a poor, putrefying carcass, was reserved for our enlightened age!"
