# Luke 16:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In hell, their eyes are opened to see their mistakes about the Messiah, and they find themselves experiencing torments and remorse of conscience. The descendents of Abraham, in whom they boasted and on whom they relied, hold no value for them now. The Jewish belief that the wicked would see the righteous in happiness and themselves in torment is further intensified in this scenario, as the rich man both sees Abraham from a distance and recognizes him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Hades, שְׁאוֹל, is the abode of all disembodied spirits till the resurrection; not, the place of torment, much less hell."
2. "Lazarus was also in Hades, but separate from Dives; one on the blissful, the other on the baleful side."
3. "ἐν βασάνοις not eternal condemnation; for the judgment has not yet taken place; men can only be judged in the body, for the deeds done in the body: but, the certainty and anticipation of it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "in hell—not the final place of the lost (for which another word is used), but as we say 'the unseen world.'"
2. "But as the object here is certainly to depict the whole torment of the one and the perfect bliss of the other, it comes in this case to much the same."
3. "seeth Abraham—not God, to whom therefore he cannot cry [BENGEL]."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'hell' here means, therefore, that dark, obscure, and miserable place, far from heaven, where the wicked shall be punished forever."
2. "One of the first things that occurred in hell was to look up, and see the poor man that lay at his gate completely happy. What a contrast!"
3. "Heaven and hell will be far from each other, and it will be no small part of the misery of the one that it is far and forever removed from the other."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Hell. Rev., Hades. Where Lazarus also was, but in a different region. See on Matthew 16:18.

### John Calvin:
1. "The general truth conveyed is, that believing souls, when they have left their bodies, lead a joyful and blessed life out of this world, and that for the reprobate there are prepared dreadful torments, which can no more be conceived by our minds than the boundless glory of the heavens."
2. "Let it be reckoned enough that the inconceivable vengeance of God, which awaits the ungodly, is communicated to us in an obscure manner, so far as is necessary to strike terror into our minds."
3. "The wicked are described as fearfully tormented by the misery which they feel; as desiring some relief, but cut off from hope, and thus experiencing a double torment; and as having their anguish increased by being compelled to remember their crimes, and to compare the present blessedness of believers with their own miserable and lost condition."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And in hell, Greek, ‘Hades,’ i.e., in the state or place of departed spirits; which must not be confounded with Gehenna, the final state of eternal punishment, since in this case it includes ‘Abraham’s bosom.’"
2. "Being in torments. The rich man was in a place of punishment; for the whole parable turns on this point. Physical torment is not implied, save so far as it is necessary for the figurative representation."
3. "Seeth Abraham afar off. According to the Jewish notion, Paradise and Gehenna are so situated that one is visible from the other. A literal sense is not to be pressed, any more than in the previous part of the verse. The recognition of Abraham points to the fact that descent from Abraham, even when acknowledged in that state after death (Luke 16:25), is in itself of no avail."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Lazarus was in Hades also for both Paradise (Abraham's bosom) and Gehenna are in the unseen world beyond the grave." 
2. "In torments (εν βασανοις). The touchstone by which gold and other metals were tested, then the rack for torturing people." 
3. "The Jews believed that Gehenna and Paradise were close together. This detail in the parable does not demand that we believe it. The picture calls for it."

### John Gill:
1. "In hell their eyes are opened, and they see their mistakes about the Messiah, and find themselves in torments, under dreadful gnawings, and remorse of conscience."
2. "The covenant of circumcision given to him, and to them his natural seed, now of no use to them; their descent from him, of which they boasted, and in which they trusted, now of no avail."
3. "The notion of the Jews, that wicked men will see the righteous in happiness, and themselves in torment, will be aggravated, to which the allusion is."

### John Wesley:
1. "He seeth Abraham afar off — And yet knew him at that distance..."
