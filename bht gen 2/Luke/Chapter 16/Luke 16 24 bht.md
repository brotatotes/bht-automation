## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Superbus temporis, mendicus inferni." 
2. "The omission of the article before βασάνοις points no doubt to subjective torments; but where lies the limit between inner and outer to the disembodied?"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Father Abraham—a well-founded, but unavailing, claim of natural descent (Luke 3:8; John 8:37)."
2. "mercy on me—who never showed any (James 2:3)."
3. "dip . . . tongue—that is the least conceivable and the most momentary abatement of his torment; that is all. But even this he is told is (1) unreasonable."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Jews considered it a signal honor that Abraham was their 'father' - that is, that they were 'descendants' from him."
2. "Nor does he ask to be admitted where Lazarus was. He had no 'desire' to be in a holy place, and he well knew that there was no restoration to those who once sink down to hell."
3. "The lost are often represented as suffering 'in flames,' because 'fire' is an image of the severest pain that we know."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "The rivulets that from the verdant hills Of Cassentin descend down into Arno, Making their channels to be soft and cold, Ever before me stand, and not in vain"
3. "Tormented [οδυνωμαι] . Used by Luke only. Tormented is too strong. The word is used of the sorrow of Joseph and Mary when the child Jesus was missing (ch. 2 48); and of the grief of the Ephesian elders on parting with Paul (Acts 20:38). Rev., I am in anguish."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Father Abraham. Even there the man does not forget that he is a Jew."
2. "Send Lazarus. It is possible, but not probable, that he still fancies he has some right to the services of one who was his inferior on earth."

1. "That he may dip (ινα βαψη). First aorist active subjunctive of βαπτω, common verb, to dip."
2. "A small service that will be welcome."
3. "For I am in anguish (οτ οδυνωμα). The active has a causative sense to cause intense pain, the middle to torment oneself (Luke 2:48; Acts 20:38), the passive to be translated as here."

### John Gill:
1. "And here the Jews, in their distress, are represented as applying to him, saying, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus which seems to have respect to the mercy promised to Abraham, the covenant made with him, and the oath swore unto him, to send the Messiah."
2. "And cool my tongue; which had spoken so many scurrilous and blasphemous things of Christ; saying that he was a sinner, a glutton, and a winebibber, a Samaritan, and had a devil; that he cast out devils by Beelzebub, the prince of devils; and that he was a seditious person, and guilty of blasphemy."
3. "This man could not so much as get a drop of water to cool his tongue, not the least refreshment, nor mitigation of the anguish of his conscience, for the sins of his tongue."

1. "It cannot be denied, but here is one precedent in Scripture of praying to departed saints."
2. "Who is it that prays, and with what success?"
