# Luke 16:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the passage, we see a clear contrast between the rich man and Lazarus. The rich man, who sought pleasure in worldly things, now suffers the consequences of his neglect of God. On the other hand, despite his poverty and suffering, Lazarus endured with patience, rooted in his faith and fear of God. The rich man's focus on earthly wealth as his ultimate good led to his downfall, while Lazarus's faithfulness earned him a heavenly reward. It is a powerful reminder that our priorities and choices in this life have eternal consequences.
