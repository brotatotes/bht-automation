# Luke 16:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Between the righteous and the wicked there is a vast and unbridgeable gap. While the wicked may desire to pass from their state of torment to the abode of the righteous, this is an impossibility. The permanent separation between the two states has been determined by God's unchanging decree. The words of Jesus caution us to heed His warning and choose the path of righteousness, for once we enter the abyss, there is no return.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Even if it were not so, however, and for whatsoever reason, God's decree hath placed thee there thy wish is impossible."
2. "In the interpretation, the irresistible decree then truly so, but no such on earth by which the Almighty Hand hath separated us and you, in order that, not merely so that, none may pass it. In the graphic description, a yawning chasm impassable."
3. "ἐστήρικται, is fixed for ever. This expression precludes all idea that the following verse indicates the beginning of a better mind in the rich man."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Besides all this—independently of this consideration."
2. "A great gulf fixed—By an irrevocable decree there has been placed a vast impassable abyss between the two states, and the occupants of each."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is impossible to conceive that the righteous would desire to leave their abodes in glory to go and dwell in the world of woe; nor can we suppose that they would wish to go for any reason unless it were possible to furnish relief."
2. "There can be no doubt that the wicked will desire to pass the gulf that divides them from heaven. They would be glad to be in a state of happiness; but all such wishes will be vain."
3. "No: if there is anything certain from the Scripture, it is that they who enter hell return no more; they who sink there sink forever."

### John Calvin:
1. "A vast gulf lieth. These words describe the permanency of the future state, and denote, that the boundaries which separate the reprobate from the elect can never be broken through."
2. "And thus we are reminded to return early to the path, while there is yet time, lest we rush headlong into that abyss, from which it will be impossible to rise."
3. "The words must not be strictly interpreted, when it is said, that no one is permitted to pass who would wish to descend from heaven to hell; for it is certain, that none of the righteous entertain any such desire."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "God has immutably decreed otherwise: there is a great gulf fixed."
2. "Here our Lord reveals what was unknown to the popular mind of that time."
3. "In the world of departed spirits, according to our Lord’s imagery, where He deviates from the popular notions, a change of state is impossible; God has so ordered it."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Beside all this (εν πασ τουτοις).In all these things (or regions)."
2. "Gulf (χασμα). An old word from χαινω, to yawn, our chasm, a gaping opening."
3. "Is fixed (εστηρικτα). Perfect passive indicative of στηριζω, old verb (see on Luke 9:51). Permanent chasm."

### John Gill:
1. "Between us and you there is a great gulf fixed; as this may regard the state of the Pharisees after death, it intends not the natural distance between heaven and hell."
2. "But not this natural space, be it what it will, but the immutable decree of God is intended here, which has unalterably fixed the state of the damned, and of the blessed."
3. "This also agrees with the notions of the Jews who represent it impossible: for a man, after he has descended into hell, to come up from thence any more."

### John Wesley:
1. Beside this there is a great gulf fixed — Reader, to which side of it wilt thou go?
