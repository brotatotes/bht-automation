# Luke 16:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The rich man in this passage labors under the false belief that his five brothers will accept the testimony of Lazarus, who has risen from the dead. However, it is important to note that the number five holds significance in Jewish tradition, symbolizing a division or part of a whole. This raises the possibility that the rich man's concern for his brothers may not be rooted in genuine love, but rather in a selfish desire to avoid their arrival and the potential increase of his own suffering in the same place.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Rich Man labours under the delusion that his five brothers will believe the testimony of Lazarus as a man from the dead."

### John Gill:
1. "The Jewish nation were usually divided into 'three' parts, 'priests, Levites, and Israelites'; of these three the great sanhedrim usually consisted...let that number also be remarked." 
2. "It may be, that the twice five, or ten tribes of Israel, which were not known where they were, nor are they to this day, may be designed by a 'synechdoche', of a part for the whole; whose return the Jews are yet expecting, and for whose welfare they are greatly concerned."
3. "His concern for them did not arise from any regard to Christ, and the enlargement of his interest; nor from any love to his testimony, the Gospel; nor from any real notion or desire of converting grace for his brethren; nor from true love to them; but from a selfish principle, lest his own torments should be aggravated by their coming."

### John Wesley:
1. Lest they also come into this place â€” He might justly fear lest their reproaches should add to his own torment.
