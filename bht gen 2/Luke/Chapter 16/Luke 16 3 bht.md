# Luke 16:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The steward, facing the prospect of poverty and misery, considers his options. He cannot dig or work hard labor, as his luxurious lifestyle has made him unfit for such toil. Yet, he is ashamed to beg, finding it disagreeable and beneath him. Instead, he contemplates cheating for his livelihood, prioritizing his own gain over integrity. This false sense of honor reveals a prideful arrogance, upheld by society but condemned by higher authorities.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The steward sets before himself the certainty of poverty and misery."
2. "He has lived softly and effeminately, and cannot do an honest day’s work."
3. "This speech, of digging and begging, must not be sought for in the interpretation; it belongs to the truth of the parable itself as introducing the scheme which follows, but has no ulterior meaning."

1. 3. cannot dig . . . to beg,
	ashamed—therefore, when dismissed, shall be in utter want.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To dig, here, is the same as to till the earth, to work at daily labor."
2. "It is proper for the sick, the lame, and the feeble to beg; but it is 'not' well for the able-bodied to do it, nor is it well to aid them, except by giving them employment, and compelling them to work for a living."
3. "He does a beggar who is able to work the most real kindness who sets him to work, and, as a general rule, we should not aid an able-bodied man or woman in any other way."

2. "Taketh away (αφαιρειτα). Present (linear) middle indicative of αφαιρεω, old verb to take away. Here the middle present means, He is taking away for himself."
3. "To beg I am not ashamed (επαιτειν αισχυνομα). The infinitive with αισχυνομα means ashamed to begin to beg."

### John Gill:
1. "What shall I do for a maintenance? how shall I live? what shall I do to please men, and gain their opinion and good will, and so be provided for by them?" 
2. "nothing was meaner among the Jews than husbandry...and to beg I am ashamed; for nothing could be more disagreeable, to one who had lived so well in his master's house, and in so much fulness and luxury."
3. "neither of which the Pharisees much cared for, though they made large pretensions to both; nor did they dig deep to lay a good foundation whereon to build eternal life and happiness: nor could they attain to the law of righteousness by all their toil and labour, they would be thought to have taken: and for 'begging', they were above that."

### John Wesley:
1. To beg I am ashamed — But not ashamed to cheat! This was likewise a sense of honour! "By men called honour, but by angels pride."
