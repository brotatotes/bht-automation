# Luke 16:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These verses highlight the resistance and unbelief of the people, who refused to heed the message of Moses and the prophets. Even if someone were to come back from the dead, they would still not repent, as repentance is not a matter of human will but a gift of God's grace. This illustrates the hardened hearts of the people, who did not even respond to the preaching and miracles of Christ himself.

3. "Faith does not depend on miracles, or any extraordinary sign, but is the peculiar gift of the Spirit, and is produced by means of the word."

2. "But if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent; but alas! repentance is not of man's will, but a gift of God's grace; nor could these men repent, because in a judicial way their eyes were shut, their ears were stopped, and their hearts were hardened."
3. "Though Christ came in person to them, and preached, as never man did, with power and authority, and confirmed his doctrine with miracles, yet they repented not, nor did they when he arose from the dead."
