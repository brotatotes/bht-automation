# Luke 16:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If people do not respond to the message conveyed through the Old Testament Scriptures, they will not be convinced or compelled to truly repent, for genuine repentance requires a complete transformation of the heart. No matter how many supernatural occurrences or miraculous events they witness, it is God alone who can bring about this change through the application of His Word, and no amount of communication with the dead will have any effect on their unbelief. It is a stern reminder that our utmost and unwavering trust should be placed in the divine revelation contained in the Bible.
