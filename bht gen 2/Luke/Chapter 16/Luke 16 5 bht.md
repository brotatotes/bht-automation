# Luke 16:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parable suggests that we, like the Gentiles, are indebted to God due to our sinfulness. Just as the debtors in the parable were under the authority of the steward, we too are under the authority of the law. Just as the debts in the parable were specific to the individuals, our debts also differ. The debts of the first debtor are likened to oil, which symbolizes the ceremonial law that they failed to uphold, while the debts of the second debtor are represented by wheat, indicating their failure to observe the requirements of the law.
