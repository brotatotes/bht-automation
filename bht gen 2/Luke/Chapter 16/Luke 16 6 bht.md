# Luke 16:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The steward, in his cunning plan, returns a hundred measures of oil to the debtors. These measures were likely intended for the temple service and were vouchers in the form of written bills. He urgently instructs them to take their bills and quickly write fifty, half of the original amount. This deceitful act exemplifies the secretive nature of the arrangement and the steward's desire to secure his position before his removal.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The steward, not yet out of office, has all the vouchers by him, and returns each debtor his own bond, for him to alter the figure (not, to make another, which would imply the destruction of the old bond, not its return)." 
2. "καθίσας is graphic. ταχέως implies the hurry with which the furtive business is transacted. The debtors seem to be all together, that all may be implicated and none may tell of the other."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A hundred measures - The measure here mentioned is the 'bath' which contained, according to Dr. Arbuthnot’s tables, 7 1/2 gallons, or, according to the marginal note, about 9 gallons and 3 quarts."
2. "Thy bill - The contract, obligation, or 'lease.' It was probably written as a 'promise' by the debtor and signed by the steward, and thus became binding."
3. "Quickly - He supposed that his master would soon remove him, and he was, therefore, in haste to have all things secure beforehand."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The bath was a Hebrew measure, but the amount is uncertain, since, according to Edersheim, there were three kinds of measurement in use in Palestine."
2. "Assuming the first standard, the bath would be about fifty-six pints, and the debt, therefore, a large one."
3. "The bill is the bond which the buyer has given, and which is in the steward's keeping. He gives it back to the debtor for him to alter the figures."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Measures (βατους). Transliterated word for Hebrew bath, between eight and nine gallons." 
2. "Thy bond (σου τα γραμματα). Thy writings, thy contracts, thy note." 
3. "Quickly (ταχεως). It was a secret arrangement and speed was essential."

### John Gill:
1. "And he said an hundred measures of oil....which illustrates the above observation, that they were for the temple service."
2. "Take thy bill, or 'writing'; which showed the bargain made for so many measures; and which acknowledged the receipt of them, and promised payment."
3. "And sit down quickly; for his case required haste; and write fifty; just half; that it might appear he had bought but fifty, and was accountable for no more."
