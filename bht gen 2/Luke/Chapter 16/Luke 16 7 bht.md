# Luke 16:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this parable, each debtor is given a different measure or cor of debt, representing their individual situations. The variation in the amount deducted does not bear any significant meaning. The Hebrew measure known as the kor or homer was a unit of dry measure equivalent to around 10 baths or 70 gallons. The specific amount, however, is not crucial for grasping the overall message of the parable. The focus lies on the different circumstances of the debtors and the concept of forgiveness.
