# Luke 16:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus tells a parable about a dishonest steward whose shrewdness is commended by his master, not for his unjust actions, but for his foresight and skillful planning. This does not mean that Jesus approves of his dishonesty, but rather highlights the greater wisdom displayed by worldly people in securing their earthly interests compared to the children of light who often neglect their spiritual responsibilities. This parable serves as a reminder for believers to be wise and diligent in seeking eternal treasures and not to be outdone by the worldly in matters of the soul.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The point brought out is not merely the shrewdness of the steward, but his lord, whose injury was wrought by this very shrewdness, praising it."
2. "For the purposes of their self-interest, [the sons of this world] are more shrewd than the sons of light."
3. "It is hardly necessary to add that the discovery of the steward's trick by the master is essential to the parable, as exemplifying the φρονίμως and φρονιμώτεροι."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "commended, c.—not for his 'injustice,' but 'because he had done wisely,' or prudently with commendable foresight and skilful adaptation of means to end."
2. "the greater wisdom (or shrewdness) of the one, in adaptation of means to ends, and in energetic, determined prosecution of them, is none of it for God and eternity...all for the purposes of their own grovelling and fleeting generation."
3. "yet this is only 'as night-birds see better in the dark than those of the day owls than eagles'...But we may learn lessons from them, as our Lord now shows, and 'be wise as serpents.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This passage cannot be brought, therefore, to prove that Jesus meant to commend his dishonesty. It was a commendation of his 'shrewdness or forethought;' but the master could no more 'approve' of his conduct as a moral act than he could the first act of cheating him."
2. "The children of this world... show more skill, study more plans, contrive more ways to provide for themselves, than the children of light do to promote the interests of religion."
3. "Those who 'are' worldly show much prudence in providing for themselves; seize occasions for making good bargains; are active and industrious; try to turn everything to the best account, and thus exert themselves to the utmost to advance their interests; while Christians often suffer opportunities of doing good to pass unimproved; are less steady, firm, and anxious about eternal things, and thus show less wisdom."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The phrase expresses Jesus' judgment on what the steward's master praised." 
2. "The idiom is a Hebrew one."
3. "The men of the world make their intercourse with one another more profitable than the sons of light do their intercourse with their own kind."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ only meant what he adds a little afterwards, that ungodly and worldly men are more industrious and skillful in conducting the affairs of this fading life, than the children of God are anxious to obtain the heavenly and eternal life, or careful to make it the subject of their study and meditation."
2. "By this comparison he charges us with highly criminal indifference, in not providing for the future, with at least as much earnestness as ungodly men display by attending to their own interests in this world."
3. "Hence we infer, that our Lord does not intend to compare the wisdom of the Spirit to the wisdom of the flesh, but only to arouse believers to consider more attentively what belongs to the future life, and not to shut their eyes against the light of the Gospel, when they perceive that even the blind, amidst their darkness, see more clearly."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The steward's lord praised him though he himself had been wronged." 
2. "The steward distinguished by unrighteousness as his characteristic."
3. "Men of the world in their dealings with men like themselves are more prudent than the children of light in their intercourse with one another."

### John Gill:
1. "Not that he commended him for the fact he did, or the injustice of it for this is contrary to his nature and perfections; but for his craft and cunning in providing himself a maintenance for time to come."
2. "For the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light."
3. "Now, the men of the world, or carnal men, are, generally speaking, wiser than these; not in things spiritual, but in things natural, in the affairs of life, in worldly matters."

### John Wesley:
1. "The dishonesty of such a servant be detestable, yet his foresight, care, and contrivance, about the interests of this life, deserve our imitation, with regard to the more important affairs of another."
2. "Those who seek no other portion than this world: Are wiser - Not absolutely, for they are, one and all, egregious fools; but they are more consistent with themselves; they are truer to their principles; they more steadily pursue their end; they are wiser in their generation - That is, in their own way, than the children of light - The children of God, whose light shines on their hearts."
