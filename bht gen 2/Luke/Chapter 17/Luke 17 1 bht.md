# Luke 17:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Offences are bound to come, due to God's decree, Satan's wickedness, and the corruption of people's principles and practices. These offences can test the faith of believers and become stumbling blocks for those with weak minds. Those who cause these stumbling blocks will face divine consequences.
