# Luke 17:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As believers, we should always be living out our faith, seeking to serve and honor Christ. Our service to Him should not be driven by the desire for merit or credit, but rather out of love and gratitude. We must recognize that everything we have belongs to God, and therefore we cannot claim to earn or merit anything from Him. Instead, our good works are a response to His grace, and He graciously rewards us with eternal blessings. Our focus should always be on seeking and serving God, trusting in His promises rather than seeking our own gain or recognition.
