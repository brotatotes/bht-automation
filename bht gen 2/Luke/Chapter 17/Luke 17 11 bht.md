# Luke 17:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Jesus journeyed towards Jerusalem to eat his last passover and fulfill his ultimate purpose of suffering and dying for his people, he deliberately chose a route that took him through the borders of Samaria and Galilee. This journey served multiple purposes: it displayed Christ's divine power through the healing of the ten lepers, exposed the ingratitude of the Jewish nation towards his miracles, and highlighted the gratitude of the Samaritan who alone recognized his indebtedness to Christ. Furthermore, this route revealed the impiety of the Jews, as such a remarkable miracle in their midst received little attention.
