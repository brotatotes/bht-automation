# Luke 17:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The misery of the afflicted lepers brought together people from different races, as they all shared the same plight. These lepers were not allowed to enter the village or come near those who were healthy, due to their uncleanliness. They stood at a distance, as prescribed by the Levitical requirements, which required them to keep themselves separate. This instance in which Jesus heals a leper is unique to the Gospel of Luke.
