# Luke 17:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Though the outcasts were united in their common misery, they also possessed a measure of faith in Christ as their Master. Despite the fierce national antipathy between the Jews and Samaritans, these poor outcasts trusted in Christ's word alone, declaring themselves clean. However, it is all too common for people to seek God out of strong necessity, only to forget Him once their desires are fulfilled. Still, the first step towards redemption is taken when individuals recognize their need for Christ, the great Master who is able and willing to show compassion to all who call upon Him.
