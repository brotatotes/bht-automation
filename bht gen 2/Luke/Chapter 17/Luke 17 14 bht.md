# Luke 17:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As the lepers went, they were cleansed by the power of Jesus. This miracle served as a testimony that Christ had indeed healed them. It also tested their faith and taught the importance of love and gratitude. Just as the lepers had to follow Christ's command and go to the priests, sinners defiled by sin should put their faith in Jesus and obey His commands with the confidence that He is able and willing to heal them. This miracle demonstrates the human aspect of salvation and the importance of believing and acting on the word of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "One of our Lord’s first miracles had been the healing of a leper; then He touched him and said, ‘Be thou clean:’ now He sinks as it were the healing, and keeps it in the background; and why so? There may have been reasons unknown to us; but one we can plainly see, and that is, to bring out for the Church the lesson which the history yields."
2. "In their going away, in the absence of Jesus they are healed: what need to go back and give Him thanks? Here was a trial of their love: faith they had, enough to go, and enough to be cleansed: but love (with the one exception) gratitude, they had not."
3. "The meaning evidently being that they had not gone far, and that the whole took place within a short time. They had not been to the priests, as some suppose."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "show yourselves—as cleansed persons."
2. "Thus too would the Samaritan be taught that 'salvation is of the Jews' (John 4:22)."
3. "as they went, were cleansed—In how many different ways were our Lord's cures wrought, and this different from all the rest."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "By this command he gave them an implied assurance that they would be healed; for the 'design' for which they were to go was to exhibit the 'evidence' that they were restored."
2. "It may also be observed that this required no small measure of 'faith' on their part, for he did not 'first' heal them, and then tell them to go; he told them to go without 'expressly' assuring them that they would be healed."
3. "So sinners defiled with the leprosy of sin, should put faith in the Lord Jesus and obey his commands, with the fullest confidence that he is able to heal them, and that he 'will' do it if they follow his directions."

### John Calvin:
1. "Thus Christ preserves their right entire, and appeals to them as witnesses for approving of the miracle which he had wrought."
2. "It is an additional proof of the folly of the Papists, that they do not consider what a foul stain of infamy they throw on their confession."
3. "But if that transitory faith—which wanted a living root, and produced nothing more than the blade—was honored by God with a remarkable effect, how much more valuable is the reward that awaits our faith, if it is sincerely and permanently fixed on God?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This miracle brings out the human side of the work of salvation, most fully."
2. "Our Lord would test their faith by their obedience, and, as it further appears, teach a lesson respecting love and gratitude, useful for the church in all ages."
3. "No one need wait to know all the truth before he can really believe and be saved; let him believe what he has heard the Lord say; if he really believes he will act accordingly, and the spiritual healing promised to faith will come from the Saviour."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  As they went  (εν τω υπαγειν αυτους). Favourite Lukan idiom of εν with articular infinitive as in Luke 17:11 and often. 

### John Gill:
1. "His compassion moved towards them, and he ordered them to do as follows; go show yourselves unto the priests."
2. "On the nature of the disease of leprosy, and of the likeness there is between that and sin, and of the agreement between the cleansing of a leper, and the cleansing of a sinner by the blood of Christ."
3. "Here it may be observed, that as these lepers had a cure while they were in the way of their duty, going, as Christ ordered them...faith in Christ, whereby the heart is purified, comes by hearing the word of God."
