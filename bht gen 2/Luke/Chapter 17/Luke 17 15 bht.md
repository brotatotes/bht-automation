# Luke 17:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The healing was immediate, witnessed by the narrator. The man, having obtained permission from the priests, needed to fulfill the command of Christ and give thanks for his healing. It is a reproach that a single stranger showed more gratitude than many of the Jews. Let us not be guilty of unthankfulness and lack of piety. When we are aware of our spiritual sickness, we will seek after a cure and express gratitude for it by glorifying God with both our words and our actions.

2. "No man will seek after a cure, till he sees, or is sensible of his sickness and his wound; and when he does, he will inquire after, and make use of the proper means of healing; and when he has got a cure, he is, or at least ought to be, thankful for it."
3. "And it becomes such who are cured of the leprosy of sin, to glorify God; not only with their mouths, by bringing their offering and sacrifice of praise to him, but by deeds also, with their bodies, and with their spirits."
