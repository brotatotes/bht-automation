# Luke 17:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
There were ten who were cleansed, but only one returned to give thanks, highlighting the lack of gratitude among the majority. This incident serves as a prophetic representation of how Christ would be received, with the Jews and heathen responding differently. Although the ten had enough faith to receive physical healing, it remains uncertain if they received any spiritual benefit. It is a reminder that many may claim to be cleansed by Christ but only a few truly glorify Him. Gratitude is a rare virtue, with instances of genuine gratitude being as scarce as one in ten.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1.  17. ]  Were not the ten cleansed? but (of those ten)  the nine, where (are they)  ?

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 17, 18. Were there not ten
	cleansed—rather, were not the ten cleansed? that is, the
	whole of them—an example (by the way) of Christ's omniscience
	[BENGEL].

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The incident is prophetic of the reception accorded to Christ by the Jews and heathen respectively."
2. "Some gratitude they had, but the personal gratitude which takes the form of love they lacked."
3. "They had enough of faith to receive bodily healing, but it is left uncertain whether they received any spiritual benefit."

### John Gill:
1. "They are many, that are cleansed by the blood of Christ; his blood was shed for many, for the remission of sins; and by his righteousness, he justifies many; at least there are many who profess themselves to be cleansed by him, and yet there are but few that glorify him."
2. "Christ's flock, which is separated from the world, and walks in Gospel order, within the inclosures of it, is but a little flock; they are but a few names in Sardis, who have not defiled themselves, with corruptions in doctrine and discipline."
3. "Ingratitude is a crime many are guilty of, and it is highly resented by Christ; instances of gratitude are few, but as one in ten; now and then a single Samaritan, a stranger, one that has been a vile sinner, comes and acknowledges the grace of Christ in cleansing him."
