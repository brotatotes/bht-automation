# Luke 17:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage reveals a striking contrast between the nine Jews and the Samaritan. While the nine, who were of the same country and religion as Jesus, neglected to return and give thanks, the Samaritan, considered an outsider by the Jews, displayed gratitude. The Samaritans were seen as Gentiles, with a mixed religion and foreign origins. This interaction serves as a reminder that gratitude and faith can be found in unexpected places, even among those who are deemed outsiders or unfamiliar. It challenges us to be open to receiving blessings from unlikely sources and to express gratitude regardless of societal barriers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Samaritans were Gentiles; not a mixed race, as is sometimes erroneously supposed."
2. "They had a mixed religion, but were themselves originally from other countries."
3. "There may have been a reason for the nine Jews not returning, that they held the ceremonial duty imposed on them to be paramount, which the Samaritan might not rate so highly."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 18. this stranger—"this
	alien" (literally, "of another race"). The language is
	that of wonder and admiration, as is expressly said of another
	exhibition of Gentile faith ( :-).

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The nine were Jews, and yet put the ceremonial requirement above gratitude to their own countryman who had healed them."
2. "The stranger came, though the Jews had no dealings with the Samaritans."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Save this stranger (ε μη ο αλλογενης). The old word was αλλοφυλος (Acts 10:28), but αλλογενης occurs in the LXX, Josephus, and inscriptions."
2. "Deissmann (Light from the Ancient East, p. 80) gives the inscription from the limestone block from the Temple of Israel in Jerusalem which uses this very word which may have been read by Jesus: Let no foreigner enter within the screen and enclosure surrounding the sanctuary (Μηθενα αλλογενη εισπορευεσθα εντος του περ το ιερον τρυφακτου κα περιβολου)."

### John Gill:
1. "They did not return to give thanks to Christ, and acknowledge him the author of their cure and cleansing they did not give glory to God."
2. "A Samaritan was reckoned a Gentile, and so he was in the times of Christ; and therefore he calls a Samaritan a stranger."
3. "Here is a stranger among the Jews, and reckoned unclean, on account of leprosy, and sent with them to show himself to the priest."
