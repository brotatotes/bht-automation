# Luke 17:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If someone causes harm to a weak believer, it would be better for them if a millstone were tied around their neck and they were thrown into the sea. The behavior of the Pharisees is used here as an example to illustrate the consequences of causing harm to little ones, who are considered to be weak believers. The use of the phrase it were better emphasizes the seriousness of the consequences for those who cause harm to others.
