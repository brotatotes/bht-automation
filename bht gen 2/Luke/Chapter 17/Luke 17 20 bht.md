# Luke 17:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The kingdom of God will not come with visible signs and outward spectacle. It cannot be recognized and observed through external appearances or worldly measures of power and grandeur. Instead, the arrival of the kingdom of God is found in the works of Jesus Christ, the fulfillment of Scripture prophecies, and the power displayed in His miracles. It is not something that can be easily perceived or understood by the eyes alone, but rather requires a deeper spiritual discernment.
