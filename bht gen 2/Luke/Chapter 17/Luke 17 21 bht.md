# Luke 17:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The kingdom of God is not something that can be observed in outward displays or supernatural manifestations. It is a spiritual kingdom that resides within the hearts of believers, bringing righteousness, peace, and joy through the work of the Holy Ghost. This kingdom, though invisible to the eye, is powerful and transformative. It is not restricted to certain times or places, but is present here and now, in the midst of us. It is a kingdom that cannot be moved, and it brings glory to those who are partakers of it.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Its coming shall be so gradual and unobserved, that none during its waxing onward shall be able to point here or there for a proof of its coming."
2. "The kingdom of God was begun among them, and continues thus making its way in the world, without observation of men; so that whenever men can say ‘lo here or lo there,’ whenever great ‘revivals’ or ‘triumphs of the faith’ can be pointed to, they stand self-condemned as not belonging to that kingdom."
3. "Thus we see that every such marked event in the history of the Church is by God’s own hand as it were blotted and marred, so as not to deceive us into thinking that the kingdom has come."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Lo here! . . . lo there!—shut up within this or that sharply defined and visible geographical or ecclesiastical limit."
2. "Within you—is of an internal and spiritual character (as contrasted with their outside views of it). But it has its external side too."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The reign of God is 'in the heart.' It does not come with pomp and splendor, like the reign of temporal kings, merely to control the external 'actions' and strike the senses of people with awe, but it reigns in the heart by the law of God; it sets up its dominion over the passions, and brings every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ."
2. "The Messiah has come. John has ushered in the kingdom of God, and you are not to expect the appearance of the Messiah with great pomp and splendor, for he is now among you."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "You refers to the Pharisees, in whose hearts nothing certainly found a place less than did the ethical kingdom of God."
2. "Jesus is not speaking of the inwardness of the kingdom, but of its presence."
3. "The whole language of the kingdom of heaven being within men, rather than men being within the kingdom, is modern."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Men have no right to point to anything as a proof of the speedy coming of this kingdom."
2. "The kingdom of God is within you, or, 'in the midst of you.'"
3. "Humanity must be prepared for the new external and divine state of things by a spiritual work wrought in the depths of the heart."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "What Jesus says to the Pharisees is that they, as others, are to look for the kingdom of God within themselves, not in outward displays and supernatural manifestations." 
2. "It is not a localized display 'Here' or 'There.'"
3. "The kingdom of God as 'come upon you,' speaking to Pharisees."

### John Gill:
1. "the kingdom of God is within you: in the elect of God among the Jews, in their hearts; it being of a spiritual nature, and lying in righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost"
2. "hence it appears, that the work of grace is an internal thing; it is wrought in the hearts of men; it has its seat in the inward parts, and is therefore called the inner, and the hidden man"
3. "it is a kingdom which cannot be moved; and as it is glorious in itself, it makes such glorious who are partakers of it"

### John Wesley:
1. "This shall not be the language of those who are, or shall be sent by me, to declare the coming of my kingdom."
2. "Look not for it in distant times or remote places: it is now in the midst of you."
3. "It is come: it is present in the soul of every true believer: it is a spiritual kingdom, an internal principle."
