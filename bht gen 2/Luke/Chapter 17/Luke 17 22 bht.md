# Luke 17:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the days to come, there will be a longing among you for the presence of the Bridegroom, the Son of Man. You will find yourselves yearning for the days when He was among you, for in those days you found comfort and solace. Yet, as time passes, you will realize that those days have passed, and you will wish in vain for their return. Cherish the moments of His presence while you have them, for there may come a time when you will long for even one day of His nearness.
