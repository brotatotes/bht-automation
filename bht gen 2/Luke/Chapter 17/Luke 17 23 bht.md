# Luke 17:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Be cautious of those who claim to know the exact time and place of Christ's second coming. Many will falsely proclaim, 'Christ is in such a place,' misleading others with their predictions and causing unnecessary panic. Do not follow their lead, for this can lead to danger and disappointment. Instead, remain steadfast in your faith and trust in God's perfect timing.
