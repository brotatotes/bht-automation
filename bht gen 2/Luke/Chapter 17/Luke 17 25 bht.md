# Luke 17:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
But first, it was necessary for Christ to suffer many things, such as cruel mockings, spitting, buffeting, scourging, and ultimately, death. This suffering and rejection were crucial before His glorification. He was rejected by the generation of that time, subjected to extreme scorn and contempt in the most degrading manner. All of these events were indispensable according to God's plans, Christ's covenant, the prophecies of the Old Testament, and the salvation of His people.
