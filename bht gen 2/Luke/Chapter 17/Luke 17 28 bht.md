# Luke 17:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, there is a clear distinction between the actions of the people. They partook in various activities such as eating, drinking, buying, selling, planting, and building. These actions were carried out by the inhabitants of a city doomed for destruction. The people indulged in worldly pleasures, engaging in trade, and constructing houses in a land known for its fertility. However, their prosperity and abundance ultimately gave way to their downfall.
