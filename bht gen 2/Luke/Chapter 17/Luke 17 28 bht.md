# Luke 17:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we witness the people of Sodom and the neighboring cities engaging in their daily activities - eating, drinking, buying, selling, planting, and building. Their focus was solely on themselves and their own prosperity, with no regard for the needs of others. They lived in security and peace, oblivious to the poor and needy around them. However, this self-centeredness and lack of compassion ended in their destruction, as their actions were far from the justice and righteousness that God desires. The contrast between their ongoing actions, represented by the imperfect tense, and the sudden calamity that befell them, represented by the aorists, highlights the abruptness and severity of their downfall.
