# Luke 17:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the days of Lot, the people of Sodom and the surrounding cities lived their lives just as the people do today. They ate, drank, bought, sold, and built houses for themselves and their families, engrossed in their own pursuits. They were enjoying a time of prosperity and seemed to have no inkling of the impending destruction that would soon befall them. It is a reminder that in our own lives, we should always be prepared and mindful of the greater purpose beyond the material world.

### John Gill:
1. "Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot,.... When he lived in Sodom, and before, and at the time of the destruction of that city with other neighbouring ones:they did eat, they drank;"
2. "This is to be understood of the inhabitants of Sodom, and the other cities that perished with it:they bought, they sold: they traded among themselves, and with their neighbours;"
3. "they built; houses for themselves and posterity; and thus, as a Jewish writer observes of them, in agreement with our Lord's design in all this, being filled with the increase of the earth, they lived in security, peace, and tranquillity."
