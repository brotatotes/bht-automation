# Luke 17:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Genesis 19:24, it is suggested by some scholars that the Hebrew word used, גפרית, may actually mean pitch or rosin derived from certain types of trees. This helps to paint a vivid picture of the destruction of the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, which were consumed by fire from heaven. The accounts of these cities' destruction, along with others, have been substantiated by the testimonies of non-biblical sources. Additionally, this event serves as an example of the impending destruction of Jerusalem and the land of Judea, as mentioned in Luke 17:31 and Matthew 24:16-18.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἔβρεξεν, impersonal, not ὁ θεὸς ἔβρ." 
2. "That such an expression as ὁ θεὸς βρέχει is used Matthew 5:45, is no proof that when βρέχει is used impersonally the sacred name is to be supplied."
3. "Luk 17:31 refers immediately to the example of Sodom just related. In Mat 24:16-18 it finds its place by a reference to the destruction of Jerusalem, see there."

### John Gill:
1. "The Hebrew word, גפרית, used in Genesis 19:24... is observed, by some learned men, that it rather signifies 'pitch', or 'rosin', which proceeds from some sort of trees."
2. "The destruction of this city, with others, by fire from heaven... are confirmed by the testimonies of Heathen writers."
3. "And destroyed them all; all the inhabitants of Sodom, and all of Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim; and which was an ensample of the destruction of Jerusalem, and the land of Judea."
