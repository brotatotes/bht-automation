# Luke 17:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
There will come a time when the true state of people's hearts and their complacency will be uncovered. It is comparable to the time before the destruction of Jerusalem when the Jews lived in carelessness and security. This period will resemble a time of laziness and negligence, preceding the day of the Lord's judgment. Just as there was a remnant of people who were saved during those previous calamities, there will be those who are protected and cared for during the unexpected arrival of the Lord.
