# Luke 17:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When you find yourself facing imminent danger or destruction, be cautious and do not hesitate to leave everything behind, just as Lot and his family did when fleeing Sodom. The impending catastrophe preceding the coming of the Messiah is similar to the events described in Matthew 24:29-31, where the urgency to abandon earthly possessions and seek safety is emphasized. Although the extent of physical flight is uncertain, it is clear that absolute indifference towards worldly interests is required to be prepared for the arrival of the Son of Man.
