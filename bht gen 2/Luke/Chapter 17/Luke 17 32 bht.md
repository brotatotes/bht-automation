# Luke 17:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Remember Lot's wife and let her serve as a reminder to not look back with longing for what has been left behind. Just as she became a pillar of salt for disobeying God's command, let us not be like her in our journey of faith. Instead, let us focus on moving forward without hesitation, giving up worldly desires and looking towards the kingdom of God.
