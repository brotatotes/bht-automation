## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ζητήσῃ should be rendered as a futurus exactus, as an aorist conjoined with a future always must be: shall have sought, i.e. 'during his preceding life,' shall lose it then." 
2. "ζωογονήσει, vivipariet (Act 7:19): an expressive word, derived from animal parturition, bringing forth to air and life what was before concealed in the womb. That day shall come as the pains of labour (ὠδῖνες) on a woman in travail (Mat 24:8): but to the saints of God it shall be the birth of the soul and body to life and glory everlasting." 
3. "See St. Ignatius ad Rom. c. 6."
