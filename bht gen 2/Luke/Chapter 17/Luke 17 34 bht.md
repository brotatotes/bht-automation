# Luke 17:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In that night, there will be a mingling of the prepared and unprepared, similar to how the destruction of Jerusalem brought the separation of Christians from their old associates. This separation, like the second coming of Christ, will be a shocking truth that burst upon a heedless world. And in this night, there will be a clear distinction made by God's providence, emphasizing the need for believers to trust in it.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The prepared and unprepared mingled in closest intercourse together in the ordinary walks and fellowships of life, when the moment of severance arrives."
2. "Awful truth! realized before the destruction of Jerusalem, when the Christians found themselves forced by their Lord's directions at once and for ever away from their old associates."
3. "Most of all when the second coming of Christ shall burst upon a heedless world."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In that night. Night is the time of surprise and terror, and the return of the Lord had already been set forth figuratively as occurring at night (chap. Luke 12:35-39); but Luke 17:35-36, refer to the day-time."
2. "Two men on one bed. Peculiar to Luke. Illustrating the separation of those previously closely associated together."
3. "There will be a separation between the faithful and the unfaithful, as well as a gathering of the elect out of the world. This illustration gives prominence to the former idea, the next to the latter."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  In that night  (ταυτη τη νυκτ). More vivid still, "on this night," when Christ comes. 

### John Gill:
1. "...still suggests the security the people of the Jews would be in, at the time of their destruction."
2. "...this likewise intimates, that the destruction of the Jews would be at a time when they were thoughtless of it, and were eating and drinking, as in the days of Noah and of Lot, Luke 17:27."
3. "...which is mentioned, to show the distinction God will make in his providence, and to encourage believers to trust in it."
