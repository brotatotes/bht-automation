# Luke 17:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Two women grinding together was a common sight where one would be taken and the other left by the Roman soldiers. The reason for this can only be attributed to the sovereign will and providence of God, which guides and directs the actions of men. The mention of Luke 17:36 is likely an insertion from Matthew 24:40, as it is omitted by the best authorities. The periphrastic future active indicative in Luke 17:35, also found in Matthew 24:41, emphasizes the future action of two women grinding in one mill. Their proximity reflects an intimate connection, similar to the gathering of people mentioned in Acts 2:1.
