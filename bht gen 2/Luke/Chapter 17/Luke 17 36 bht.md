# Luke 17:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In these various instances, it is clear that these circumstances do not necessarily convey the impact or message of the Gospel being preached. Rather, it suggests that while some are called and respond to the Gospel, others remain in their sins. These individuals are depicted as either asleep in bed, feasting on a couch, grinding in a mill, or occupied with work in the field. It is implied that they are not in a suitable place or state of mind to hear and receive the Gospel when it is proclaimed.
