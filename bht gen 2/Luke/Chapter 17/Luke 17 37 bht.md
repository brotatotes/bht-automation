# Luke 17:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
At the destruction of Jerusalem and many times since, the ministers of divine judgment have been drawn to places of great moral and spiritual corruption, just as birds of prey are drawn to carrion. Jerusalem, known for its wickedness, was a prime target for these calamities. This proverb is mentioned in Matthew 24:28 as well, but there it likely also refers to the destruction of Jerusalem. The question of where such destruction would come was answered with the image of eagles gathering around a carcass, symbolizing the Roman army swooping in and devouring the Jewish people in their fortifications.

### John Wesley:
