# Luke 17:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If someone sins against you multiple times in a day and each time repents and asks for forgiveness, you should receive them as if they had never sinned against you. This forgiveness is reserved for genuine penitents, those who sincerely regret their actions. It is our duty to forgive all, whether or not they have truly repented, and not just a limited number of times, but repeatedly and abundantly.
