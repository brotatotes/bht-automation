# Luke 17:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples, realizing the difficulty of forgiving offenses, earnestly requested an increase of faith from the Lord. They felt their own weakness and recognized that it was only through a greater measure of faith that they could fulfill the challenging task of forgiving others. This plea to God for more faith was significant, as the disciples acknowledged that faith is not something of their own making, but a gift bestowed by the Lord. Humbly recognizing their need, they sought Christ's divine power to provide the increase they desired.
