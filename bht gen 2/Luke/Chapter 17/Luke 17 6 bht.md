# Luke 17:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If you had even the smallest amount of genuine faith, you would be able to accomplish incredible things. No task would be too difficult for you. It would be as if you could command a sycamine tree to be uprooted and planted in the sea, and it would obey. This demonstrates the immense power and potential that faith holds. The expression of commanding a sycamine tree to move serves as a symbol for the extraordinary feats that true faith can accomplish.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἐλέγετε ἄν, ye would say: ὑπήκουσεν ἄν, it would (even while you were speaking) have obeyed."
2. "Notice the different tenses with ἄν: ἐλέγετε ἄν, ye would say: ὑπήκουσεν ἄν, it would (even while you were speaking) have obeyed."
3. "ἐκριζώθ. ] ‘Cum ipsis radicibus, in mari mansura. Tale quiddam fit ipsis fidelibus.’ Bengel."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 6. sycamine—mulberry. (See on
	 :-.)

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This sycamore is a remarkable tree. It not only bears several crops of figs during the year, but these figs grow on short stems along the trunk and large branches, and not at the end of twigs, as in other fruit-bearing trees."
2. "It is easily propagated, merely by planting a stout branch in the ground, and watering it until it has struck its roots into the soil. This it does with great rapidity and to a vast depth."
3. "Now, look at this tree - its ample girth, its wide-spread arms branching off from the parent trunk only a few feet from the ground; then examine its enormous roots, as thick, as numerous, and as wide-spread into the deep soil below as the branches extend into the air above the very best type of invincible steadfastness."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Luke distinguishes between this and sukomorea, the fig-mulberry."
2. "The names were sometimes confused, but a physician would readily make the distinction."
3. "Both [sycamine and sukomorea] were used medicinally."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The promise here given is even stronger than that in Matthew, for the tree is represented as being planted in the sea, where growth is ordinarily impossible."
2. "This promise is misunderstood, only when miracles of power are put above miracles of grace."
3. "You think the duties I enjoin too hard for your faith, but this shows that you have as yet no faith of the high order you ought to have, for the smallest measure of such a faith would enable you to do what seems altogether impossible in the natural world; and so much the more in spiritual things, since real faith is preeminently spiritual power."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "If ye have...Ye would say...a mixed condition therefore." 
2. "The distinction is not observed in the LXX, but it is observed in the late Greek medical writers for both trees have medicinal properties."
3. "Both trees differ from the English sycamore. In Matthew 17:20 we have 'mountain' in place of 'sycamine tree'."

### John Gill:
1. "If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed; ye might say unto this sycamine tree; be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea, and it should obey you." 
2. "For such a tree to be plucked up by the root at a word speaking, is very wonderful and miraculous, and beyond the power of nature." 
3. "The design is to show, what great things are done by faith, and what an increase of it they should have."

### John Wesley:
1. "If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed — If ye had the least measure of true faith, no instance of duty would be too hard for you."
2. "Ye would say to this sycamine tree — This seems to have been a kind of proverbial expression."
