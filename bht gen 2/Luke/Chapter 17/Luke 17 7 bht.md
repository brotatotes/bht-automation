# Luke 17:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is important to recognize that our obedience and service to God should not be driven by an expectation of reward or merit. Instead, we should humbly acknowledge our complete dependency on Him and our unworthiness. Just as a servant does not demand reward for their work, but rather faithfully fulfills their duties, we too should obey God without seeking personal gain. Our focus should be on faithfully serving the Lord rather than expecting any sort of entitlement or special status.
