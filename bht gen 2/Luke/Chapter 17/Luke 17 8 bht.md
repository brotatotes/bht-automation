# Luke 17:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is likely that the master would request the servant to prepare what he needs for supper, as it agrees with the custom and relationship between a master and servant. The servant would also gird himself, a practice in those regions where long garments were worn, to be ready and efficient in his service. This reflects the importance of being prepared and quickly fulfilling one's duties. Providing food and drink for a servant, regardless of their social status, is an act of mercy and not oppressing them, aligning with the principle of treating others with kindness and generosity.
