# Luke 17:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Lord is speaking of the rightful state of relation between us and Him, as He is not laying down rules for the behavior of an earthly master to his servants. Our service to God should not be motivated by seeking thanks, as God is not bound to thank us like an earthly master would. It is not customary for masters to thank their servants, and any commendation we receive should not be mistaken for gratitude. The parable highlights the importance of choosing the position of sons rather than remaining in the role of servants.
