# Luke 18:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Prayer is not just an action but a sincere desire of the heart. It is necessary to always pray and never lose heart or slacken. We should not neglect regular moments of prayer and seize opportunities to seek God. God does not grant immediate assistance to test our perseverance. Just as the wicked judge yielded to the widow, our prayers, when continually maintained, will not be in vain. We should pray, understanding the necessity to always pray and not give in to discouragement, even when answers are delayed. Prayer is an antidote against fainting under affliction.
