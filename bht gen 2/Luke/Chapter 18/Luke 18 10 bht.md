# Luke 18:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, two men went to the temple to pray. The Pharisee approached with an ostentatious display, reciting a self-righteous monologue, boasting of his supposed virtues and emphasizing the sins he believed himself to be innocent of. On the other hand, the publican approached with humility and confession, recognizing his own unworthiness. The Pharisee's self-centered attitude led to rejection, while the prayers of the publican were pleasing to God. This passage reminds us that a humble and contrite heart is more valuable in the eyes of God than self-righteousness and pride.
