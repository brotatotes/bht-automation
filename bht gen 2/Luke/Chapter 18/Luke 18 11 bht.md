# Luke 18:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Pharisee in this story presents a distorted view of gratitude and prayer. Rather than humbly acknowledging God's grace and mercy, he is self-absorbed and arrogant. He boasts of his moral superiority and looks down upon others, failing to recognize his own sinfulness. His prayer is not a genuine communion with God, but a self-centered monologue. This serves as a warning against the dangers of pride, self-righteousness, and the tendency to compare oneself with others. Instead, true gratitude and prayer should be rooted in humility, recognizing our need for God's undeserved goodness and mercy.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "To have been kept from gross iniquities was undoubtedly a just cause of thankfulness to God but instead of the devoutly humble, admiring frame which this should inspire, the Pharisee arrogantly severs himself from the rest of mankind, as quite above them."
2. "Not confining himself to the one divinely prescribed annual fast, he was not behind the most rigid, who fasted on the second and fifth days of every week, and gave the tenth not only of what the law laid under tithing, but of 'all his gains.' Thus, besides doing all his duty, he did works of supererogation; while sins to confess and spiritual wants to be supplied he seems to have felt none."
3. "What a picture of the Pharisaic character and religion!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He said over to himself what he had done, and what was the ground on which he expected the favour of God."
2. "Hypocrites are often the most orthodox in opinion of any class of people. They know the truth, and admit it."
3. "It is, however, not wrong to thank God that he has kept us from the gross sins which other people commit; but it should not be done in an ostentatious manner, nor should it be done forgetting still that we are great sinners and need pardon."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Stood [σατθεις] . Lit., having been placed. Took his stand. It implies taking up his position ostentatiously; striking an attitude. But no necessarily in a bad sense."
2. "Took his stand. It implies taking up his position ostentatiously; striking an attitude."
3. "Prayed [προσηυχετο] . Imperfect : began to pray, or proceeded to pray."

### John Calvin:
1. "For this thanksgiving, which is presented exclusively in his own name, does not at all imply that he boasted of his own virtue, as if he had obtained righteousness from himself, or merited any thing by his own industry."
2. "Hence we infer that men are not truly and properly humbled, though they are convinced that they can do nothing, unless they likewise distrust the merits of works, and learn to place their salvation in the undeserved goodness of God, so as to rest upon it all their confidence."
3. "And observe, that he is not charged with the vainglorious ambition of those who indulge in boasting before men, while they are inwardly conscious of their own wickedness, but is charged with concealed hypocrisy; for he is not said to have been the herald of his own praises, but to have prayed silently within himself."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The phrase doubtless alludes to the fact that his prayer was not really a communing with God, but a communing with himself."
2. "He did not thank God, but boasted. It is possible to thank God for what we do and become more than others, but such a thanksgiving springs out of the most profound humility."
3. "The thanksgiving was not for freedom from these sins, but for his superiority to sinners; and he introduces the concrete and actual sinner (the publican)."

### John Gill:
1. "he prayed only with respect to himself; he was wholly intent upon himself; his own self, and the commendation of himself, were the subject of his prayer"
2. "he thanks God, in order to exalt himself, and places his righteousness in his own works, and treats all other men in a censorious and disdainful manner"
3. "he prayed only with respect to himself; he was wholly intent upon himself; his own self, and the commendation of himself, were the subject of his prayer"
