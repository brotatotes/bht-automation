# Luke 18:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Pharisee in this passage boasts of his righteousness, which he believes exceeds the requirements of the law. He proudly fasts twice a week, following the tradition of the strictest Pharisees who observed fasting on Mondays and Thursdays. Additionally, he claims to give tithes of all that he possesses, following the practice of giving one full tenth of his income in tithes. However, his focus on external observances and actions reveals a neglect of the inward transformation of the heart. True righteousness requires humility and dependence on God's mercy, rather than self-exaltation and personal works.
