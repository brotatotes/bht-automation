# Luke 18:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The publican stood at a distance, not only physically but also spiritually, recognizing his unworthiness compared to the Pharisee. He humbly refused to lift up his eyes to heaven, conscious of his sinfulness and filled with shame. His posture and demeanor reflected his deep sense of humility and unworthiness before God. The publican recognized that his only hope for mercy was through the propitiatory sacrifice of the Messiah, typified by the sacrifices under the law.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "A contrast in spirit to the other's thanks that he was not as other men, is furnished by the poor Publican in his humility acknowledging this by an act."
2. "There is a slight but true difference also in σταθείς of the Pharisee 'being put in position' and ἑστώς of the publican, 'standing;' coming in merely and remaining, in no studied place or posture."
3. "It seems to me that any emphatic comparison here would somewhat detract from the solemnity and simplicity of the prayer. The τῷ rather implies, not comparison with others, but intense self-abasement: 'sinner that I am.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Standing afar off—as unworthy to draw near; but that was the way to get near."
2. "Would not lift up—blushing and ashamed to do so."
3. "Smote, c.—kept smiting for anguish and self-reproach."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The publican stood ... from the temple."
2. "Men who are conscious of guilt always fix their eyes on the ground."
3. "He felt most that 'God' was a witness of his actions, and he was willing, therefore, to confess his sins before him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Standing [εστως]. In a timid attitude: merely standing, not posturing as the Pharisee."
2. "Be merciful [ιλασθητι]. Lit., be propitiated."
3. "A sinner [τω αμαρτωλω]. With the definite article, 'the sinner.' 'He thinks about no other man' (Bengel)."

### John Calvin:
1. "Humility lies in not refusing to acknowledge our sins, but condemning ourselves, and thus anticipating the judgment of God."
2. "In order to obtain favor, [we] must begin with [the forgiveness of sins], if we desire that he would accept our prayers."
3. "God will not be gracious to any but those who betake themselves with trembling to his mercy alone."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Possibly, too, from the Pharisees thus indicating that he did not deem himself as other men, out morally below them."
2. "He thinks of himself as though he were the great and only sinner."
3. "This petition is the only one a sinner can offer or may offer, but it may and can be answered only for Christ’s sake."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "At a distance from the Pharisee, not from the sanctuary." 
2. "Worshippers usually lifted up their closed eyes to God." 
3. "The main point in the contrast lies in this article. The Pharisee thought of others as sinners. The publican thinks of himself alone as the sinner, not of others at all."

### John Gill:
1. "This poor man might stand at a greater distance than was required, that he might not displease the Pharisee, who, he knew, would resent it, should he stand near him; or rather this was done, to testify the sense he had of his state and condition, and of his unworthiness."
2. "And agreeably to this, it is elsewhere said,'he that prays, ought to fix his eyes below, and his heart above.'"
3. "The publican was right in addressing him by confession: the petition he makes to him is, to be 'merciful', or 'propitious' to him; that is, to show mercy to him, through the propitiary sacrifice of the Messiah, which was typified by the sacrifices under the law."

### John Wesley:
1. "The publican standing afar off - From the holy of holies..." 
2. "Would not so much as lift up his eyes to heaven - Touched with shame..."
