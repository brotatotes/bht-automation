# Luke 18:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The publican, in contrast to the Pharisee, went down to his house justified before God. This humble man's prayer was accepted by God because of his sincere repentance and acknowledgement of his own unworthiness. Jesus teaches us that those who exalt themselves will be humbled, but those who humble themselves will be exalted by God.

3. "Thus the particular instance is bound up with the general truth."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "To be self-emptied, or, 'poor in spirit,' is the fundamental and indispensable preparation for the reception of the 'grace which bringeth salvation': wherever this exists, the 'mourning' for it which precedes 'comfort' and the earnest 'hungerings and thirstings after righteousness' which are rewarded by the 'fulness' of it, will, as we see here, be surely found."
2. "Such, therefore, and such only, are the justified ones."
3. "This great law of the Kingdom of God is, in the teaching of Christ, inscribed, as in letters of gold, over its entrance gate."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "God judges of this differently from people.Justified - Accepted or approved of God."
3. "The word 'justify' means to declare or treat as righteous. In this case it means that in their prayers the one was approved and the other not; the one went down with the favor of God in answer to his petitions, the other not."

### John Calvin:

2. "Hence it follows, that righteousness consists in the forgiveness of sins."
3. "We cannot doubt, therefore, that Christ now lays down a rule for all to this effect, that God will not be pacified towards us, unless we distrust works, and pray that we may be freely reconciled."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This man, the publican, went down to his house, returned home, justified, i.e., accepted by God as righteous..."
2. "Our Lord implies that the publican’s prayer was answered, that God was merciful to this sinner, and this is precisely what is meant by justification..."
3. "The Pharisee, though previously a more moral man than the other, failed to be justified, not because he was more moral, but because he was self-righteous; the publican, the worse man of the two, was justified, not because he was worse, but because he was a humble penitent."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

3. "Every one that exalteth himself, shall be abased, and he that humbleth himself, shall be exalted."

### John Wesley:
1. This man went down — From the hill on which the temple stood, justified rather than the other - That is, and not the other.
