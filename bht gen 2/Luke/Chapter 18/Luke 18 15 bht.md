# Luke 18:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Matthew 19:13 and Mark 10:13, not only adults but also parents brought their children to Jesus, including infants. It was customary for Jesus to touch or lay His hands on the children and bless them. Although the disciples initially rebuked those who brought the infants, Jesus taught that these young ones were not to be excluded from receiving His healing touch and blessings.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Their infants also; not the people came only, but also brought their children."
2. "The art. may be merely generic, as in E. V."
3. "βρ. points out more distinctly the tender age of the children than παιδία."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Infants—showing that some, at least, of those called in Matthew and Mark simply 'little' or 'young children,' were literally 'babes.'" 
2. "Put His hands on them and pray, or invoke a 'blessing' on them, according to venerable custom." 
3. "Here, it is plain from our Lord's reply, that they thought the intrusion a useless one, as infants were not capable of receiving anything from Him. His ministrations were for grown people."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Infants [τα βρεφη] . See on 1 Peter 2:2. Touch. So Mark. Matthew has lay his hands on them and pray.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They brought (προσεφερον). Imperfect active, they were bringing. So Mark 10:13."
2. "Their babes (τα βρεφη). Old word for infants. Here Mark 10:13; Matthew 19:13 have παιδια (little children). Note 'also' (κα) in Luke, not in Mark and Matthew."
3. "Rebuked (επετιμων). Imperfect indicative active. Either inchoative began to rebuke, or continued, kept on rebuking. Matthew and Mark have the aorist επετιμησαν."

### John Gill:
1. "As well as grown persons, that were sick, to be healed by him: that he would touch them... one of the ways by which Christ healed persons, was by touching them."
2. "One of the ways by which Christ healed persons, was by touching them."
3. "But when [his] disciples saw [it], they rebuked them; the persons that brought the infants."

### John Wesley:
1.  Matthew 19:13; Mark 10:13.
