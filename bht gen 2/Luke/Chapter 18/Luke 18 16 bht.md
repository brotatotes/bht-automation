# Luke 18:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus lovingly invites the little children to come to Him without any hindrance, emphasizing that the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. It is disheartening to think that parents or preachers might prevent children from approaching Christ. Jesus' act of taking them up in His arms and blessing them demonstrates that even as infants, they are capable of being embraced by the Kingdom of God. This should serve as a heartfelt reminder to all believers to welcome and nurture children, allowing them to experience the love, grace, and presence of Jesus in their lives.
