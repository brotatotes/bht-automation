# Luke 18:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus uses the example of a child to teach his disciples about the importance of humility and to warn them against pride and vanity. He emphasizes that in order to enter the kingdom of God, one must approach it with the innocence, trust, and humility of a child, without prejudice or ambition. Jesus wants his followers to understand that having a childlike faith is crucial for receiving the blessings of God's kingdom. Anyone who lacks this childlike humility would be unfit to be a part of the Gospel community or to be considered a true follower of Christ.

### John Gill:
1. "Christ takes an occasion from hence to teach his disciples humility, and guard them against pride and vanity."
2. "Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God...as a little child; without prejudice, pride, ambition, and vanity, with meekness and humility."
3. "A very unfit and improper person to be a professor of the Gospel; or to be admitted to Gospel ordinances; or be a member of a Gospel church; or be reckoned a subject of the Messiah's kingdom."
