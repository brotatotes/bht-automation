# Luke 18:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By asking why someone would call Him good, Jesus was not implying that only God should be called good, as that would contradict Scripture. His intention was to elevate the young man's understanding of Him beyond just a good teacher, revealing Himself as more than that. Jesus wanted the young man to recognize that only God is truly good, emphasizing His divine nature. This underlying message is crucial to understanding the true meaning behind Jesus' words.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Did our Lord mean then to teach that God only ought to be called 'good'? Impossible, for that had been to contradict all Scripture teaching, and His own, too."
2. "Unless therefore we are to ascribe captiousness to our Lord, He could have had but one object—to raise the youth's ideas of Himself, as not to be classed merely with other 'good masters,' and declining to receive this title apart from the 'One' who is essentially and only 'good.'"
3. "This indeed is but distantly hinted; but unless this is seen in the background of our Lord's words, nothing worthy of Him can be made out of them."

### John Gill:
1. "why callest thou me good? it being unusual to address men, even their Rabbins, under such a title"
