# Luke 18:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This judge lacked the qualities needed to be a proper judge - wisdom, modesty, fear of God, love of truth, and love of men. He did not fear God or respect the rights of others, which disqualified him from being a judge. Those who do not fear God will not have much regard for their fellow men, as they will only show respect when obligated to do so. Judges should not show favoritism or twist judgment due to affection, flattery, or bribery.

### John Gill:
1. "The qualifications of one to be a judge, even of the bench of three, were these: wisdom, meekness (or modesty), and fear (i.e. of God), and hatred of mammon (or money), love of truth, and to have the love of men, and to be masters of a good name (or to be of good report)."
2. "But the judge in the text came greatly short of these qualifications: his character follows, which feared not God, neither regarded man; and therefore, according to the canon, was disqualified from being a judge."
3. "Such that fear not God will have little regard to men; no otherwise, or further, than they are obliged to it: indeed, judges ought not to regard men in judgment; that is, to respect the persons of men, and through affection, or flattery, or bribes, wrest judgment."
