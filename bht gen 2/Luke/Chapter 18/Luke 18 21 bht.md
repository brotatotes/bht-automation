# Luke 18:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The interaction between Jesus and the ruler who claimed to have diligently followed the commandments since his youth reveals the genuine desire of the ruler to know what else he needed to do. This sincere inquiry into his lack of fulfillment in spite of his righteous actions captures our attention. Although he turned away from Jesus, his earnestness, transparency, and close proximity to the kingdom of God struck a chord with Jesus. It is a reminder that there is more to spiritual growth than just religious observance.
