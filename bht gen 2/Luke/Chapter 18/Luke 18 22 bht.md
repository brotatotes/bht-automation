# Luke 18:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus pointed out that there was an essential lacking in this person, highlighting their need to prioritize loving God above all else. It is evident that Jesus had deep affection for this individual, as He looked upon them with love. In order to address their pride and attachment to wealth, Jesus instructs them to sell everything and give to the poor, promising them treasure in heaven. This account emphasizes the importance of detaching ourselves from material possessions and directing our resources towards the purposes and glory of God.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "lackest . . . one thing‚ÄîAh! but that a fundamental, fatal lack."
2. "sell, &c.‚ÄîAs riches were his idol, our Lord, who knew it from the first, lays His great authoritative grasp at once upon it, saying, 'Now give Me up that, and all is right.'"
3. "No general direction about the disposal of riches, then, is here given, save that we are to sit loose to them and lay them at the feet of Him who gave them. He who does this with all he has, whether rich or poor, is a true heir of the kingdom of heaven."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Yet lackest thou one thing [ŒµœÑŒπ ŒµŒΩ œÉŒøŒπ ŒªŒµŒπœÄŒµŒπ] . Lit., still one thing is lacking to thee."
2. "Mark alone adds that Jesus, looking upon him, loved him."
3. "Come [Œ¥ŒµœÖœÅŒø] . Lit., hither."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
