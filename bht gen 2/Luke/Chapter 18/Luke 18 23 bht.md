# Luke 18:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When faced with the choice between parting with Christ or parting with his vast wealth, the rich man in question was deeply sorrowful. He understood that in order to truly follow Christ, he needed to relinquish all of his material possessions. This lack of willingness to give up his riches revealed a deficiency in his commitment to fully submit his heart to God and undermined his other acts of obedience. It is evident that the rich man's attachment to his wealth overshadowed his desire to follow Christ wholeheartedly.
