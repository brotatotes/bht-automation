# Luke 18:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples of Christ were astonished when they heard Him say that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God. They questioned who then can be saved, realizing that wealth was seen as a sign of divine favor, not an obstacle to salvation. It seemed impossible, but they also recognized that while it may be beyond human capability, it is not beyond divine power.
