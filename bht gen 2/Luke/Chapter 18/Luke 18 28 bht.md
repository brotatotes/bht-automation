# Luke 18:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus instructed the rich young ruler to sell his possessions, the man was hesitant and found it difficult to surrender his worldly comforts. However, Jesus, who was always quick to respond, observed the young man's reluctance and recognized the challenge that every wealthy individual faced in entering the kingdom of God. In response, the rich young ruler boldly declared, We have left all our possessions and followed you. This statement reflected his understanding that true discipleship involved leaving behind everything - including friends, trades, and material possessions - in order to follow Jesus wholeheartedly.
