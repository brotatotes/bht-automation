# Luke 18:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When it comes to surrendering for the kingdom of God's sake, there is no man who truly comprehends the completeness and acceptableness of such a sacrifice. This entails leaving behind houses, parents, siblings, spouses, or children, all for the sake of Christ and his Gospel. By doing so, individuals can experience the true essence of the kingdom of God. This goes beyond material possessions and encompasses every form of self-sacrifice, as detailed in Matthew and Mark. Even those in more ordinary circumstances will not go unnoticed or unrewarded for their devotion to the kingdom of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "There is no man, graciously acknowledging at once the completeness and the acceptableness of the surrender as a thing already made."
2. "House, &c. - The specification is still more minute in Matthew and Mark, to take in every form of self-sacrifice."
3. "For the kingdom of God's sake - In Mark, 'for MY sake and the Gospel's.' See on Luke 6:22."

### John Gill:
1. "There is no man that hath left house, or 'houses', as read the Syriac and Persic versions; or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake: that is, for Christ's sake, and for the sake of his Gospel, as the other evangelists have it."
2. "This teaches us how to understand the kingdom of God here, and elsewhere."
3. "Not only you shall have peculiar honour done you, as to sit on thrones, and judge the twelve tribes of Israel; but there is not a single person of a more private character."
