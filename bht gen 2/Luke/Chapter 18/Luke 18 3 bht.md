# Luke 18:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ is described as the bridegroom of his church, and the church is symbolized as a chaste virgin espoused to him. The people of God often find themselves facing various adversaries, including their own sins, the influence of Satan, wicked oppressors, and persecutors. Despite the challenges they may face, it is not the role of God's people to take vengeance into their own hands. Instead, they should seek justice with the understanding that it ultimately brings glory to God, rather than seeking personal retribution.

1. "Judges were bound to show special attention to widows, Isaiah 1:17; Jeremiah 22:3. The reason of this was that they were defenseless, were commonly poor, and were liable to be oppressed by those in power."
2. "Avenge me - This would have been better translated, 'Do me justice against my adversary, or vindicate me from him.' It does not denote vengeance or revenge, but simply that she wished to have 'justice' done her - a thing which this judge was 'bound' to do, but which it seems he had no disposition to do."

3. "Deissmann (Light from the Ancient East, pp. 420ff.) quotes a œÉœÑŒ∑ŒªŒ∑ of the second century B.C. with a prayer for vengeance for a Jewish girl that had been murdered which has this very verb ŒµŒ∫Œ¥ŒπŒ∫Œµœâ."
