# Luke 18:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus speaks of the promise of a reconstruction of all human relationships on a Christian basis, after being sacrificed on the altar of love to Him. This includes the assurance of receiving manifold more comfort, peace, satisfaction, and pleasure in this present time. However, the transfer to this new and higher circle may not happen without persecution, as it could follow them into their new lives. These promises are for those who choose to forsake everything for Christ, with the ultimate reward being life everlasting in the world to come.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "We have here the blessed promise of a reconstruction of all human relationships and affections on a Christian basis and in a Christian state, after being sacrificed, in their natural form, on the altar of love to Christ." 
2. "But this 'with persecutions'; for how could such a transfer take place without the most cruel wrenches to flesh and blood? but the persecution would haply follow them into their new and higher circle, breaking that up too!"
3. "These promises are for every one who forsakes his all for Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Shall not receive (ουχ μη λαβη). Very strong double negative with aorist active subjunctive of λαμβανω." 
2. "Manifold more (πολλαπλασιονα). Late Greek word, here alone in the N.T. save Matthew 19:29 where Westcott and Hort have it though many MSS. there read εκατονπλασιονα (a hundredfold) as in Mark 10:30."

### John Gill:
1. "Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time... such comfort, peace, satisfaction, and pleasure, as are not to be found in such enjoyments."
