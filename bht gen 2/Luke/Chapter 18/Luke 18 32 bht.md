# Luke 18:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The exclusion of the betrayal in this passage raises questions, especially since Luke had access to Matthew's account. However, this omission serves as the initial announcement of the impending crucifixion. It signifies the forthcoming mistreatment of Jesus, encompassing verbal insults and physical abuse, such as spitting. These acts were carried out by both the officers in the high priest's palace and the Roman soldiers in Pilate's hall. A similar pattern of omission can be observed in Luke 9:45. These omissions emphasize the significance of these details within the larger narrative.
