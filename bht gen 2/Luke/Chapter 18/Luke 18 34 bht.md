# Luke 18:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples struggled to understand the words of Jesus, as all of these things were hidden from them. Their ignorance stemmed from their preconceived notions of the Messiah and their lack of knowledge of the Old Testament prophecies. They were perplexed by Jesus' reference to his future sufferings and could not reconcile it with their expectations of a temporal kingdom. This lack of understanding serves as a reminder for us to trust in God's words and not to shut our eyes to the light.
