# Luke 18:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, upon hearing the call of the blind man, approached him and made a deliberate stop. It was as if Jesus wanted to acknowledge the blind man's request and give him his undivided attention. He then commanded someone, likely one of his disciples or a member of the crowd, to bring the blind man to him. As the blind man drew near, Jesus asked him a question, showing his willingness to engage in a conversation with him. This interaction highlights Jesus' compassion and attentiveness to the needs of those who seek him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise, He calleth thee"—just as one earnestly desiring an interview with some exalted person, but told by one official after another that it is vain to wait, as he will not succeed (they know it), yet persists in waiting for some answer to his suit, and at length the door opens, and a servant appears, saying, "You will be admitted—he has called you."
2. "And he, casting away his garment"—how lively is this touch, evidently of an eye-witness, expressive of his earnestness and joy—"came to Jesus" (Mark 10:49 Mark 10:50).

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Stood (σταθεις). First aorist passive where Mark 10:49; Matthew 20:32 have στας (second aorist active) translated 'stood still.' One is as 'still' as the other. The first is that Jesus 'stopped.'"
2. "Be brought (αχθηνα). First aorist infinitive in indirect command."

### John Gill:
1. "And Jesus stood,.... He stood still; he made a full stop, and went no further, when, it is very likely, he was just over against him." 
2. "And commanded him to be brought unto him; either by the disciples, or by some of the multitude."
3. "And when he was come near he asked him; the following question."
