# Luke 18:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? Jesus asked, prompting the man to contemplate his true desire. Could it be alms he was seeking, or was it his sight that he longed to have restored? The man, aware of his own need, confidently responded, Lord, that I may receive my sight. This fervent cry expressed his deep yearning to regain his vision, a belief that Christ, the son of David, possessed the ability to bring about this miraculous transformation.
