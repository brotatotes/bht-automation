## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Peculiar (except ·º†Œ∫ŒøŒªŒøœçŒ∏ŒµŒπ Œ±·ΩêœÑ·ø∑, which all three relate) to Luke; his usual way of terminating such narrations."

### Philip Schaff:
1. Luke 18:43.  Glorifying God.  Peculiar to Luke, and a phrase frequently used by him. This miracle would make the prediction of Luke 18:31-33 the more incomprehensible to the disciples.
	

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Followed  (Œ∑Œ∫ŒøŒªŒøœÖŒ∏Œµ). Imperfect active as in Mark 10:52. Either inchoative he began to follow, or descriptive, he was following. 

### John Gill:
1. "As soon as ever the word was gone out of Christ's mouth, virtue went forth from him, and cured the man of his blindness; his eyes were at once opened, and he saw as other men." 
2. "And all the people, when they saw [it]; what was done, how that the man they just before saw was blind, and begging by the way side, now had his sight restored to him, in an instant, and was following Jesus, in the crowd, along with them: gave praise unto God."
3. "They ascribed the glory to God, and praised his name, that he had raised up the Messiah among them; of which this was a clear proof, inasmuch as the eyes of the blind were opened"
