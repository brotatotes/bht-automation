# Luke 18:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Take encouragement from this passage to be persistent and fervent in your prayers to God. Just as the unjust judge was moved to do justice by the widow's persistence, so too can we expect that God, who is infinitely more loving and just, will respond favorably to our prayers. If such a cruel and unjust judge can be influenced by importunity, how much more will our merciful God be inclined to answer our prayers? Therefore, let us approach God in continual prayer, knowing that our persistent prayers will prevail with Him, for He is goodness itself.
