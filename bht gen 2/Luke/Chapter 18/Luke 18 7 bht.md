The poor widow, symbolizing the forsaken Church, has a rightful claim as the chosen ones of God. God's delay in executing justice serves to test our faith and demonstrate His patient nature. Through persistent prayer, the elect find solace, knowing that their cries are heard by the Lord of Sabaoth, who will ultimately bring vindication and deliverance.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The poor widow in this case (the forsaken Church, contending with her adversary the devil, 1Pe 5:8) has this additional claim, in which the right of her cause consists, that she is the Elect of God, His Beloved." 
2. "·º°ŒºŒ≠œÅŒ±œÇ Œ∫ . ŒΩœÖŒ∫œÑœåœÇ] This answers to the œÄŒ¨ŒΩœÑŒøœÑŒµ in Luke 18:1, but is an amplification of it."
3. "Œ∫ . ŒºŒ±Œ∫œÅŒøŒ∏œÖŒºŒµ·øñ ‚Ä¶ and He delays his vengeance in their case: and He, in their case, is long-suffering. 'Est in hac voce dilationis significatio, qu√¶ ut debitori prodest, ita gravis est ei qui vim patitur.' Grotius."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "shall not God...avenge‚Äîredeem from oppression."
2. "his own elect...dear to Him as the apple of the eye."
3. "cry day and night‚Äîwhose every cry enters into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth, and how much more their incessant and persevering cries!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The great truth which our Saviour 'designed' to teach is what we ought to endeavor to find."
2. "If, therefore, this 'wicked man' by persevering prayer was induced to do justice, how much more shall 'God,' who is good, and who is not actuated by any such selfish and base principles, do justice to them who apply to him!"
3. "The people of God are often oppressed, calumniated, persecuted. They are few in number and feeble. They seem to be almost forsaken and cast down, and their enemies triumph. Yet in due time God will hear their prayers and will come forth for their vindication."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "And shall not God. The emphasis is on God."
2. "He delays also, or seems to delay, in order to try his children's faith, or because his purpose is not ripe; but he, too, will do justice to the suppliant."
3. "O there is less to try our faith, In our mysterious creed, Than in the godless look of earth In these our hours of need."

### John Calvin:
1. "We have no reason to doubt that believers will derive, at least, equal advantage from their prayers, provided they do not cease to plead earnestly with God."
2. "If at any time God winks at the injuries done to us longer than we would wish, let us know that this is done with a fatherly intention‚Äîto train us to patience."

1. "And shall not God, etc. Much more then, since God is not an unjust judge, since the widow is not a forsaken one, but his elect, will He hear importunate prayer."
2. "Who cry to him day and night. An exhortation to importunate prayer, as well as a prediction that God‚Äôs elect will not fail to offer it."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "And he is longsuffering (ŒºŒ±Œ∫œÅŒøŒ∏œÖŒºŒµ). This present active indicative comes in awkwardly after the aorist subjunctive œÄŒøŒπŒ∑œÉŒ∑ after ŒøœÖ ŒºŒ∑, but this part of the question is positive."
2. "God delays taking vengeance on behalf of his people, not through indifference, but through patient forbearance."

3. "Delays his coming, and the execution of vengeance, as on the Jewish nation, so upon the whole world of the ungodly, till his elect are gathered in from among them."

### John Wesley:

3. "Though he bear long with them -- Though he does not immediately put an end, either to the wrongs of the wicked, or the sufferings of good men."
