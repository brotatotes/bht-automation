# Luke 18:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the Son of man comes, will He find faith upon the earth? Even though God has shown both His patience and justice, there will be a scarcity of true believers when He remarkably appears against their enemies. It is important to remember that His avenging and victorious return is still in the future after many centuries. Nevertheless, the question remains: Will persevering faith be found in response to the persistent widow's parable? The answer depends on whether those enduring trials and delay continue to have confidence in God's providence and persevere in prayer.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἐν τάχει will not bear the meaning ‘ swiftly ,’ i.e. ‘ suddenly, when it comes ,’ but (see reff.) is  shortly soon, speedily, as E. V."
2. "This can hardly be, as Meyer interprets it, that the painful thought suddenly occurs to the Lord, how many there will be even at His coming who will not have received Him as the Messiah: for  ἡ πίστις  , though ‘faith’ generally, is yet here faith  in reference to the object of the parable faith which has endured in prayer without fainting."
3. "Or the meaning may be general and objective; as in reff."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Yet ere the Son of man comes to redress the wrongs of His Church, so low will the hope of relief sink, through the length of the delay, that one will be fain to ask, Will He find any faith of a coming avenger left on the earth?"
2. "That in these circumstances importunate, persevering prayer for deliverance is the Church's fitting exercise."
3. "Notwithstanding every encouragement to this, so long will the answer be delayed, while the need of relief continues the same, and all hope of deliverance will have nearly died out, and 'faith' of Christ's coming scarcely to be found."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He will surely vindicate them, and that at a time, perhaps, when they were nearly ready to give over and to sink into despair."
2. "The danger is not that 'God' will be unfaithful - he will surely be true to his promises; but the danger is that his elect - his afflicted people - will be discouraged; will not persevere in prayer; will not continue to have confidence in him."
3. "This question implies that 'in' those trials many professed disciples might faint and turn back, and many of his 'real' followers almost lose sight of this great truth, and begin to inquire whether God would interpose to save them."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Nevertheless. Notwithstanding God is certain to vindicate, will the Son of man find on earth a persistence in faith answering to the widow 's?

### John Calvin:
1. "He intended to obviate an offense which we are daily apt to take, when we see all things in shameful confusion."
2. "They who do nothing but murmur against the Lord in their hearts, and who allow no place for his providence, cannot reasonably expect that the Lord will assist them."
3. "Christ expressly foretells that, from his ascension to heaven till his return, unbelievers will abound; meaning by these words that, if the Redeemer does not so speedily appear, the blame of the delay will attach to men."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The avenging belongs to the coming of the Son of man, which is still future after eighteen centuries."
2. "The trials of the faith and patience of the church during the Lord's delay will be so great as to make it doubtful whether such importunity for the Lord's return will be the rule in the day of His appearing."
3. "The parable consists in this, that the two persons represent two classes."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Either will make sense though not quite the same sense."
2. "The use of αρα before ευρησε seems to indicate a question expecting a negative answer as in Acts 8:30; Romans 14:19."
3. "But here αρα comes in the middle of the sentence instead of near the beginning, an unusual position for either inferential αρα or interrogative αρα."

### John Gill:
1. "He will avenge them speedily, as he did in a few years after the death of Christ, when God's elect among the Jews were singled out, and gathered in from them, and were delivered from their persecutors, and saved from temporal ruin and destruction." 
2. "There will then be little of the doctrine of faith, and less of the grace of faith, and still less of the exercise of faith, particularly in prayer, and especially about the coming of Christ; it will be little thought of, and expected, or faith little exercised about it." 
3. "They seem to regard the first coming of the Messiah: and which was true with respect to the majority of their nation; and the same holds good with regard to his second coming."

### John Wesley:
1. "Yet when the Son of man cometh, will he find faith upon earth."
2. "Yet notwithstanding all the instances both of his long suffering and of his justice."
3. "Whenever he shall remarkably appear, against their enemies in this age or in after ages, how few true believers will be found upon earth!"
