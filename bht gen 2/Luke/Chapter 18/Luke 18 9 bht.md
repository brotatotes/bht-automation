# Luke 18:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Pharisee in this passage was not a hypocrite but genuinely believed in his own righteousness. He placed his trust in himself, boasting about his outward acts of holiness and religious obligations. He considered himself righteous and saw no need for repentance. He sincerely believed that he was justified before God and boldly expressed this in his prayer to God. However, it is important to recognize that true righteousness comes from God alone, and relying on our own merits can lead to pride and arrogance.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It was concerning them, it is true: but this word expresses that it was spoken to them."
2. "The usage of πρός in Luk 18:1 is no example for the sense concerning, for it is not there so used of persons, but with a neuter article and infinitive."
3. "πεποιθήκεισαν ἐφ 'ἑαυτοῖς, not, 'were persuaded of themselves,' but as E. V., trusted in themselves."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They trusted in their outward conformity to the ceremonies of the law. They considered all who did not do that as sinners. This, moreover, is the true character of self-righteousness."
2. "Men of that stamp always despise all others. They think they are far above them in holiness, and are disposed to say to them, Stand by thyself, for I am holier than thou."
3. "True religion, on the contrary, is humble. Those who trust in Christ for righteousness feel that 'they' are, in themselves, poor, and miserable, and guilty, and they are willing to admit that others may be much better than themselves."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Despised [εξουθενουντας] . Lit., made nothing of. Rev., set at nought."
2. "Others [τους λοιπους] . The expression is stronger. Lit., the rest."
3. "They threw all others beside themselves into one class. Rev., correctly, all others."

### John Calvin:
1. "No disease is more dangerous than arrogance; and yet all have it so deeply fixed in the marrow of their bones, that it can scarcely be removed or extirpated by any remedy."
2. "Though men are carried away by their ambition, yet when we come into the presence of God, all presumption ought to be laid aside; and yet every man thinks that he has sufficiently humbled himself, if he only presents a hypocritical prayer for forgiveness."
3. "It is impossible that he who deceives himself with vain confidence should not lift himself up above his brethren. Nor is it wonderful that it should be so; for how should that man not despise his equals, who vaunts against God himself?"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Set all others at naught." 
2. "A late verb εξουθενεω, like ουδενεω, from ουθεν (ουδεν), to consider or treat as nothing." 
3. "In LXX and chiefly in Luke and Paul in the N.T."

### John Gill:
1. "The ground of their trust and confidence were themselves, their hearts, and the supposed goodness of them, their outward holiness, their moral behavior, their duties, and good works, their almsdeeds, and religious exercises, their ceremonial observances, and fleshly privileges..."
2. "Such trust and confidence must be very vain, and arise from ignorance; from ignorance of God, of the perfection of his justice, and of the nature of his righteous law; and of themselves, of the impurity of their hearts, and the imperfection of their obedience."
3. "They made nothing of them, had them in no account; treated them as persons unworthy of the regard of God, and not fit to stand near them, or to be named with them."

### John Wesley:
1. "Not to hypocrites; the Pharisee here mentioned was no hypocrite, no more than an outward adulterer."
2. "He sincerely trusted in himself that he was righteous, and accordingly told God so, in the prayer which none but God heard."
