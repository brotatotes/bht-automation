# Luke 19:1 Commentary Help Text

Jesus, after healing the blind man near Jericho, entered the city but didn't stay. He swiftly passed through this populated city, where he had no miracles to perform or sinners to convert. The purpose of his passing through was simply to continue on his way.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. And Jesus entered ... - See the notes at Matthew 20:29. This means, perhaps, “he was passing” through Jericho when Zacchaeus saw him. His house was “in” Jericho.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Jericho. The city was close to the fords of the Jordan, on the frontier of Peraea, and on the richest plain of Palestine, abounding most in the choicest productions, especially balsam."
2. "...an appropriate seat for an officer of superior rank to preside over the collection of revenues."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is possible, indeed, that others entertained the same wish, but this man was most properly singled out by Luke, both on account of his rank, and on account of his wonderful conversion, which took place suddenly."
2. "Though faith was not yet formed in Zaccheus, yet this was a sort of preparation for it; for it was not without a heavenly inspiration that he desired so earnestly to get a sight of Christ."
3. "In this manner, before revealing himself to men, the Lord frequently communicates to them a secret desire, by which they are led to Him, while he is still concealed and unknown; and, though they have no fixed object in view, He does not disappoint them, but manifests himself in due time."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He had not yet passed entirely through, when He met Zaccheus."
2. "Hence it is not necessary to suppose that the house of Zaccheus was outside the city, on the way to Jerusalem."
3. "On Jericho, see Matthew 20:29."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Was passing through  (διηρχετο). Imperfect middle. Now Jesus was inside the Roman Jericho with the procession. 

### John Gill:
1. "After he had healed the blind man he met with near to Jericho, he entered into it, but made no stay in it, passed through it at once without stopping, though a very populous city."
2. "Here he had no work, either to perform miracles, or to convert sinners; though both, before he entered, and after he passed through it."
