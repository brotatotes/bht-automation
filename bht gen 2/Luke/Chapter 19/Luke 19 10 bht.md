# Luke 19:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The narratives in the Bible provide encouragement for unexpected conversions and illustrate fidelity and the different degrees of improvement of opportunities. Jesus, as the good Shepherd, seeks out the lost, which includes those who may have been great sinners. Zacchaeus, one of the lost sheep of the house of Israel, acknowledged himself as such and received the seeking Master. The phrase the lost refers to all the elect in Adam and their subsequent transgressions. Jesus came to seek and save that which was lost, exemplifying His mission to bring salvation to those in need.
