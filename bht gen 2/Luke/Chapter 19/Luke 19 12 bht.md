# Luke 19:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The nobleman in the parable represents the Lord Jesus Christ, who went into a far country, indicating his ascent to heaven, to receive his kingdom. By doing so, he dispels any notions that his royal authority was already established, and instead urges his disciples to cultivate hope and patience, for they must endure many toils before enjoying the glory they eagerly anticipate. This parable serves as a reminder that Christ's kingdom is not of this world and that he will return in the future, according to his word.
