# Luke 19:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By entrusting his disciples with different sums of money, Jesus teaches us that talents are given to be improved and that we are accountable for them. These talents symbolize the gifts and abilities that God has bestowed upon each of us. We are commanded to use these gifts to produce an increase for God's kingdom until Jesus comes again. It is essential to recognize the value of these talents and not allow them to remain dormant or unused. We must diligently trade with the resources God has given us, making the most of them until His return.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The giving the μνᾶ  to each, is a totally different thing from giving to one five, to another two, and to a third one talent." 
2. "The sums given are here all the same, and all very small."
3. "In Matt. the man given his whole property to his servants: here he makes trial of them with these small sums."

2. "The pounds here denote the talents which God has given to his servants on earth to improve, and for which they must give all account in the day of judgment."
3. "The direction was to use this money so as to gain 'more' against his return. So Jesus commands his disciples to 'improve' their talents; to make the most of them; to increase their capability of doing good, and to do it 'until' he comes to call us hence."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "His ten servants of his...the his is emphatic; lit., his own."
2. "The small sum astonishes us...the smallness of the amount corresponds to what is so carefully emphasized in our parable."
3. "The word occupy has lost the sense which it conveyed to the makers of the A.V. - that of using or laying out what is possessed."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ does not lay on all an equal charge of trafficking, but commits to one a small, and to another a larger sum of money."
2. "Till the last day of the resurrection Christ, in some respects, goes to a distance from his people, but yet that it would be highly improper for them to sit down in idleness and do no good."
3. "Whatever gifts the Lord has bestowed upon us, let us know that it is committed to us as so much money, that it may yield some gain; for nothing could be more unreasonable than that we should allow to remain buried, or should apply to no use, God’s favors, the value of which consists in yielding fruit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The number is given here, but not in the other parable; comp. the ten virgins, Matthew 25:1."
2. "To each one; not to each ‘according to his several ability’ (Matthew 25:5). In the other case the man is represented as committing his whole property to his servants; here the sums are ‘very little’ (Luke 19:17)."
3. "The Attic mina, which is probably meant, was the sixtieth part of a talent, and = $15-$17. The Hebrew mina was even smaller. The one equal official gift seems to be referred to here, not the spiritual ‘talents’ which differ in extent."

### John Wesley:
1. Trade till I come — To visit the nation, to destroy Jerusalem, to judge the world: or, in a more particular sense, to require thy soul of thee.
