# Luke 19:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parable highlights the significance of faithfulness and stewardship in the servants' gain, rather than mere profits. It emphasizes that our actions in the present directly impact our future rewards. The passages mentioned further underscore God's sovereignty and the imminent return of Christ. Like the king in the parable who returned as a king despite opposition, our Lord will come back to establish His kingdom. The parable reminds us to faithfully utilize the resources and opportunities entrusted to us, as we will one day give an account of how we have used them.
