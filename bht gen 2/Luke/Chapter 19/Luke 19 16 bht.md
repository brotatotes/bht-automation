# Luke 19:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The servant in question was set in a position of importance in the church, being one of the apostles of Christ. These apostles held the highest offices and worked diligently, using their abundant gifts to serve others. They acknowledged that Christ had authority over them and that they were accountable to Him. Therefore, when the servant refers to the gifts as thy pound, he acknowledges that they belong to Christ and the increase in their usefulness can be attributed to Christ's grace and strength working through them.
