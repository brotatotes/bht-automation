# Luke 19:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who exercise authority should do so with the grace of God, using their gifts and abilities to be good ministers of Christ. They ought to preach the pure Gospel of Christ, seeking to please the Lord rather than men. In return, the kingdom, dominion, and greatness of it will be given to them, and they will reign with Christ on earth for a thousand years.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "The ‘pound’ was a very small sum. High as the ministerial office is relatively in this world, in the other (and in comparison with the ‘talents’ even here) it is ‘very little;’ certainly is not the sole channel of blessing to the church."
2. "The reward corresponds with the kingly dignity of the returned Lord." (Comp. on the other hand Matthew 25:21.)


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Have thou authority  (ισθ εξουσιαν εχων). Periphrastic present active imperative. Keep on having authority. 

### John Gill:
1. "having the grace of God, which made him a good man, and gifts and abilities, which made him a good minister of Christ" 
2. "had preached the pure Gospel of Christ, and the whole of it, and sought not to please men, but the Lord only" 
3. "the kingdom, and dominion, and the greatness of it, will be given unto them; and they shall reign with Christ on earth a thousand years"
