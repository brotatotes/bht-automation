# Luke 19:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He who was next, though less useful, yet equally diligent and active, reflects the idea that different individuals in the ministry have varying degrees of impact and effectiveness. This reminds us that the usefulness of ministers of the Gospel is not the same, as they possess different gifts and abilities. However, their efforts, though faithful, may not always yield the same results or have the same level of impact.
