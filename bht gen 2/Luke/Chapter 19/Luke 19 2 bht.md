# Luke 19:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Zacchaeus, whose name means pure, was a chief publican, or commissioner of the customs. As he served in this role, he accumulated wealth. While it is rare for the rich to be called by grace, Zacchaeus serves as an example of the possibility. Despite the difficulties they may face, rich individuals can enter the kingdom of God. Zacchaeus was a person of prominence and substance among the publicans, having gained his wealth through his position.
