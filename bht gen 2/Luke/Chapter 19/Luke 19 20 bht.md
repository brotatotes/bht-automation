# Luke 19:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The servant in question acknowledged that his gifts were from the Lord and that he was entrusted with them. He faithfully kept them, even until the return of his Lord. However, instead of utilizing his gifts, he chose to wrap them up and let them lie dormant and unexercised. This speaks to the importance of recognizing the source of our gifts and actively utilizing them for Kingdom purposes.
