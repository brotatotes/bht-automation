# Luke 19:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ is compassionate towards those who are fearful, even if their fear is misguided and ill-grounded. As a merciful high priest, he shows compassion towards both the bodies and souls of individuals. He is generous, freely giving gifts, grace, and glory without imposing burdensome commands. Christ never sends his servants to battle at their own expense but equips them with the necessary grace and strength. In his abundant goodness, he rewards his faithful servants beyond measure, far exceeding their deserving.
