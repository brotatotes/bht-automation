# Luke 19:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The mention of the bank in this passage suggests the place of exchange or treasury. It is suggested that if the servant truly believed in a severe judgment, he should have been more diligent with his gifts. The mention of interest in this context does not approve of unlawful practices but rather highlights the servant's sloth and exposes his folly. Therefore, the message of this passage encourages diligence and wise stewardship of our gifts, while also emphasizing the importance of integrity in financial dealings, rejecting any form of oppression or dishonesty.

1. Luke 19:23.  Into the bank,  or, ‘a bank.’ The latter form opposes the view that the ‘bank’ represents the Church, and the putting of the pound there as resignation of the office.
	

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Then wherefore (κα δια τ). Note this inferential use of και- in that case."
2. "Into the bank (επ τραπεζαν). Literally, upon a table. This old word τραπεζα, from τετραπεζα (τετρα, four, πους, foot). It means then any table (Mark 7:28), food on the table (Acts 16:34), feast or banquet (Romans 11:9), table of the money-changers (John 2:15; Mark 11:15; Matthew 21:12), or bank as here. Our word bank is from Old English bench."
3. "With interest (συν τοκω). Not usury, but proper and legal interest. Old word from τικτω, to bring forth. In the N.T. only here and Matthew 25:27." 

### John Gill:
1. "Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank...had Christ been such a person as he represents him, he ought to have been the more diligent, and made the greater use of his gifts, since he knew that he would, in a rigid manner, as he suggests, demand an account of them."
2. "...that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury? not that Christ approves of usury in an unlawful way, by extortion, but reproves hereby the sloth of this man, and exposes his folly and wickedness upon his own principles."

### John Wesley:
1. "With interest — which does not appear to be contrary to any law of God or man."
2. "But this is no plea for usury, that is, the taking such interest as implies any degree of oppression or extortion."
