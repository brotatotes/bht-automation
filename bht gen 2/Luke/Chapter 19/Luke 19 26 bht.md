# Luke 19:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Having a receptive attitude and actively using the gifts and talents bestowed upon us is essential for spiritual growth and greater usefulness. Jesus emphasized that those who already possess and utilize their gifts will be given more, whereas those who neglect or hoard their talents will have them taken away. This principle, which applies to both natural and spiritual gifts, can be seen as the law of nature and grace, illustrating the importance of stewardship and faithful service in the kingdom of God.
