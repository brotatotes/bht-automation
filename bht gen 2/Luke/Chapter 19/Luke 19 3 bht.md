# Luke 19:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Zacchaeus had a strong desire to see Jesus, but his motive was different from that of kings and prophets. He wanted to see which one of the crowd was Jesus, but his small stature made it difficult for him to be seen among the crowd. It was not that Jesus was short, but rather that Zacchaeus was little in stature and unable to see over the heads of others in the crowd.

	determination not to be baulked was overruled for more than he
	sought.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "God makes use of every principle - of curiosity, or sympathy, or affection, or hope, or fear - to lead people in the way of salvation, and to impress truth on the minds of sinners."
2. "Jesus mingled with the multitude, not seeking distinctions of that sort, and perhaps, 'in appearance,' not distinguished from thousands that followed him."
3. "Little of stature - Short. Not a tall man."

### Marvin Vincent:

### Philip Schaff:

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He sought, He was seeking, conative idea."
2. "He wanted to see which one of the crowd was Jesus."
