# Luke 19:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Luke 19:31, Jesus sends his disciples to fetch a colt in a village. He anticipates that the owners of the colt will question why the disciples are untying it. Being omniscient, Jesus already knows this and instructs his disciples to answer that the Lord has need of it. The fact that the owners do not hesitate to give the colt suggests that they are familiar with Jesus and recognize him as the Lord. This passage highlights Jesus' divine knowledge and authority, as well as the willingness of believers to contribute to his mission.
