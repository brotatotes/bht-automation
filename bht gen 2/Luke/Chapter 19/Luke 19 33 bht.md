# Luke 19:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Lord Jesus referred to Himself as Lord in Luke 19:31 and Luke 19:34, with the understanding that His disciples would recognize Him as their master. The word Lord is also used in connection with the Roman emperor and the Hebrew Elohim (God). In Luke 19:33, some of the owners of the colt were present, but Christ, being God, had the power to persuade them to release the colt for His use. The presence of multiple owners could have made taking the colt more difficult.
