# Luke 19:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These Pharisees were among Jesus' followers, although their allegiance was questionable, as Luke suggests. They positioned themselves in the crowd during Jesus' procession, perhaps in a half-hearted attempt to support him. However, their true intentions were malicious, as they eagerly observed with the purpose of finding fault with Jesus. Unable to tolerate the extravagant praises bestowed upon him, they accused Jesus of arrogance and blasphemy. They feared that such declarations would incite rebellion and chaos, and believed it was Jesus' duty to suppress the unruly behavior of his disciples.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "These Pharisees could hardly in any sense be μαθηταί of Jesus."
2. "Their spirit was just that of modern Socinianism: the prophetic expressions used, and the lofty epithets applied to Him, who was merely in their view a διδάσκαλος , offended them."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Luke seems to imply by 'from the multitude' that these Pharisees were in the procession, perhaps half-hearted followers of the mob."
2. "John 12:19 speaks of Pharisees who stood off from the procession and blamed each other for their failure and the triumph of Jesus."
3. "These [Pharisees] may represent the bolder spirits of their same group who dared to demand of Jesus that he rebuke his disciples."

### John Gill:
1. "And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude,.... Who had placed themselves there, to watch and observe what was said, and done, that they might have something to reproach Christ with, expose him for, or bring as a charge against him..."
2. "Not being able to bear such high encomiums of Jesus, and such open and public declarations of his being the Messiah; and would insinuate, that it was blasphemy in them to say what they did, and pride and vanity in him to allow of it..."
3. "And that the consequence might be sedition, and tumult; and therefore it became him to check such a disorderly, noisy, evil, and dangerous practice."

### John Wesley:
1. Rebuke thy disciples — Paying thee this immoderate honour.
