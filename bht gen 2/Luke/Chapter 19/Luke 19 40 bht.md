# Luke 19:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the crowd praised Jesus, he declared, If these should hold their peace, the stones, which lie before you, would cry out. His earnest response emphasized the significance of this momentous occasion. Jesus implied that it was inconceivable for the praise to be withheld, as it was fitting for his arrival as the Messiah. The very stones themselves would testify to his glory if needed, highlighting that God's power would not be in vain, even if it required extraordinary means to bring forth praise.
