# Luke 19:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Approaching the city of Jerusalem, Jesus marveled at its grandeur and magnificence, beholding the multitude of houses and stately structures. But his heart was deeply moved, and as a man, he wept over it, knowing the impending calamities that would befall the city in the future. This display of tears is a testament to the genuineness of his human nature, as he fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah 53:5, showing his compassion for the wicked and encouraging others to mourn over Jerusalem.
