# Luke 19:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
But now they are hid from thine eyes - Having willfully rejected the Messiah, the inhabitants of Jerusalem were blinded to the truth. Their unbelief and rejection of Jesus resulted in the loss of their opportunity for peace and blessings. The knowledge of the things that belonged to their peace was a gift of God's grace, but they failed to recognize the signs of the times and rejected Him as their Messiah. As a consequence, they would not experience the peace and prosperity that would have been theirs had they received Jesus, even in a limited way.
