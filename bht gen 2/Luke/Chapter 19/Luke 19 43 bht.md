# Luke 19:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The impending judgment upon Jerusalem is foretold, with our Lord expressing sorrow and a wish for a different outcome. However, the judgment is inevitable. Jerusalem will be besieged, with a built wall surrounding it, leaving no hope of escape. The dreadful predictions of punishment will be fully and literally fulfilled. The Romans will cast up a trench, a mound with palisades, and build a wall around the city, causing its inhabitants to face unparalleled horrors and distress. This serves as a poignant reminder not to despise the Redeemer and His grace, lest we extinguish the light of salvation.
