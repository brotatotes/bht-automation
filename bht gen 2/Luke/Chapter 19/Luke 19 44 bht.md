# Luke 19:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The desolation that will come upon the city will be complete and devastating. It will be a visitation of wrath and vengeance, a consequence of their rejection of Jesus as the Messiah. The destruction will be so thorough that all the Jews who were gathered together for the passover at that time will witness it. Only three towers will initially remain, serving as a reminder of the city's former splendor, but they too will eventually be brought down.
