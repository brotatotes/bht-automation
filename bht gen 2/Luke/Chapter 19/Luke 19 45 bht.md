# Luke 19:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Jesus entered Jerusalem on His final visit, He made His way to the temple, a place where He had important work to accomplish in the few remaining days of His life. He immediately got to work, casting out those who were involved in corrupt practices within the temple. The presence of sellers and buyers of animals for sacrifice had turned the temple into a den of thieves, a place where people were motivated by greed rather than genuine worship. Jesus took action, overturning tables and seats, emphasizing His authority as the true Lord of the temple.
