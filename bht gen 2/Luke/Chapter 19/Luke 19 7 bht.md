# Luke 19:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The crowd of Jews accompanying Jesus to Jerusalem murmured at His choice to dine with Zacchaeus, a chief tax collector and notorious sinner. This action of Jesus shocked their sensibilities and caused them to question His holiness and wisdom. However, Jesus, in His infinite love and grace, saw beyond Zacchaeus's reputation and recognized the possibility of his repentance and salvation. This encounter highlights the transformative power of God's grace in the lives of even the most sinful individuals.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The murmurers are Jews who were accompanying Him to Jerusalem, on the road to which Zacchæus’s house lay."
2. "παρὰ ἁμ  .   ἀνδρί belongs to  καταλῦσαι."
3. "His profession in life, and perhaps an unprincipled exercise of his power in it, had earned him this name with his fellow-countrymen. Cf. his confession in the next verse."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Something more than 'eating with' such." 
2. "This mighty change, however, was all unknown to them. But they shall know it presently." 
3. "'Sinner' would refer both to his office, vile in the eyes of a Jew, and to his character, which it is evident was not good."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They regarded as especially wicked."
2. "The people seemed to forget that he might be a penitent, and that the Messiah came to save that which was lost."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. To be guest [καταλυσαι] . More correctly, Rev., lodge. See on ch. Luke 9:12. A sinner. See on ch. Luke 3:12.

### John Calvin:
1. "The world disregards the offer of the grace of God, but complains bitterly when it is conveyed to others."
2. "The conversion of Zaccheus was an astonishing work of God, and yet there was no good reason why Zaccheus should be marked with infamy."
3. "With such magnanimity ought all his ministers to be endued, as to think more highly of the salvation of one soul than of the murmurs which all ignorant persons may utter, and not to desist from their duty, even though all their actions and words may expose them to reproaches."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Scarcely the disciples, but the crowd of Jews, among whom doubtless were many priests, since Jericho was a priestly city." 
2. "Not necessarily to remain over night. The same word occurs in this sense in John 1:39, but the time of day is there specified, to show that it has that meaning." 
3. "Zaccheus, as a publican, would be thus termed, whatever his character had been. Especially in a priestly city like Jericho would the chief publican be an object of scorn. But his own confession (Luke 19:8) implies that he deserved the name."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Murmured (διεγογγυζοντο). Imperfect middle of this compound onomatopoetic word δια-γογγυζω. In Luke 5:30 we have the simple γογγυζω, a late word like the cooing doves or the hum of bees."
2. "This compound with δια- is still rarer, but more expressive."
3. "Jesus was the hero of this crowd from Galilee on their way to the passover. But here he had shocked their sensibilities and those of the people of Jericho by inviting himself to be the guest of this chief publican and notorious sinner who had robbed nearly everybody in the city by exorbitant taxes."

### John Gill:
1. "The pharisaical sort, the priests and Levites, of which there were great numbers in Jericho... They all murmured; as the Scribes and Pharisees did, at his eating with publicans and sinners"
2. "Saying, that he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner; a notorious one, an abandoned profligate creature; one of the worst of sinners, as being a publican, and the chief of them"
3. "They thought it was not agreeable to the character of an holy man, and a venerable prophet, which Christ bore, to go into such a man's house, eat at his table; and have familiar conversation with him"

### John Wesley:
1. They all murmured — All who were near: though most of them rather out of surprise than indignation.
