## BHT:
Zacchaeus took a deliberate stand and addressed Jesus, saying, Look, Lord, I give. This was not just a casual statement, but a clear determination to act immediately and fulfill his pledge.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Our Lord’s answer, σήμερον … τῷ οἴκῳ τούτῳ, looks as if He were just entering the house, not just leaving it; and the σήμ. must be the same with that in Luke 19:5."
2. "σταθείς has something formal and pre-determined about it: he stood forward, with some effort and resolve."
3. "Zacchæus may well have heard of that parable from one of his publican acquaintances, or perhaps repentance may have led him at once to this act of self-denial."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Lord—Mark how frequently Luke uses this title, and always where lordly authority, dignity, or power is intended."
2. "if I have—that is, 'so far as I have,' for evidently the 'if' is so used (as in Philippians 4:8)."
3. "voluntarily determines to give up all that was ill-gotten, quadrupled. He gratefully addressed this to the 'Lord,' to whom he owed the wonderful change."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This was not a proclamation of his 'own' righteousness, nor the 'ground' of his righteousness, but it was the 'evidence' of the sincerity of his repentance." 
2. "A man who has hoarded ill-gotten gold, if he becomes a Christian, will be disposed to do good with it. A man who has injured others...must, if he be a Christian, be willing, as far as possible, to make restoration." 
3. "The sincerity of Zacchaeus’ repentance was manifest by his being willing to make restoration as great as if it had been proved against him, evincing 'his sense' of the wrong, and his purpose to make full restitution."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He was like the Pharisee in attitude, but not in spirit."
2. "Zacchaeus' statement is not a vindication, but a vow. 'I now give by way of restoration.'"
3. "It is an odd coincidence, nothing more, that the fig - mulberry (sycamore) should occur in connection with the fig - shewer (sycophant)."

### John Calvin:
1. "The conversion of Zaccheus is described by fruits and outward signs." 
2. "A man might indeed bestow all his goods on the poor, and yet his generosity might be of no value in the sight of God; but, though no mention is here made of inward repentance, yet Luke means that the godly zeal, which he commends in Zaccheus, proceeded from that living root." 
3. "Zaccheus devotes the half of his goods to God in such a manner, as to give, at the same time, compensation for whatever wrongs he has done; and hence we infer that the riches which he possessed were not the fruit of dishonest gain."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And Zaccheus stood. The same word as in chap. Luke 18:11. Here it implies that he came forward and took a stand, in a formal way with joyful decision."
2. "The half of my goods I give to the poor. It is improbable that Zaccheus had already done so; this is the announcement of his purpose."
3. "I restore fourfold. Restitution from double to fivefold, was commanded in the case of theft (Exodus 22:1-7); hence this is, by implication, a confession of theft."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "If I have wrongfully exacted aught of any man. A most significant admission and confession."
2. "Restitution is good proof of a change of heart."
3. "Without this the offer of Zacchaeus to give half his goods to the poor would be less effective."

### John Gill:
1. "And Zacchaeus stood.... and said unto the Lord... behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give unto the poor." 
2. "to give a tenth part, was reckoned a medium... and I restore him fourfold: the same that was done in case of sheep stealing."
3. "This was done by Zacchaeus, to show the truth and reality of his repentance."

### John Wesley:
1. And Zaccheus stood — Showing by his posture, his deliberate, purpose and ready mind, and said, Behold, Lord, I give - I determine to do it immediately.
