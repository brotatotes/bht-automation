# Luke 19:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Salvation is proclaimed by the Gospel and directed to men as a way to salvation. Zaccheus, as a son of Abraham, has availed himself of his Jewish rights by receiving the Lord in faith and humility. His faith is commendable, and through it, his good works become acceptable to God. It was not the promised restitution that brought salvation, but rather Zaccheus' belief in and acceptance of Christ. As a result, he is now considered a son of Abraham, standing in the footsteps of faithful believers.
