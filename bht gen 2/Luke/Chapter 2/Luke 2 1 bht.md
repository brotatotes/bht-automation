# Luke 2:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During the time of Caesar Augustus, the second emperor of Rome, a decree was issued for a census to be taken, ensuring that all the world would be taxed. This decision had been determined by Augustus many years prior, but was postponed due to unrest in the empire. Yet, it was precisely at this time, under the rule of Augustus and during a period of peace, that the Messiah, the King of kings, was born. This series of events demonstrates the remarkable intervention of divine providence, fulfilling the prophecy spoken of centuries before.

	register themselves.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It should have been rendered 'the whole land' - that is, the whole land of Palestine."
2. "The 'whole land' is mentioned to show that it was not 'Judea' only, but that it included also 'Galilee,' the place where Joseph and Mary dwelt."
3. "This is not the meaning of the original word here. It means rather to 'enroll,' or take a 'list' of the citizens, with their employments, the amount of their property, etc., equivalent to what was meant by census."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Decree [δογμα]...Hence, strictly, a personal opinion; and, as the opinion of one who can impose his opinion authoritatively on others, a decree."
2. "The phrase was originally used by the Greeks to denote the land inhabited by themselves, in contrast with barbarian countries; afterward, when the Greeks became subject to the Romans, the entire Roman world; still later, for the whole inhabited world."
3. "The word means properly to register or enter in a list. Commentators are divided as to whether it refers to an enrollment for taxation, or for ascertaining the population."

### John Calvin:
1. "We must not attend merely to the events themselves. We must remember also the prediction which was uttered by the prophet many centuries before. A comparison will clearly show it to have been accomplished by the wonderful Providence of God."
2. "Nor is the Providence of God less wonderful in employing the mandate of a tyrant to draw Mary from home, that the prophecy may be fulfilled."
3. "Thus we see that the holy servants of God, even though they wander from their design, unconscious where they are going, still keep the right path, because God directs their steps."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Such an enrolment was like a modem census; but as the ultimate purpose was taxation, there was a record of property."
2. "Luke, therefore, might properly use this term, even though at the time there was no avowal of the proposed taxing."
3. "At the death of Augustus a paper prepared by him, containing full statistics of the empire, was read before the Roman Senate. This implies a census of the population of Judea some time before the death of Augustus (A. D. 14 )."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "No such decree was given by Greek or Roman historians and it was for long assumed by many scholars that Luke was in error."
2. "But papyri and inscriptions have confirmed Luke on every point in these crucial verses Luke 2:1-7."
3. "It was a census, not a taxing, though taxing generally followed and was based on the census."

### John Gill:
1. "That there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus; second emperor of Rome...by him a decree was made and published, that all the world should be taxed." 
2. "Such an enrolment had been determined on by Augustus, when at Tarracon in Spain, twenty-seven years before; but he was diverted from it by some disturbances in the empire, so that it was deferred to this time, in which there was a remarkable interposition of divine providence."
3. "Now at the time of this enrolment, and under this august emperor, and when the whole world was in a profound peace, was the Messiah born, the King of kings, and the only potentate; the Shiloh, the peaceable and prosperous, the Prince of Peace, and Lord of life and glory."
