# Luke 2:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The angel's description guided the shepherds to the stable or cave where the newborn Savior lay, wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger. It was through this seemingly insignificant sign that they would know they had found Him. This contrast between the grandeur of the angel's words and the lowly condition of the child highlighted the amazing contrasts that mark His life and mission. By directing the shepherds to the humble location of the Savior, the angel ensured that their faith would not waver and that they would embrace Him in this meek state.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "[The shepherds] seem to have known the spot [of the stable or cave] somehow by the angel’s description." 
2. "The angel in giving the sign, generalizes the term 'the child;' the shepherds were to know the truth of his words by finding a child wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The sign was to consist, it seems, solely in the overpowering contrast between the things just said of Him and the lowly condition in which they would find Him."
2. "Thus early were these amazing contrasts, which are His chosen style, held forth."

### Albert Barnes:
1. This shall be a sign ... - The evidence by which you shall know the child is that you will find him wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Sign [σημειον] . See on Matthew 11:20. The babe [βρεφος] . See on 1 Peter 2:2. Rev., properly, "a babe." No article.

### John Calvin:
1. "That the mean and despicable condition in which Christ was might not deter the shepherds from believing in Christ, the angel tells them beforehand what they would see."
2. "Sending down to us from heaven the word of the Gospel, he enjoins us to embrace Christ crucified, and holds out to us signs in earthly and fading elements, which raise us to the glory of a blessed immortality."
3. "But if the stable gave no offense whatever to the shepherds, so as to prevent them from going to Christ to obtain salvation, or from yielding to his authority, while he was yet a child; no sign, however mean in itself, ought to hide his glory from our view, or prevent us from offering to him lowly adoration, now that he has ascended to heaven, and sits at the right hand of the Father."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "No sign had been asked for... The dispensation of faith is beginning."
2. "A babe. Not 'the babe.' They were to look for a child born that day, wrapped and lying in a manger. There could be but one such."
3. "A manger, not 'the manger.' This implies that the place was not one well known to the shepherds... Some suppose that a secret influence guided them to the spot."

### John Gill:
1. "This sign would distinguish the newborn Savior from all others."
2. "Had not the angel given them this direction, they would never have thought to have looked for, and found: him in such a place."
3. "By this means this objection was prevented, and this stumbling block was removed out of the way, and they were prepared to see him, embrace, and believe in him, in this mean condition."
