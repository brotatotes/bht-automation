# Luke 2:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The multitude of angels that appeared were like an army from heaven, sent to minister, protect, and defend God's people. They are called a heavenly host because they dwell in heaven and are distinct from earthly hosts and armies. They praised and worshiped God, just as they did when the Son of God was incarnated. Their presence and message were a manifestation of divine splendor and a demonstration of God adorning His Son.
