# Luke 2:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The shepherds, known for their piety and expectation of the Messiah, wasted no time in seeking out the newborn Savior. Their immediate response reflects their faith and eagerness to witness what the Lord had made known to them. Just as the angels who constantly serve and obey God, the shepherds were obedient to the divine call to go to Bethlehem. It is clear that God intended for the shepherds to visit and provided them with both the guidance of an angel and a sign to recognize the newborn Savior.
