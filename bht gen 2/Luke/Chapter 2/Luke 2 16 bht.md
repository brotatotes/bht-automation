# Luke 2:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The shepherds wasted no time and hurriedly went to the city, driven by the extraordinary nature of the vision and the significance of the news they had received. Following the angel's guidance, they eventually found Mary, Joseph, and the baby in Bethlehem, exactly as they had been directed: in an inn and specifically in a stable within the inn. The couple had placed the newborn in a manger, wrapped in swaddling clothes, as Mary had done immediately after giving birth, due to the lack of space in the inn.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "with haste—Compare Luke 1:39; Matthew 28:8 ("did run"); John 4:28 ("left her water-pot," as they do their flocks, in a transport)." 
2. "found Mary, &c.—'mysteriously guided by the Spirit to the right place through the obscurity of the night' [OLSHAUSEN]." 
3. "a manger—'the manger,' as before."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Found (ajneuran). Only here and Acts 21:4. Ana indicates the discovery of the facts in succession."
2. "Mary and Joseph and the babe. Each has the article, pointing to the several parties already referred to."

### John Calvin:
1. "The glory of God was so fully before their eyes, and reverence for his Word was so deeply impressed upon their minds, that the elevation of their faith easily rose above all that appeared mean or despicable in Christ."
2. "And the only reason why our faith is either retarded or driven from the proper course, by some very trifling obstacles, is, that we do not look steadfastly enough on God, and are easily 'tossed to and fro.'"
3. "If this one thought were entirely to occupy our minds, that we have a certain and faithful testimony from heaven, it would be a sufficiently strong and firm support against every kind of temptations, and will sufficiently protect us against every little offense that might have been taken."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Found, suggesting previous search."
2. "Mary and Joseph Her name naturally comes first, as the mother, but especially in view of the peculiar nature of her motherhood."
3. "In the manger: the one they had sought as the sign."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "With haste (σπευσαντες). Aorist active participle of simultaneous action."
2. "Found (ανευραν). Second aorist active indicative of a common Greek verb ανευρισκω, but only in Luke in the N.T."
3. "The compound ανα suggests a search before finding."

### John Gill:
1. "The wonderfulness of the vision, the importance of the thing related, the eagerness of their spirits to see the thing that was told them, put them on making quick dispatch, and hastening to the city with all speed."
2. "As they had been directed by the angel, in the city of Bethlehem, in an inn there, and in a stable in the inn."
3. "Mary had put it as soon as born, and had wrapped it in swaddling clothes; because there was no room in the inn, and as the angel had told them they should find it."
