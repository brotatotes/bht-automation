# Luke 2:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This was the first enrollment that took place while Cyrenius was governor of Syria. It is believed that this enrollment occurred around the time of the birth of Jesus, although the actual taxation itself may have been carried out later under the rule of Quirinius. The region of Syria, which included Judea, had a significant influence on the Jewish nation, sharing similarities in areas such as tithes and the observance of the Sabbath. The accuracy of Luke's account is supported by historical records and established census practices in Egypt that date back to the same time period.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "This registration was previous to Cyrenius being governor of Syria."
3. "But it is perhaps better to suppose, with others, that the registration may have been ordered with a view to the taxation, about the time of our Lord's birth, though the taxing itself—an obnoxious measure in Palestine—was not carried out till the time of Quirinus."
