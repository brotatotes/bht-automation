# Luke 2:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Just as the shepherds glorified and praised God for the birth of the Messiah, we too should marvel at the grace and honor bestowed upon us. Let us remember the exact agreement between the angel's message and the things that we have heard, for in doing so, we strengthen our faith and bring out the truth of God within us. May our zeal in glorifying and praising God be a reproach to our own ingratitude and a testament to the power of Christ's birth and resurrection in raising us to God.
