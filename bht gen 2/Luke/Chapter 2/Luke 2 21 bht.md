# Luke 2:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The act of circumcision was not necessary for Jesus because He was sinless; however, it was a way for His parents to fulfill their obligation to the law. By being circumcised, Jesus displayed His obedience to the law and acknowledged His identity as a descendant of Abraham. This act also carried a deeper significance, as it represented the dedication of children to God. Just as circumcision was a common practice for the Jews, giving names to children at the time of circumcision was customary.
