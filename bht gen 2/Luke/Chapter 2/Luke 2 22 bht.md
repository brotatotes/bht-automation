# Luke 2:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During the days of purification, Mary and Joseph followed the law of Moses, which required a mother to be considered unclean for forty days after giving birth to a child. This practice was not because of any sin or guilt on their part, but rather a ritualistic purification according to the law. It is through this fulfillment of the law that Mary, as the mother of Jesus, demonstrated obedience and honored the customs of her people.

"By that Babe, in due time, we were to be redeemed, 'not with corruptible things as silver and gold, but with the precious blood of Christ,' and the consuming of the mother's burnt offering, and the sprinkling of her with the blood of her sin offering, were to find their abiding realization in the 'living sacrifice' of the Christian mother herself, in the fulness of a 'heart sprinkled from an evil conscience,' by 'the blood which cleanseth from all sin.'"
