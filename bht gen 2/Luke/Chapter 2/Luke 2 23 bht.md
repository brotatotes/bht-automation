# Luke 2:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Every male born to a Hebrew family is considered holy to the Lord. They must be devoted and consecrated to Him and redeemed, as a reminder of how God spared the firstborn of Israel during the plagues in Egypt. The Levites were exempt from this requirement, but all other firstborn males needed to be redeemed. This law foreshadows Jesus, who fulfilled the law by subjecting Himself to its requirements. He became our ultimate sacrifice and redeemer, freeing us from the bondage, curse, and condemnation of the law.
