# Luke 2:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the parents of our Lord brought him from Bethlehem to Jerusalem, their offering of a pair of turtle doves or two young pigeons spoke of their poverty. This offering, as specified in Leviticus 12:8, was suitable for those who were not able to bring a lamb. By presenting this offering, Mary and Joseph demonstrated both their obedience to the law and their humble circumstances. Overall, this act not only fulfilled the requirements of the law but also showcased the divine providence that surrounded the birth and life of Jesus.
