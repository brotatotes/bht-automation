Simeon received a unique revelation by the Holy Ghost, distinct from dreams, angelic appearances, or heavenly voices. Through this revelation, he was assured that he would live to see the Lord's Christ in the flesh.

This divine revelation brought Simeon great anticipation and assurance, as he awaited the fulfillment of God's promise.
