# Luke 2:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Spirit of God guided Simeon to the temple, leading him to the very moment when the Virgin Mary was about to present Jesus to the Lord. Simeon's steps were ordered by the Spirit, his coming into the temple prompted by a divine impulse. It was through the Spirit that Simeon recognized the Messiah, and by the Spirit that he was able to testify beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory that would follow. The Spirit's guiding hand ensured that Simeon fulfilled the customs of the law, in presenting Jesus and making the appropriate offerings for purification.
