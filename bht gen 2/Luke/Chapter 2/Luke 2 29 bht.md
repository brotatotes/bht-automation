# Luke 2:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Simeon's words express an intense adoration and praise for the Son of God, resembling the beauty and rapture found in the Psalms. In acknowledging Jesus as his Lord, Simeon recognizes His authority over life and death, seeing himself as a servant. His request to depart in peace reflects his deep desire to die with cheerfulness, having obtained all that he longed for in seeing and embracing the Savior. This desire for peace in death aligns with God's will and promises, unlike misguided desires for death driven by personal motives or sinful desires.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### John Gill:
1. "He acknowledges him as his Lord, and to have a despotic power over him with respect to life and death; and himself as his servant, which he was, both by creation and grace."
2. "what he requests of the Lord is that he might depart in peace; signifying his hearty desire to die, and with what cheerfulness he should meet death, having obtained all that he could wish for and desire, in seeing and embracing the Saviour."
3. "he greatly desired, and in which, he sinned not, because his request was according to the word of God: whereas often, desires of death are not only without the word of God, and due resignation to his will, and any regard to his glory, but to be rid of some trouble, or gratify some lust, as pride, revenge, &c."
