## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "seen thy salvation—Many saw this child, nay, the full-grown 'man, Christ Jesus,' who never saw in Him 'God's Salvation.'"
2. "This estimate of an object of sight, an unconscious, helpless babe, was pure faith."
3. "He 'beheld His glory'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. Thy salvation - Him who is to procure salvation for his people; or, the Saviour.

### John Calvin:
1. "By saving I understand the matter of salvation: for in Christ are hid all the parts of salvation and of a happy life."
2. "If the sight of Christ, while he was yet a child, had so powerful an effect on Simeon, that he approached death with cheerfulness and composure; how much more abundant materials of lasting peace are now furnished to us, who have the opportunity of beholding our salvation altogether completed in Christ?"
3. "His absence from us in body is of such a nature, that we are permitted to behold him sitting at the right hand of the Father. If such a sight does not bring peace to our minds, and make us go cheerfully to death, we are highly ungrateful to God, and hold the honor, which he has bestowed upon us, in little estimation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Thy salvation, i.e., the Messianic deliverance. He sees the world’s salvation, while beholding the form of a helpless child." 
2. "The prominence given by Simeon to 'salvation' rather than to the person of the child, confirms the early date of the song."
3. "All peoples, both Jews and Gentiles, as the next verse shows. The past tense is used from a prophetic point of view, as in the songs of Mary and Zacharias."

### John Gill:
1. "He is called 'God's salvation' because he is a Saviour of his choosing, calling, and constituting; whom he promised under the Old Testament dispensation and in the fulness of time sent."
2. "They see him in the glory of his person, the fulness of his grace, the suitableness and excellency of his righteousness, the efficacy of his blood, and the perfection of his sacrifice; and as an able, willing, complete, and only Saviour."
3. "Such a sight of him puts them out of conceit with themselves, and their own works of righteousness, as saviours; makes the creature, and all it has and does, look mean and empty; fills the soul with love to Christ, and a high esteem of him, and with joy unspeakable, and full of glory."

### John Wesley:
1. Thy salvation — Thy Christ, thy Saviour.
