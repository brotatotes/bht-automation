# Luke 2:31 Commentary Help Text

In this passage, it becomes evident that Jesus was divinely appointed to be a light for all people, including the Gentiles. The glory of Israel, already belonging to God, would shine even more magnificently through Him, particularly among those who believe. Simeon's understanding of Christ's universal presence expands our perception of His greatness. The breadth of God's plan, encompassing all nations and predetermined in His eternal purposes, is vividly portrayed. Through Jesus, God's salvation extends to the ends of the earth, serving as a beacon of hope and drawing people from every nation to Him.
