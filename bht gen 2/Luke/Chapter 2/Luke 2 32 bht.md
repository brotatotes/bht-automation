# Luke 2:32 Commentary Help Text

The Messiah is revealed as a light for the Gentiles, bringing salvation and illuminating their darkness.

This global mission of the Messiah is evident in Luke's writings. Ultimately, the Messiah's light will lead to the salvation of both the Gentiles and the people of Israel.
