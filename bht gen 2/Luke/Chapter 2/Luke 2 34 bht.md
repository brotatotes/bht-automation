# Luke 2:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This child is set for the fall and rising again of many. He will be a stumbling block to some, causing their destruction due to unbelief. However, for others, he will be a precious cornerstone, a foundation for their faith, lifting them up to great honor and glory. Through Christ, believers are raised from their lowly state of sin and death to a life of grace, holiness, and eternal life. His contradictory nature as both a stumbling block and a cornerstone unveils the true thoughts and intentions of people's hearts.
