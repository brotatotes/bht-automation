# Luke 2:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Luke's account does not mention the flight to Egypt or the reason why Joseph and Mary returned to Nazareth instead of Bethlehem. However, both the Gospel of Matthew and Luke do not provide a full account of this period. It is possible that they returned to Bethlehem at some point, as Bethlehem was their native city and Nazareth was their place of habitation. The two accounts of the Gospels complement each other in providing insights into the purification of Mary, the presentation and redemption of her firstborn, and the associated sacrifices and ceremonies.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This part of the gospel history is one where the Harmonists, by their arbitrary reconcilements of the two Evangelistic accounts, have given great advantage to the enemies of the faith."
2. "The only inference from these two accounts, which is inevitable, is that they are wholly independent of one another."
3. "In all the main circumstances of the Conception and Nativity they agree, or are easily and naturally reconciled."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Nothing is more difficult than to fix the precise order in which the visit of the Magi, with the flight into and return from Egypt, are to be taken."
2. "It is perhaps best to leave this in the obscurity in which we find it, as the result of two independent, though if we knew all, easily reconcilable narratives."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Luke has omitted the flight into Egypt recorded by Matthew; but he has not denied it, nor are his words to be pressed as if he meant to affirm that they went immediately to Nazareth."
2. "A parallel case we have in the life of Paul. When he was converted it is said that he came to Jerusalem, as if he had gone there immediately after his conversion Acts 9:26; yet we learn in another place that this was after an interval of three years, Galatians 1:17-18."
3. "In the case before us there is no improbability in supposing that they returned to Bethlehem, then went to Egypt, and then to Galilee."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Nazareth. See on Matthew 2:23.

### John Calvin:
1. "I am very far from agreeing with those who imagine that Joseph and Mary, after having finished the sacrifice of purification, returned to Bethlehem, to live there."
2. "Those persons are foolish enough to believe, that Joseph had a settled abode in a place where he was so little known, that he was unable to find a temporary lodging."
3. "We infer from it, that he never was an inhabitant of Bethlehem, though it was the place of his extraction."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth."
2. "It is, however, difficult to suppose that Luke had seen Matthew’s account, or vice versa."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Luke tells nothing of the flight to Egypt and the reason for the return to Nazareth instead of Bethlehem."
2. "But then neither Gospel gives all the details of this period."
3. "The two Gospels supplement each other."

### John Gill:
1. "Relating to the purification of Mary, and the presentation and redemption of her firstborn, and the sacrifices and ceremonies belonging thereunto." 
2. "Nor did they go now directly to Galilee; or, if they did, they soon came back again to Bethlehem, since here the wise men found them two years after."
3. "Bethlehem was their native city, the place of their birth, at least of their family; and Nazareth was the city of their habitation."
