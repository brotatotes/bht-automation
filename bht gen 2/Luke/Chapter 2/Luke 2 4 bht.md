# Luke 2:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus made his way up to Bethlehem, a city associated with King David. Both Joseph and Mary traveled to this place, perhaps for personal enrollment due to their royal lineage. This journey was not a matter of choice for Mary, given her condition, but rather a necessity. Bethlehem, being the birthplace of David, held great significance as the birthplace of the promised Messiah. Thus, it was not a coincidence that Jesus made his entrance into the world in this town.
