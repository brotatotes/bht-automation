# Luke 2:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
At the age of twelve, a boy would start observing the ordinances and become known as a son of the law. This event highlights the parents' religious devotion and serves as an example for other parents to nurture their children in the ways of the Lord. The parents likely took Jesus to the Passover in Jerusalem so that He could familiarize Himself with the religious traditions and obligations. It was customary for Jewish parents to train their children and familiarize them with religious practices from a young age.
