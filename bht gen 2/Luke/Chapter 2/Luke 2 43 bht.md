# Luke 2:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The child Jesus, having completed the days of the feast, remained behind in Jerusalem, unbeknownst to Mary and Joseph for some time. It was not disobedience on His part, but rather a deep desire to hear the teachings of the doctors of the law and engage in conversation with them. However, we should not take His action as an example for children to act without consulting or asking for permission from their parents. This incident shows us that Jesus, as the fruit of the womb, experienced and sanctified every stage of human life, except for old age.
