# Luke 2:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is noteworthy that the parents did not immediately realize that Jesus was missing, as they likely assumed He was still in the company with others from their village. The search for Jesus was thorough, but futile, as they looked up and down, back and forth, but He could not be found. When souls have lost sight of Christ, they should turn to their spiritual kindred and friends who are related to Christ to inquire concerning Him and expect to hear of Him there.
