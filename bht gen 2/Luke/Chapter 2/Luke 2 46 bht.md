# Luke 2:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In their search, after three days, they found him in the temple, specifically in an apartment of it, sitting in the midst of the doctors. While he did not engage in disputing, he participated in the customary practice of asking and answering questions, a common activity in these assemblies. It is possible that he was seated at the feet of these teachers, as learners typically sat, while the doctors themselves were on raised benches in a semicircular form.
