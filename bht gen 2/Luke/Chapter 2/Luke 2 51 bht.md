# Luke 2:51 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He willingly submitted himself to the authority of his parents, even though he had divine wisdom beyond their understanding. This humble and respectful obedience extended even to him working alongside his presumed father in their trade. Mary, his mother, cherished and stored these remarkable events in her heart, treasuring them as precious memories. And just as an esteemed rabbi recorded and recited scripture from memory, she, too, held onto these experiences, foretelling how Jesus' destiny would transcend her earthly grasp.
