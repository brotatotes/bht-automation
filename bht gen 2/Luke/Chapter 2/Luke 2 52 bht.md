# Luke 2:52 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In his journey of human development, Jesus grew not only in physical stature but also in wisdom. As the perfect example of humanity, Jesus's growth in wisdom was indicative of his increasing understanding and knowledge in both natural and spiritual matters. This growth in wisdom corresponded to the increase of his favor with God, as he continually demonstrated righteousness and holiness throughout his life. This suggests that even if one were to attain purity like Christ, there would still be room for growth in holiness and, consequently, an increase in the favor and love of God.

### Henry Alford:
1. "During these eighteen mysterious years we may, by the light of what is here revealed, view the holy Child advancing onward to that fulness of wisdom and divine approval which was indicated at His Baptism, by ἐν σοὶ εὐδόκησα."
2. "The growing up through infancy, childhood, youth, manhood, from grace to grace, holiness to holiness, in subjection, self-denial, and love, without one polluting touch of sin, this it was which, consummated by the three years of active ministry, by the Passion, and by the Cross, constituted 'the obedience of one man,' by which many were made righteous."
3. "He had emptied Himself of His glory: His infancy and childhood were no mere pretence, but the Divine personality was in Him carried through these states of weakness and inexperience, and gathered round itself the ordinary accessions and experiences of the sons of men."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "What seasons of tranquil meditation over the lively oracles, and holy fellowship with His Father; what inlettings, on the one hand, of light, and love, and power from on high, and outgoings of filial supplication, freedom, love, and joy on the other, would these eighteen years contain!"
2. "And would they not seem 'but a few days' if they were so passed, however ardently He might long to be more directly 'about His Father's business?'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In favour with God - That is, in proportion to his advance in wisdom."
2. "This does not imply that he ever lacked the favor of God, but that God regarded him with favor in proportion as he showed an understanding and spirit like his own."
3. "Happy are those children who imitate the example of Jesus - who are obedient to parents who increase in wisdom - who are sober, temperate, and industrious, and who thus increase in favor with God and people."
