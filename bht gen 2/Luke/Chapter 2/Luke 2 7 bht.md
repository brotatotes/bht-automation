# Luke 2:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The birth of Jesus was not surrounded by luxury or comfort. Instead, it took place in a humble setting, possibly a cave or a stall. This reflects the meanness of His birth and the low estate into which He came. The lack of room in the inn highlights the rejection and lack of welcome that Jesus would later experience in His ministry. This significant event, taking place in such a lowly setting, reveals the amazing grace of Christ, who willingly left His heavenly glory behind to become poor for our sake.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The combination of this consideration with the fact that brethren of our Lord are brought forward in this Gospel in close connexion with His mother, makes it as certain as any implied fact can be, that those brethren were the children of Mary herself."
2. "Ancient tradition states the birthplace of our Lord to have been a cave: thus Justin Martyr, Dial. 78, p. 175, ἐπειδὴ Ἰωσὴφ οὐκ εἶχεν ἐν τῇ κώμῃ ἐκείνῃ ποῦ καταλῦσαι , ἐν σπηλαίῳ τινὶ σύνεγγυς τῆς κώμης κατέλυσε · καὶ τότε , ὄντων αὐτῶν ἐκεῖ , ἐτετόκει ἡ Μαρία τὸν χριστόν , καὶ ἐν φάτνῃ αὐτὸν ἐτεθείκει."
3. "[T]his tradition is nowise inconsistent with our text for caves are used in most rocky countries as stables."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Had she then none to help her? It would seem so."
2. "The ancient tradition, that our Lord was born in a grotto or cave, is quite consistent with this, the country being rocky."
3. "But some 'guests went and came' not 'rudely,' but reverently. God sent visitors of His own to pay court to the new-born King."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The obvious meaning of the Bible is that she had; and if this be the case, the word 'firstborn' is here to be taken in its common signification."
2. "There was nothing special in the manner in which the infant Jesus was treated."
3. "It is worthy of our consideration that Jesus was born 'poor.' He did not inherit a princely estate...And in this we are shown that it is no dishonor to be poor."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Naturally found often in medical writings...Swaddle is swathel, from the verb to swathe." 
2. "Quite possibly a rock cave. Dr. Thomson says : 'I have seen many such, consisting of one or more rooms, in front of and including a cavern where the cattle were kept' (Land and Book ")." 
3. "The beautiful significance of the revelation of the infant Christ to shepherds watching the flocks destined for sacrifice needs no comment."

### John Calvin:
1. "We see here not only the great poverty of Joseph, but the cruel tyranny which admitted of no excuse."
2. "Joseph was not so devoid of feeling as to have no concern about his wife’s delivery."
3. "We see, at the same time, what sort of beginning the life of the Son of God had, and in what cradle he was placed."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Luke says nothing to justify the legends of a birth without pain, and the many other fancies which have been added to the story."
2. "Our Lord was born in a stable. This was purposed by God, however accidental the choice on the part of Joseph and Mary. His self-abasement is thus illustrated, the nature of His kingdom suggested, the lesson of humility enforced."
3. "The fact that changed the world was accomplished in a stable; but the world’s emperor must send forth a universal decree that this humble birth might be in accordance with prophecy; for He who lay in the manger there was King of kings."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "There is not a particle of evidence for the notion that Mary refused to bear other children because she was the mother of the Messiah."
2. "Wrapped in swaddling clothes. From σπαργανον, a swathing band. Only here and verse Luke 2:12 in the N.T., but in Euripides, Aristotle, Hippocrates, Plutarch. Frequent in medical works."
3. "In the inn. A lodging-house or khan, poor enough at best, but there was not even room in this public place because of the crowds for the census."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ, as to his human nature, was Mary's firstborn; and as to his divine nature, God's firstborn."
2. "This shows the meanness of our Lord's birth, and into what a low estate he came."
3. "It expresses his amazing grace, in that he was rich, yet for our sakes became poor."

### John Wesley:
1. "She laid him in the manger — Perhaps it might rather be translated in the stall."
2. "They were lodged in the ox stall, fitted up on occasion of the great concourse, for poor guests."
3. "There was no room for them in the inn — Now also, there is seldom room for Christ in an inn."
