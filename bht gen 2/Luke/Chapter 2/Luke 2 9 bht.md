# Luke 2:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The angel of the Lord, possibly Gabriel, approached the shepherds. His appearance was not ordinary, for he was surrounded by the glory of the Lord. This divine brightness served to capture the shepherds' attention and fill them with a great fear, as is often the case when encountering heavenly visions. The angel's presence revealed that God was at work, and it was through this encounter that the shepherds would receive the remarkable news of the Messiah's birth.
