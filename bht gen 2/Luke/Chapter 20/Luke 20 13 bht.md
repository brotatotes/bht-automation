# Luke 20:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
What shall I do? or what can be done more than has been done? This question inquires about the possible steps to take or the extent of actions required. I will send my beloved Son; the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who lay in his bosom, was the darling of his soul, and the delight of his heart. This statement highlights the deep love and cherished relationship between God the Father and his Son. Additionally, when people saw him, they failed to perceive his true worth and beauty, missing the remarkable qualities and attractiveness displayed by him.
