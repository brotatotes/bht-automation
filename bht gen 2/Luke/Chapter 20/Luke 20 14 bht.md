# Luke 20:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the individuals in the parable saw the Son of the vineyard owner, they said among themselves, This Son is his heir. They were envious of his privileged position and sought to obtain the inheritance for themselves. Their plan was to kill him so that the inheritance would become theirs—the nation, city, temple, and all its benefits. This mindset reflects the depraved desire of the human heart to possess what rightfully belongs to another and emphasizes the profound truth that God's inheritance is destined for His Son in our nature.
