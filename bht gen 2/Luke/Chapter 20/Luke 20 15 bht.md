# Luke 20:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people in the vineyard rejected and cast out the One who was sent to them, denying his authority and even questioning his nationality. They delivered him to the Gentiles, who were outsiders and not part of the chosen people of Israel. Ultimately, they put him to death, killing the Prince of life, the Lord of glory, and the heir of all things. These actions fulfilled the prophetic parallels found in Hebrews 13:11-13, 1 Kings 21:13, and John 19:17, underscoring the significance of this rejection and crucifixion.
