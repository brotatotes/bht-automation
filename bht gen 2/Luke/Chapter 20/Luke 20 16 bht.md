# Luke 20:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He will come and destroy the wicked tenants, who are represented by the scribes, chief priests, and elders. The tenants, who are the religious leaders, are being confronted with their own unrighteous actions. Despite their protests of God forbid, they are actually fulfilling the prophecies that speak of their rejection and killing of the Messiah, as well as the destruction of their nation, city, and temple. It is a chilling reminder of the consequences of their actions.
