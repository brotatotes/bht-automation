# Luke 20:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The quoted scripture in Luke 20:17 speaks to the rejection of the Messiah by the Jews, resulting in their downfall. This rejection is symbolized by the stone being rejected by the builders but becoming the cornerstone. The phrase He looked on them is used to capture their attention and emphasize the significance of the scripture. This rejection and exaltation of the Messiah is in perfect alignment with the prophecy and carries important consequences for the unbelievers.
