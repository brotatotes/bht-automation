# Luke 20:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The religious leaders were eager to apprehend Jesus and silence him because they were deeply troubled by his question about John's baptism, which left them speechless. They were also afraid of the people's reaction, fearing that they might revolt or protect Jesus. However, their rage stemmed from the realization that they were the ones who had mistreated God's servants and were now planning to kill His Son. Ultimately, their actions would result in their own downfall and the transfer of God's kingdom to others.
