# Luke 20:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The religious leaders approached Jesus and asked, Tell us, by what authority do you do these things? The mention of these things refers to the actions Jesus had taken, including clearing the temple. Luke adds these words to what Mark and Matthew have written. The reference to the authority by which Jesus acted may have included not just His teaching, but also His driving out the buyers and sellers from the temple, which affected the religious leaders and their profits. They questioned whether this authority came from God or man.
