# Luke 20:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The question of paying tribute to Caesar was not about the legality for paying taxes, but more about the Jews, who identified themselves as descendants of Abraham and God's chosen people, having to pay taxes to a pagan emperor. The question was posed with an emphasis on the phrase for us, as in, whether it was acceptable for the Jews to pay tribute to a foreign emperor. The Syriac and Persic versions refer to it as head money, suggesting that it was an annual tax.
