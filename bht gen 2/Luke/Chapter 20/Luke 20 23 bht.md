# Luke 20:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus astutely recognized the hidden motives behind the spies' question, perceiving that they were either seeking to trap him into making a statement against paying tribute to the Roman governor or to incite the Jewish people by affirming its lawfulness. In response, Jesus poses a rhetorical question, Why tempt ye me? revealing the deceptive nature of their inquiry and refusing to be ensnared by their craftiness.
