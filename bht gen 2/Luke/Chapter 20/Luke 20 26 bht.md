# Luke 20:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
His opponents were unable to seize Jesus' words before the people, just as they would later fail to do so in the presence of the Sanhedrin. Despite their efforts, they were unsuccessful in distorting his teachings and discrediting him. The way Jesus responded left them astonished, for he gave them no grounds to accuse him. As a result, they were silenced and compelled to retreat, defeated by his wisdom and insight.
