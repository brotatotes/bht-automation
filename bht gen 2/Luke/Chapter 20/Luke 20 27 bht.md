# Luke 20:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Sadducees, known for their disbelief in the resurrection, approached Jesus with a question in an attempt to challenge him. This particular sect denied the existence of angels and spirits, let alone the concept of resurrection. Their main subject of inquiry was a case they presented to Jesus, seeking his response to their long-standing conundrum.
