# Luke 20:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Deuteronomy 25:5, we encounter a law that addresses the circumstance of a man passing away without any descendants. In such a case, his brother is commanded to marry the widow, and the first child born to them is regarded as the deceased's and entitled to inherit his possessions. This law serves as a safeguard to ensure the continuation of a family lineage and the preservation of inheritance within the community.
