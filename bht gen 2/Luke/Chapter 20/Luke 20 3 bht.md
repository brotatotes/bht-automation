# Luke 20:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, Jesus skillfully handles his interrogators by responding to their question with another question. This serves two purposes: it avoids the trap they had set for him and it ultimately leads to the answer they were seeking. Jesus' reply is not impertinent, but rather a clever way to address their inquiry and navigate the tricky situation at hand.
