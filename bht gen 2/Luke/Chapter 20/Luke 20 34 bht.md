# Luke 20:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
People in this world marry and are given in marriage for the purpose of continuing the human race and ensuring that they have heirs to inherit their possessions after they have passed away. This is because all human beings are subject to death and mortality, and therefore the survival of the species depends on the ongoing reproduction and replenishment of individuals.
