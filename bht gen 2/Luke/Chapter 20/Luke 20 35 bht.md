# Luke 20:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who are deemed worthy to inherit the coming world do not achieve this through their own efforts or righteousness, but rather it is through the sacrifice and righteousness of the Messiah. This world they obtain is not the result of their works, but rather an inheritance received by faith. It is a world they enter into before the resurrection of the dead, experiencing the blessings and promises of God in the present.
