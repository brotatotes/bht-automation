# Luke 20:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who are raised to eternal life are described as being equal unto the angels, for they are now in a state where they cannot die anymore. They are not only children of God in terms of their character, but their very nature is transformed, making them true offspring of God. As such, they will no longer partake in marriage or be given in marriage, as the purpose of marriage will no longer be necessary in the future state where there are no more deaths.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The ἰσάγγ. γάρ εἰσιν is alleged, not as shewing them to be ἀπαθεῖς κ. ἀφιλήδονοι, but as setting forth their immortality."
2. "υἱοὶ θ. is here used, not in its ethical sense, as applied to believers in this world, but its metaphysical sense, as denoting the essential state of the blessed after the resurrection: 'they are, by their resurrection, essentially partakers of the divine nature, and so cannot die.'"
3. "When Meyer says that the Lord only speaks of the risen, and has not here in His view the 'quick' at the time of His coming, it must be remembered that the 'change' which shall pass on them (1Co 15:51-54) shall put them into precisely the same ἀφθαρσία as the risen."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Marriage is ordained to perpetuate the human family; but as there will be no breaches by death in the future state, this ordinance will cease."
2. "equal—or 'like.' unto the angels—that is, in the immortality of their nature."
3. "children of God—not in respect of character but nature; 'being the children of the resurrection' to an undecaying existence."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Equal unto the angels [ισαγγελοι] . Only here in New Testament.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For neither can they die any more... the same is true of unbelievers." 
2. "...their altered nature is introduced as a reason why they cannot 'die any more:' for they are equal unto the angels." 
3. "They are not simply sons of God in the moral sense, but are essentially 'partakers of the divine nature,' and hence free from death."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "Angels do not marry, there is no marriage in heaven."
3. "Sons of God, being sons of the resurrection (υιο θεου της αναστασεως υιο οντες). This Hebraistic phrase, 'sons of the resurrection' defines 'sons of God' and is a direct answer to the Sadducees."

### John Gill:
1. "Neither can they die any more...for they are equal unto the angels." 
2. "Being the children of the resurrection; as Christ was declared to be the son of God by his resurrection, so will they appear to be the children of God by their resurrection to eternal life."
