# Luke 20:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Moses, whom the Sadducees cited to counter Christ's teaching on the resurrection, actually affirmed it by declaring that the dead are raised. This truth was revealed to Moses at the burning bush, where he encountered the Lord and saw a fire that did not consume the bush. Moses understood that God is the God of the living, not of the dead, as evidenced by His identification as the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Therefore, the testimony of Moses and the other prophets confirms the reality of the resurrection.
