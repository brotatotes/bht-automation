# Luke 20:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers, after they have died, lead a heavenly life with God. Their life is concealed under the secret keeping of God, and their eternal existence is not determined by the perceptions of the flesh. In the sight of God, all creatures, whether living or dead, sustain a gracious covenant relation that cannot be dissolved. This understanding goes beyond previous arguments and emphasizes the faithfulness of God in preserving believers, even beyond human comprehension. It is truly remarkable and precious to consider the glimpses we have of the resurrection state.

### John Wesley:
1. "He is not a God of the dead, or, there is no God of the dead - That is, tho term God implies such a relation, as cannot possibly subsist between him and the dead; who in the Sadducees' sense are extinguished spirits; who could neither worship him, nor receive good from him."
2. "For as all the faithful are the children of Abraham, and the Divine promise of being a God to him and his seed is entailed upon them, it implies their continued existence and happiness in a future state as much as Abraham's."
3. "And as the body is an essential part of man, it implies both his resurrection and theirs; and so overthrows the entire scheme of the Sadducean doctrine."
