The scribes were pleased with how Jesus handled the argument with the Sadducees, as they enjoyed seeing Jesus triumph over them. Both parties were unable to respond to Jesus' words, leaving them defeated. Jesus baffled the Pharisees with his question about David and the Messiah, showing his authority and denouncing the scribes' corrupt teachings. The Pharisees, despite their hostility towards Jesus, admired his response and praised his reasoning.
