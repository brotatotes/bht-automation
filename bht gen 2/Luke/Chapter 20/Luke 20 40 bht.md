# Luke 20:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Pharisees, Sadducees, Herodians, and even the scribes were silenced in their attempts to challenge Jesus with their questions. Their boldness and courage faded away in his presence, and they no longer dared to ask him anything. The once confident and audacious leaders of the religious community were left speechless and humbled by Jesus' wisdom and authority. Only one of the scribes, perhaps feeling braver than the rest, dared to ask him a question shortly after.
