# Luke 20:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Pharisees and Scribes were engaged in a discussion about the identity of the Messiah, with one of the lawyers even agreeing with Jesus. Luke, who did not include this specific incident, indicates that Jesus was referring to the Pharisees when he mentioned they say. The term Christ here refers to the Messiah, and Jesus posed a thought-provoking question to challenge their understanding: How can Christ be David's son? This interaction highlights the importance of examining and understanding the Old Testament Scriptures and the testimony they provide through divine inspiration.
