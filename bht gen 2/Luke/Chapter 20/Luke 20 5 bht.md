# Luke 20:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people, caught in a heated debate, were reasoning with themselves and engaging in deep discussions. They debated the matter among themselves, reasoning after this manner. If they were to say that John's baptism was from heaven, then why did they not believe him? This question would be their greatest challenge, for their lack of belief would then have no justification.
