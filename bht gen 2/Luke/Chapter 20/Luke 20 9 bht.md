# Luke 20:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ illustrated the relationship between the leaders of Israel and the people through the parable of the vineyard. The vineyard represents the people of Israel, and the certain man or householder represents the Lord of hosts. The Lord planted the vineyard, symbolizing the establishment of Israel in the land of Canaan. The husbandmen, or spiritual guides, were entrusted with the task of tending to the people. However, over a long period of time, the leaders failed to fulfill their responsibility, resulting in the need for new leadership and judgment.
