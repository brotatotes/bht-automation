# Luke 21:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Jesus sat near the treasury, his gaze was fixed on the ground, but he lifted his eyes and observed the scene before him. The treasury was not positioned above Jesus, as he was right next to it, providing a clear view of the rich men who were casting their gifts into the treasury. This sight served as a momentary diversion, offering a respite from the intense strain of the preceding hours.
