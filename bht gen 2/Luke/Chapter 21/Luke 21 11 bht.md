# Luke 21:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
And great earthquakes shall be in various places, along with famines and pestilences are just a few examples of the fearful sights and signs from heaven mentioned. These signs encompass various aspects, including terrible things heard or seen, like thunderings, lightnings, and a voice heard in the temple saying, let us go hence. Moreover, there will be great signs from heaven, such as comets, blazing stars, and even a flaming sword. It's important to note that these signs are not limited to visual phenomena but can also involve terrors and terrifying events, as described in Josephus' writings.
