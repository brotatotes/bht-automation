# Luke 21:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Before all these events take place, there will be a time when you will face persecution and be brought before authorities. This persecution may involve imprisonment, flogging, or standing trial before courts and rulers. It will be a challenging time when your faith and commitment to Christ will be put to the test, but remember that it is for the sake of His name and the proclamation of the Gospel. Stay strong and continue to boldly profess and preach the name of Jesus, even in the face of opposition.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The prophecies...are a parenthetical warning of what shall happen before the τέλος." 
2. "Having stated, ἀρχὴ ὠδίνων ταῦτα, these things shall be the very beginning of the actual pangs themselves."
3. "The prophetic chronology is resumed from οὔπω τὸ τέλος...here, by distinct statement, πρὸ δὲ τούτων πάντων."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 12. brought before, &c.—The
	book of Acts verifies all this.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The passage in Matthew tells of what shall take place before the end comes, then in Matthew 24:7-8 of certain things which are 'the beginning of sorrows', actually a part of the final throes, introducing these as a proof that 'the end is not yet'." 
2. "Afterwards... 'then' introduces the prediction of persecution."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "But before all these things" - In Mark 13:8; Matthew 24:8 these things are termed "the beginning of travail." That may be the idea here. Plummer insists that priority of time is the point, not magnitude.
2. "Bringing you" - Present passive participle from απαγω, an old verb to lead off or away. But here the participle is in the accusative plural, not the nominative like παραδιδοντες (present active participle, delivering you up), agreeing with υμας not expressed the object of παραδιδοντες, "you being brought before or led off." 
3. "A technical term in Athenian legal language" - "A technical term in Athenian legal language" (Bruce).

### John Gill:
1. "Before all these things come to pass, they shall lay their hands on you." 
2. "Delivering you up to the synagogues, to be scourged there, or to the courts of judicature." 
3. "Being brought before kings and rulers, for my name's sake, for being called by his name, and calling upon it, for professing, and preaching his Gospel."

### John Wesley:
1. Mark 13:9.
