# Luke 21:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By bearing witness to the truth, believers will not only receive an opportunity to testify for their faithfulness to the Lord but also demonstrate the certainty of the words spoken by Christ. In the midst of opposition and persecution, their testimonies will serve as evidence and proof that they have preserved their souls and that those who oppose them are without excuse. Their encounters with resistance and adversity will ultimately strengthen and confirm their belief in the Gospel.
