# Luke 21:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When faced with questions or challenges, it is important to always be prepared to give an answer. This involves resolving in our hearts to have a rule to never deviate from. However, our preparation should not consist of meticulously studying and planning our words or responses. Instead, we should trust in the guidance of the Holy Spirit, avoiding the temptation to rely on our own wisdom or strategies. We can be assured that even in intimidating situations, God will give us the words to say.
