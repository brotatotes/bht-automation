# Luke 21:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus warns that his followers will face betrayal and persecution, even from those closest to them. Brothers will turn against brothers, parents against children. The intensity of the persecution is seen in the examples of Stephen and James, who were put to death for their faith. Ultimately, all of the disciples, except John, would face martyrdom. These words of Jesus remind us that following him may come at a great cost, but our ultimate hope lies in the promise of eternal life with him.
