# Luke 21:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage in Mark 12:42 tells the story of a poor widow who gave two mites, the smallest Jewish coin, into the temple treasury. It is noteworthy that the word poor is derived from a Greek word meaning someone who works for their living. The widow's act is considered significant because Jesus takes note of her sacrificial giving, valuing it over the larger, but less heartfelt, offerings of others. This act of the widow demonstrates that even the smallest acts of faith and love, when done with sincerity, carry great weight in the eyes of God.
