# Luke 21:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jerusalem is surrounded by armies, it is a clear sign that its desolation is near. The use of the present tense emphasizes the urgency of the warning. This indicates that there will be no escape or deliverance, making the destruction of Jerusalem inevitable. The siege was not lifted until the city was completely destroyed, which occurred about four years later. Thus, the fulfillment of this prophecy demonstrates the reliability of predictive prophecy, as foretold by the Lord Jesus. Christians, aware of these prophecies, wisely fled from Jerusalem to Pella before it was too late.
