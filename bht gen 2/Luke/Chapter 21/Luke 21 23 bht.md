# Luke 21:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
There will be an immense distress in the land of Judea, a time of tribulation like no other before or after, bringing miseries upon the people that cannot be fully expressed. This distress is not just a result of human anger, but also the righteous anger of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The distress on all the earth is not so distinctly the result of the divine anger, as that which shall befall this nation."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "woe unto—"alas for."
    	with child, c.—from the
    	greater suffering it would involve as also "flight in winter,
    	and on the sabbath," which they were to "pray" against
    	(Matthew 24:20), the one as more
    	trying to the body, the other to the soul."
2. "For then shall be
    	tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world, nor
    	ever shall be"—language not unusual in the Old Testament for
    	tremendous calamities, though of this it may perhaps be literally
    	said, "And except those days should be shortened, there should
    	no flesh be saved, but for the elect's sake those days shall be
    	shortened" (Matthew 24:21;
    	Matthew 24:22).
3. "Here in Matthew and
    	Mark (Matthew 24:24; Mark 13:22)
    	are some particulars about "false Christs," who should, "if
    	possible"—a precious clause—"deceive the very
    	elect." (Compare 2 Thessalonians 2:9-11;
    	Revelation 13:13.)"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Distress [αναγκη] . Originally constraint, necessity; thence force or violence, and in the classical poets, distress, anguish.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Upon the land, or 'earth.' This may be general, but as the direct reference is to the war under Titus, it more probably means: the land of Judea."
2. "If the wider sense be adopted, the particular distress (Divine retribution) is brought out in the clause: wrath unto this people."

### John Gill:
1. "There shall be great distress in the land; of Judea." 
2. "The distress was very great, and such a time of tribulation, as was never known since the beginning of the world, nor never will be the like."
3. "Their miseries are not to be expressed:and wrath upon this people; of the Jews; even the wrath of God, as well as of man, which came upon them to the uttermost."
