# Luke 21:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jerusalem was devastated during the siege, with over a million people perishing and nearly a hundred thousand sold into slavery, fulfilling the prophecy in a horrifying manner. The city itself was desecrated, Jews barred from entering, and a pagan temple erected on the sacred ground. However, there is hope in this darkness, as the times of the Gentiles, referring to their dominance over Jerusalem, will come to an end once the full conversion of the Gentiles is achieved.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Josephus (War, VI. 9.3) states that 1,100,000 Jews perished in the destruction of Jerusalem and 97,000 were taken captive. Surely this is an exaggeration and yet the number must have been large."
