# Luke 21:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Men's hearts failing them for fear, as they witness the signs in the sky, earth, and sea, causing them to swoon and expire with dread. These signs, which are the focus of their anticipation, include the impending events that will unfold on the land of Judea. The world, the inhabited earth, will experience the shaking of the powers of heaven, akin to the tumultuous billows of the sea.
