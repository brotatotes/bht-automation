# Luke 21:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The coming of the Son of man is something that will not happen until a specific time, as indicated by the phrase And then shall they see. This implies that the fulfillment of this event will be delayed. The promise of the second coming of the Son of man in glory is not something that will happen immediately. Instead, it is depicted as a future event, leaving the time element purposely vague.
