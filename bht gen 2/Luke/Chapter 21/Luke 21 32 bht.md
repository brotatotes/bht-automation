# Luke 21:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Verily I say unto you, this generation shall not pass away till all things be effected. This generation refers to the people living at that time. It is believed that the reference is to the destruction of Jerusalem as a type of the end of the world. The phrase till all things be effected suggests that all the events prophesied about the destruction of Jerusalem will come to pass before the passing away of that generation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 32. This generation—not "this
	nation," as some interpret it, which, though admissible in
	itself, seems very unnatural here. It is rather as in  :-.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This generation (η γενεα αυτη). Naturally people then living."
2. "Shall not pass away (ου μη παρελθη). Second aorist active subjunctive of παρερχομα. Strongest possible negative with ου μη."
3. "The reference, therefore, is to the destruction of Jerusalem regarded as the type of the end of the world."

### John Gill:
1. Verily I say unto you, this generation,.... :-. :-. All the Oriental versions read here as there, "all these things"; before related.

### John Wesley:
1. Till all things be effected — All that has been spoken of the destruction of Jerusalem, to which the question, Luke 21:7, relates: and which is treated of from Luke 21:8-24.
