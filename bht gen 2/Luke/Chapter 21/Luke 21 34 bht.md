# Luke 21:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Be on guard and watchful, for the anxieties and excesses of life have the power to dull the senses and make the mind unfit for spiritual matters. Do not be intoxicated with the cares of this world, for just as too much wine can cloud the body, excessive worldly preoccupations can cloud the soul. Be aware that indulging in these distractions can lead to ruin if one remains carnal and secure in their ways, unaware of the impending judgment or death that may come upon them unexpectedly.
