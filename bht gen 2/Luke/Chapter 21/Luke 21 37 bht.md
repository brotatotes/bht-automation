# Luke 21:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During the last week of His life, Jesus spent his days teaching in the temple, openly preaching the Gospel to the people. Every night, he would leave the temple and the city and find lodging on the Mount of Olives, most likely to pray for himself and his disciples. This was his constant method leading up to the feast of Passover, and it indicates how Jesus made the most of His time in Jerusalem. It is significant that after this particular period, he did not come back into the temple again.
