# Luke 21:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people in Jerusalem rose early in the morning to come eagerly to the temple to hear Jesus teach. His disciples were among those who eagerly came in the morning to listen to his instructions, valuing his teachings more than their own comfort and sleep. Let us follow their example, not hesitating to sacrifice unnecessary sleep in order to position ourselves before the Lord, ready to receive his word and seek the guidance of his Spirit.
