# Luke 21:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this particular incident, Jesus observed people making their offerings to God. Those who possessed great abundance gave a considerable amount, but it didn't affect their wealth significantly. However, in contrast to the others, a widow with very little resources gave everything she had. This act of sacrifice deeply impressed Jesus because it revealed the true heart of giving. It wasn't about the amount given, but rather the level of sacrifice involved. This widow's offering demonstrated complete reliance on God for her livelihood, which resonated with Jesus and served as an example of true devotion.
