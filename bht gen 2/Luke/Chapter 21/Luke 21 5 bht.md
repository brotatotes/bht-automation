# Luke 21:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As they discussed the temple, the disciples marveled at its magnificent construction, with its impressive array of goodly stones and remarkable gifts. The disciples couldn't help but admire the grandeur of the temple, including its intricately crafted marble, which shone brilliantly in the sunlight and gave the impression of a snow-covered mountain in the distance. This conversation took place as they were leaving the temple, still in awe of its beauty and splendor.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Goodly stones - Beautiful stones. Either referring to the large, square, and well-finished stones of which the eastern wall was built, or to the precious stones which might have been used in decorating the temple itself."
2. "Gifts - This word properly denotes anything devoted or dedicated to God. Anciently warriors dedicated to their gods the spoils of war - the shields, and helmets, and armor, and garments of those slain in battle. These were suspended in the temples."
3. "It would seem that something of this kind had occurred in the temple of Jerusalem, and that the people, to express their gratitude to God, had suspended on the pillars and perches of the temple gifts and offerings."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Stones. See on Mark 13:1." 
2. "Offerings [αναθημασιν] . Only here in New Testament. From ajnatiqhmi, to set up. Hence of something set up in the temple as a votive offering." 
3. "The word ajnaqema, (Galatians 1:8, Rev.), is the same word, something devoted, and so devoted to evil and accursed. Luke uses the classical form. The other is the common or Hellenistic form. The two forms develop gradually a divergence in meaning; the one signifying devoted in a good, the other in a bad sense."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The columns of the cloister or portico were monoliths of marble over forty feet high" (Plummer).
2. "The word αναθημα (here only in the N.T.) is not to be confused with αναθεμα from the same verb ανατιθημ, but which came to mean a curse (Galatians 1:8; Acts 23:14). So αναθεμα came to mean devoted in a bad sense, αναθημα in a good sense" (Vincent).

### John Gill:
1. "And as some spake of the temple,.... These were the disciples; Mark says, one of them; but it seems there were more than one; one might begin the discourse, and others join him."
2. "How it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts."
3. "This was as he went out of the temple."
