# Luke 21:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the near future, the temple will be completely demolished, with not a single stone left standing upon another. This prophecy will come to pass within a few years, causing great astonishment among the disciples who had just witnessed Jesus' triumphant entry into Jerusalem. The temple's destruction will be so thorough that even the smallest remnants will be thrown down. The approaching days will bring about the irreversible end of the temple as it currently exists.
