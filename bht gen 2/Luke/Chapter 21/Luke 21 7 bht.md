# Luke 21:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples, upon seeing the magnificent temple, inquired about its future destruction and the signs that would precede it. Luke's account alone serves as proof of his independence in providing this scene and dialogue. It is remarkable that Luke does not account for any different setting or hearing than the others. The disciples' question reveals their curiosity about the precise timing and signs associated with the temple's destruction. This clarifies that the discussion in this passage pertains to the temple's destruction, as mentioned in Matthew 24:3.
