# Luke 22:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Jews eat their bread without leaven to remember how they hastily left Egypt. This feast represents the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth that should be partaken in the Gospel feast. The Passover is called so because when God struck down the firstborn in Egypt, He spared the houses of the Israelites. It is noteworthy that in Matthew 26:17, the terms unleavened bread and Passover are used interchangeably.
