# Luke 22:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus instructed his disciples to enter the city and find a man carrying a pitcher, He did so with divine foresight, providing them with a sign to recognize the specific house where He would celebrate the Passover. This sign was not only a test of their faith and obedience but also revealed Jesus' omniscience and deity. By specifying the details of the encounter and the timing of fetching water, Jesus demonstrated his supernatural knowledge and wisdom.
