# Luke 22:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The master, in this context, refers to Jesus who instructs Peter and John to prepare the guest-chamber for the Passover meal. The term master used for Jesus is specific and significant, denoting his authority and eminence among his followers. The guest-chamber mentioned here is like an inn or a waiting place where travelers would rest, be refreshed, and partake in feasting. It is worth noting that the disciples were a sufficient number to eat the lamb by themselves, emphasizing the magnitude and significance of the Passover meal for them.
