# Luke 22:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the hour was come, in the evening, the disciples gathered to observe the Passover feast, reclining or lying along on couches, as was the custom. Even Judas, who had already made his deal with the chief priests, scribes, and elders, took his place among the apostles, deceiving them and waiting for the right moment to betray Jesus. This event took place when it was dark, at least after six o'clock.
