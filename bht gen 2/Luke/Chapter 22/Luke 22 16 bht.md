# Luke 22:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During the Passover meal, Jesus spoke of the Passover lamb and its fulfillment in the kingdom of God. This specific Passover marked the last time He would eat before His death. The Passover lamb foreshadowed Christ, who fulfills it completely. The Gospel dispensation has already realized this fulfillment, allowing us to partake in the Messianic banquet through the Lord's Supper. In the future, we will share in the eternal joys and pleasures of God's kingdom, where this Passover will be fully realized.
