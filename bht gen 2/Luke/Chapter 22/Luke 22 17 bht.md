# Luke 22:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, Jesus took the cup and gave thanks before dividing it among his disciples. He states that he will not drink of it again until the kingdom of God comes. This refusal to drink signifies that he will not partake in the Passover feast anymore. Instead, he institutes the Lord's Supper, superseding the Passover with a new ordinance that is intended to be perpetual. Jesus's actions and words during this event demonstrate the transition between the old and new economies, and the fulfillment of the Passover rite through his role as the true Lamb of God.
