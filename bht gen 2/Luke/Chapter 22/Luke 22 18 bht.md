# Luke 22:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The language used implies that Jesus did not partake in the Supper He later instituted, indicating a shift from the old rite to the new one soon to be established. Luke's order emphasizes the contrast between the two rites. The phrase the fruit of the vine encompasses anything that symbolizes the new covenant. The mention of the kingdom of God suggests the consummation of His kingdom, which had already come through the resurrection of Christ, the pouring forth of the Spirit, the conversion of multitudes, and the ultimate state of happiness in the world to come.
