# Luke 22:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During the Last Supper, Jesus took bread, which represented his body, and said, This is my body. This figurative language was used to symbolize the partaking of his sacrifice. The bread was not literally his body, just as the paschal lamb of the passover was not literally the passover. By using this language, Jesus was emphasizing the significance of the bread as a representation of his sacrificial death, inviting his disciples to partake in remembrance of him.
