# Luke 22:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The religious leaders were actively seeking a way to kill Jesus, taking steps to carry out their plan even as the Feast approached. Their purpose was clear – to slay him. This was not a sudden decision, as they had already made up their minds and sought counsel on the matter. However, they were cautious and afraid to arrest Jesus openly during the feast, fearing the response of the people who held him in high regard.
