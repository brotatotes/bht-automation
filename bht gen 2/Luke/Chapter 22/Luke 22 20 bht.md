# Luke 22:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After the meal, Jesus took the cup and gave thanks over it, presenting it to His disciples as a symbolic representation of the New Testament. This cup signifies the blood of Christ, which was shed as a confirmation of the covenant between God and His people. It is important to understand that the cup itself is not the New Testament, but rather a visible sign of the covenant and the blood that was poured out for the redemption of humanity.

2. "Some paraphrase thus: 'This cup is the new covenant because it contains my blood'; but even this view gives no countenance to the literal rendering of the Roman Catholics because the 'cup' could only represent the 'covenant.'"
3. "That which is poured out for you. This is spoken of the 'blood,' although the form of the original admits of a reference to the word 'cup.' More exactly it points to the fruit of the vine poured out from the grapes and representing the blood of Christ."
