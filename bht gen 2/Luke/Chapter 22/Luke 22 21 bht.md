# Luke 22:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Before instituting the Lord's Supper, Jesus indicated the presence of Judas as the betrayer by saying, The hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table. Shortly after this statement, Judas left and did not return until he came to the garden to betray Jesus. The act of dipping the morsel could only have been done while the food was on the table, further highlighting the significance of Judas' betrayal within the context of the shared meal.
