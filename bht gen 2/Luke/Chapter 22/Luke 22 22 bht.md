# Luke 22:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The death of Christ, including its manner and means, was predetermined by God. Even though Judas played a role in this betrayal, it does not absolve him from his guilt. In fact, the woe spoken about Judas emphasizes the gravity of his actions, as he not only met a tragic end but also faced eternal punishment in a place of everlasting torments. The predetermined plan by God did not excuse the sins of those involved; rather, it highlights the sovereignty and justice of God in bringing about His purposes.
