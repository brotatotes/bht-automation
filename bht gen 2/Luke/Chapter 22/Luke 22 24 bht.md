# Luke 22:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
At a certain time, there was a contentious dispute among the apostles, possibly sparked by the ambitious request of Zebedee's sons to hold coveted positions in Christ's kingdom. This contention may have been led by Peter, James, and John, who were especially favored by Jesus. Interestingly, this disagreement about who would be considered the greatest was likely the same dispute mentioned in the gospels of Matthew and Mark. Notably, although recounting it here, the event actually took place prior to the present moment.

1. "The Persic version reads, 'at a certain time there was a contention among the apostles'; and some think, that this refers to the time when the mother of Zebedee's two sons asked the favour of Christ, to set one of them at his right hand, and the other at his left, in his kingdom."
2. "Perhaps the contention might be chiefly between Peter, James and John, the two sons of Zebedee, and who were the favourite disciples of Christ; and Peter might urge his seniority, and what Christ had said to him, Matthew 16:18 and the rather, since it is certain Satan was now busy about him; wherefore Christ calls him by name, and singles him out among the rest."
3. "Which of them should be accounted the greatest; by Christ; or that should be so in his kingdom."
