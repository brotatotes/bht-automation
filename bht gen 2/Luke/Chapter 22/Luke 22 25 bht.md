# Luke 22:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The contrast between the kings of the Gentiles and Christ's kingdom is evident in their different approaches to authority and recognition. The kings seek to exercise arbitrary authority and be called benefactors, a title that often disguises their ambition and cruelty. In contrast, Christ's kingdom is spiritual and characterized by humility and service. It is not managed in the same way as worldly kingdoms, as Christ himself came to serve rather than to be served. The desire for power and recognition reflects a heathen mindset, whereas Christ's kingdom operates according to a different set of values.
