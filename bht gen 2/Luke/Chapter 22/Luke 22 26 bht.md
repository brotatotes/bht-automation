# Luke 22:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let us remember that true greatness lies not in holding positions of power and authority, but in serving others. As followers of Christ, we are called to be humble and to serve one another with love and compassion. The apostles and ministers of the word exemplified this by being servants for Jesus' sake, condescending to those considered lower and esteeming them better than themselves. May we strive to be like them, exhibiting true greatness through our selfless service to others.
