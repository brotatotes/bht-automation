# Luke 22:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ demonstrates his point about humility and service by washing the feet of his disciples, emphasizing that he came not to be served, but to serve. He challenges their desire for positions of authority by setting an example of a servant leader. By doing so, Jesus discourages their contention for power and encourages them to imitate his meek and lowly attitude, serving one another in love. He takes no higher position among them, but instead positions himself in their midst, showing that true greatness is found in humble service.
