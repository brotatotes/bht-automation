Throughout his ministry, Jesus faced various trials and temptations. These temptations were not only external but also internal, testing his faith and patience.

Jesus commended them for their unwavering loyalty and acknowledged their participation in his sufferings. They remained by his side from the beginning, through all the trials he encountered, and their continued presence and commitment were a source of encouragement for Jesus.
