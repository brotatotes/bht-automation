# Luke 22:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ, the dispenser of kingdoms, appoints his faithful followers not to a temporal rule, but to a spiritual kingdom. This kingdom encompasses the entire Gospel dispensation and grants believers the authority to open the door of faith to others. Through trials and temptations, they are assured of preservation until they enter into the glorious kingdom. This appointment is not limited to one person, but extends to all who have fought and conquered in the same way as Christ, who received his appointed kingdom from the Father.
