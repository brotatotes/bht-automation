# Luke 22:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Satan, the adversary and enemy of the Messiah, entered into Judas, overtaking and influencing him. It was Satan who put the idea into Judas' heart to betray Jesus, capturing and exploiting the weaknesses within him. This event occurred a few days before the Passover, indicating that the sop Judas took, after which Satan entered into him, was not the Passover sop, but a different one consumed at the supper in Bethany. Satan is always ready to assist those whose hearts are set on evil deeds.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Satan, seeing this door into his heart standing wide open, determines to enter by it, but cautiously first merely 'putting it into his heart to betray Him' (John 13:2), suggesting the thought to him that by this means he might enrich himself."
2. "Starting back, perhaps, or mercifully held back, for some time, the determination to carry it into immediate effect was not consummated till, sitting at the paschal supper, 'Satan entered into him' (see on John 13:2- :), and conscience, effectually stifled, only rose again to be his tormentor."
3. "What lessons in all this for every one (Ephesians 4:27; James 4:7; 1 Peter 5:8; 1 Peter 5:9)!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is not necessary to suppose that Satan entered personally into the body of Judas, but only that he brought him under his influence."
2. "To show its exceeding evil and baseness, it is only necessary to say that when it produced its 'appropriate' effect in this case, it led to the betraying and crucifixion of the Son of God."
3. "We may learn, also, that when Satan 'tempts' people, he commonly does it by exciting and raising to the highest pitch their native passions."
