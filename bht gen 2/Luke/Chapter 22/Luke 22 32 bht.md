# Luke 22:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus knew that Peter would be severely tested and his faith would be in danger of failing. Even though Peter would stumble and fall, Jesus prayed specifically for him, interceding on his behalf. The purpose of Jesus' prayer was to ensure that Peter's faith would not completely collapse, but rather that he would ultimately return to strengthen his fellow believers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Though the ὑμᾶς included Judas, he is not included in the prayer: see John 17:6-12. We may notice here, that our Lord speaks of the total failure of even an Apostle’s faith, as possible." 
2. "There can, I think, be little doubt that this word is here used in the general N.T. sense, of returning as a penitent after sin, turning to God; and not in the almost expletive meaning which it has in such passages as Psalms 84:6, ὁ θεός, σὺ ἐπιστρέψας ζωώσεις ἡμᾶς."
3. "The use of this word and the cognate substantive thrice by Peter in his two epistles (see reff.), and in the first passage in a connexion with the mention of Satan’s temptations, is remarkable."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But I have prayed—have been doing it already. for thee—as most in danger."
2. "Fail not—that is, entirely; for partially it did fail."
3. "Converted—brought back afresh as a penitent disciple. Strengthen, &c.—that is, make use of thy bitter experience for the fortifying of thy tempted brethren."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The prayer of Jesus was that he might not altogether apostatize from the faith."
2. "He well knew that Jesus was the Messiah... he was brought to true repentance."
3. "Use your experience to warn them of their danger, and to comfort and sustain them in their temptations."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Prayed [εδεηθην]. See on prayers, ch. 5 33."
2. "Converted is simply the Latinized rendering of the word to turn round [χονςερτερε]."
3. "Rev., stablish, which is much better. Strengthen may denote only a temporary effect. The word implies fixedness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In the consciousness of greater power than that of Satan and greater faithfulness than that of Peter."
2. "Our Lord prays, not that Peter be not tried, but that his faith should not utterly fail."
3. "Peter’s sin and repentance are both implied here. ‘Converted’(so E. V.) is unfortunate; there is no reference to the experience with which Christian life usually begins."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus could not keep Satan from attacking Peter. He had already captured Judas. Did he not repeatedly attack Jesus? But he could and did pray for Peter's faith and his praying won in the end, though Peter stumbled and fell." 
2. "The words single out Peter sharply." 
3. "The use of this word implied that Peter would fall though he would come back and 'strengthen thy brethren.'"

### John Gill:
1. "Satan in his temptations strikes principally at the faith of God's people; that being a grace which gives much glory to God, and in the exercise of which believers have much peace, joy, and comfort; both which he envies and grudges."
2. "Though, through the power of sin, and the force of temptation, [faith] may fail as to some degree of the steadfastness of it, as to the acting and exercise of it, and as to the sense believers may have of it; yet never as to its principle, it being an irrevocable gift of God's grace."
3. "[Peter's] recovery by the fresh exercise of faith in Christ, and repentance for his sins, is called conversion: and which was not his own act, but owing to the power and efficacy of divine grace."

### John Wesley:
1. "But I have prayed for thee - Who wilt be in the greatest danger of all: that thy faith fail not - Altogether." 
2. "And when thou art returned - From thy flight, strengthen thy brethren - All that are weak in faith; perhaps scandalized at thy fall."
