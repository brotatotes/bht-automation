# Luke 22:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In his overconfidence, Peter questioned the necessity of Jesus praying for him. He felt secure in his own strength and was not afraid of Satan or any trial that may come his way. However, his bold assertion stemmed from a lack of understanding, as he did not realize the depth of the challenges he would face. Little did he know that he would soon falter and experience a crisis of faith. Yet, despite Peter's momentary weakness, Jesus had been interceding for him in prayer, ensuring that his faith would not ultimately fail.
