# Luke 22:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter's denial of Jesus is foretold in Luke 22:34, as Jesus directly addresses him by his name, Peter, highlighting the significance of his steadfastness. This warning is not exclusive to Luke, as all four Gospels mention it. Jesus assures Peter that he will deny knowing Him before the cock crowing, a prophecy fulfilled in Luke 22:57. The timing of the cock crowing is significant, occurring in the early morning hours.
