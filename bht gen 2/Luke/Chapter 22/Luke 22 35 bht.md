# Luke 22:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus sent out his disciples without purse, scrip, and shoes, they lacked nothing at all. They were provided with everything necessary, including food, clothes, and good lodgings in every place. They were borne above all want and danger, and God fully provided for them. As they embark on a new journey, Jesus reminds them of their past experience, urging them to put confidence in him and in God. He assures them that just as he cared for them before, he will continue to have regard for them in their present circumstances.
