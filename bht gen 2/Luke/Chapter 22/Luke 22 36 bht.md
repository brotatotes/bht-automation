# Luke 22:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
From this time forward, their situation will be completely different. They will be in need of everything. However, when Jesus says, He that hath no sword, let him sell his garment and buy one, he is not speaking literally. Instead, he is emphasizing the extreme danger they will face.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He who has a purse, &c., and he who has none, let him &c., see reff. Thus the sense will be complete for he who has a purse, can buy a sword, without selling his garment."
2. "The saying is both a description to them of their altered situation with reference to the world without, and a declaration that self-defence and self-provision would henceforward be necessary."
3. "It forms a decisive testimony, from the mouth of the Lord Himself, against the views of the Quakers and some other sects on these points."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "But now they were to go into the wide world, among strangers, trials, dangers, and wants."
2. "It altogether refers to their future life. They were going into the midst of dangers."
3. "Men encompassed with danger may lawfully 'defend' their lives. It does not prove that it is lawful to make 'offensive' war on a nation or an individual."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He that hath not a purse or scrip (and is therefore penniless), let him sell his garment and buy a sword."


### John Calvin:
1. "He threatens that they will soon meet with great troubles and fierce attacks."
2. "He warns them of the severe struggles of temptations which they must undergo, and of the fierce attacks which they must sustain in spiritual contests."
3. "Having experienced so large and seasonable supplies from God, they ought not, for the future, to entertain any doubt that he would provide for every one of their necessities."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He that hath not, i.e., purse or wallet, let him sell his cloke (‘outer garment’), necessary as that is, and buy a sword, which is now more indispensable than clothing."
2. "This is not to be taken literally, nor yet allegorically, as though the purse, wallet, and sword had each a spiritual signification; but the whole is a figurative setting forth of the fact that henceforth self-defense would be their chief necessity, in view of the outward perils which would come upon them."
3. "This opposes the non-resistant theory of the Quakers, and also the view, that force can be used aggressively in the cause of Christ; self-defense alone is in question."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Buy a sword (αγορασατω μαχαιραν). This is for defence clearly." 
2. "Jesus does not mean that his disciples are to repel force by force, but that they are to be ready to defend his cause against attack."
3. "Changed conditions bring changed needs. This language can be misunderstood as it was then."

### John Gill:
1. "From this time forward, immediately after his departure from them, after his death, resurrection, and ascension, when they should be sent into all the world to preach the Gospel, it would be otherwise with them than before..."
2. "They should be reduced to great penury and distress, should neither have food, nor money to buy any with; and that they should suffer hunger, and thirst, and nakedness, and have no certain dwelling place..."
3. "Christ here uses the common dialect of the nation...His meaning is, that wherever they came, and a door was opened for the preaching of the Gospel, they would have many adversaries, and these powerful, and would be used with great violence, and be followed with rage and persecution; so that they might seem to stand in need of swords to defend them..."

### John Wesley:
1. "But now — You will be quite in another situation. You will want every thing."
2. "He that hath no sword, let him sell his garment and buy one — It is plain, this is not to be taken literally."
3. "It only means, This will be a time of extreme danger."
