# Luke 22:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Though he himself was not a transgressor, Jesus willingly took on the appearance of sinful flesh and associated with sinners. As a result, he was wrongly accused and included among the likes of Barabbas, a murderer and thief. It is important to understand that Jesus, being in the position of his people, had their sins imputed to him. Through this imputation, he was not only counted as a sinner, but as sin itself. Therefore, all the plans, designs, and decrees of God, relating to Jesus' sufferings and death, were soon to reach their completion.
