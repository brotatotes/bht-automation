# Luke 22:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples, two of whom were armed, likely carried swords for protection when traveling in Galilee. However, they misunderstood Jesus' words about needing swords, thinking he referred to immediate defense. Jesus, aware of their misunderstanding, responds, It is enough, indicating that the swords were not sufficient for his purpose. He wanted to foretell them of impending dangers after his death, not to encourage armed conflict. It was a shame that the disciples didn't grasp the spiritual meaning of Jesus' teachings and instead resorted to literal interpretation and reliance on weapons.

### Henry Alford:
1. "Two of them were armed, either from excess of zeal to defend Him, excited by His announcement of His sufferings during this feast, or perhaps because they had brought their weapons from Galilee as protection by the way."
2. "They exhibit their swords, misunderstanding His words and supposing them to apply to that night. Our Lord breaks off the matter with ‘It is enough;’ not ‘they are sufficient;’ but, It is well, we are sufficiently provided ‘it was not to this that My words referred.’"
3. "The rebuke is parallel with, though milder than, the one in Mark 8:17, as the misunderstanding was somewhat similar."

### Philip Schaff:
