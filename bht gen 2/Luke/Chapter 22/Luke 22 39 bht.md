# Luke 22:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Jesus made his way towards Gethsemane, it was customary for him to go there (Luke 22:39), and his disciples followed him, witnessing his sorrows and agonies in the garden (Luke 22:39). By going to Gethsemane, Jesus willingly positioned himself where Judas could easily find him, fulfilling the prophecy of his betrayal (Luke 22:39). The disciples sang a hymn, likely one of the Jewish Hallel Psalms (Matthew 26:30), as they left the upper room, concluding the Passover service (Matthew 26:30). Thus, their journey began, symbolizing the start of Jesus' sorrows and sufferings outside the city (Matthew 26:30).
