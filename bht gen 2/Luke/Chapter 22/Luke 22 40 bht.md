# Luke 22:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the gospel account, Jesus withdraws to a place, a stone's throw away from his disciples. This place is known as the garden of Gethsemane. It is in this garden that Jesus displays a beautiful oneness with humanity by sharing in our natural emotions and experiences. At the same time, Jesus reveals his complete submission to the will of his Father. In this moment of intense struggle, an angel appears from heaven to strengthen him, providing support and sustaining his weary spirit for the final trial that awaits him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He must be alone. 'He was withdrawn from them about a stone's-cast'â€”though near enough for them to be competent witnesses and kneeled down, uttering that most affecting prayer..." 
2. "By signifying how it felt in the one view, He shows His beautiful oneness with ourselves in nature and feeling; by expressing how He regarded it in the other light, He reveals His absolute obediential subjection to His Father."
3. "To fortify Him for this, 'there appeared an angel unto Him from heaven strengthening Him'â€”not to minister light or comfort (He was to have none of that, and they were not needed nor fitted to convey it), but purely to sustain and brace up sinking nature for a yet hotter and fiercer struggle."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. The place. See on Gethsemane, Matthew 26:36.

### Philip Schaff:
1. Luke 22:40.  At the place.  A well-known place; perhaps already known.by name to readers of the Gospel. Hence the omission of the name.
