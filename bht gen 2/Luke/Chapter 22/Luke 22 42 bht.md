# Luke 22:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, the first prayer is a humble request to God, acknowledging that if it aligns with His plan for saving sinners, the petitioner is willing to carry it out. However, it is important to note that even though the petitioner expresses their desire, it is ultimately not their own will that should be done. Despite having a human will distinct from but not contradictory to His divine will, the petitioner surrenders to the divine will, emphasizing that God's will should be the ultimate focus and priority.
