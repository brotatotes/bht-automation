# Luke 22:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of a fierce battle against the enemy, Jesus experienced an intense struggle of prayer and sorrow. The agony He endured was so great that His sweat became colored with blood, falling to the ground in thick, clotted drops. This extraordinary phenomenon served as a testimony to the reality of His humanity, proving that He had a true and real body and a soul capable of grief and sorrow. The evidence of this agonizing and bloody sweat not only affirms the authenticity of His human nature but also emphasizes the magnitude of the conflict He endured for the redemption of mankind.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The intention of the Evangelist seems clearly to be, to convey the idea that the sweat was (not fell like, but was) like drops of blood; i.e. coloured with blood..."
2. "To suppose that it only fell like drops of blood (why not drops of any thing else? and drops of blood from what, and where?) is to nullify the force of the sentence, and make the insertion of Î±á¼µÎ¼Î±Ï„Î¿Ï‚ not only superfluous but absurd."
3. "We must not forget, in asking on what testimony this rests, that the marks of such drops would be visible after the termination of the agony."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Having progressed from the first prayer into an intense struggle of prayer and sorrow."
2. "Agony occurs only here. It is used by medical writers, and the fact of a sweat accompanying an agony is also mentioned by them."
3. "Great drops: gouts or clots. Very common in medical language."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The first result of the strengthening was that He prayed more earnestly, the final result was complete resignation and victorious waiting for the betrayer."
2. "The easy and natural explanation is, that as the result of the agony His sweat became colored with blood (not pure blood, hence â€˜as it wereâ€™), and fell in great clots to the ground."
3. "No other sense accords so well with the language used. Instances of bloody sweat have occurred since. Every other view fails to give a sufficient climax to Lukeâ€™s description and seems to fall below the dignity of the conflict there endured for us."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Satan pressed Jesus harder than ever before."
2. "Thick, clotted blood."
3. "Aristotle speaks of a bloody sweat as does Theophrastus."

### John Gill:
1. "The battle between the two combatants, the serpent, and the seed of the woman, which issued in the destruction of Satan and the recovery of mankind."
2. "His sweat was, as it were, great drops of blood falling to the ground."
3. "This agony, and bloody sweat of Christ, prove the truth of his human nature; the sweat shows that he had a true and real body, as other men; the anxiety of his mind, that he had a reasonable soul capable of grief and sorrow, as human souls are."

### John Wesley:
1. "Feeling the weight of the wrath of God, and at the same time surrounded with a mighty host of devils, who exercised all their force and malice to persecute and distract his wounded spirit."
2. "He prayed more earnestly â€” Even with stronger cries and tars: and his sweat - As cold as the weather was, was as it were great drops of blood - Which, by the vehement distress of his soul, were forced out of the pores, in so great a quantity as afterward united in large, thick, grumous drops, and even fell to the ground."
