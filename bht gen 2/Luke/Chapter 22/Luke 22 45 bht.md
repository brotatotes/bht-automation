# Luke 22:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus came to his disciples, he found them sleeping, not out of laziness, but because they were overwhelmed by sorrow. The depth of their sorrow was evident in Jesus' own expression of distress. Their hearts were weighed down by sadness, which led to their drowsiness and need for rest.
