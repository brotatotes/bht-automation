# Luke 22:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As the events unfold, we see one of the twelve disciples, Judas, leading a multitude of Roman soldiers and officers of the chief priests, going before them to the place where Jesus was. It was Judas who went ahead as their guide, indicating where Jesus could be found and informing them whom they should detain. His intention was to identify Jesus by drawing near to him and giving him a kiss, a pre-arranged signal by which the soldiers would recognize their target.
