# Luke 22:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Judas, in his act of betrayal, was confronted by Jesus who openly called it betrayal despite being addressed by name. This confrontation was intended to make it clear that Judas was betraying the Son of man, the Messiah who assumed human nature for the good of mankind. Jesus, who is holy and harmless, emphasized this to show that he was not a stranger to what Judas was about to do.
