# Luke 22:49 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples, not fully understanding Christ's intentions, questioned whether they should use the sword in self-defense. They may have wanted to demonstrate their loyalty and commitment to Jesus, as they had previously vowed to never deny him. Perhaps they were emboldened by the fact that the men who came to arrest Jesus fell to the ground when He revealed Himself. However, their perception of the situation was limited, as they were unaware of the divine plan that was about to unfold.
