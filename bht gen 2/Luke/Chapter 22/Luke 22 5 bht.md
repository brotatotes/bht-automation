# Luke 22:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It was a momentous occasion when one of Jesus' closest disciples offered to betray him for thirty pieces of silver, a monetary value equal to the fines paid for accidentally killing a servant. This act of betrayal held a symbolic significance, as the betrayer accepted the payment willingly, highlighting the value placed on Jesus' life. Interestingly, while Luke mentions the involvement of money in the betrayal, he does not specify the exact amount. This decision by the disciple to betray Jesus had profound implications for the unfolding of events that would ultimately lead to His crucifixion.
