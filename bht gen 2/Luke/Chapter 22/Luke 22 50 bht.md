# Luke 22:50 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Luke 22:50, Peter boldly took action by drawing his sword without waiting for a response from Jesus. Luke specifically mentions that it was a certain one of them, omitting Peter's name. Both Luke and John confirm that it was the right ear that Peter struck. The inclusion of the names Peter and Malchus in John's account suggests that both were likely deceased at the time of writing. Peter's targeting of this particular servant may have been due to his evident hostility and malignancy towards Jesus.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. The servant. See on Matthew 26:51. His right ear. Lit., his ear, the right one. See on Matthew 26:51; and compare Mark 14:47. Both Matthew and Mark use diminutives.

### Philip Schaff:
1. Luke 22:50.  A certain one of them.  Luke too omits Peterâ€™s name.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Luke the Physician does [mention 'right']."
2. "John 18:10 follows Luke in this item and also adds the names of Peter and of Malchus since probably both were dead by that time and Peter would not be involved in trouble."

### John Gill:
1. "The person that drew his sword, and performed this daring action, not waiting for an answer from Christ, was Peter."
2. "Both Peter and the high priest's servant, that he smote, was Malchus."
3. "It is very likely, that this servant was very busy and forward to lay hold on Christ, and showed much virulence, and great malignity; and therefore Peter singled him out, and levelled his blow at him."
