# Luke 22:51 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He went to the wounded man, touched his ear, and healed him, demonstrating that despite his weakened state, Jesus still possessed the miraculous power to restore. This act served as an example, affirming his command to show kindness to enemies and providing undeniable evidence of his willingness to be taken into custody. Surprisingly, instead of halting their assault, one would have expected this miraculous healing to convince his opponents of his divinity and messianic identity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Suffer, permit me, thus far: i.e. to touch the ear of the wounded person."
2. "If this interpretation be correct, it furnishes an additional token of the truthfulness of our narrative for the previous laying hold of Jesus has not been mentioned here, but in Matthew (Mat 26:50) and Mark (Mar 14:46)."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Suffer ye thus far. This is variously interpreted. I think the text requires that the words should be addressed to the disciples, and taken as the answer to the question, shall we smite, etc. The meaning then is, permit them to go so far as to seize me."
2. "Ear [ωτιου] . This time Luke uses the diminutive. Wyc., little ear."
3. "Healed. Only Luke records the healing."

### John Calvin:
1. "By his foolish zeal Peter had brought grievous reproach on his Master and his doctrine; and there can be no doubt, that this was a contrivance by which Satan attempted to involve the Gospel in eternal disgrace."
2. "But a fearful and amazing stupidity must have seized his adversaries, who were not at all affected by having seen such a miracle."
3. "Above all, in the person himself who was healed, there is a striking instance of ingratitude; for neither did the divine power of Christ subdue him to repentance for his hardness, nor was he overcome by kindness so as to be changed from an enemy into a disciple."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Suffer ye thus far. Probably addressed to the disciples: Let them go on and fulfil this their design of taking me. It is a mild reproof of the hasty use of the sword." 
2. "Touched his ear, etc. Luke, the physician, alone mentions this. The passage does not clearly indicate how the healing took place."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "If addressed to Peter and the other disciples it means that they are to suffer this much of violence against Jesus."
2. "If it is addressed to the crowd, it means that they are to excuse Peter for his rash act."
3. "He could have healed the wound without that. This miracle of surgery is given alone by Luke."

### John Gill:
1. "He went to the wounded man, and he touched his ear and healed him; which shows, that though the human nature of Christ was in a very low condition, yet he still retained the power of doing miracles."
2. "By this example, he confirmed his precept of doing good to enemies and gave full proof of his willingness to be apprehended by them."
3. "One would have thought this would have put a stop to them and have convinced them of the truth of his being a divine person and the Messiah."

### John Wesley:
1. Suffer me at least to have my hands at liberty thus far, while I do one more act of mercy.
