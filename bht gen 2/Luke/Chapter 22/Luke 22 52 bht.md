# Luke 22:52 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After Jesus performed the miracle and calmed the crowd, the chief priests, captains, and elders took it upon themselves to come and confront Jesus. They wanted to be there to witness what was happening and to encourage Judas, the soldiers, and their officers. Jesus questioned them, asking if they had come after him as if he were a thief, armed with swords and staffs. This shows that they were treating him as if he were a criminal, resembling a robber like Barabbas.
