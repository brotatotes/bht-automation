# Luke 22:53 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our Lord distinguished between the power of men and the power of darkness that ruled over Him during His hour of betrayal. This hour, predetermined by God's plan, marked the voluntariness of His atoning sacrifice on the Cross. The power of darkness, symbolizing the influence of Satan, was involved in the events that unfolded. Though they took advantage of this hour, it was temporary, and a better day would come. In this declaration, we witness the mysterious interplay between God's purpose, human agency, and Satanic power.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Our Lord here distinguishes between the power exercised over Him by men, and that by the Evil One: but so as to make the ἐξουσία which rules over them to be that of darkness while His own assertion of this shows that all was by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God." 
2. "In the word σκότος there is also an allusion to the time midnight."
3. "Compare with this declaration of the power of darkness over Him, the declaration, in ch. Luke 4:13, that the devil left Him ἄχρι καιροῦ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Darkness was appropriate to such a deed, hence it was the hour which suited them."

### John Gill:
1. "The reason was, because his time was not come, and they had no licence or permission to hurt him, or any power given them against him from above."
2. "But this is your hour; the time was now come for the betraying of him by Judas; for the seizing and apprehending him by the Roman soldiers and officers; and for the delivery of him into the hands of the chief priests and elders; and for them to insult, mock, buffet, scourge him, and spit upon him."
3. "The hour fixed for this was now come; it was now, and not before, and therefore they could not lay hold on him, and do to him what they listed, but now they might; yet this was but an hour, a short time that they had to triumph over him."

1. This is your hour — Before which ye could not take me: and the power of darkness - The time when Satan has power.
