# Luke 22:54 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Notwithstanding his miracles and compassion, this event confirms Jesus' prophetic words that this was the time when those with power would seize him. The high priest's house was different from the temple where they normally sat. Peter, though following, did so from a distance.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Our narrative leaves it undecided who this high-priest was, inasmuch as, Annas and Caiaphas are mentioned as high-priests."
2. "From John we find that it was Annas; who having questioned Jesus, sent Him bound to Caiaphas, before whom His trial took place."
3. "Luke omits this trial altogether or perhaps gives the substance of it in the account of the morning assembly of the Sanhedrim."

### Philip Schaff:
1. Luke 22:54.  The high-priest’s home.  Undoubtedly Caiaphas is meant, since the other Evangelists agree in making his house the scene of Peter’s denial.
	

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Into the high priest's house" (εις την οικιαν του αρχιερεως). Luke alone mentions "the house."
2. "Followed" (ηκολουθε). Imperfect, was following, as Matthew 26:58; John 18:15.
3. "Curiously Mark 14:54 has the aorist."

### John Gill:
1. "Notwithstanding the miracle he had wrought, and the humanity he had shown...this was a confirmation of his last words; for by this it appeared, that now was their time, and power was given to them."
2. "This was not in the temple where they used to sit...it is manifestly distinguished from his own house."
3. "And Peter followed afar off."

### John Wesley:
1.  Matthew 26:57; Mark 14:53; John 18:12.
