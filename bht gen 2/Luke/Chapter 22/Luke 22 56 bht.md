# Luke 22:56 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As the fire illuminated the scene, a maid saw Peter and gazed intently at him. Her steady gaze revealed a recognition of something in him, causing her to scrutinize him further. Without speaking the name of Jesus, it seemed as though she identified Peter as one of His disciples, viewing him suspiciously as if he were a spy.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. By the fire [προς το φως] . See on Mark 14:54.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In the light (προς το φως). Facing (προς) the light, for the fire gave light as well as heat."
2. "Looking steadfastly (ατενισασα). Favourite word in Luke (Luke 4:20, etc.) for gazing steadily at one."
3. "This man also (κα ουτος). As if pointing to Peter and talking about him. The other Gospels (Mark 14:67; Matthew 26:69; John 18:25) make a direct address to Peter. Both could be true, as she turned to Peter."

### John Gill:
1. "But a certain maid beheld him...and earnestly looked upon him..." 
2. "...she discovered something in him, which made her look at him again with some earnestness..." 
3. "...she disdained to mention the name of Jesus...and her sense was, that Peter was one of that clan, a disciple of his, and was only come hither as a spy."
