# Luke 22:57 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When confronted by the maid, he was taken aback and resorted to denying any knowledge of Jesus. This denial was foretold by Jesus himself, fulfilling his prophecy. It is ironic how the same person who proclaimed his loyalty to Jesus, claiming he would die for him rather than deny him, was now overcome with fear and denied him at the first sign of trouble.
