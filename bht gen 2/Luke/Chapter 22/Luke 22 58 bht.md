# Luke 22:58 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After Peter's initial denial witnessed by a woman, a man joined in accusing him of being a follower of Christ. Not only did the woman affirm his association with Jesus, but other members of the crowd also recognized Peter's Galilean origins and the credibility of their claims was bolstered by the testimony of a relative of Malchus who had seen Peter in the garden. This culmination of various individuals accusing Peter led to his third and final denial.
