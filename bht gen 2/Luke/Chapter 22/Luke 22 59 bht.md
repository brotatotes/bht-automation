## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "After the space of about one hour" (διαστασης ωσε ωρας μιας). Genitive absolute with second aorist active participle feminine singular of διιστημ. It means standing in two or apart, about an hour intervening.
2. "Confidently affirmed" (διισχυριζετο). Imperfect middle, he kept affirming strongly. An old verb (δια, ισχυριζομα), to make oneself strong, to make emphatic declaration.
3. "For he is a Galilean" (κα γαρ Γαλιλαιος εστιν). Matthew 26:73 makes it plain that it was his speech that gave him away.

### John Gill:
1. "Another confidently affirmed... and therefore with all assurance asserted it, as a matter of fact, as an unquestionable truth, and beyond all doubt." 
2. "Saying of a truth, this fellow also was with him; a disciple and follower of Jesus, and was with him when he was apprehended; I saw him there, and it may be depended on as a truth."
3. "For he is a Galilean; you may be assured of this yourselves, his speech betrays him; you may know him by his language, and which confirms my assertion."

### John Wesley:
1. And about one hour after — So he did not recollect himself in all that time.
