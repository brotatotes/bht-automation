### Marvin Vincent:
1. Promised [εξωμολογησεν] . See on Matthew 3:6; Matthew 11:25. The idea is that of an open and fair consent or pledge.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Consented (εξωμολογησεν). Old verb, but the ancients usually used the simple form for promise or consent rather than the compound. This is the only instance of this sense in the N.T."
2. "Opportunity (ευκαριαν). From ευκαιρος (ευ, καιρος), a good chance. Old word, but in the N.T. only here and parallel passage Matthew 26:16."
3. "In the absence of the multitude (ατερ οχλου). Ατερ is an old preposition, common in the poets, but rare in prose. Also in verse Luke 22:35. It means 'without,' 'apart from,' like χωρις. The point of Judas was just this. He would get Jesus into the hands of the Sanhedrin during the feast in spite of the crowd."

### John Gill:
1. "He faithfully promised he would."
2. "The two days following before the passover: to betray him unto them in the absence of the people."
3. "He had promised, until the night of the passover, when he was alone in the garden with his disciples."
