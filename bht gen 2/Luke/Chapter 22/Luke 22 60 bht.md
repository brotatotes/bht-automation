# Luke 22:60 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter's denials of Jesus were not just a momentary lapse, but a continuous stumbling. As he vehemently denied any knowledge of Jesus, Peter's confusion and lack of understanding were evident. His words and actions spoke volumes, as he not only denied Jesus but also began to curse and swear, expressing his rejection of any association with Christ. The significance of Peter's betrayal becomes even more pronounced when we consider that this was the second time he denied knowing Jesus.
