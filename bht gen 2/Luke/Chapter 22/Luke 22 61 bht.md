# Luke 22:61 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The intense gaze that the Lord had fixed upon Peter during his trials conveys not only concern and pity, but also love and mercy. This look was not merely a reminder of Peter's denial, but it was also filled with power that worked to convict and humble him, ultimately leading to repentance. As the cock crowed, Peter's memory was jolted, remembering the precise words of the Lord, how he had foretold his denial three times. It is a mysterious thing how Peter had momentarily forgotten this warning amidst the distress of the trials.
