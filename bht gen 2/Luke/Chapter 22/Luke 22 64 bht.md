# Luke 22:64 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After Jesus was blindfolded, his captors began to taunt him and strike him on the face. This act of blindfolding was done in a mocking manner, perhaps to imitate games played by children. The blindfolding served to intensify their abuse towards Jesus, as they struck him on the parts of his face that were not covered. Their aggressive actions and disrespectful questioning were designed to belittle Jesus and disregard his prophetic authority. It is important to note that this account is mentioned only in the books of Matthew and Mark, highlighting the indignities Jesus endured during his arrest and trial.

### John Gill:
1. "And when they had blindfolded him,.... Or put a veil, or linen cloth over his eyes, as children do at play, to make themselves some sport with him..." 
2. "...they struck him on the face; on that part of it which was not covered, either with their hands, or with rods..."
