# Luke 22:65 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In addition to denying and ridiculing his deity and divine sonship, they mocked his roles as a prophet, priest, and king. The charge of blasphemy was leveled against Jesus for daring to claim to be the Son of God, but in reality, it was their accusation that was false because Jesus truly was the Son of God.
