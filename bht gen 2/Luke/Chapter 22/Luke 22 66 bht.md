# Luke 22:66 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The assembly of the elders, composed of the chief priests, Scribes, and other representatives of the people, led Jesus into their council chamber within the temple. It was here that they questioned Him, asking if He was indeed the Christ. The Sanhedrin, the great council of the nation, sought to investigate and condemn Jesus during the daylight hours, according to Roman law and Jewish tradition. This gathering of the Sanhedrin was a significant moment in the events leading up to Christ's crucifixion.
