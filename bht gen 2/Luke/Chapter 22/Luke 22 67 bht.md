# Luke 22:67 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the people asked Jesus, Are you the Christ?, they were seeking a straightforward and open response from Him, wanting Him to freely admit if He was indeed the Messiah. Jesus recognized their lack of belief, understanding that even if He were to answer them, they would not accept His words. Their unbelief was stubborn and unyielding, making them impervious to any evidence or reasoning presented to them. Their minds were closed to the possibility of Jesus being the long-awaited Messiah, their skepticism clouding their judgment and preventing them from embracing the truth.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "If thou art the Christ, tell us. An abrupt beginning, presupposing testimony that He made this claim."
2. "If I tell you, ye will not believe, i.e., you do not ask to know the truth, but to make me condemn myself."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "If thou art the Christ (Ε συ ε ο Χριστος). The Messiah, they mean. The condition is the first class, assuming it to be true."
2. "If I tell you (Εαν υμιν ειπω). Condition of the third class, undetermined, but with likelihood of being determined."
3. "Ye will not believe (ου μη πιστευσητε). Double negative with the aorist subjunctive, strongest possible negative."

### John Gill:
1. "Saying, art thou the Christ,... tell us". The Ethiopic version adds, openly; tell us frankly, freely, plainly, as in John 10:24. 
2. "And he said unto them, if I tell you, you will not believe." The Vulgate Latin and Syriac versions read, "will not believe me"; neither what he said, nor that he was the Messiah. 
3. "Their unbelief was wilful, obstinate, and invincible: they were proof against all arguments, evidence, and demonstration itself."
