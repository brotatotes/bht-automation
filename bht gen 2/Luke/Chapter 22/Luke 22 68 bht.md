# Luke 22:68 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When considering the verses, it is important to recognize Jesus' intention in responding to the questions posed to Him. His words serve as a formal protest against the spirit and tendency of the inquiry, as He questions the legality of His arrest and the manner in which He was coerced into His present situation. The questioners, however, have no genuine desire to examine and believe; their objective is instead to avoid involvement in complex matters. Jesus is well aware of their intentions, yet the time has come for the truth to be confessed, though the case has already been prejudged.
