# Luke 22:69 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, in response to the demand by the Pharisees to know if he is the Messiah, affirms that he is the Son of Man, indicating his humanity and his humble form at that time. The Jews regarded him as a mere man. However, they also recognized that this title is associated with the Messiah, particularly in the sense that the Messiah would have authority from God. Jesus not only claims equality with God, but he also demonstrates this by his resurrection, ascension, and the subsequent destruction of their nation, city, and temple.
