# Luke 22:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The day came when the passover lamb must be sacrificed, according to the law in Exodus 12:6, which states that it was to be done between the two evenings. The Synoptic Gospels clearly present this as a fact, with the lamb being slain by the head of the family. Additionally, the expression the first of them, the fourteenth day of the month Nisan emphasizes that the day itself arrived, not simply that it was drawing near. For further information on this subject, refer to the notes on Matthew 26:17 and John 18:28.
