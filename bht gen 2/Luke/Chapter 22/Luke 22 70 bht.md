# Luke 22:70 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The question posed is whether Jesus is the Son of God, a title associated with the Messiah. Jesus confirms that He is not only the Son of God but also the Son of Man. These were both known titles of the Messiah, reflecting His divine and human nature. Jesus affirms this by stating, Ye say that I am, acknowledging the truth of their statement. Thus, He claims to be the Messiah, embodying both divinity and humanity.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They ask about 'the Messiah.' Jesus affirms that he is the Son of Man and will sit at the right hand of the power of God. They take this to be a claim to be the Son of God (both humanity and deity). Jesus accepts the challenge and admits that he claims to be all three (Messiah, the Son of man, the Son of God)."
2. "Ye say (Hυμεις λεγετε). Just a Greek idiom for 'Yes' (compare 'I am' in Mark 14:62 with 'Thou has said' in Matthew 26:64)."

### John Gill:
1. "Art thou the Son of God?...They knew that the Messiah...was the Son of God." 
2. "Ye say that I am;...ye say it...it is the very truth." 
3. "For I am;...the Son of God."
