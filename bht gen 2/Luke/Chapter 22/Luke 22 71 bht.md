# Luke 22:71 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The witnesses brought forth were unnecessary, for the high priest acknowledged that they had heard Jesus speak the words themselves. In claiming to be the Son of God, Jesus made a statement that, if false, would justify the charge of blasphemy. However, if His claim is true, then it is those who accused Him of blasphemy that are in the wrong. The decision to pronounce Jesus as worthy of death is an eternal one, as all will have to come face to face with Christ as Judge.
