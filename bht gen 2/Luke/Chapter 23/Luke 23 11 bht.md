## BHT:

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "στρατ. are the bodyguard in attendance upon Herod." 
2. "ἐσθῆτα λαμπρ. Variously interpreted: either purple, as befitting a king, and why should this not be the very χλαμὺς κοκκίνη afterwards used by Pilate’s soldiers?" 
3. "or white, as λαμπρ. is rendered by some (but see note), Acts 10:30."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "stung with disappointment at His refusal to amuse him with miracles or answer any of his questions."
2. "But if so, 'He in reality honored Him, as did Pilate with His true title blazoned on the cross' [BENGEL]."
3. "Thus he implicated himself with Pilate in all the guilt of His condemnation, and with him accordingly he is classed."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "The Roman princes wore 'purple' robes, and 'Pilate,' therefore, put such a robe on Jesus."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Gorgeous [λαμπραν] . Lit., bright or brilliant."

### John Calvin:
1. "But the pride of Herod, which shut the door on the grace of God, admits of no excuse."
2. "Nor can it be doubted that God, in order to punish him for his former indifference, purposely hardened his heart by such a spectacle."
3. "For almost all courtiers, being addicted to pompous display, have their senses pre-occupied by so great vanity, that they carelessly despise, or pass by with closed eyes, the spiritual favors of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The motive was resentment at the silence of Jesus, though actual contempt was doubtless felt."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Set him at nought (εξουθενησας). First aorist active participle from εξουθενεω, to count as nothing, to treat with utter contempt, as zero." 
2. "Arraying him in gorgeous apparel (περιβαλων εσθητα λαμπραν). Second aorist active participle of περιβαλλω, to fling around one. Λαμπραν is brilliant, shining as in James 2:2, so different from the modest dress of the Master."

### John Gill:
1. "And Herod, with his men of war,.... Or his soldiers, his bodyguards that attended his person, who came with him from Galilee, and were both for his security and service, and for his pomp and magnificence"

3. "and mocked him; as a king, and made sport and pastime with him:and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe."

### John Wesley:
1. "Herod set him at nought — Probably judging him to be a fool, because he answered nothing."
