# Luke 23:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Pilate sent Jesus to Herod, it reconciled the two wicked men who previously had nothing in common. It pleased Herod that Pilate acknowledged his authority by sending someone under his jurisdiction to take cognizance of the case, while Pilate was pleased that Herod did not use his power but referred the case to the Roman governor. This act of reconciliation shows how the world disdains the children of God and religion itself. Hatred of religion often brings together wicked individuals who previously had been at odds, united in their opposition to Christ and His followers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "[...] apparently something concerning Herod‚Äôs power of jurisdiction, which was conceded by Pilate in this sending Jesus to him, and again waived by Herod in sending Him back again."
2. "The present feeling of Pilate was any thing but hostile to the person of Christ; and Herod, by his treatment of Him, shews that he thought Him beneath his judicial notice."
3. "This remission of Jesus to Herod seems not to have been known to either of the other three Evangelists. It is worthy of notice that they all relate the mocking by the soldiers of Pilate, which Luke omits, whereas he gives it as taking place before Herod."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was not because they were united in 'hating' Jesus, as is often the case with wicked people, for Pilate was certainly desirous of releasing him, and 'both' considered him merely as an object of ridicule and sport."
2. "It is true, however, that wicked people, at variance in other things, are often united in opposing and ridiculing Christ and his followers."
3. "Enmities of long standing are sometimes made up, and the most opposite characters brought together, simply to oppose religion."

### John Calvin:
1. "From the fact that Christ was the occasion of reconciling two wicked men, let us learn how much the children of God, and religion itself, are disdained by the world."
2. "Hatred of religion often produces mutual harmony among wicked men, so that those who formerly had nothing in common unite together to extinguish the name of God."
3. "Having first been reconciled to God, we ought to assist each other, by a devout and holy agreement, to follow righteousness, and to labor to discharge the duties of brotherly affection and of mutual humanity."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If the cause of the quarrel was some question of jurisdiction connected possibly with the occurrence mentioned in chap. Luke 13:1, we see a reason why a reconciliation now took place."
2. "Even if neither was directly hostile, practically the indecision of the one and the indifference of the other conspired to nail our Lord to the cross."
3. "It is easy to harmonize this account with those of Matthew and Mark, but more difficult to insert the occurrence in John‚Äôs narrative."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For before they were at enmity between themselves." 
2. "A periphrastic imperfect of the double compound œÄœÅŒøœÖœÄŒµœÅœáœâ, an old verb, to exist previously." 
3. "Here alone in the N.T., with ŒøŒΩœÑŒµœÇ (participle of ŒµŒπŒº) added."

### John Gill:
1. "For it pleased Herod, that Pilate should show such a regard to his authority and power, as to send one that belonged to his jurisdiction to take cognizance of his case."
2. "Pilate, on the other hand, was pleased with Herod, that though he was one that was under his jurisdiction, and so had a right of trying the cause, and either absolve or condemn, yet chose not to use this his power, but referred the case to the Roman governor."
3. "But now matters were made up by this step of Pilate's, in sending Christ to him, supposed to be a Galilean, and so of Herod's jurisdiction; which was tacitly acknowledging his former conduct to be wrong, and showed a regard to Herod's authority."
