# Luke 23:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Pilate, after a thorough examination (ανα) of Jesus, concludes that he is innocent and finds no fault or crime that justifies punishment, let alone death. He perceives no evidence or charges that prove Jesus guilty of any wrongdoing, even as he carefully considers every accusation presented against him. Pilate's meticulous examination reveals the absence of any basis for a guilty verdict.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Perverteth [αποστρεφοντα] . Another compound of strefw, to turn; diastrefonta is rendered by the same word in ver. 2."
2. "Diastrefonta implies more of the idea of distraction (compare Wyc., turning upside down); turning different ways; while ajpostrefonta emphasizes the turning away [απο] of the people from their civil and religious allegiance."
3. "Examined [ανακρινας] . Originally implying a thorough examination; ajna, up, from bottom to top. Technically, of a legal examination."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Pilate understands the charge against Jesus to be that he is a revolutionary agitator and a dangerous rival to Caesar, treason in plain words." 
2. "Right before your eyes I have given him a careful examination (ανα) up and down, κρινω, to judge, sift." 
3. "Attraction of the relative α to the case (genitive) of the unexpressed antecedent τουτων."

### John Gill:
1. "I have found no fault in this man; cannot perceive any charge proved against him, or any crime he is guilty of, for which punishment should be inflicted on him; or at least, that he should be put to death."
2. "He had carefully looked into, and examined every thing, and had omitted nothing, and that all their accusations, and charges, put together, did not make it appear that he was guilty of a single crime."
