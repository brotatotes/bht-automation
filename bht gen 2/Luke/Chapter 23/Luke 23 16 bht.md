# Luke 23:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Pilate, swayed by the Jews and their accusations, decided to chastise Jesus, not because he believed He was guilty, but to appease them and persuade them to change their mind. This act of punishment would make it appear that Jesus had done something wrong, and Pilate hoped that this would satisfy the Jews and spare Jesus from death, which was his desire. Ultimately, Pilate's intention was to release Jesus and set Him free from his bonds.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "If there be no fault in Him, why should He be corrected at all?"
2. "The Jews perceive their advantage, and from this moment follow it up."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'chastise' here means to 'scourge or to whip.'"
2. "It was as 'really' unjust to do that as it was to crucify him."
3. "Man should do his duty in all situations; and he that, like Pilate, seeks only for public favor and popularity, will assuredly be led into crime."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Chastise [παιδευσας]. Originally to bring up a child [παις]. Hence, to instruct, so Acts 7:22, of Moses instructed in the wisdom of the Egyptians; and Acts 22:3, of Paul instructed in the law."
2. "The word is not synonymous with punish, since it always implies an infliction which contemplates the subject's amendment; and hence answers to chastise or chasten."
3. "Chasten is from the Latin castus, 'pure,' 'chaste;' and to chasten is, properly, to purify. This meaning underlies even the use of the word by Pilate, who was not likely to be nice in his choice of words. Instead of punishing him with death, he will chastise him, in order to teach him better. So Wyc., I shall deliver him amended."

### John Calvin:
1. "But earthly men, who are not confirmed by the Spirit of God in a constant wish to do what is right, even though they are desirous to maintain integrity, are accustomed, in this manner, to yield so far as to commit small injuries, when they are compelled."
2. "The Popish clergy persecute his holy servants with the same cruelty with which the Jewish priests cried out, demanding that Christ should be put to death."
3. "Yet in their defense they plead the violence of his enemies; as if this pretense were a sufficient cloak for their treacherous cowardice, which, if it was not excusable in Pilate, deserves to be viewed in them with the highest detestation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Pilate ought to have said: I will release without any punishment. His want of moral earnestness now appears."
2. "This was a concession, and an illegal one, since he declares Jesus to be innocent."
3. "If he was willing to chastise Jesus illegally, why could he not be forced to crucify Him."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Chastise (παιδευσας). First aorist active participle of παιδευω, to train a child (παις), and then, as a part of the training, punishment."
2. "Our English word chasten is from the Latin castus, pure, chaste, and means to purify (cf. Hebrews 12:6)."
3. "Perhaps Pilate may have split a hair over the word as Wycliff puts it: 'I shall deliver him amended.' But, if Jesus was innocent, Pilate had no doubt to 'chastise' him to satisfy a mob."

### John Gill:
1. "This he proposed, not because he thought him deserving of it, but in complaisance to the Jews; since it would look as if their charges were not altogether weak and groundless."
2. "This would carry a show of guilt and punishment, and he hoped this might be thought sufficient, and so he should please them, and save Jesus from dying, which he much desired."
3. "Release him; from his bonds, and let him go."

### John Wesley:
1. I will therefore chastise him — Here Pilate began to give ground, which only encouraged them to press on. Matthew 27:15; Mark 15:6; John 18:39.
