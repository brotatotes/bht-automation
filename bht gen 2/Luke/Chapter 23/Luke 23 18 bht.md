# Luke 23:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The entire multitude, consisting of the chief priests, rulers, and people, collectively and vociferously objected to any talk of releasing him. Their outcry was forceful and filled with animosity, urging for his immediate removal. Calvary, the execution site, was where they demanded he be taken away and carried out of their lives. In stark contrast, they ardently requested the release of Barabbas, a criminal whose character is expounded upon later.
