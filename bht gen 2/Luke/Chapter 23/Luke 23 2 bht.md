# Luke 23:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus was falsely accused by the Sanhedrin of perverting the nation through false doctrine and teaching seditious principles. However, in reality, he taught the true doctrine and opposed the corrupt traditions of the Pharisees and elders. Moreover, Jesus emphasized the importance of giving Caesar what belonged to him and even paid the tribute money himself. He demonstrated his commitment to peace and humility by avoiding attempts to make him a king. The Sanhedrin's accusations were not only false but also misrepresented Jesus' teachings and intentions.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This charge was intended to represent the result of their previous judgment,  εὕραμεν  ; whereas, in fact,  no such matter had been before them: but they falsely allege it before Pilate, knowing that it was the point on which his judgment was likely to be most severe."
2. "The words themselves which they use are not so false, as the spirit, and impression which they convey."
3. "The  κωλύοντα φ  .   Κ  .   διδ  . was, however,  false entirely (see ch. Luke 20:22 ff.); and is just one of those instances where those who are determined to effect their purpose by falsehood, do so, in spite of the fact having been precisely the contrary to that which they assert."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We found this man."
2. "Perverting the nation."
3. "They did not say that he 'taught' that people should not give tribute - that would have been too gross a charge, and would have been easily refuted; but it was an 'inference' which they drew."

### Marvin Vincent:

### Philip Schaff:

2. "They thus represent themselves as genuine friends of the people."
3. "This involved what was true. But from this single element of truth they deduced certain political results, which had never occurred, and by putting these false inferences in the foreground sought to obtain sentence of death against our Lord."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They had indulged their hatred in doing it, but they no longer have the power of life and death."
2. "The Sanhedrin imply that the great popularity of Jesus was seditious."
3. "Jesus did claim to be the Christ and the king of the kingdom of God. But the Sanhedrin wanted Pilate to think that he set himself up as a rival to Caesar."

### John Gill:
1. "he was so far from perverting the nation with false doctrine and worship, that he taught the true doctrine, and right way of worship, and refuted the false glosses of the Pharisees, and opposed the vain traditions of the elders, by which both were corrupted"
2. "so far was he from any seditious principles and practices, or doing any injury to Tiberius Caesar, the then reigning emperor, that he taught the people to give Caesar the things that were Caesar's, and he himself paid the tribute money"
