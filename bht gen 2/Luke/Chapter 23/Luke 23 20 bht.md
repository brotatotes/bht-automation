# Luke 23:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The act of speaking, or spake, implies direct communication with either an individual or a crowd, similar to how it is used in Acts 21:40 and Acts 22:2. The speaker's conviction of the accused person's innocence grows over time as they see more clearly the malicious intentions and envy of those who accuse them. The speaker's words unmistakably indicate their belief in the accused's innocence and their plea for their release.
