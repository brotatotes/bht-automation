# Luke 23:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Pilate questioned, Why, what evil hath he done? Seeking an explanation for the accusations against Jesus, Pilate tried to understand the specific crimes Jesus was being charged with. It is evident that Pilate found no cause of death in Jesus and saw him as innocent, not deserving of such a shameful and painful death. Pilate even suggested the option of chastising Jesus and letting him go, hoping for compromise and reconciliation. In contrast to the disciple Peter's denial of Christ, Pilate, a heathen, acknowledged the innocence of Jesus, inadvertently honoring him.

### John Wesley:
