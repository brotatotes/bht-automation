# Luke 23:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this particular moment, the narrative introduces Barabbas, a man described as detestable due to his involvement in insurrection and murder. Despite this unfavorable character, he is granted freedom while Jesus is handed over to be mocked, scourged, and ultimately crucified. The abrupt transition in the story accentuates the stark contrast between the actions of the crowd, who clamorously advocated for Barabbas' release, and the abandonment of justice in favor of an unjust mob rule.
