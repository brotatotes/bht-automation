## BHT:
The crowd witnessing the event consisted of people from all parts who had come to the Passover, adding to the size. The lack of mourning from the crowd stemmed from the belief that Christ's death atoned for their own sins. However, there were individuals who mourned out of a genuine tenderness of spirit and a sense of sorrow for the suffering of such an innocent and beneficial person as Christ.
