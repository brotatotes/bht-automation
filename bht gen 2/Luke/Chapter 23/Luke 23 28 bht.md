# Luke 23:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ's words to the women of Jerusalem tell us that they need not weep for Him, for He willingly chose to die. They should redirect their sorrow towards themselves and their children, mourning for the sins of all, including the sin of crucifying Him. Understanding the cause of Christ's death requires meditation, as God allowed His Son to suffer so severely only to be an expiation for the sins of the world. The impending calamities that would befall Jerusalem, including the siege, would lead to the suffering and demise of those who were lamenting Him at that moment.
