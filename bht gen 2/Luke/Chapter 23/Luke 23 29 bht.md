# Luke 23:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Blessed are those women who are childless, for they will be spared from the unimaginable horrors that will befall those who have children. In those desperate times, some mothers will be so deprived of food that they will resort to killing and eating their own children. This gruesome act will evoke not only revulsion but also empathy from onlookers, as they understand the desperation and anguish that compelled these mothers to commit such unspeakable acts. This prophecy serves as a warning of the impending doom and emphasizes the extreme suffering that will befall Jerusalem.
