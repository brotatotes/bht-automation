# Luke 23:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Pilate inquired if Jesus was the King of the Jews, Jesus confirmed Pilate's statement by responding, Thou sayest it. However, Jesus did not stop there; he further clarified what kind of king he was and the nature of his kingdom. This additional explanation by Jesus likely put Pilate at ease and perhaps even made him consider releasing Jesus, as suggested by the subsequent events.
