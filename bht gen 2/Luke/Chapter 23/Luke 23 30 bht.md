# Luke 23:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The imminent destruction of Jerusalem is described using language from the prophecy of Hosea. The severity of the tribulation is unparalleled, surpassing any previous calamity and those that will come after. Just as the people of Jerusalem sought hiding places during the siege, they will desperately try to find refuge from the impending judgment. The choice to be buried under the falling mountains and hills rather than face the dreadful distress reflects the extreme anguish they will experience.
