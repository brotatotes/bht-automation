# Luke 23:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When considering the sufferings of Christ, we are reminded of the judgment that awaits the unrepentant. The metaphor of the green tree represents the innocent and righteous, while the dry tree symbolizes the guilty. If such sufferings come upon the green tree, how much worse will be the judgment for those who provoke it? The sufferings of Christ serve as a warning of the unspeakable dread that awaits the wicked. It is a solemn reminder of the consequences of rejecting the salvation offered through Christ.

2. "He, the vine, the green tree, the fruit-bearing tree, of Whom His people are the branches, if He, if they in Him and in themselves, are so treated, so tried with sufferings, what shall become of them who are cast forth as a branch and are withered?"
3. "The explanations which make the green-tree = the young, and the dry = the old, or the green-tree = the women, comparatively innocent, the dry = the guilty at the destruction of Jerusalem seem to me unworthy of the place which the words hold."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If such sufferings alight upon the innocent One, the very Lamb of God, what must be in store for those who are provoking the flames?" 
2. "green treeâ€”that naturally resists the fire."
3. "the dryâ€”that attracts the fire, being its proper fuel."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If they do these things in a green tree ... what will they not do in relation to this guilty nation?"
2. "The sufferings of the Saviour, as compared with the sufferings of the guilty, were like the burning of a green tree as compared with the burning of one that is dry."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Tree [Î¾Ï…Î»Ï‰] . Originally wood, timber. In later Greek, a tree. Used of the cross by Peter, Acts 5:30; Acts 10:39; and 1 Peter 2:24. Compare Galatians 3:13.

### John Calvin:
1. "The phrase, if they do, may be taken indefinitely for if it be done, and the meaning will be: 'If green wood is thrown into the fire before the time, what, think you, shall become of what is dry and old?'"
2. "The general meaning is, that the lamentation of the women is foolish if they do not likewise expect and dread the awful judgment of God which hangs over the wicked."
3. "And whenever our distress of mind, arising from the bitterness of the cross, goes to excess, it is proper to soothe it by this consolation, that God, who now permits his own people to be unjustly oppressed, will not ultimately allow the wicked to escape punishment."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In proverbial form our Lord here contrasts what is coming upon Himself, â€˜the green tree,â€™ the fruitful vine, the innocent one when He bore our sins, with what would come upon them, 'the dry tree,' the unfruitful ones standing to bear their own judgment."
2. "'These things' must be interpreted as a judgment on sin, or the contrast fails."
3. "At such a time nothing could be more appropriate than an allusion to His vicarious work. He could not avert the judgment. He must announce, but even at the last joins with it a thought of His work for sinners."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Green wood is hard to burn and so is used for the innocent."
2. "Dry wood kindles easily and is a symbol for the guilty."
3. "If they can put Jesus to death, being who he is, what will happen to Jerusalem when its day of judgment comes?"

### John Gill:
1. "The metaphor seems designed to express the righteousness and innocence of Christ...and yet, how many hard and grievous things were done unto him!"
2. "To which may be added, that he was forsaken by his God, and Father, and his wrath was poured out upon him...and justice drew its sword, and sheathed it in him."
3. "The wicked Jews that rejected Christ, and crucified him, are particularly meant; and if such evil things were done by them to so just a person, what may not be expected will fall on them in retaliation for such usage?"

### John Wesley:
1. "If they do these things in the green tree, what shall be done in the dry?" - Our Lord makes use of a proverbial expression, frequent among the Jews, who compare a good man to a green tree, and a bad man to a dead one.
2. "If an innocent person suffer thus, what will become of the wicked?" - If an innocent person suffer thus, what will become of the wicked?
