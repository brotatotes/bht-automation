# Luke 23:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Luke 23:32, we see that two others were led with Jesus. It is interesting to note that the focus seems to be solely on Jesus, not on the sympathy for the other two. Jesus, who was considered a malefactor by the Jews, was united with them, despite being in a different category altogether. The death he suffered, crucifixion, was a punishment reserved for the worst and most despicable criminals, such as slaves, thieves, and robbers. Understanding this context enhances our understanding of the significance and uniqueness of Jesus' sacrifice.
