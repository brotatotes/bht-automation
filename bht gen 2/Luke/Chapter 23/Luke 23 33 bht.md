# Luke 23:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The place where Christ was crucified is called Calvary or Golgotha, which means skull and is likely named for its resemblance to a skull. It is believed by some that this is where Adam, the first man, was buried. Crucifixion often occurred on high places or mountains, so it is fitting that Jesus was crucified on a hill, fulfilling the prophecy in Isaiah 53:12. Jesus was crucified between two robbers on the same cross intended for Barabbas, the leader of the robber band. This act of crucifixion is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies.

1. Calvary [κρανιον] . The Greek word is the translation of the Hebrew Golgotha. See on Matthew 27:33. 35 - 43. Compare Matthew 27:39-44; Mark 14:29-32.
