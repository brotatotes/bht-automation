# Luke 23:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our Lord's time on the cross was mostly silent, yet the four evangelists captured seven sentences that He spoke during that time. It is remarkable that, as they were nailing Him to the cross, He seemed to be more concerned about the injury they were doing to their own souls than the wounds they gave Him. In His anguish, He prayed for their forgiveness and salvation, and His prayer was not in vain. It brought about forgiveness for the penitent and a suspension of vengeance for the impenitent.
