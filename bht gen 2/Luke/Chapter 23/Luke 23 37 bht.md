# Luke 23:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The mockery expressed in the statement, If thou art the King of the Jews, save thyself, reveals the soldiers' rejection of Jesus as the divine Messiah. However, this statement also carries a deeper meaning. Jesus could not save himself if he was to fulfill his purpose of saving others. The soldiers' demand for Jesus to save himself from the cross reflects their lack of understanding of the greater redemptive plan that Jesus was undertaking.
