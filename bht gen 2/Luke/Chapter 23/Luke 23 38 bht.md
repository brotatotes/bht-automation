# Luke 23:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A superscription was written, stating the crime Jesus was charged with and accused of. This inscription was placed over Him on the projecting upright beam of the cross. Luke mentions this title later than the other Evangelists, perhaps because the sneer of the soldiers suggested the mention of Pilate's mockery in writing this superscription. The title read, This is Jesus of Nazareth the King of the Jews, appearing in Latin, Aramaic, and Greek for all to understand. (Matthew 27:37; Mark 15:26; John 19:19)
