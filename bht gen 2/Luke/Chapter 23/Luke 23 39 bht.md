# Luke 23:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Amidst the mockery and reviling, both the soldiers and the thief echoed the same taunts thrown at Jesus by the religious authorities and the crowd. While the thief's words may have been influenced by a desire to please the rulers and secure his own release, they also revealed the deep wickedness and unrepentant heart within him. It is possible that there was initially a shared reviling from both thieves, until one of them experienced the transforming power of God's grace.
