## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Pilate must have known well that a man who had really done that, whereof Jesus was accused, would be no such object of hatred to the Sanhedrim."
2. "This knowledge was doubtless accompanied (as the above-cited verses imply) with a previous acquaintance with some of the sayings and doings of Jesus, from which Pilate had probably formed his own opinion that He was no such King as His foes would represent Him."
3. "This is now confirmed by His own words (as related by John); and Pilate wishes to dismiss Him, finding no fault in Him."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I find no fault - I see no evidence that he is guilty of what you charge him with."
2. "This was after Pilate had taken Jesus into the judgment-hall by himself and examined him 'privately,' and had been satisfied in regard to the nature of his kingdom."
3. "He was 'then' satisfied that though he claimed to be 'a king,' yet his kingdom was not of this world, and that 'his' claims did not interfere with those of Caesar."

### John Calvin:
1. "As Christ was come to bear the punishment of our sins, it was proper that he should first be condemned by the mouth of his judge, that it might afterwards be evident that he was condemned for the sake of others, and not for his own."
2. "But as Pilate, from a dread of exciting a tumult, did not venture absolutely to acquit him, he willingly availed himself of the opportunity which presented itself, of submitting him to the jurisdiction of Herod."
3. "This Herod was he who bears the surname of Antipas to whom was left the tetrarchy of Galilee, when Archelaus was a prisoner at Vienna, and when Judea had been annexed to the province of Syria."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I find no fault in this man." - Pilate speaks as a judge. 
2. "Knowing that the Sanhedrin would have no desire to put to death any one for the political crime alleged." 
3. "He examines our Lord and satisfies himself that no such political crime was involved in His claim to be King of the Jews."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The procession of the Sanhedrin would draw a crowd (Plummer) and some may have come to ask for the release of a prisoner (Mark 15:8)."
2. "Luke does not give the explanation of this sudden decision of Pilate that Jesus is innocent. Evidently he held a careful examination before he delivered his judgment on the case."
3. "Pilate took Jesus inside the palace from the upper gallery (John 18:33) and then came out and rendered his decision to the Sanhedrin (John 18:38) who would not go into the palace of Pilate (John 18:28)."

### John Gill:
