## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Bengel supports the notion that this penitent thief was a Gentile. But surely this is an unwarranted assumption. What should a Gentile know of Paradise, or of the kingdom of the Messiah as about to come?"
2. "The silence of the penitent is broken by the ἡμᾶς of the other compromising him in the scoff."
3. "οὐδέ alludes to the multitude. Dost thou too not fear God? ὅτι (as thou oughtest to do), seeing that…."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Let others jeer, but dost thou?"
2. "Thou art within an hour or two of eternity, and dost thou spend it in reckless disregard of coming judgment?"
3. "Doth even a common lot kindle no sympathy in thy breast?"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is improper for you to rail on him as the rulers and Romans do. God is just, and you are hastening to his bar, and you should, therefore, fear him, and fear that he will punish you for railing on this innocent man."
2. "Same condemnation - Condemnation to death; not death for the same thing, but the same 'kind' of death."

### John Calvin:
1. "In this wicked man a striking mirror of the unexpected and incredible grace of God is held out to us"
2. "First, then, a remarkable instance of the grace of God shines in the conversion of that man."
3. "For it was not by the natural movement of the flesh that he laid aside his fierce cruelty and proud contempt of God, so as to repent immediately, but he was subdued by the hand of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The two were probably placed on either side of Jesus to carry out the taunt that this was the King of the Jews, and these the (Jewish) subjects."
2. "The reason he ought to fear God is: seeing thou art in the same condemnation, i.e., with this One whom you are railing at."

### John Gill:
1. "Dost not thou fear God, any more than these priests, people, and soldiers, that are acting such a barbarous and inhuman part to a man in misery?"
2. "Wilt thou do the same, and show that thou art an impious wretch, now thou art just going out of the world, and neither fears God, nor regards man, and art without compassion to a fellow sufferer, adding sin to sin?"
3. "Seeing thou art in the same condemnation? undergoing the same sort of punishment, though not on the same account."

### John Wesley:
