## BHT:
The condemned criminal acknowledged the justice in his punishment, recognizing that their crimes warranted such a fate.

With this declaration, the dying criminal affirmed the truth of Jesus' claims and bore witness to His blamelessness, even in the face of their shared crucifixion.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He classes himself with the other in condemnation, but not in his prayer afterwards."
2. "This is a remarkable testimony to the innocence of Jesus from one who was probably executed for his share in those very tumults which He was accused of having excited."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He made Himself the promised Messiah, the Son of God; but in this He 'did nothing amiss'; He ate with publicans and sinners, and bade all the weary and heavy laden come and rest under His wing; but in this He 'did nothing amiss': He claimed to be Lord of the Kingdom of God, to shut it at will, but also to open it at pleasure even to such as we are; but in this He 'did nothing amiss!'"
2. "His frank confession and genuine self-condemnation."
3. "His noble testimony, not only to the innocence of Jesus, but to all that this implied of the rightfulness of His claims."

### Albert Barnes:

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "Lit., out of place, and so strange, eccentric, perverse; as in 2 Thessalonians 3:2, where it is rendered unreasonable."

### John Calvin:
1. "The robber here draws a distinction between the condition of Christ and that of himself and his companion, or he acknowledges, that the punishment which was common to all the three was justly inflicted on him and his companion, but not on Christ..."
2. "...the robber gave a proof of his repentance, such as God demands from all of us, when he acknowledged that he was now receiving the reward due to his actions."
3. "And, therefore, if we truly repent of our crimes, let us learn to confess them willingly and without hypocrisy, whenever it is necessary, and not to refuse the disgrace which we have deserved."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He speaks like a true penitent; for the connection with the last verse involves a reference to God's justice."
2. "Even had the robber said nothing more than this, yet he would awaken our deepest astonishment, that God in a moment wherein literally all voices are raised against Jesus, and not a friendly word is heard in his favor causes a witness for the spotless innocence of the Saviour to appear on one of the crosses beside Him."
3. "His faith becomes stronger, for he now turns to Christ Himself. He believed in Christ's innocence, yet believed in the justice of God. There must have been a practical acceptance of our Lord's atoning sacrifice, or the bold faith of his petition has no sufficient foundation."
