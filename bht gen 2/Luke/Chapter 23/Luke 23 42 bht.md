In the face of suffering and imminent death, the criminal on the cross displayed remarkable faith in Jesus as the true King and Messiah. He acknowledged Jesus as the King of kings and Lord of lords, believing in His power to establish and enter into His kingdom.

Through this simple yet profound act of faith, the criminal demonstrated that salvation and redemption are accessible to all, regardless of their circumstances or past.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "His faith lays hold on the truth that this is the King of the Jews in a higher and immortal sense."
2. "What is really astounding is the power and strength of that faith, which, amidst shame and pain and mockery, could thus lift itself to the apprehension of the Crucified as this King."
3. "It will be seen that there is no necessity for supposing the man to have been a disciple, as some have done."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It implied that he believed that Jesus was what he claimed to be - the Messiah; that, though he was dying with them, yet he would set up his kingdom; and that he had full power to bless him, though about to expire."
2. "Such a result of preaching the gospel would not have been unlike what has often occurred since, where, while the gospel has been proclaimed, one has been 'taken and another left;' one has been melted to repentance, another has been more hardened in guilt."
3. "This was a case of repentance in the last hour, the trying hour of death; and it has been remarked that one was brought to repentance there, to show that no one should 'despair' on a dying bed; and 'but' one, that none should be presumptuous and delay repentance to that awful moment."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Into thy kingdom. Some texts read eijv, into, ejn, in. So Rev. In that case we must understand, "in thy kingly glory."

### John Calvin:
1. "A robber, who not only had not been educated in the school of Christ, but, by giving himself up to execrable murders, had endeavored to extinguish all sense of what was right, suddenly rises higher than all the apostles and the other disciples whom the Lord himself had taken so much pains to instruct..."
2. "But that a person, ignorant and uneducated, and whose mind was altogether corrupted, should all at once, on receiving his earliest instructions, perceive salvation and heavenly glory in the accursed cross, was truly astonishing."
3. "To the flesh it must have appeared to be fabulous and absurd, to ascribe to one who was rejected and despised, whom the world could not endure, an earthly kingdom more exalted than all the empires of the world."


### Philip Schaff:
1. "He does not ask liberation from the cross, but is satisfied to cast himself on the personal love and care of the Being hanging in torture beside him."
2. "The manâ€™s faith recognized Jesus, not as one who would become King, but who was King, and as such would appear again, not as now, but in His royal dignity."
3. "It detracts nothing from the manâ€™s faith to suppose that he himself cherished some of the common Jewish expectations when he thus spoke. But whatever his belief about the kingdom, his faith in the King was implicit."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

### John Wesley:
1. "Remember me when thou comest - From heaven, in thy kingdom."
2. "He acknowledges him a king, and such a king, as after he is dead, can profit the dead."
