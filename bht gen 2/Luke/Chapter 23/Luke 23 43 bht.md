# Luke 23:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Today, Jesus promises that the thief will be with him in paradise, the future place of eternal happiness and glory for the saints. This is the same paradise that the Jews often refer to as heaven. Jesus specifically tells the thief that he will be with him in paradise today, emphasizing that his reward will be immediate. This incident serves as a clear and simple example of the plan of salvation, demonstrating God's ability to remember and save even the most undeserving.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Lord surpasses his prayer in the answer; the ἀμήν σοι λέγω, σήμερον, is the reply to the uncertain ὅταν of the thief."
2. "By the death of Christ only was Paradise first opened, in the true sense of the word."
3. "That this is not fulness of glory as yet, is evident; for the glorified body is not yet joined to their spirits, they are not yet perfect; but it is a degree of bliss compared to which their former degree was but as imprisonment."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It was a 'song in the night.' It ministered cheer to His spirit in the midnight gloom that now enwrapt it." 
2. "Thou shalt not be parted from Me even for a moment, but together we shall go, and with Me, ere this day expire, shalt thou be in Paradise."
3. "Learn (1) How 'One is taken and another left'; (2) How easily divine teaching can raise the rudest and worst above the best instructed and most devoted servants of Christ; (3) How presumption and despair on a death hour are equally discountenanced here, the one in the impenitent thief, the other in his penitent fellow."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jesus told him that his prayer would be answered that very day, implying, evidently, that it would be 'immediately' at death."
2. "The word [Paradise] came thus to denote any place of happiness, and was used particularly to denote the abodes of the blessed in another world."
3. "The plain meaning of the passage is, 'Today thou shalt be made happy, or be received to a state of blessedness with me after death.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In Paradise [παραδεισω] . Originally an enclosed park, or pleasure - ground."
2. "In the Jewish theology, the department of Hades where the blessed souls await the resurrection; and therefore equivalent to Abraham's bosom."
3. "Each on his cross, by Thee we hang awhile, Watching thy patient smile, Till we have learn'd to say, 'Tis justly done, Only in glory, Lord, thy sinful servant own."

### John Calvin:
1. "Nothing more lofty or magnificent belongs to a divine King than to restore life to the dead."
2. "There is therefore no room to doubt that [Christ] is prepared to admit into his kingdom all, without exception, who shall apply to him."
3. "Whoever then in dying shall commit to Christ, in true faith, the keeping of his soul, will not be long detained or allowed to languish in suspense; but Christ will meet his prayer with the same kindness which he exercised towards the robber."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The promise implies first of all that both should die that day, instead of lingering long, as was often the case, and then that both should that day pass to the same place: shalt thou be with me in Paradise."
2. "If this is borne in mind we have a check to the many fancies which are wont to gather about the word Paradise as here used."
3. "There is, however, a more extended view: that our Lord went down into the depths of death to announce His triumph and thus transfer those in ‘Abraham’s bosom’ into ‘the Paradise of God’ (comp. 1 Peter 3:18-19), and that as the robber died after Him (John 19:32-33) the former passed at once into this Paradise."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He promises him immediate and conscious fellowship after death with Christ in Paradise which is a Persian word and is used here not for any supposed intermediate state; but the very bliss of heaven itself."
2. "This Persian word was used for an enclosed park or pleasure ground (so Xenophon). The word occurs in two other passages in the N.T. (2 Corinthians 12:4; Revelation 2:7), in both of which the reference is plainly to heaven."
3. "Some Jews did use the word for the abode of the pious dead till the resurrection, interpreting 'Abraham's bosom' (Luke 16:22) in this sense also. But the evidence for such an intermediate state is too weak to warrant belief in it."

### John Gill:
1. "Verily I say unto thee, today thou shall be with me in paradise;… in the future place, and state of the happiness of the saints, even heaven, and eternal glory, which the Jews frequently call by this name."
2. "Jesus did not say, 'Today shall ye be with me in paradise', but 'Today shalt thou be with me in paradise.'"
3. "Too, it is doubtful whether any other gospel incident presents the plan of salvation more clearly or simply."

### John Wesley:
1. "In paradise - The place where the souls of the righteous remain from death till the resurrection."
2. "I will not only remember thee then, but this very day."
