# Luke 23:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
At the sixth hour, which is around noon, the darkness covered the sun, obscuring the upper hemisphere, while the moon, being in opposition to the sun, added to the darkness in the lower hemisphere. The darkness during this time was so intense that it caused the sky to become dark, leading to a powerful symbolism of the spiritual darkness that Jesus was experiencing on the cross.
