# Luke 23:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The darkness that covered the land was not a mere natural eclipse, as it was the time of a full moon. Instead, it was a preternatural event that lasted three hours and darkened the entire earth. This fulfilled the prophecy in Amos 8:9, signifying the gravity of the moment. Additionally, it is worth noting that the veil of the temple was torn in two, symbolizing the barrier between God and humanity being removed due to the sacrifice of Jesus.
