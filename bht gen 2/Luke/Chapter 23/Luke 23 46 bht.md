# Luke 23:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus said, Father, into thy hands I commend my Spirit, he was not referring to the Holy Spirit or his divine nature. Rather, he entrusted his human soul to the care and protection of God. This act demonstrates that his spirit belonged to God, the Father of spirits, and was immortal. It also shows that the spirit had the ability to exist separately from the body and go immediately to heaven. In doing this, Jesus set an example for his followers, reminding them that they too can commit their souls into the same loving hands of the Father.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "They accompany that, which in our Lord’s case was strictly speaking the act of death. It was His own act not ‘feeling the approach of death,’ as some, not apprehending the matter, have commented; but a determinate delivering up of His spirit to the Father." 
2. "The πνεῦμα here is the Personality, the human soul informed by the Spirit, in union: not separated, so that His soul went to Hades, and His spirit to the Father."
3. "Both are delivered into the hand of the Father by Whom quickened He worked His great victory over death and Hell."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. I commend [παρατιθεμαι] . See on ch. Luke 9:16. Gave up the ghost [εξεπνευσεν] . Lit., breathed out (his life). Wyc., sent out the spirit. See on Matthew 27:50. 47 - 49. Compare Matthew 27:51-56; Mark 14:38-41.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Our Lord dies with Scriptural words on His lips (Psalms 31:5)."
2. "In this prayer which came after the sixth word (‘It is finished’), with its announcement of the completed work, our Lord freely gives up His spirit to the Father."
3. "Whoever could think that Jesus, with these words, breathed out His life forever into the empty air, such an one certainly knows nothing of the true, living spirit, and, consequently, nothing of the living God, and of the living power of the crucified One."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus dies with the words of Psalms 31:5 on his lips."
2. "There is no special reason for retaining 'ghost' in the English as both Matthew 27:50 (yielded up his spirit, αφηκεν το πνευμα) and John 19:30 (gave up his spirit, παρεδωκεν το πνευμα) use πνευμα which is the root of εκπνεω, the verb in Mark and Luke."

### John Gill:
1. "Father, into thy hands I commend my Spirit; not the Holy Spirit, nor his divine nature, but his human soul...he committed it to his divine care and protection; and to enjoy his presence, during its separation from his body" 
2. "this shows, that his spirit, or soul, belonged to God, the Father of spirits, and now returned to him that gave it; that it was immortal, and died not with the body, and was capable of existing in a separate state from it, and went immediately to heaven"
3. "what the dying head did, dying members may, and should, even commit their souls into the same hands"

### John Wesley:
1. Father, into thy hands — The Father receives the Spirit of Jesus: Jesus himself the spirits of the faithful.
