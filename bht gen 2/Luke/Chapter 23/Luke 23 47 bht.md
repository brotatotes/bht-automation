# Luke 23:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The centurion, upon witnessing the events, glorified God and confessed, Certainly, this was a righteous man. His conversion was deeply impacted by what he saw, recognizing the truthfulness of Jesus' claim to be the Son of God. While both confessions might have been made, it is more likely that the other Gospel writers accurately captured the essence of the centurion's words. The centurion's acknowledgement of Jesus as a righteous man validates his teachings and actions.
