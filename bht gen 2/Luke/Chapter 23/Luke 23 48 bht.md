## BHT:
The people who had witnessed the crucifixion but were not directly involved in it returned, smiting their breasts, a sign of their deep sorrow and remorse for their role in the crucifixion. This action was an acknowledgment of guilt and a recognition that they were deserving of some form of judgement. It serves as a powerful reminder of the weight and consequences of their actions.
