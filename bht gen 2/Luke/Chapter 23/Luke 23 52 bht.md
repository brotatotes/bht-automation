# Luke 23:52 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Luke 23:52 tells us that Joseph of Arimathea, described as a bold man, went to Pilate to request the body of Jesus. Mark 15:43-45 provides more details about this request, stating that Joseph begged for the body of Jesus, fully aware that Jesus was dead. The purpose of Joseph's request was to give Jesus a proper burial, ensuring that He would not be left with the two criminals or mistreated by the crowd.
