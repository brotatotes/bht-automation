# Luke 23:53 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After Jesus was taken down from the cross, he was wrapped in linen, following the Jewish burial customs. Then, his body was laid in a tomb that was hewn in stone, carefully cut out of a rock. This location was significant, as no one had ever been laid there before, ensuring that it was indeed Jesus' body that was raised from the dead. This detail adds weight to the reality of his resurrection.
