# Luke 23:54 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On the day of the Preparation, the day before the Sabbath, it was customary for every household to have a lamp lit on the Sabbath, even if they had nothing to eat. This was considered part of the joy of the Sabbath. As evening approached, the lamps would be lit all around, signifying the beginning of the Sabbath. In fact, the evening of any day was often referred to as light by the Jews. This sheds light on the timing of events, as the Jewish Sabbath began at sundown rather than at sunrise.

2. "So that when these lamps were every where lighting, before the sun was set, and the sabbath properly come, it might be said to draw on, or to be shining forth."
3. "Besides, it was usual to call the evening of any day by the name of 'light': thus it is said, 'on the light (i.e. the night) of the fourteenth (of the month "Nisan"), they search for leaven, &c.'"
