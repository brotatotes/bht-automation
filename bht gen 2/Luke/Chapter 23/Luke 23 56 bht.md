## BHT:
They diligently prepared spices and ointments to anoint and embalm the body of Christ, which were considered important for the burial customs of that time. The women faithfully observed the Sabbath, not yet aware of the future changes in the law. After the Sabbath had passed, they hastened to the sepulcher to anoint the body, as it was not permissible to do so on a Sabbath day.
