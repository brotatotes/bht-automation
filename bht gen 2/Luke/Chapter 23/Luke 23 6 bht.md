# Luke 23:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Pilate learned that Jesus was from Galilee, he asked if he belonged to Herod's jurisdiction. This question arose because Galilee fell under Herod's authority, and knowing this detail could provide Pilate with an opportunity to pass the responsibility for Jesus onto someone else. Indeed, Jesus spent a significant part of his life in Galilee, as he was born in Bethlehem but grew up in Nazareth. This connection with Galilee was well-known, and it played a role in identifying Jesus as a Galilean.
