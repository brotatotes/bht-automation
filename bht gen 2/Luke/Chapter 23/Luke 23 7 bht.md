# Luke 23:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, knowing that he fell under Herod's jurisdiction, was sent to him to be examined and have his case tried. This decision was made with the intention of respecting Herod's authority and allowing him to exercise his proper role as judge in this matter. It is worth noting that Herod, being a Jew himself, had come to Jerusalem at that time to observe the feast of the passover.
