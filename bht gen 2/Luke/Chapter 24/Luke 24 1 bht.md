# Luke 24:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ rose from the dead on the day that fulfilled the Scriptures and his own predictions. The women, mentioned in this passage, set out from the city or its suburbs while it was still dark. By the time they reached the sepulchre, the sun had risen. They had brought the spices they had prepared on the eve of the Sabbath, with the intention of anointing Jesus' body, but their plans were hindered by the observance of the Sabbath regulations.
