# Luke 24:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The testimonies of the disciples who went to Emmaus served as the foundation for the entire preceding section of this chapter. Mary Magdalene, who had been healed by Jesus from demonic possession, was the first to witness His resurrection. Joanna, the wife of Herod's steward, was a devoted follower of Christ and had supported Him financially. Mary, the mother of James, Joses, Simon, and Judas, was also among the women who faithfully reported the events to the apostles. Each of these individuals played a vital role in proclaiming the resurrection of Jesus.
