# Luke 24:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The linen bandages in which Jesus' body had been wrapped lay in one place, while the napkin that had been wrapped around his head was in a separate place. This detail proves that the body was not stolen or taken away, and perplexed Peter, who couldn't make sense of what he was seeing. He had no concept of resurrection but couldn't explain the disappearance of the body and the presence of the remaining clothes. So, he left the tomb and went to Jerusalem, wondering at the astonishing events that had unfolded.
