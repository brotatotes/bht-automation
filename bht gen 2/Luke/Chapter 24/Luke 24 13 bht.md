# Luke 24:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After the resurrection, Jesus appeared to two of his disciples on the road to Emmaus, one being Cleophas as mentioned in Luke 24:18. The identity of the other disciple is uncertain, but some speculate that it could have been Luke himself. The distance from Jerusalem to Emmaus was about seven miles or sixty stadia. Emmaus was not a prominent place, but it was mentioned to establish the authenticity of the event.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "One of them, Luke 24:18, was called Kleopas... Who the other was, is idle to conjecture."
2. "Our narrative seems to have been from the report of Cleopas."
3. "There were two other places of the same name: (1) a town afterwards called Nicopolis... (2) Another Emmaus is mentioned Jos. B. J. iv. 1. 3..."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Two of them--One was Cleopas; who the other was is mere conjecture."
2. "Emmaus--about seven and a half miles from Jerusalem. They probably lived there and were going home after the Passover."

1. "The name of one of them was "Cleopas," Luke 24:18. Many have supposed that the other was Luke, and that he omitted his own name from modesty."
2. "In regard to the locality of Emmaus, it seems quite probable that it is the same village which is referred to by Josephus... who states that, after the destruction of Jerusalem, Titus gave 'Emmaus'... to 800 of his troops, whom he had dismissed from his army, for their habitation."
3. "But it is wholly unknown why they were going to Emmaus. It may have been that this was their native place, or that they had friends in the vicinity. They seem to have given up all for lost, and to have come to the conclusion that Jesus was not the Messiah..."
