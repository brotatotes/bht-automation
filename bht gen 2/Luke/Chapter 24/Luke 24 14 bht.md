# Luke 24:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The two disciples were engaged in heartfelt conversation, exchanging views and feelings as they weighed all the facts. It is likely that they discussed the shameful treatment Jesus endured and the reports they had heard from the women who visited the empty tomb. Their conversation reflected their faith in Christ, as they sought to understand and grapple with the offense of the cross. Little did they know that in their humble desire to learn, they were unknowingly inviting Jesus, their Teacher, to join them as a fellow traveler on their journey.

2. "Their docility afforded Christ an opportunity of removing their error...their holy desire to obey God finds favor in his sight, so that he stretches out his hand to them, brings them to full conviction, and does not permit them to remain irresolute."
3. "We ought, at least, to hold it as certain, that when we inquire about Christ, if this be done from a modest desire to learn, the door is opened for him to assist us; nay, we may almost say that we then call for himself to be our Teacher; as irreligious men, by their unholy speeches, drive him to a distance from them."
