# Luke 24:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As the disciples walked, their eyes were fixed on the ground, their spirits burdened with sorrow. It is possible that God, in His providence, guided them to not look up, so that they did not immediately recognize Jesus. By preventing them from knowing Him, Jesus had the intention of concealing His identity temporarily, only to later reveal Himself fully to them. This redirection of their gaze served to protect them from being overwhelmed by His sudden presence.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:

1. "For though Christ remained like himself, he was not recognized, because the eyes of beholders were held; and this takes away all suspicion of a phantom or false imagination."
2. "But hence we learn how great is the weakness of all our senses, since neither eyes nor ears discharge their office, unless so far as power is incessantly communicated to them from heaven."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He Himself prevented their knowing Him; and this was His purpose of love; He would conceal only to reveal more fully."
2. "We often fail to recognize Christ when He is nearest to us; if He holds our eyes, as He sometimes does, it is to bless us more; if we hold our own eyes, then we are in danger of never recognizing Him at all."

3. "This was so ordered, that they should not know him; that so they might not be surprised at once, as they would have been, had they looked at him, and discerned who he was."
