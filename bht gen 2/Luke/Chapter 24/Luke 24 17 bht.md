What kind of conversations are you having as you walk? Jesus asked his disciples. He wanted to know the subject of their discussions and what was weighing heavily on their hearts. Their sad expressions revealed that they were deeply troubled, perhaps exchanging words about the recent events that had saddened them. Their interaction reflected a deep sense of sorrow and distress.
