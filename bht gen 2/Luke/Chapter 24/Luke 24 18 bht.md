# Luke 24:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Are you the only one who has been dwelling alone in Jerusalem and doesn't know what has happened? Even strangers and sojourners would have known about the events that took place there. The matter was so well-known and talked about that it would be surprising for anyone to be unaware of it, whether they were a resident or a visitor.
