# Luke 24:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The two disciples engaged in a passionate discussion, as indicated by their communication and gestures. These disciples were Jews, not Hellenists, and it is likely that they assumed their new companion was also Jewish. The rulers delivered Jesus to Pilate, resulting in his crucifixion. Although Pilate played a role in the sentencing and the Roman soldiers carried out the execution, the chief priests and rulers are attributed with the act, as they were responsible for requesting and instigating it. See Matthew 26:59-66 for further details.
