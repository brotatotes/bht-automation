# Luke 24:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The women who had gone to the tomb not only reported that they could not find the body of Jesus, but also that they had seen some angels, confirming the accounts of Luke 24:2-11. The disciples, however, were still uncertain and perplexed. Although the testimony from the women and angels was clear and well-attested, the disciples struggled to fully believe or discredit it. They dared to hope for the resurrection, but were also filled with fear that it might not be true.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This agrees exactly with Luke’s own narrative, but not with Matthew’s, in which they had seen the Lord Himself."
2. "There seems however to be some hint that the women had made some such report in the αὐτὸν δὲ οὐκ εἶδον said below of the τινὲς τῶν σὺν ἡμῖν."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Cleopas, absorbed in his story, throws himself back to the time of his interview with the women."
2. "They came saying that they have seen a vision of angels which say."

### Philip Schaff:
1. Luke 24:23. The narrative agrees with Luke 24:2-11.
	 That they had also seen.  Not finding what they sought, they had ‘also’ seen what they did not seek, and heard what they could scarcely believe. 

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "But all this was too indirect and uncertain (women and angels) for Cleopas and his companion."

### John Gill:
1. "They not only reported, that they could not find the body of Jesus, but also that they had seen some angels."
2. "So that it was not a deception of their sight, they certainly saw both Christ and the angels; and were assured from their testimony, as well as by their own eyes and ears, that he was certainly risen."
3. "Now, though this was so clear a point, and so well attested, the disciples knew not how to believe it; they were perplexed about it; they could neither receive it, nor discredit it; they hoped it might be so, but feared it was not."
