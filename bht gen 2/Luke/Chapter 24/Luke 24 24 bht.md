# Luke 24:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said - empty, with the linen clothes lying there. However, they did not see Jesus themselves, which left them puzzled and uncertain. The women had reported seeing him alive on the way, but the disciples could not comprehend why they had not seen him themselves. This uncertainty contributed to their skepticism about the whole event.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is natural, even in accordance with Luke 24:12, that the antithesis to 'τινές' before, and the loose way of speaking to a stranger, who (they believed) was not acquainted with any among them, might cause them here to use 'τινές', without any reference to Peter being accompanied."

### Albert Barnes:
1. Certain of them which were with us - Peter and John. See John 20:2-9.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The hope that was rekindled was turned to sadness...because despite the angelic message, the Lord had not yet appeared."
2. "But even were this the case, they had treated the report as 'idle talk.'"
3. "It is more probable that they left Jerusalem before the full report came."

### John Gill:
1. "And found it even so as the women had said; that is, that the body of Jesus was not there, and that the linen clothes were laid by themselves."
2. "But him they saw not; the women, as before observed, might report, that though they found not the body in the grave, yet they saw him alive by the way, but so did not the disciples; which made it look very strange, doubtful, and suspicious, that the women should see him, and not his apostles; they could not tell how to account for this, and this made them to be in suspense about the fact."
