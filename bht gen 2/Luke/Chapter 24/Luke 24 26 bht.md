# Luke 24:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The sufferings of Christ were not in vain, but rather proof of his messianic identity. It was necessary for him to suffer in order to fulfill prophecies and bring about redemption. These sufferings served as the appointed way for Christ to enter into his glory. Through his sacrificial death, he became a curse to remove the curse and cleanse the sins of others. By bearing the loathsome sins of humanity, he procured salvation in a way that was just and honorable to God. Thus, the doubts surrounding Christ's sufferings were unfounded, as they were essential for his ultimate glorification.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The sufferings were the appointed way by which Christ should enter into His glory."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Ought not Christâ€¦ to sufferâ€¦ and enterâ€¦ into His glory."
2. "Ye believe in the glory; but these very sufferings are the predicted gate of entrance into it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Ought not the 'Messiah.' Was there not evidence that he would do it? and was it not indispensable that he should, in order to fulfil the prophecies?"
2. "The 'necessity' of his suffering these things referred to 'here' was that it was foretold that he 'would.'"
3. "The reason why it was predicted, and why it was necessary that it should occur, was that it was proper that God should manifest his justice, and do honor to his law, and secure the due regard for his government, while he pardoned the guilty."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In the eternal order of things, and in fulfillment of the eternal counsel of God as expressed in the prophecies, it was essentially fitting that Christ should suffer."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ did not, therefore, assert in three words, that Christ ought to have suffered, but explained at great length that he had been sent in order that he might expiate, by the sacrifice of his death, the sins of the world."
2. "he might become a curse in order to remove the curse, â€” that by having guilt imputed to him he might wash away the pollutions of others."
3. "This ought to be carefully observed; for since Christ is deprived of the honor due to him, if he is not reckoned to be a sacrifice for sins, the only way by which he could enter into his glory was that humiliation or emptying, (Philippians 2:7,) out of which the Redeemer had arisen."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Behooved it not (according to these prophecies) the Christ (of whom they speak) to suffer these things (which have made you sad), and (according to the prophets, by just such sufferings) to enter into his glory?" 
2. "The ground of these prophecies lies in a deeper necessity. If we may thus speak of it, the necessity of such sufferings, on His way to glory, for our redemption."
3. "They needed most instruction about the necessity of such sufferings. Many doubting, unbelieving hearts need such instruction still: they talk of Christ's glory, and forget that the appointed way thither was through suffering."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The very things about the death of Jesus that disturbed them so were the strongest proof that he was the Messiah of the Old Testament."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ suffered many things in his personal character, being traduced as a sinful and wicked man, and a friend and encourager of sinners... to teach his people patience, under the loss of their good names, characters, and reputations." 
2. "He suffered greatly in his soul... chiefly from his bearing the loathsome sins of men, the strokes of justice, and the wrath of God; and particularly, through his being forsaken by him: and of all these there was a necessity."
3. "He ought to have suffered these things, as he did; the counsels and purposes of God, the covenant transactions and agreement he himself entered into with his Father, the prophecies of the Old Testament, and his own predictions concerning these things, together with the salvation of his people, in a way consistent with the justice of God, and the honour of his law, made them necessary."

### John Wesley:
1. "These very sufferings which occasion your doubts, are the proofs of his being the Messiah."
2. "And to enter into his glory â€” Which could be done no other way."
