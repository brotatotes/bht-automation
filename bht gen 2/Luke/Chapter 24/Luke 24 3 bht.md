# Luke 24:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As the women entered the sepulchre, guided by the angel, they were confronted with an empty tomb, defying their expectations. The Jews' burial tombs were spacious enough for individuals to enter, further emphasizing the absence of the Lord Jesus' body. It is worth noting that this specific combination, the Lord Jesus, is frequently found in the Acts but not elsewhere in the Gospels, underscoring its significance in this context.
