# Luke 24:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As the disciples sat down to eat, the stranger took on the role of the master of the house, a position that caught their attention. He proceeded to take the bread, bless it, break it, and give it to them, reminiscent of the last supper. In that moment, their eyes were opened and they recognized him as their risen Lord. It was a profound revelation, and though he disappeared from their sight, the impact of that encounter would last forever.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I believe that there was something in the manner of His breaking the bread, and helping and giving it to them, which was his own appointed means of opening their eyes to the recognition of Him."
2. "The Lord at their meal takes on Him the office of the master of the house (which alone would shew that it was not their house, but an inn), perhaps on account of the superior place which His discourse had won for Him in their estimation: and as the Jewish rule was, that 'three eating together were bound to give thanks,' He fulfils this duty."
3. "perhaps the well-known manner of His taking bread, &c., perhaps the marks of the nails in His hands, then first noticed, or these together, as secondary means, but certainly His own will and permission to be seen by them, opened their eyes to know Him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The stranger first startles them by taking the place of master at their own table."
2. "On proceeding to that act which reproduced the whole scene of the last Supper, a rush of associations and recollections disclosed their guest, and He stood confessed before their astonished gaze—THEIR RISEN LORD!"
3. "They were going to gaze on Him, perhaps embrace Him, but that moment He is gone! It was enough."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Sat at meat - Reclined at the table, or while he was at supper."
2. "He took bread and blessed it ... - This was the office of the master of a feast, and perhaps this first attracted particularly their attention."
3. "Though he was in 'their' house, yet he acted as 'master' of the feast, as he used to do with them before his death."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A very beautiful use of the imperfect, indicating that while he was in the act of distributing they recognized him."
2. "He blessed, and having broken, was giving it to them, when, in an instant, their eyes were opened."

### John Calvin:
1. "And, indeed, it might be said with some plausibility, that the Lord was at length recognized in the spiritual mirror of the Lord’s Supper; for the disciples did not know him, when they beheld him with the bodily eyes."
2. "But as this conjecture rests on no probable grounds, I choose rather to view the words of Luke as meaning that Christ, in taking the bread, gave thanks according to his custom."
3. "In the meantime, let us learn by the example of our Master, whenever we eat bread, to offer thanksgiving to the Author of life — an action which will distinguish us from irreligious men."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The meal must have been soon ready, as the day was far spent, and... [there is] no hint of any continued conversation in the house."
2. "He took the bread... In so doing He assumed the duty of the master of the house... This favors the view that it was not the home of the disciples... [and] this was a preparation for the subsequent recognition."
3. "And blessed it... neither the breaking nor the giving to them would be deemed remarkable... Yet the form of the original reminds of the feeding of the multitudes and of the Lord's Supper."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Luke's common idiom as in verses Luke 24:4; Luke 24:15." 
2. "Note first aorist passive infinitive (on the reclining as to him)." 
3. "Imperfect, inchoative idea, began to give to them, in contrast with the preceding aorist (punctiliar) participles."

### John Gill:
1. "He took bread and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them; as if he was the master of the house..."
2. "...they were a proper company to bless the bread together; that is, one in the name of the rest, they joining with him."
3. "Three that eat together have no power to divide; that is, to make a separate blessing, but are obliged to it conjunctly."

### John Wesley:
1. He took the bread, and blessed, and brake — Just in the same manner as when ho instituted his last supper.
