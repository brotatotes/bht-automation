# Luke 24:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus rose from the dead, He first appeared to Simon (Peter). This appearance is only hinted at here but is mentioned again in 1 Corinthians 15:5. It is not clear whether this appearance happened before or after the encounter on the way to Emmaus. Nevertheless, the fact that Jesus appeared to Simon first demonstrates His love, favor, and readiness to forgive, even after Peter’s denial. This early appearance to Peter must have brought great comfort and relief to him, as well as to the other disciples who were previously uncertain and in distress.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This appearance to Simon (i.e. Peter the other Simon would not be thus named without explanation: see ch. Luke 5:3 ff.) is only hinted at here, but is asserted again, 1 Corinthians 15:5, in immediate connexion with that which here follows."
2. "It is not clear whether it took place before or after that on the way to Emmaus."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is not known precisely when this happened, as the time and place are not mentioned."
2. "This was a mark of special love and favor, and particularly, after Peter’s denial, it showed how ready he was to pardon, and how willing to impart comfort to those who are penitent, though their sins are great."


### Marvin Vincent:
1. Is risen [ηγερθη] - appeared [ωφθη] . Both aorists. The Lord rose and appeared. So Wyc. See on appeared, ch. 22 43.

### John Calvin:
1. "By these words Luke means that those persons who had brought to the apostles joyful intelligence to confirm their minds, were informed by the disciples respecting another appearance."
2. "By a comparison of the time, we may conclude that Peter, after having returned from the sepulcher, was in a state of great perplexity and uncertainty, until Christ showed himself to him."
3. "However, it is evident from Luke that the greater part of them, in the midst of that overpowering amazement, not only embraced willingly what was told them, but contended with their own distrust; for by the word actually they cut off all ground for doubt."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Lord is risen indeed. The emphasis rests on ‘indeed;' they had half hoped so, but had now good evidence."

3. "Undoubtedly Peter is meant; no other Simon would be thus indefinitely mentioned."

### John Wesley:
1. "The Lord hath appeared to Simon — Before he was seen of the twelve apostles, 1 Corinthians 15:5."
