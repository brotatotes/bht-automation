# Luke 24:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus joined them, he engaged in a meaningful conversation and opened the Scriptures to them in a powerful way. Throughout their encounter, their eyes were unable to recognize him. However, as he broke the bread and shared it with them, their eyes were suddenly opened, and they clearly saw who he was. This event reminds us of the importance of the Lord's Supper, where Jesus is revealed to us in the breaking of bread.
