## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Lord appeared, the doors being shut, in the midst."
2. "The ordinary Jewish salutation, 'שָׁלוֹם לָכֶם,' but of more than ordinary meaning in the mouth of the Lord."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 36. Jesus . . . stood—(See on
	 :-).

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Jesus himself. The best texts omit Jesus. Render as Rev., "he himself stood." And saith unto them, Peace be unto you. The best texts omit.

### John Calvin:
1. "There is no contradiction about the substance of the fact; unless some person were to raise a debate about the time."
2. "But I do not think it right to insist precisely on the hour of the evening. On the contrary, we may easily and properly extend to a late hour of the night what is here said, and understand it to mean that Christ came to them after the evening, when the apostles had shut the doors, and kept themselves concealed within the house."
3. "He does not, indeed, say that Christ, by his divine power, opened for himself the doors which were shut, but something of this sort is indirectly suggested by the phrase which he employs, Jesus stood. For how could our Lord suddenly, during the night, stand in the midst of them, if he had not entered in a miraculous manner?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Mark’s account hints at unbelief, and their subsequent fear suggests the same."
2. "A sudden miraculous appearing is meant, corresponding to the disappearance in Luke 24:31."
3. "Peace be unto you. Comp. John 20:19. The ordinary Jewish salutation, but meaning more in this case."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  He himself stood  (αυτος εστη). He himself stepped and stood. Some documents do not have "Peace be unto you." 

### John Gill:
1. "Jesus himself stood in the midst of them...without hearing the doors opened, or the sound of the feet of Jesus, and without seeing him come in, and approach unto them, he, in a moment, at once, stood in the middle of them..."
2. "By his power he opened the [doors] and secretly let himself in, and shut them again at once; and by the agility of his body moved so swiftly, that he was not discerned until he was among them, where he stood to be seen, and known by them; whereby he made that good in a corporeal sense, which he had promised in a spiritual sense..."
3. "And saith unto them, peace be unto you; which was an usual form of salutation among the Jews..."

### John Wesley:
1. "It was just as easy to his Divine power to open a door undiscernibly, as it was to come in at a door opened by some other hand."
