# Luke 24:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
But the disciples were filled with a mix of fear and astonishment when they saw Jesus appear suddenly among them, even though the doors were locked. They couldn't understand how it could be Jesus himself, risen from the dead in his own body. Despite their previous belief in the resurrection and hearing confirmation from other disciples, they thought that what they were seeing was a spirit or a mere apparition, rather than the actual presence of Jesus.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "On account of His sudden appearance, and the likeness to one whom they knew to have been dead."
2. "πνεῦμα is a ghost or spectre, an appearance of the dead to the living."
3. "Not exactly as φάντασμα, which might have been any appearance of a supernatural kind."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "a spirit—the ghost of their dead Lord, but not Himself in the body"
2. "thoughts—rather, 'reasonings'; that is, whether He were risen or no, and whether this was His very self."

### John Calvin:
1. "The terror excited in them by the strangeness of the spectacle was such, that they dare not trust their eyes."
2. "Now, when they behold him with their eyes, their senses are struck with astonishment, so that they think he is a spirit."
3. "So then they did not suspect that this was a vision intended to deceive them, as if it had been an idle phantom, but, seized with fear, they thought only that there was exhibited to them in spirit what was actually placed before their eyes."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Terrified and affrighted... It was now, not hopelessness, but terror in fear of the sudden appearance, at night too."
2. "A ghost, a departed spirit, returned in the semblance of a body."
3. "This assumes, and our Lord's words teach, that there are disembodied spirits."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Terrified (πτοηθεντες). First aorist passive participle of πτοεω, old verb and in the N.T. only here and Luke 21:9 which see." 
2. "Affrighted (εμφοβο γενομενο). Late adjective from εν and φοβος (fear). Both these terms of fear are strong." 
3. "Supposed (εδοκουν). Imperfect active of δοκεω, kept on thinking so."

### John Gill:
1. "But they were terrified and affrighted,...At the sight of him, and at his sudden appearance among them, without being heard, or seen before, and the doors shut and bolted..."
2. "...they could not tell how to account for it, that it should be Jesus himself risen from the dead in his own body..."
3. "...though they had been just speaking of his resurrection, and had had a confirmation of it from the disciples that went to Emmaus: and supposed that they had seen a spirit; that what they saw was a phantom, or apparition, or a spirit, that had assumed, and appeared in, the shape of Jesus, and was not he himself."
