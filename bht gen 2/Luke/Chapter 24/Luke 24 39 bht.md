Jesus appeared to the disciples to provide them with undeniable evidence of his resurrection. Through his wounds, they could see and touch, the disciples were able to recognize the reality and identity of Jesus.

By offering both visual and tangible proof of his resurrection, Jesus reassured the disciples and solidified their faith in his resurrection.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The sight of the Hands and Feet, which they recognized as His, might at once convince them of the reality of the appearance, and the identity of the Person."
2. "He who is the Truth, does not speak thus of that which He knows, and has created. He declares to us the truth, that those appearances to which He was now likened by the disciples, and spirits in general, have not flesh and bones."
3. "Observe σάρκα κ . ὀστέα but not αἷμα. This the resurrection Body probably had, as being the animal life."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Behold, c.—lovingly offering them both ocular and tangible demonstration of the reality of His resurrection."
2. "a spirit hath not—an important statement regarding 'spirits'."
3. "flesh and bones—He says not 'flesh and blood' for the blood is the life of the animal and corruptible body, but 'flesh and bones,' implying the identity, but with diversity of laws, of the resurrection body."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Handle [ψηλαφησατε] . Compare 1 John 1:1. The word occurs also Acts 17:27; Hebrews 12:18."
2. "It never expresses the so handling an object as to exercise a moulding, modifying influence upon it, but at most a feeling of its surface; this, it may be, with the intention of learning its composition (Genesis 27:12, Genesis 27:21, Genesis 27:22)."
3. "Used of groping in the dark, Job 5:14; of the blind, Isaiah 49:10; Deuteronomy 28:29; Jude 1:16:26. See on Hebrews 12:18."

### John Calvin:
1. "Sight and touch will prove that I am a real man, who have formerly conversed with you; for I am clothed with that flesh which was crucified, and which still bears the marks of it."
2. "Again, when Christ declares that his body may be touched, and that it has solid bones, this passage is justly and appropriately adduced by those who adhere to us, for the purpose of refuting the gross error about the transubstantiation of bread into the body, or about the local presence of the body, which men foolishly imagine to exist in the Holy Supper."
3. "We must therefore hold that the distinction between flesh and spirit, which the words of Christ authorize us to regard as perpetual, exists in the present day."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A comparison with John’s account leads us to find here a proof of His identity, from the wounds in His hands and feet."
2. "The proof of the reality is the main thought here."
3. "A spirit hath not flesh and bones. This is a direct assertion of our Lord."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus is patient with his proof. They were convinced before he came into the room, but that psychological shock had unnerved them all." 
2. "Handle. This very word is used in 1 John 1:1 as proof of the actual human body of Jesus. It is an old verb for touching with the hand." 
3. "Flesh and bones. At least this proves that he is not just a ghost and that Jesus had a real human body against the Docetic Gnostics who denied it."

### John Gill:
1. "By which they might be convinced he was not a spirit, and be assured of the truth of his resurrection, and that in the same numerical body in which he suffered."
2. "Handle me and see; or know by feeling, as well as by sight; so that if the one was not sufficient, the other might confirm; sight might be deceived, but feeling could not."
3. "A spirit hath not flesh and bones; nothing but appearance, or air at most; no solid substance to be felt and handled."
