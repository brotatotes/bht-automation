# Luke 24:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the presence of these heavenly messengers, the truth and certainty of the resurrection are established, for as the Scripture says, By the mouth of two or three witnesses everything is established. Their appearance, dressed in brilliant and gleaming garments, signifies their celestial nature and magnificence. These angels, resembling men, suddenly appeared before the disciples as a sign of good news and brought tidings of the risen Lord. Mary had even witnessed their presence before this encounter, and Luke reveals that there were two angels in the form of men, while Matthew and Mark mention only one.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἐπέστ. does not determine the position of the angels. It is merely came upon them under ordinary circumstances; appeared to them, in a supernatural connexion."
2. "On the two angels here, see note on Mark 16:5; to which I will just add, that the Harmonistic view, as represented by Greswell [Diss. vi., vol. 3], strangely enough puts together the angel in Matthew, and the angel in Mark, and makes the two angels in Luke."
3. "ἄνδρες to all appearance; the Evangelist does not mean that they were such, as clearly appears from what follows."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Shining [αστραπτουσαις] . Only here and ch. 17 24. Akin to ajstraph, lightning. See on bright shining, ch. 11 36; and compare ch. 17 24.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Perplexed thereabout. A natural state of mind, even if they had some hope of His rising, for now He seemed lost to them."
2. "Two men. This was the form of the angelic appearance."
3. "In shining garments. The word used implies that the brilliancy was like that of lightning. At such a time the presence of a multitude of angels was, so to speak, natural, and hence a variety of appearances."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Luke's common Hebraistic idiom, εν with the articular infinitive (present passive απορεισθα from απορεω, to lose one's way) and the accusative of general reference."
2. "The angel looked like a man and some remembered two. In verse Luke 24:23 Cleopas and his companion call them 'angels.'"
3. "The 'men' had the garments of 'angels.'"

### John Gill:
1. "For by the mouth of two or three witnesses everything is established."
2. "Their garments were bright and glittering like lightning, to set forth the glory and majesty of these celestial spirits."
