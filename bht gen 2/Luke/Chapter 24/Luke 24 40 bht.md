# Luke 24:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He showed them his hands and his feet as proof of his identity and as signs of victory, triumphing over death. These prints of nails were the infallible proofs by which he demonstrated that he had truly risen from the dead and had been resurrected in his physical body. Seeing and feeling these prints allowed the disciples to know and believe in the reality of his incarnation as well as the reality of his resurrection.
