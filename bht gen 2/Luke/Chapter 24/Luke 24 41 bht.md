# Luke 24:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples were filled with such overwhelming joy upon receiving the news that they could hardly believe their own senses. Their joy, while a sign of their belief, also hindered their ability to fully comprehend and accept the reality before them. It is a reminder for us to be cautious of allowing our emotions to cloud our judgement and to strive for a balance between faith and reason.
