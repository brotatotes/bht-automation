# Luke 24:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus was given a piece of broiled fish and an honeycomb. The omission of the words and a honeycomb in some ancient manuscripts is notable, but these words are preferred to be retained because there are various reasons to explain their omission and inclusion by copyists. The broiled fish was given to Jesus as evidence of his corporeal existence, while the honeycomb was likely meant to be consumed after the fish.
