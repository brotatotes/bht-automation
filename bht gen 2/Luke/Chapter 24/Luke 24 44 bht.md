# Luke 24:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ is explaining to his disciples that what he had previously told them about his death and resurrection is now being fulfilled. He reminds them of his teachings and expresses a gentle reproach for their forgetfulness. Despite their initial astonishment, he seeks to show them that his resurrection was in accordance with the prophecies in the Old Testament, which were divided into the law, prophets, and psalms. Thus, his resurrection was not an unexpected event but rather the fulfillment of what had been foretold.
