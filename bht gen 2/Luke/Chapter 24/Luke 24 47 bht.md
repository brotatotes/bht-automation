# Luke 24:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The preaching of the Gospel, with its message of repentance and forgiveness of sins, was to begin in Jerusalem. This was significant in multiple ways. Firstly, it demonstrated the all-encompassing nature of the Gospel, extending even to the chief of sinners. Secondly, it served as a powerful testimony to the truth of the Christian message, as it was being proclaimed in the very place where the events had taken place. The significance and authority of the preaching came from the name of Christ, under whose commission it was carried out.

3. "And now it was necessary, according to Old Testament prophecies, that both these should be preached in his name; in the name of the Messiah; by his authority, and as coming through him; since the remission of sin is by his blood; and he is exalted as a prince, and a Saviour, to give both repentance and forgiveness of sins to all the Israel of God."
