# Luke 24:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The women were asked why they were looking for the living among the dead, a question that highlighted their forgetfulness of Jesus' prediction of his resurrection. It's a reminder that Christ is not to be found among the dead sinners or lifeless professors, but among the living saints and the churches of the living God. Life cannot be found in the dead works of the law or through lifeless performances on the dead letter of the law. The question prompted them to reconsider their search and shift their focus to where true life could be found.
