## BHT:
On the mount of Olives, Jesus led His disciples out as far as Bethany. This was the very spot where He began His triumphal entry into Jerusalem and now He ascended to heaven in a glorious manner. From this elevated location, He blessed His disciples with an outpouring of the Holy Spirit, granting them an increase in grace, understanding of the Scriptures, and inner peace. Jesus lifted up His hands towards His apostles, authoritatively bestowing upon them His blessings.
