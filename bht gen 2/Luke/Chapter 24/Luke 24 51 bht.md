# Luke 24:51 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our Lord's ascension into heaven was a fitting conclusion to his earthly ministry, as it surpassed even his resurrection in significance. His resurrection had already been attested to by the apostles, who had seen him alive after his crucifixion. However, it was necessary for him to ascend into heaven in order for them to receive the promise of the Holy Spirit and for their spiritual union with him to be fully realized. Though they could no longer see him with their physical eyes, his presence and authority as their Lord remained undiminished in the heavenly realm.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "[He was] borne up into heaven... the absolute passive is best." 
2. "The tense is imperfect, signifying the continuance of the going up during the προσκυν of the next verse."
3. "The more particular account of the Ascension is given Acts 1:9-12, where see notes. That account is in perfect accordance with this, but supplementary to it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Incarnate Love, Crucified Love, Risen Love, now on the wing for heaven, waiting only those odorous gales which were to waft Him to the skies, goes away in benedictions."
2. "And oh, if angels were so transported at His birth into this scene of tears and death, what must have been their ecstasy as they welcomed and attended Him 'far above all heavens' into the presence-chamber?"
3. "Thou hast an everlasting right, O my Saviour, to that august place. The brightness of the Father's glory, enshrined in our nature, hath won it well for He poured out His soul unto death, and led captivity captive, receiving gifts for men, yea for the rebellious, that the Lord God might dwell among them."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. And was carried up into heaven. Some texts omit. 

### Philip Schaff:
1. "While he blessed them. Not after, but during this benediction with uplifted hands."
2. "And was carried up into heaven. The tense of the original is picturesque and indicates a continued process, a gradual going up out of their sight."

2. "Jesus was taken up into heaven on a cloud."

1. "Their spiritual and mystical union by him remained, which is indissoluble; nor was his gracious presence from them withdrawn; nor was this parting in anger and resentment, as he sometimes does withdraw from his people..."
2. "It was a withdrawing of his corporeal presence from them, and that but for a while; he will come again a second time from heaven, from whence the saints expect him, and then they will meet, and never part more..."
3. "He went up gradually, till he became invisible to his disciples; or through the agility of his human body; for the bodies of the saints, when raised, will be like the angels, swift and nimble, and capable of moving from place to place, and of ascending and descending..."

### John Wesley:
1. "It was much more proper that our Lord should ascend into heaven, than that he should rise from the dead, in the sight of the apostles."
2. "For his resurrection was proved when they saw him alive after his passion."
3. "But they could not see him in heaven while they continued on earth."
