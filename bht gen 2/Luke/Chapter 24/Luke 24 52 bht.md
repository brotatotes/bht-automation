By worshiping Jesus after his ascension, the disciples affirmed his deity and divine sonship. They were filled with great joy because Jesus had entered into glory and was undertaking something significant for them. Their return to Jerusalem was marked by cheerfulness, hope, and a firm belief that the promise of the Father would soon be fulfilled. This act of worship not only acknowledged Jesus as the Son of God but also demonstrated the disciples' anticipation of the fulfillment of the promises Jesus had made to them.
