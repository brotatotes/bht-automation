# Luke 3:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the fifteenth year of Tiberius Caesar's reign, which could be considered the acceptable year of the Lord, John the Baptist emerged as a prophet after a long period of prophetic silence. Luke pays meticulous attention to the chronological precision by mentioning various Roman officials, including Pontius Pilate, Herod Antipas, Philip, and Lysanias, as well as the high-priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas. This serves to set the historical and political context for John's ministry and baptism. Through such precision, Luke's Gospel is validated and reinforced.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The fifteenth year of the sole principate of Tiberius began [...] we should have the birth of our Lord in U.C. 751 or about then."
2. "This difficulty has led to the supposition that this fifteenth year is not to be dated from the sole but from the associated principate of Tiberius, which commenced most probably at the end of U.C. 764."
3. "HEROD ANTIPAS became tetrarch of Galilee after the death of his father Herod [...] and continued till he was deposed in 792."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Here the curtain of the New Testament is, as it were, drawn up, and the greatest of all epochs of the Church commences."
2. "No such elaborate chronological precision is to be found elsewhere in the New Testament, and it comes fitly from him who claims it as the peculiar recommendation of his Gospel, that he had 'accurately traced down all things from the first.'"
3. "Trachonitis—farther to the northeast, between Iturea and Damascus; a rocky district, infested by robbers, and committed by Augustus to Herod the Great to keep in order."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Tiberius Caesar - Tiberius succeeded Augustus in the empire, and began his 'sole' reign Aug. 19th, 14 a.d. He was a most infamous character - a scourge to the Roman people."
2. "Pontius Pilate was the 'fifth' governor that had been sent, and of course had been in Judea but a short time."
3. "Herod being tetrarch of Galilee - This was 'Herod Antipas' son of Herod the Great, to whom Galilee had been left as his part of his father’s kingdom."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Pontius Pilate. Wyc., Pilat of Pounce. Tetrarch. See on Matthew 14:1.

### John Calvin:
1. "Luke mentions here two sons of Herod, — Herod Antipas, who had been made tetrarch of Galilee, and governed Samaria and Peraea, — and Philip, who was tetrarch of Trachonitis and Iturea, and reigned from the sea of Tiberias, or Gennesareth, to the foot of Lebanon, which is the source of the river Jordan."
2. "The word Tetrarch is here used in a sense not quite accurate, as if the whole country had been divided into four parts. But as at first there was a fourfold division into districts, so afterwards, when other changes took place, the names Tetrarch and Tetrarchies were retained by way of honor."
3. "In this sense Pliny enumerates seventeen tetrarchies of one country."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Luke’s accuracy appears from his naming here no less than seven official person ages, from the Roman emperor to the Jewish high-priest, or high-priests."
2. "The fifteenth year of the sole reign of Tiberius was from August 19, U. C. 781, to the same day 782."
