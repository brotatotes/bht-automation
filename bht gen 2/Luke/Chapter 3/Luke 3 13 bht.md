# Luke 3:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
John's admonition to exact no more is not a call for publicans to abandon their profession. Instead, he urges them to carry out their duties with integrity and fairness. While there were some who exploited their position for personal gain, John recognizes that not all publicans were dishonorable. Paying the just amount of taxes is not only a responsibility but also a way of supporting the government. John's words remind us of the importance of conducting ourselves honestly, for it reflects our reverence for God and the authenticity of our repentance.
