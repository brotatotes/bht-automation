# Luke 3:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Soldiers, serving in an army, should not use unjust force against individuals or take their property unlawfully. They should not falsely accuse anyone or engage in slanderous behavior. Instead, soldiers should be content with their wages and avoid mutiny or ill treatment of others, showing that they are upright and honorable in their profession.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "] στρατευόμενοι properly, men on march: see Lexx.: but this need not be pressed, only that they were soldiers, serving in an army. Who these were, we have no means of determining."
2. "The meaning here, to oppress or vex, corresponding to the Lat. concutere, seems to be confined to ecclesiastical use."
3. "The way in which soldiers would be likely to act the part of informers, would be by laying vexatious charges of disaffection against persons."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "soldiers . . . Do violence to none—The word signifies to 'shake thoroughly,' and so to 'intimidate,' probably in order to extort money or other property." 
2. "accuse . . . falsely—acting as informers vexatiously, on frivolous or false grounds." 
3. "content with your wages—'rations.' We may take this as a warning against mutiny, which the officers attempted to suppress by largesses and donations."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Do not take the property of any by unlawful force, or do not use unjust force against the person or property of any individual."
2. "Do not accuse any falsely."
3. "It was possible to be a good man and yet a soldier. What was required was that in their profession they should show that they were really upright, and did not commit the crimes which were often practiced in that calling."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Soldiers [στρατευομενοι]. Strictly, soldiers on service: hence the participle, serving as soldiers, instead of the more comprehensive term stratiwtai, soldiers by profession."
2. "Do violence [διασεισητε]. Only here in the New Testament. Lit., to shake violently; hence to agitate or terrify; and so to extort money from one by terrifying him."
3. "Accuse any falsely [συκοφαντησητε]. The common explanation of this word is based on the derivation from sukon, a fig, and fainw, to make known; hence of informing against persons who exported figs from Attica, contrary to the law, or who plundered sacred fig trees. As informers were tempted to accuse innocent persons by the reward paid for pointing out violators of the law, the verb acquired the meaning to accuse falsely."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Do violence to no one. The verb first means ‘to shake violently,’ then to oppress, vex, lay under contribution, etc."
2. "Neither accuse any wrongfully. Lit., neither be sycophants, i.e., play the spy, be informers, slander, etc. For such conduct military service, in those days, afforded great opportunity."
3. "Be content with your wages. Mutinies on account of pay were frequent, especially among the soldiers of dependent kings. John did not say: Throw away your arms and desert your colors; but: Do not abuse your power."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Soldiers also (κα στρατευομενο). Men on service, militantes rather than milites (Plummer)." 
2. "Do violence to no man (μηδενα διασεισητε). Here only in the N.T., but in the LXX and common in ancient Greek. It means to shake (seismic disturbance, earthquake) thoroughly (δια) and so thoroughly to terrify, to extort money or property by intimidating (3Macc. 7:21)." 
3. "Be content with your wages (αρκεισθε τοις οψωνιοις υμων). Discontent with wages was a complaint of mercenary soldiers."

### John Gill:
1. "John replied, do violence to no man; or 'shake' him, or put him, into bodily fear, by threatening, hectoring, and bullying him, and drawing the sword upon him, which is usual, upon the least offence, for such persons to do."
2. "Neither accuse any falsely, or play the sycophant; who, in order to flatter some, bring malicious accusations against others; and which was a vice that too much prevailed among the Jewish soldiery."
3. "Be content with your wages; allowed by the government, and do not seek to increase them by any unlawful methods, as by mutiny and sedition, by rebelling against your officers, or by ill usage of the people."
