# Luke 3:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people, in their expectation of the Messiah's arrival, were deeply stirred by John's preaching. They mused and debated among themselves whether John could possibly be the Christ. Though some considered John's unconventional appearance and hoped he was the Messiah, it is important to note that John's Levitical lineage did not align with the expected lineage of the Messiah. Nevertheless, their questioning of John's identity demonstrates the high regard and reverence they had for him.
