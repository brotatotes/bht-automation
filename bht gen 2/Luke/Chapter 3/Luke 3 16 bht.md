# Luke 3:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
John the Baptist humbly acknowledged that he baptized with water, but emphasized the coming of someone greater than him, someone he was unworthy to even untie the strap of their shoes. This imagery highlights the vast difference in power and authority between John and the Messiah. John recognized that the Messiah's ministry would be characterized by the baptism in the Holy Spirit, which would far surpass the water baptism John was performing. The Messiah's baptism would bring the transformative power of the Holy Spirit and judgment like fire, as seen in the events of Pentecost.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "So far from entertaining such a thought as laying claim to the honors of Messiahship, the meanest services I can render to that 'Mightier than I that is coming after me,' are too high an honor for me."
2. "Beautiful spirit, distinguishing this servant of Christ throughout!"
3. "one mightier than I—"the Mighter than I.""

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "One mightier [ο ισχυροτερος]. The definite article points to an expected personage."
2. "Hence better as Rev., he that is mightier."
3. "Unloose [λυσαι]. So also Mark; but Matthew bastasai, to bear."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He that is mightier than I... John would not turn aside for the flattery of the crowd."
2. "This bold Messianic picture in the Synoptic Gospels shows that John saw the Messiah's coming as a judgment upon the world like fire and the fan of the thrashing-floor."
3. "But he had the spiritual conception also, the baptism in the Holy Spirit which will characterize the Messiah's Mission and so will far transcend the water baptism which marked the ministry of John."

### John Gill:
1. "...
I indeed baptize you with water;...but one mightier than I cometh; that is, after me;...the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose..."
2. "neither to bear his shoes after him, as Matthew says, nor to untie his shoe string, or unbuckle his shoe, both which were menial actions with the Jews..."
3. "he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire; as he did some of their nation, his own disciples, on the day of pentecost..."
