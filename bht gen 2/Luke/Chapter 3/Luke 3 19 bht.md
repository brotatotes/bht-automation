# Luke 3:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
John the Baptist fearlessly confronted Herod Antipater, exposing his wickedness and the sin of taking his brother Philip's wife as his own. John courageously rebuked Herod for these offenses and others with great faithfulness and freedom. Despite the love and respect Herod had for John, he continued in his wrongdoings, even retaliating by imprisoning John. This account highlights the unwavering fidelity of John in speaking truth to power and the urgency for all teachers of righteousness to confront sin, regardless of the consequences.

2. "We behold in John an illustrious example of that moral courage, which all pious teachers ought to possess, not to hesitate to incur the wrath of the great and powerful, as often as it may be found necessary: for he, with whom there is acceptance of persons, does not honestly serve God."
3. "When Luke says, he added this to all the evil actions which he did, he means, that Herod’s malice is become desperate, and has reached its utmost height, when the sinner is enraged by remedies, and not only refuses correction, but takes vengeance on his adviser, as if he had been his enemy."
