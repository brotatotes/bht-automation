# Luke 3:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During this period, there was a unique situation where Annas held the position of high priest, and Caiaphas served as his deputy, also known as his sagan. While there could only be one high priest according to the law and Jewish customs, Annas was still regarded as having authority, possibly due to his previous position and influence. The presence of both individuals in this role reflects a complex and troubled time, with the sacred office of high priest being divided by ambition and tyranny.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Annan, as ex-high-priest, and possibly retaining in the view of the Jews the legitimate high-priesthood, was counted still as having the office." 
2. "Annas certainly exercised the power and had influence enough to procure the actual high-priesthood for five of his sons after his own deposition."
3. "A substitute, or deputy to the high-priest, appears to have been usual, and Annas would thus be able to evade the Roman appointment and keep the authority."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Both Zadok and Abiathar acted as high priests in David's time, and it seems to have become the fixed practice to have two."
2. "Such formulas, of course, are never used when speaking of Jesus, because the divine nature manifested itself in Him not at certain isolated moments of His life. He was the one everlasting manifestation of the Godhead—THE WORD."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "An impostor does not mention names, and times, and places particularly. If he did, it would be easy to ascertain that he was an impostor."
2. "The sacred writers describe objects and people as if they were perfectly familiar with them. They never appear to be 'guarding' themselves."
3. "If they were 'honest,' then the Christian religion is true."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Came [εγενετο] . Lit., arose, or came to pass. John. The Synoptists intrduce him under different titles. Here, the son of Zacharias; Matthew, the Baptist; Mark, the Baptizer.

### John Calvin:
1. "Luke’s narrative indicates such a state of trouble and confusion, that, though there was not more than one person who was actually high priest, the sacred office was torn in pieces by ambition and tyranny." 
2. "Hence infer, that there are no regular teachers, but those on whom God has conferred the office; and that it is not enough to have the word of God, if there be not likewise a special calling." 
3. "The whole passage is remarkable, and proves that the appointment to the sacred office of high priest was entirely at the disposal of the Roman Governor."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There could be properly but one high-priest, holding office for life; the verse therefore suggests some peculiar state of things."
2. "Annas was probably recognized by the Jews as the legitimate high-priest, while Caiaphas was accepted as high-priest de facto, whenever contact with Roman authority made such a recognition necessary."
3. "The word of God came. The Old Testament formula for prophetic inspiration."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The great epoch marked by εγενετο rather than ην." 
2. "ρημα θεου is some particular utterance of God (Plummer), common in LXX, here alone in the N.T." 
3. "All three Synoptics locate him 'in the wilderness' (εν τη ερημω) as here, Mark 1:4; Matthew 3:1 (adding 'of Judea')."

### John Gill:
1. "Some difficulty here arises, how these two could be both high priests; when according to the law of God, and the usages of the Jewish nation, there was to be, and was but one high priest at a time."
2. "Annas so called, because he had been one formerly, the same with Ananus, the son of Seth; who was put into the priesthood by Quirinius, in the room of Joazar, and was deposed by Valerius Gratus, and Ishmael ben Phabi was put into his room."
3. "The "Sagan" was not an officer pro tempore, or so much under the high priest, and one in his stead, as a ruler and governor over other priests."

### John Wesley:
1. Annas being high priest, and Caiaphas — There could be but one high priest, strictly speaking, at once. Annas was the high priest at that time, and Caiaphas his sagan or deputy.
