# Luke 3:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After baptizing Jesus and the descent of the Spirit upon Him, John the Baptist was shut up in prison. This event is mentioned before Jesus' baptism to emphasize the transition from John to Jesus. By mentioning this early on, it allows for a smooth and uninterrupted flow in the narrative. The verb used to describe John's confinement implies that he was shut down, possibly with the reference to closing the door of a dungeon. This act of imprisonment was driven by the instigation of Herodias and is considered to be of a more flagitious nature.
