# Luke 3:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus was baptized by John in the Jordan, he was praying, and at that moment, the heaven was opened. This event signified the anointing of Jesus as the Son of God and the confirmation of his role as the Messiah. Through his prayer, Jesus was acknowledging his dependence on God, and in response, the Father bore witness to him. The opening of heaven and the voices that followed were a divine confirmation of Jesus' mission and identity.
