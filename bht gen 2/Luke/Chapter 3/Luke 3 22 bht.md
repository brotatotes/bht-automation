# Luke 3:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus was baptized, the Holy Spirit descended upon him in a bodily form like a dove.

In addition to the presence of the Holy Spirit, a voice from heaven declared that Jesus is God's beloved Son, further affirming his divine identity and pleasure in him. This event highlighted the deity of Christ and deepened his Messianic consciousness. It was a significant moment that revealed Jesus as the chosen Son of God.
