# Luke 3:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, at around the age of thirty-four, began his ministry and accomplished great achievements within a limited period of time. It is a blessing for anyone who faithfully fulfills their life's purpose with zeal, and even more so if their life is cut short. The time we spend serving God and others may be short, but the rewards in eternity will be immeasurable.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "If no other proof were in existence of the total independence of the present Gospels of Matthew and Luke, their genealogies would furnish what I conceive to be an undeniable one."
2. "It has never yet been accomplished; and every endeavour to do it has violated either ingenuousness or common sense."
3. "It may suffice us that they are inserted in the Gospels as authentic documents, and both of them merely to clear the Davidical descent of the putative father of the Lord."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "At this age the priests entered on their office."
2. "Those who take the latter opinion, that we have here the line of Mary...explain the statement about Joseph, that he was 'the son of Hell,' to mean that he was his son-in-law."
3. "On comparing the two genealogies, it will be found that Matthew, writing more immediately for Jews, deemed it enough to show that the Saviour was sprung from Abraham and David; whereas Luke, writing more immediately for Gentiles, traces the descent back to Adam, the parent stock of the whole human family."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jesus began to be ... - This was the age at which the priests entered on their office, Numbers 4:3, Numbers 4:47; but it is not evident that Jesus had any reference to that in delaying his work to his thirtieth year."
2. "He was not subjected to the Levitical law in regard to the priesthood, and it does not appear that prophets and teachers did not commence their work before that age."
3. "As was supposed - As was commonly thought, or perhaps being legally reckoned as his son."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Began to be about thirty years of age [ην αρχομενος ωσει ετων τριακοντα] . Peculiar to Luke. A. V. is wrong. It should be as Rev., when he began (to teach) was about thirty years of age."
2. "Compare Matthew 4:1-11; Mark 1:12-13."

### John Calvin:
1. "When Christ was preparing to preach the Gospel, he was introduced by Baptism into his office; and at the same time was endued with the Holy Spirit."
2. "On account of this mildness of Christ, by which he kindly and gently called, and every day invites, sinners to the hope of salvation, the Holy Spirit descended upon him in the appearance of a dove."
3. "As the Spirit of God is everywhere present, and fills heaven and earth, he is not said, in a literal sense, to descend, and the same observation may be made as to his appearance."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "'About,' indefinite, but probably over that age."
2. "'It is remarkable that, in the Talmud, Mary the mother of Jesus is called the daughter of Heli. From whence have Jewish scholars derived this information? If from the text of Luke, this proves that they understood it as we do; if they received it from tradition, it confirms the truth of the genealogical document Luke made use of.'" (Godet.)
3. "The first view is open to fewest objections."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus Himself (αυτος Ιησους). Emphatic intensive pronoun calling attention to the personality of Jesus."
2. "The Authorized Version 'began to be about thirty years of age,' is an impossible translation."
3. "It is in harmony with Pauline universality (Plummer) that Luke carries the genealogy back to Adam and does not stop with Abraham."

### John Gill:
1. "Or Jesus, when he was baptized and began his public ministry, was about thirty years of age: an age at which the priests, under the law, who were typical of Christ, entered on their work."
2. "Joseph might very rightly be called, as he was supposed to be, the father of Jesus, by a rule which obtains with the Jews that he"that brings up, and not he that begets, is called the father."
3. "Jesus was the son of Eli; and which must be understood, and carried through the whole genealogy, as thus; Jesus the son of Matthat, Jesus the son of Levi, Jesus the son of Melchi, c. till you come to Jesus the son of Adam, and Jesus the Son of God."

### John Wesley:
1. "Our great Master attained not, as it seems, to the conclusion of his thirty-fourth year. Yet what glorious achievements did he accomplish within those narrow limits of time!"
2. "Happy that servant, who, with any proportionable zeal, despatches the great business of life; and so much the more happy, if his sun go down at noon."
3. "For the space that is taken from the labours of time, shall be added to the rewards of eternity."
