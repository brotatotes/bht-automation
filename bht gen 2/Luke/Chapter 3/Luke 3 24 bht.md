# Luke 3:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The inclusion of Matthat in Luke 3:24 has raised debates among scholars, with some arguing for its omission based on early church fathers' testimonies. Others suggest that it is not the same as Matthan, the grandfather of Joseph in Matthew 1:15. Referring to Jewish writings, King Jannai, identified with Jochanan or John, the son of Simeon and Mattithiah, adds historical credibility. Moreover, Joseph, mentioned as the son of Mattathias, is identified as Joseph the second, also known as Arsis, who held great honor and governed for sixty years. These insights deepen our understanding of the historical context.
