# Luke 3:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Matthew 1:12, the genealogies of Jesus in Matthew and Luke potentially converge, indicating a possible connection between the individuals mentioned. It is suggested that there may have been a marriage involving Salathiel and a daughter of Neri, such as a Levirate marriage. These complexities are likely to have arisen during the time of the captivity of Israel. Notably, one source refers to Rhesa as Rhesa Mesullam, while another highlights Zorobabel's lengthy governance of fifty-eight years. Additionally, Neri is identified as the same person as Jechonias in accordance with the Alexandrian chronicle.
