# Luke 3:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The mentioned genealogy introduces names that are absent from the Old Testament, such as Melchi and Mattatha, who raise questions about the continuity with previous genealogical records. Yet, there is a possible connection between Ahishar and Mattatha, indicated by their presumed equivalence. Additionally, the link between Nathan and David can be established through 2 Samuel 5:14, affirming the lineage.
