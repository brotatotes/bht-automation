# Luke 3:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The name Cainan, mentioned in some translations of the Old Testament, presents a puzzling case. It is not found in the Hebrew text, Samaritan version, or Targum. Some argue that it may be a corruption or interpolation in the text, while others suggest it was mistakenly added by an early transcriber of Luke's Gospel, later finding its way into the Septuagint. Regardless, it is clear that there is no evidence for the existence of a Cainan, son of Arphaxad, and the next words should be connected to Salah, his actual son.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This name does not exist in our present Hebrew text, but in the LXX, Genesis 10:24; Genesis 11:12-13, and furnishes a curious instance of one of two things either (1) the corruption of our present Hebrew text in these chronological passages; or (2) the incorrectness of the LXX, and notwithstanding that, the high reputation which it had obtained in so short a time." 
2. "Lightfoot holds the latter alternative: but I own I think the former more probable."
3. "See on the whole question of the appearance of this second Cainam(n) among the ancestors of our Lord, Lord A. Hervey’s work above cited, ch. 8, in which, with much research and acuteness, he has endeavoured to shew that the name was probably interpolated here, and got from hence into the LXX. Certainly it appears not to have existed in the earliest copies of that version."

### John Gill:
1. "This Cainan is not mentioned by Moses in Genesis 11:12 nor has he ever appeared in any Hebrew copy of the Old Testament, nor in the Samaritan version, nor in the Targum."
2. "It indeed stands in the present copies of the Septuagint, but was not originally there; and therefore could not be taken by Luke from thence, but seems to be owing to some early negligent transcriber of Luke's Gospel, and since put into the Septuagint to give it authority."
3. "For certain it is, there never was such a Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, for Salah was his son; and with him the next words should be connected."
