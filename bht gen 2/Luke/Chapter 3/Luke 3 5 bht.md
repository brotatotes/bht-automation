# Luke 3:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Every obstacle and hindrance, representing lowliness and depression, will be raised and directed to believe in Christ, receiving divine consolation from Him. On the contrary, those who are prideful and trust in themselves will be humbled, while the Messiah alone will be exalted in His person, grace, and righteousness. Furthermore, those who walk in crooked ways and associate with the workers of iniquity will be transformed and guided towards righteousness and truth. The fulfillment of this prophetic statement entails the removal of all hindrances and obstacles that stand in the way of progress and faith.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 5. Every valley, &c.—levelling

	Lord."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Valley [φαραγξ] . Strictly, of a chasm or ravine in a mountain side."
2. "Shall be filled - brought low."
3. "The exhortation 'to gather out the stones ' (Isaiah 61:10) is peculiarly appropriate."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Valley (φαραγξ). Here only in the N.T., though in the LXX and ancient Greek. It is a ravine or valley hedged in by precipices."
2. "Shall be filled (πληρωθησετα). Future passive indicative of πληροω. In 1845 when the Sultan visited Brusa the inhabitants were called out to clear the roads of rocks and to fill up the hollows. Oriental monarchs often did this very thing."
3. "Hill (βουνος). Called a Cyrenaic word by Herodotus, but later Greek writers use it as does the LXX. Brought low (ταπεινωθησετα). Future passive indicative of ταπεινοω. Literal meaning here of a verb common in the metaphorical sense."

### John Gill:
1. "Under which, such souls as were lowly and humble, and depressed with the sense of sin, should be raised and directed to believe in Christ, and be filled with divine consolation from him."
2. "all such as are elated with their own abilities, and boast of their righteousness, trust in themselves, and look with disdain and contempt on others, their loftiness shall be bowed down, and their haughtiness made low; and the Messiah alone, in his person, grace, and righteousness, be exalted."
3. "such as are of a crooked spirit, and walk in crooked ways, with the workers of iniquity, shall have new spirits given them, and be directed to right ways, and be led in the paths of righteousness and truth."

### John Wesley:
1. Every valley shall be filled, … — That is, every hinderance shall be removed.
