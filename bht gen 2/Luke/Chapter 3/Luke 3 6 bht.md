# Luke 3:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The salvation of God, found in Jesus Christ, is the focus of the passage. It is a salvation that is not limited but intended to be revealed universally. The prophet's goal is to highlight the extraordinary nature of this salvation, surpassing any previous demonstrations of God's grace or deliverance. The New Testament writers often combine different passages to emphasize the exceptional value and significance of this salvation. By joining passages from different places, they illustrate the universal nature of the Gospel and its message of redemption for all.
