## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He said, the imperfect, and came forth, the present participle; both denoting action in progress, or customary action; so that the sense is, he kept saying, or he used to say to those who were coming out, to the crowds of people which kept pouring out successively."
2. "John's figurative language is altogether the language of the desert. Notice the succession of images."
3. "Warned [υπεδειξεν] . From upo, under, and deiknumi, to shew. Hence, literally, to shew secretly. The word implies a private or confidential hint or reminder."

### John Calvin:
1. "Though the persons whom John reproved were few in number, his design was to strike terror on all; as Paul enjoins us to regard it as the advantage of public rebukes, 'that others also may fear.'" 
2. "It is probable, therefore, that John publicly attacked the Pharisees, for the benefit of the whole church of God, that they might no longer dazzle the eyes of simple men by empty show, or hold the body of the people under oppression by wicked tyranny."
3. "As he had suspicions of their repentance, he puts the question with doubt and wonder, if it be possible that they repent sincerely. In this way, he summons them to the inward tribunal of conscience, that they may thoroughly examine themselves, and, laying aside all flattery, may institute a severe investigation into their crimes."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "To be baptized of him (βαπτισθηνα υπ' αυτου). This is the purpose of their coming."
2. "John's metaphors are from the wilderness (vipers, fruits, axe, slave boy loosing sandals, fire, fan, thrashing-floor, garner, chaff, stones)."
3. "Who warned you? (τις επεδειξεν υμιν;). The verb is like our 'suggest' by proof to eye, ear, or brain."

### John Gill:
1. "The multitude to whom he spake the following words, were many of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
2. "They came out of their houses, towns, and cities, round about, to the place where John was."
3. "John refused them, saying to them, 'O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?'"
