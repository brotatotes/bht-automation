# Luke 3:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do not rely on your association with the Church or any external privileges, for they do not guarantee true repentance. Instead, produce the evidence of genuine repentance through the fruit of transformed lives. Recognize that God's power is not limited to physical lineage, as He can raise up children of Abraham from unexpected sources. Understand that God is calling for an immediate change of heart, emphasizing the urgency of responding to His summons.
