# Luke 4:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, filled with the Holy Spirit, was about to embark on his public ministry but first had to endure a series of temptations. Even though he was abundantly equipped with the Spirit's gifts, he needed to face these trials to fully prepare himself. Led by the Spirit, Jesus entered the wilderness, a desolate and dangerous place, where he was vulnerable to Satan's attacks. In this isolated environment, he was without human society or sustenance, making it the perfect setting for Satan to tempt him. However, with the power of the Spirit, Jesus was fortified against these temptations.

1. "By the Spirit...indicating the sphere rather than the impulse of his action."
2. "He was not only impelled into the wilderness, but guided in the wilderness by the Spirit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Full of the Holy Spirit, which came upon Him at His baptism. ‘Full of the Holy Spirit,’ He throughout this conflict wields victoriously ‘the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God.’"
2. "In The Spirit. Not quite the same as ‘by the Spirit;’ the idea of His abiding in the Spirit as the element of His life is included."
3. "In the wilderness. More correct than ‘into,’ implying that the leading of the Spirit continued there, ‘during forty days.’"

### Archibald T. Robertson:

### John Gill:
1. "The Spirit of God having descended on him at his baptism, and afresh anointed, and filled his human nature with his gifts, whereby, as man, he was abundantly furnished for the great work of the public ministry, he was just about to enter upon; yet must first go through a series of temptations, and which, through the fulness of the Holy Spirit in him, he was sufficiently fortified against."
2. "This was that part, which was uninhabited by men, and was infested with wild beasts, and where Christ could neither have the comfort and benefit of human society, nor anything for the sustenance of life, and where he was exposed to the utmost danger; and so in circumstances very opportune and favourable for Satan to ply him with his temptations, for which purpose he was led thither."
