# Luke 4:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus was in all points tried like as we are, having completed every temptation. The enemy tried all his weapons and forms of temptation, but Jesus was in all points tempted and yet did not fall into sin. The devil attacked Jesus through the Pharisees, using Peter as his instrument, and even in the garden of Gethsemane. But for a season, until another opportunity presented itself, the devil departed from Jesus, waiting for the hour and power of darkness.
