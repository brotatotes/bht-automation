# Luke 4:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus taught in the synagogues, he captivated the listeners with his divine wisdom and power. The synagogues provided an open door for him to share his teachings and perform miraculous works. People were amazed by his doctrine and praised him as a remarkable preacher. They marveled at his gracious words and glorified him, as well as God for him. However, this initial admiration and peace would not last for long, as tumultuous times and opposition were yet to come. Ultimately, Jesus' strong resilience and divine guidance would help him endure and overcome the challenges he faced.
