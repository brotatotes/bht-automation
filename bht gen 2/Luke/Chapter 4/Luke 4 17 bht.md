# Luke 4:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By divine guidance, Jesus was given the book of Isaiah to read. Opening the scroll, He found the passage He intended to read, a fortuitous discovery orchestrated by the particular providence of God. This highlights the importance of God's hand in guiding and directing our lives, even in the smallest details such as the opening of a book. It serves as a reminder to trust in His guidance and be attentive to the signs and promptings He places in our path.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The roll containing that book (probably, that alone) was given to the Lord."
2. "But it does not appear that He read any part of the lesson for the day; but when He had unrolled the scroll, found (the fortuitous, i.e. providential, finding is the most likely interpretation, not the searching for and finding) the passage which follows."
3. "No inference can be drawn as to the time of the year from this narrative; partly on account of the uncertainty above mentioned, and partly because it is not quite clear whether the roll contained only Isaiah, or other books also."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The book - The volume contained the prophecy of Isaiah. It would seem, from this, that the books were kept separate, and not united into one as with us." 
2. "When he had opened the book - Literally, when he had 'unrolled' the book. Books, among the ancients, were written on parchments or vellum that is, skins of beasts, and were 'rolled' together on two rollers, beginning at each end, so that while reading they rolled off from one to the other."
3. "The place where it was written - Isaiah 61:1-2."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word [Œ≤ŒπŒ≤ŒªŒπŒøŒΩ] is also used to denote a division of a work, and is therefore appropriate here to mark the writings of a single prophet as related to the whole body of the prophetic writings."
2. "Both this and the simple verb [ptussw], to close, (verse 30), occur only once in the New Testament. The former word was used in medical language of the opening out of various parts of the body, and the latter of the rolling up of bandages."
3. "As if by chance: reading at the place where the roll opened of itself, and trusting to divine guidance."

### John Calvin:
1. "Isaiah there predicts that, after the Babylonish captivity, there will still be witnesses of the grace of God, who shall gather the people from destruction, and from the darkness of death, and restore, by a spiritual power, the Church, which has been overwhelmed by so many calamities."
2. "But as that redemption was to be proclaimed in the name and authority of Christ alone, he uses the singular number, and speaks in the name of Christ, that he may more powerfully awaken the minds of the godly to strong confidence."
3. "It is certain, that what is here related belongs properly to Christ alone, for two reasons: first, because he alone was endued with the fullness of the Spirit, (John 3:34,) to be the witness and ambassador of our reconciliation to God; secondly, because he alone, by the power of his Spirit, performs and grants all the benefits that are here promised."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The reading of the Law had already taken place, and that from the Prophets was to begin."
2. "When He unrolled the book, His eye fell, accidentally some would say,  providentially we say, upon this passage."
3. "All calculations as to the time of year, based on the reading of this part of Isaiah, are therefore excluded."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This last is what Jesus did. The book of the prophet Isaiah (Œ≤ŒπŒ≤ŒªŒπŒøŒΩ œÑŒøœÖ œÄœÅŒøœÜŒ∑œÑŒøœÖ ŒïœÉŒ±ŒπŒøœÖ). Literally, 'a roll of the prophet Isaiah.' Apparently Isaiah was handed to Jesus without his asking for it. But certainly Jesus cared more for the prophets than for the ceremonial law."
 
2. "Jesus used Deuteronomy in his temptations and now Isaiah for this sermon. The Syriac Sinaitic manuscript has it that Jesus stood up after the attendant handed him the roll."
3. "He continued to unroll (rolling up the other side) till he found the passage desired. At any rate it was a marvelously appropriate passage (Isaiah 61:1; Isaiah 61:2 with one clause omitted and some words from Isaiah 58:6)."

### John Gill:
1. "The same method was observed, when a king read in the book of the law; but when a common priest, or an inferior person read, so much ceremony was not used, as to hand the book from one to another."
2. "Such a roll, or volume, of the prophet Isaiah, Christ unrolled, till he came to the place he intended to read."
3. "Before the reading of the prophets, a blessing used to be said, which was in this form: 'blessed art thou, O Lord our God, the king of the world, Who hath chosen the good prophets, and art well pleased with their words, which are said in truth; blessed art thou, O Lord, who hast chosen the law, Moses his servant, and Israel his people, and the prophets of truth and righteousness.'"

### John Wesley:
1. He found ‚Äî It seems, opening upon it, by the particular providence of God.
