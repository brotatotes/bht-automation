# Luke 4:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, anointed me with His power, setting me apart for the offices of prophet, king, and priest. It is remarkable how the doctrine of the Trinity is evident even in these words, emphasizing the presence of the Spirit and the Lord. In comparing the spiritual state of humanity to captives in prison, it is revealed that Christ not only opens the prison doors, but also gives spiritual sight to those blinded by sin and sets them free from the chains of their bondage.

### Albert Barnes:

3. "Deliverance to the captives - It does not, indeed, 'literally' open the doors of prisons, but it releases the mind captive under sin; it gives comfort to the prisoner, and it will finally open all prison doors and break off all the chains of slavery, and, by preventing 'crime,' prevent also the sufferings that are the consequence of crime."

3. "We were altogether overwhelmed by every kind of evils: but there God cheers us by his life-giving light, to rescue us from the deep abyss of death, and to restore us to complete happiness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The meaning of this prophetic citation may be better seen, when we remember that it stands in the middle of the third great division of the book of Isaiah...and thus by implication announces the fulfilment of all that went before, in Him who then addressed them." 
2. "Our Lord read what was in the roll, but Luke gives the general drift of the passage."

3.
