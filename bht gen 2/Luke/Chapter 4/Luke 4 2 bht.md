# Luke 4:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, filled with the Holy Spirit, was led into the wilderness by the Spirit, enduring forty days of temptation from the devil. The length of the temptation is emphasized by both Luke and Mark, signifying its significant duration. During this time, Jesus abstained from food completely, showcasing his astounding ability to sustain his human nature under such circumstances. As a result of his prolonged fasting, Jesus grew hungry, which marked the opportune moment for the devil to launch his attack, taking advantage of Jesus' weakened physical state.
