# Luke 4:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Today, as I speak these words, the scripture that was written is being fulfilled right in front of your ears. It is I, the chosen one, the anointed Messiah, who stands here before you, anointed by the Holy Spirit to preach good news and proclaim the fulfillment of all these promises. This scripture has always been understood by the Jews as referring to the Messiah, and now, I, Jesus, the true Messiah, proclaim that the words of this scripture are being fulfilled today.
