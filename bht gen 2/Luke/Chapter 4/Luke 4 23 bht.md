# Luke 4:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Despite the doubts and skepticism of the people in his hometown of Nazareth, Jesus emphasizes the importance of their own belief and acceptance. He acknowledges their desire for him to perform miracles as he has elsewhere, but reminds them that their unbelief hinders him from doing so. He also draws parallels to prophets in the past who were rejected in their own land and driven to work miracles among those outside of Israel. Jesus seeks their understanding that faith and acceptance should not be limited by familiarity or proximity, but should extend to those around them, including himself.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Not, ‘raise thyself from thy obscure station,’ but, exert thy powers of healing in thine own country, as presently interpreted."
2. "The reproach was repeated under the Cross. Then, with a strictly individual application."
3. "Whether we read ἐν or εἰς, the preposition is equally local in its signification, in Capernaum, not 'in the case of Capernaum,' or 'to Capernaum.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Charity begins at home."
2. "Strange rumors have reached our ears of Thy doings at Capernaum but if such power resides in Thee to cure the ills of humanity, why has none of it yet come nearer home, and why is all this alleged power reserved for strangers?"
3. "His choice of Capernaum as a place of residence since entering on public life was, it seems, already well known at Nazareth; and when He did come thither, to give no displays of His power when distant places were ringing with His fame, wounded their pride."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "You profess to be the Messiah. You have performed miracles at Capernaum. You profess to be able to deliver us from our maladies, our sins, our afflictions. Show that you have the power, that you are worthy of our confidence, by working miracles here, as you profess to have done at Capernaum."
2. "It does not refer, therefore, to any purification of his own, or imply any reflection on him for setting up to teach them. It was only a demand that he would show the proper evidence 'by miracles' why they should trust in him, and he proceeds to show them why he would not give them this evidence."
3. "Whatsoever we have heard done - Whatsoever we have heard that thou hast done. It would seem, from this, that Christ had before this performed miracles in Capernaum, though the evangelist has not recorded them."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Surely [παντως] . Lit., by all means. Rev., doubtless."
2. "Physician, heal thyself. A saying which Luke alone records."
3. "Galen speaks of a physician who should have cured himself before he attempted to attend patients."

### John Calvin:
1. "From the words of Christ it may be easily inferred, that he was treated with contempt by the inhabitants of Nazareth: for he states publicly those thoughts, which he knew to exist in their minds."
2. "He afterwards imputes to them the blame of his declining to work miracles among them, and charges them with malice, in bestowing no honor on a prophet of God."
3. "The objection, which he anticipates, is this: 'There is no reason to wonder, if his countrymen hold him in little estimation, since he does not dignify his own country, as he does other places, by working miracles; and, consequently, it is but a just revenge, if his own countrymen, whom he treats with less respect than all others, are found to reject him.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This reply is based upon something deeper than the question of Luke 4:22. The tone throughout is that of reproof."
2. "Luke, the physician, presents Christ as the Physician; our Lord implies that this is His office."
3. "If thou wilt be a helper of others (physician), help thyself from the want of respect and esteem among us, by working miracles here as thou hast done in Capernaum."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The proverb means that the physician was expected to take his own medicine and to heal himself." 
2. "The point of the parable seems to be that the people were expecting him to make good his claim to the Messiahship by doing here in Nazareth what they had heard of his doing in Capernaum and elsewhere." 
3. "Jesus applies the proverb to himself as an interpretation of their real attitude towards himself."
