# Luke 4:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
No prophet is truly accepted or acknowledged in their own country. This is often the case when a teacher sent from God comes to his own community. The familiarity with the person and their humble background often leads to contempt for their calling and authority. People struggle to accept that someone they knew on equal or lower terms could now bear a superior role. Therefore, it is not surprising that the people in Jesus' hometown could not recognize and appreciate his divine authority and power.
