# Luke 4:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During a three-year-and-six-month famine, our Lord brings forward the instances of the great prophets Elijah and Elisha, who, instead of performing miracles for their own people, helped foreigners. This demonstrates the universal nature of Jesus' ministry, reaching beyond national boundaries. The duration of the famine, including the extra six months without rain, holds symbolic significance in Jewish history and prophecy, symbolizing desolation and possible future tribulation. This underscores the sovereignty of God, as His miracles can occur in unexpected ways and times, exemplifying His power and divine plan.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
