# Luke 4:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's sovereign ways of bestowing favors are often surprising. In this instance, God overlooks His chosen people, the widows in Israel, and instead sends His prophet to a Gentile woman in the land of Sidon. This illustrates a proverb from the life of Elijah and reminds us that God's miracles may occur in unexpected places. This serves as a reminder to the people that God's actions align with His past dealings and are a response to their lack of faith and tendency to doubt.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'save' in this verse does not express the meaning of the original...The meaning of the verse is this: 'He was sent to none of the widows in Israel. He was not sent except to Sarepta, to a woman that was a 'Sidonian.'" 
2. "Dr. Thomson ('The Land and the Book,' vol. i. p. 232-236) regards Sarepta as the modern Sarafend. He says that the ruins have been frequently dug over for stone to build the barracks at Beirut, and that the broken columns, marble slabs, sarcophagi, and other ruins indicate that it was once a flourishing city."
3. "A large town was built there in the time of the Crusades."

### Philip Schaff:

### Archibald T. Robertson:
