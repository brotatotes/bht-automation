# Luke 4:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The story of Naaman the Syrian in 2 Kings 5:14 depicts the healing of a lone leper by the prophet Elisha. This account serves as a parallel to the miracles performed by Jesus, such as the healing of the Syro-Phoenician woman and the ruler's son in Capernaum. The prevalence of leprosy during that time is evident, and the cure for Naaman involved dipping himself seven times in the Jordan River, upon the instruction of Elisha. This early reference to the inclusion of Gentiles in God's blessings would have brought joy to the hearts of believers like Theophilus.
