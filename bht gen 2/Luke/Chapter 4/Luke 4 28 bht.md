# Luke 4:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people of Nazareth, who were initially amazed at Jesus's eloquence and ministry, were filled with wrath when they heard his allusions to the heathen, as they realized that they were being compared to the disobedient Israelites of old. They were angered by the implication that the Gentiles would receive the blessings that they despised, highlighting their rejection of God's sovereign and discriminating ways. The sudden burst of rage demonstrated their inability to bear the close application of Jesus's words, despite initially approving of his ministry.
