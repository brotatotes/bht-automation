# Luke 4:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people in the synagogue were so furious that they abruptly interrupted the service and forcefully expelled Jesus. Determined to harm Him, they led Him to the brow of the hill where their city was situated. Their intention was to throw Him down headlong and break Him to pieces, just like the destruction of the Edomites in the past. These individuals acted in a savage, unjust, and barbaric manner, disregarding the sanctity of the place, the worship being conducted, and even the Sabbath day itself. It is a stark display of their murderous intent towards Christ.
