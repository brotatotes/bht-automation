# Luke 4:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If Jesus truly is the Son of God, as he claims to be, then he possesses all divine perfections, including almighty power. This diabolic suggestion, aimed at causing doubt in Jesus towards his Father, appeals to Jesus' hunger as an opportunity to doubt and sin. However, Jesus remained firm and unyielding in the face of these temptations, refusing to use his power for selfish purposes, even when it would have been within his ability to turn stones into bread.
