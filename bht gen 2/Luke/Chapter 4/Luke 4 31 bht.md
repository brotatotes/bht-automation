# Luke 4:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ made the deliberate choice to move from Nazareth to Capernaum, viewing it as His new headquarters for His ministry. The change in location signified the rejection He faced in Nazareth and allowed Him to fully dedicate Himself to teaching and healing in Capernaum. In Capernaum, Jesus continued His practice of teaching in the synagogue on the Sabbath days, providing instruction and clarity on passages from the Old Testament. This move to Capernaum marked a significant shift in Jesus' ministry and enabled Him to touch the lives of the inhabitants in a profound way.
