# Luke 4:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage describes a man who was possessed by an unclean demon, driven by the influence and personality of the possessing demon. This evil spirit had seized his faculties, causing him to speak and perform involuntary movements. The demonic possession was evident in his loud cries and screams upon encountering Jesus. The term unclean is frequently used to describe evil spirits in the Gospel of Luke. The man was filled with a spirit of divination and was a deceiver, imposing on the people. Jesus' encounter with the possessed man demonstrated His power and authority over the forces of darkness.
