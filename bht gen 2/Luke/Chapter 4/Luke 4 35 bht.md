# Luke 4:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus rebuked the demon, he commanded it to be silent and come out of the possessed man. The word used here, hold thy peace or be thou muzzled, suggests a forceful restraint. As the demon was driven out, it caused the man to convulse and experience great pain, but it did not physically harm him. This detail, carefully noted by Luke, highlights the power of Jesus over the forces of evil, as he delivers individuals from oppression without causing bodily injury.
