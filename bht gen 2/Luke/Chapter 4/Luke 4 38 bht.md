# Luke 4:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The healing of Peter's mother-in-law is described in Mark 1:29-34 and Matthew 8:14-17. A fever is a class of diseases characterized by a preternatural heat felt throughout the body, accompanied by various symptoms. It is often present alongside inflammation and is indicated by a quick pulse and abnormal heat levels. Luke, who uses the word fever multiple times in the New Testament, further emphasizes the intensity of this condition. Paul's reference to Peter's wife in 1 Corinthians 9:5 is also relevant to this discussion.
