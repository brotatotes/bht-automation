# Luke 4:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus showed his compassionate nature by approaching the woman lying with a fever, as a sympathetic physician would. It's clear that Jesus's actions were not to exorcise a demon, but to provide healing and support. He spoke to the fever, commanding it to leave her, just as he had control over the elements. This miraculous healing happened instantly, allowing the woman to rise and serve others without any lingering weakness.
