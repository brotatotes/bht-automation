# Luke 4:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By quoting Deuteronomy 8:3, the passage suggests that human nature can be sustained by the power of God without relying solely on ordinary means. This emphasizes the importance of recognizing that bread alone cannot sustain life without divine blessing. When Jesus speaks of every word of God, it does not refer to all of Scripture, but rather the word of God's power that upholds and sustains all things, or the blessing and strength that He bestows upon food.
