# Luke 4:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the sun was set and the Sabbath ended, the people brought their sick to him, waiting for the moment when it was no longer considered work to carry a sick person. He laid his hands on every one of them, healing their various diseases, without the use of medicine, by the mere imposition of his hands. The cures of Jesus reached the physical, mental, and spiritual planes of human nature, demonstrating his lordship over all aspects of life and his tireless ministry of love.
