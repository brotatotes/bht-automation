# Luke 4:41 Commentary Help Text

It is evident that Jesus exercised his authority over demons by not allowing them to speak and bear witness to his divine nature. Despite the demons' knowledge of who he was, Jesus refused their testimony, thereby highlighting the clear distinction between his divine authority and the forces of evil. He explicitly ordered them to depart and rebuked them, displaying his complete control over all spiritual forces. His intentional refusal of their testimony serves as a powerful reminder of his dominion over the demonic realm.
