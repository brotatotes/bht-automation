# Luke 4:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Very early in the morning, Jesus rose and went to a quiet place to be alone and pray to God. People sought after him and tried to convince him to stay with them, not only because they were interested in his miracles and physical healing, but also because they wanted to prevent his departure. However, Jesus understood the importance of his mission and the need to continuously spread the good news to all, which required him to keep moving and reaching out to different places and people.
