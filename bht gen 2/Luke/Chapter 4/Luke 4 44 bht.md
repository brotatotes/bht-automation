# Luke 4:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During his ministry, he preached in the synagogues of Galilee, reaching out to the various cities and towns in the region. This is supported by other accounts in Mark 1:39 and Matthew 8:23-25, which describe the extensive work he did during this campaign. The various readings in the manuscripts, such as different attempts to address the difficulty of the phrase τῆς Ἰουδαίας, should not sway the critic. Their primary responsibility is to uncover the true sacred text, rather than projecting their own judgments and preferences onto it.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The reading τῆς Ἰουδαίας must, on any intelligible critical principles, be adopted; and Tregelles can hardly be acquitted of inconsistency with his own usual practice, in rejecting it."
2. "This view is confirmed by the fact that two evangelistaria here read τοῖς Ἰουδαίοις; one, τῶν Ἰουδαίων, both being attempts to escape from the difficulty of τῆς Ἰουδαίας; while one adopts αὐτῶν, part of the sentence in Mark."
3. "Still, these are considerations which must not weigh in the least degree with the critic. It is his province simply to track out what is the sacred text, not what, in his own feeble and partial judgment, it ought to have been."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "One must fill in details, though Mark 1:39 and Matthew 8:23-25 tell of the mass of work done on this campaign."
2. "Periphrastic imperfect active, describing his first tour of Galilee in accord with the purpose just stated."
3. "Was preaching (ην κηρυσσων)."

### John Gill:
1. And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee. In the several synagogues that were in different cities and towns throughout all Galilee.
