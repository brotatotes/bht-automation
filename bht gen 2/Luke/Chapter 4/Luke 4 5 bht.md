# Luke 4:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The devil transported Jesus from the pinnacle of the temple to a high mountain near Jerusalem, where he showed Jesus all the kingdoms of the world. This panoramic view of the world's kingdoms is a mental, imaginative experience that does not discredit the possibility of Satan physically appearing. It is important to note that as the Creator and ruler of the world, Jesus did not require any representation or knowledge of the kingdoms from Satan. The order of these temptations is uncertain, but while Luke's account follows a geographical progression, Matthew's order represents a climactic progression.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There can be little doubt that the order in Matt., in which this temptation is placed last, is to be adhered to in our expositions of the Temptation."
2. "No definite notes of succession are given in our text, but they are by Matt.: see notes there."
3. "Schleiermacher and Bleek suppose that the inversion has been made as suiting better the requirements of probability: it seeming more natural that our Lord should be first taken to the mountain and then to Jerusalem, than the converse."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In a moment of time [ŒµŒΩ œÉœÑŒπŒ≥ŒºŒ∑ œáœÅŒøŒΩŒøœÖ]. Peculiar to Luke. Stigmh is literally a mark made by a pointed instrument, a dot: hence a point of time." 
2. "Comapre stigmata, brand-marks, Galatians 6:17." 
3. "Tynd., in the twinkling of an eye."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "No definite mark of time, hence we think this temptation was the third (as in Matthew)."
2. "A supernatural extension of vision is possibly implied."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This panorama of all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them in a moment of time was mental, a great feat of the imagination (a mental satanic 'movie' performance), but this fact in no way discredits the idea of the actual visible appearance of Satan also."
2. "Luke's order is geographical (wilderness, mountain, Jerusalem). Matthew's is climacteric (hunger, nervous dread, ambition). There is a climax in Luke's order also (sense, man, God)."
3. "There is no way to tell the actual order."

### John Gill:
1. "The devil took him from the pinnacle of the temple, and carried him to some high mountain, as Lebanon, or Pisgah, or some other near Jerusalem." 
2. "He showed unto him all the kingdoms of the world not of the Roman empire only, but of the whole universe, every kingdom that was under the heavens." 
3. "Nor did Christ, who is the maker of the world, and the governor among the nations, need any representation of the kingdoms of the world from him."
