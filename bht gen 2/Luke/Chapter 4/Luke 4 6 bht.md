# Luke 4:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God is ultimately the one who controls and governs all the kingdoms of the world, not Satan. While Satan may deceive people into thinking he has authority over the kingdoms, it is a lie. Satan can only operate within the limits and permissions granted by God. This is why it is important to remember that it is God who ultimately determines the rise and fall of nations, not Satan.
