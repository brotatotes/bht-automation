# Luke 4:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus faced the temptation to bow down and worship, but he rejected the notion of the Messiah as an earthly ruler and refused to admit Satan's authority. Unlike a good angel, who directs worship to God alone, Satan sought to elevate himself to the position of deity. Jesus' rejection of this audacious demand demonstrated his understanding of the true source of worship. Satan's arrogance and insolence were exposed in his attempt to claim divine worship. By steadfastly refusing to give in, Jesus upheld the proper worship that should be reserved solely for God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is the ingressive aorist (œÄœÅŒøœÉŒ∫œÖŒΩŒ∑œÉŒ∑ŒπœÇ), just bow the knee once up here in my presence."
2. "The temptation was for Jesus to admit Satan's authority by this act of prostration (fall down and worship), a recognition of authority rather than of personal merit."
3. "The heart of Satan's program is here laid bare. Jesus here rejected the Jewish idea of the Messiah as an earthly ruler merely."

### John Gill:
1. "A wide difference there is between a good angel and a fallen angel; a good angel will not suffer himself to be worshipped by men, but directs to the worship of God only."
2. "He affected deity, and sought to have divine worship given him; and in this sin he still persisted, and grew worse and worse, more daring and insolent, desiring worship of him who is God over all, blessed for ever."
3. "O horrid impudence, arrogance, and insolence!"
