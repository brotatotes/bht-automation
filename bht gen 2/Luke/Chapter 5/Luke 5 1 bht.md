# Luke 5:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Matthew 4:18 and Mark 1:16, we witness the moment when Jesus called upon Simon and Andrew, two brothers who were fishermen. What is striking about this calling is that Jesus reached out to individuals who were not yet familiar with him. This underscores the power and attraction of Jesus' message and mission, as it was compelling enough to draw people to follow him, irrespective of their prior knowledge or background.
