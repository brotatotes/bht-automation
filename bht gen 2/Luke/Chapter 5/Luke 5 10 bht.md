# Luke 5:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Fear not, for there shall be no harm done to you or your boats. Instead, you shall cast the net of the Gospel and be the joyful instrument of bringing many people out of the depths of sin into the path of life and salvation. This was clearly seen when Peter preached and three thousand souls were converted in one sermon (Acts 2:41).

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The striking parallel, and yet contrast, in John 21:0 with its injunction, 'feed My lambs,' 'shepherd My sheep,' given to the same Peter; its net which did not burst: and the minute and beautiful appropriateness of each will be seen."
2. "It is perhaps too subtle, and hardly accordant with the rules of emphasis, to find (with Me [48] . and Stier) a fitness in ζωγρῶν as expressing the ethical catching of men. I prefer taking it as the word common to both acts merely as catch."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Simon, fear not—This shows how the Lord read Peter's speech. The more highly they deemed Him, ever the more grateful it was to the Redeemer's spirit. Never did they pain Him by manifesting too lofty conceptions of Him."
2. "from henceforth—marking a new stage of their connection with Christ. The last was simply, 'I will make you fishers.'"
3. "fishers of men—'What wilt thou think, Simon, overwhelmed by this draught of fishes, when I shall bring to thy net what will beggar all this glory?'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Fear not - He calmed their fears. With mildness and tenderness he stilled all their troubled feelings..."
2. "From henceforth - Hereafter."
3. "Shalt catch men - Thou shalt be a minister of the gospel, and thy business shall be to win people to the truth that they may be saved."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word here denotes a closer association, a common interest."
2. "The verb zwgrew, to catch, is compounded of zwov, living, and ajgreuw, to catch or take. Hence, lit., to take alive."
3. "There is certainly a reason for the use of this term, as indicating that Christ 's ministers are called to win men to life."

### John Calvin:
1. "The words of Matthew are, I will make you fishers of men; and those of Mark are, I will cause that you may become fishers of men. They teach us, that Peter, and the other three, were not only gathered by Christ to be his disciples, but were made apostles, or, at least, chosen with a view to the apostleship."
2. "This ought to be carefully weighed; for all are not commanded to leave their parents and their former occupation, and literally to follow Christ. There are some whom the Lord is satisfied with having in his flock and his Church, while he assigns to others their own station."
3. "Christ selected rough mechanics, — persons not only destitute of learning, but inferior in capacity, that he might train, or rather renew them by the power of his Spirit, so as to excel all the wise men of the world."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Thou shalt catch men... to catch them alive and for life, not dead and for death."
2. "Peter is to be a catcher of men, not of fish, and to catch them alive and for life, not dead and for death."
3. "Jesus foresees the possibilities in Simon and he joyfully undertakes the task of making a fisher of men out of this poor fisher of fish."

### John Gill:
1. "I shall do thee no harm, nor shall the boats sink, or any damage come to any person, or to the vessels."
2. "Thou shalt cast the net of the Gospel, and be the happy instrument of drawing many persons out of the depths of sin and misery, in which they are plunged, into the way of life and salvation."
3. "Which was greatly verified, in the conversion of three thousand at one cast, under one sermon of his, Acts 2:41."
