# Luke 5:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples' decision to forsake all and follow Jesus is a significant moment in their journey with Him. Prior to this, they had followed Him, but had not fully abandoned their former lives. This act of leaving everything behind signifies their complete devotion and commitment to Jesus. They not only left their livelihoods, but also their relationships and comforts. It serves as a reminder that discipleship requires a willingness to let go of worldly attachments and prioritize our relationship with Jesus above all else.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The whole occurrence was allegorized very early: the boat being taken as representing the Church; the net, doctrine; the sea, the heathen world; the bursting of the net, heresies."
2. "The fish was a favorite symbol among the early Christians, especially as the initial letters of the Greek phrase: Jesus Christ, son of God, Saviour, made up the word meaning fish (Ιχθυς)."
