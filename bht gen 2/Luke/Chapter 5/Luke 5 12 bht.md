# Luke 5:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The severity of the leprosy in this account is emphasized by the description of it as a bad case that is full of sores and far advanced. The parallel between leprosy and sin is drawn, highlighting their defiling and unclean nature. Just as leprosy spreads and brings ruin to the body, sin spreads and brings ruin to the soul and body. The healing and cleansing from sin can only come through Christ, not through adherence to the law.

### Henry Alford:
1.  12. ]  œÄŒªŒÆœÅŒ∑œÇ Œª  . (a touch of medical accuracy from the beloved physician) implies the soreness of the disease.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The expression, full of leprosy, seems to be used here with professional accuracy. Leprosy was known among physicians under three forms: the dull white, the clear white, and the black. Luke means to describe an aggravated case."
2. "The word full in this connection is often used by medical writers, as, full of disease; the veins full of blood; the ears full of roaring."
3. "All three evangelists say cleanse instead of heal, because of the notion of uncleanness which specially attached to this malady."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Evidently a bad case full of sores and far advanced as Luke the physician notes."
2. "The law (Leviticus 13:12) curiously treated advanced cases as less unclean than the earlier stages."
3. "His condition of the third class turned on the 'will' (Œ∏ŒµŒªŒ∑ŒπœÇ) of Jesus who at once asserts his will (Œ∏Œ∑Œªœâ) and cleanses him."

### John Gill:
1. "Between this disease and sin, there is a very great likeness. This disease is a very filthy one, and of a defiling nature... all mankind, by reason of sin, are by the Lord pronounced filthy; and by their evil actions, not only defile themselves, but others."
2. "Sin has spread itself over all mankind, and over all the powers and faculties of the soul, and members of the body; there is no place free of it... so sin eats like a canker, and brings ruin and destruction upon men, both soul and body."
3. "The law heals none, it is the killing letter, the ministration of condemnation and death; Christ only, by his blood and stripes, heals the disease of sin, and cleanses from it."

### John Wesley:
1.  Matthew 8:2; Mark 1:40.
