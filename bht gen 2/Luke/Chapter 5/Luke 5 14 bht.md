# Luke 5:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
And he commanded him to tell no man, but instead instructed him to go show himself to the priests and offer for his cleansing, according to the command given by Moses, as a testimony unto them. This passage demonstrates a transition from indirect to direct speech, a frequent occurrence in the Greek language. The reference to going to the priests and making an offering aligns with the instructions outlined in Leviticus 14:2. The Syriac and Persic versions further emphasize the importance of following the prescribed cleansing process as outlined by Moses.

### Henry Alford:
1.  14. ] A change of construction from the oblique to the direct: see reff.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He charged [παρηγγειλεν]. A strong word, often, of military orders. Aristotle uses it of a physician: to prescribe."
2. "Mark has ejmbrimhsamenov, strictly or sternly charged. See on Mark 1:43."
3. "Go, shew thyself. A lively change from the narrative to direct address."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "To tell no man." (μηδεν ειπειν). This is an indirect command after the verb "charged" (παρηγγειλεν). But Luke changes (constructio variata) to the direct quotation, a common idiom in Greek and often in Luke (Acts 1:4).
2. "Here in the direct form he follows Mark 1:43; Matthew 8:4. See discussion there about the direction to go to the priest to receive a certificate showing his cleansing, like our release from quarantine (Leviticus 13:39; Leviticus 14:2-32)."
3. "For a testimony unto them." (εις μαρτυριον αυτοις). The use of αυτοις (them) here is "according to sense," as we say, for it has no antecedent in the context, just to people in general. But this identical phrase with absence of direct reference occurs in Mark and Matthew, pretty good proof of the use of one by the other. Both Matthew 8:4; Luke 5:14 follow Mark 1:44.

### John Gill:
1. "And he charged him to tell no man... but go show thyself to the priest."
2. "The Syriac and Persic versions read, 'to the priests: and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses has commanded, for a testimony unto them'."

### John Wesley:
1.  Leviticus 14:2.
