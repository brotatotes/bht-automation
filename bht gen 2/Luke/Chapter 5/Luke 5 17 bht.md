# Luke 5:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The multitudes came from all parts to observe Jesus and seek healing, while the Pharisees and doctors of the law sought to expose him.

Jesus, being seated, drew people's attention as he taught, and the power of God was present to heal them both spiritually and physically.
