The friends of the paralyzed man encountered a problem when they tried to bring him to Jesus due to the crowded house. Undeterred, they came up with a creative solution. They went to the flat roof of the house and removed the tiles, creating a wider opening. Through this opening, they lowered the man on his bed right in front of Jesus. It was a remarkable demonstration of determination and resourcefulness, capturing the attention of everyone present.
