# Luke 5:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Luke 5:21, the scribes and Pharisees questioned Jesus' authority to forgive sins, reasoning that only God has the power to do so. Their understanding was rooted in the belief that sins can only be forgiven by the one against whom they are committed. This highlights their limited perception of Jesus, failing to grasp his divine nature and purpose as the Redeemer. Their skepticism stemmed from a lack of comprehension regarding the true nature of Jesus and his role as the savior who came to deliver people from the bondage of sin.
