# Luke 5:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To walk is not merely a physical act, but a deeper meaning lies beneath it. It signifies the authority and power of God to forgive sins and heal the sick. It is clear that only God can truly speak a word that can bring about the forgiveness of sins or restore physical well-being. By posing the question of whether it is easier to say your sins are forgiven or rise, take up your bed and walk, Jesus was revealing his divinity and demonstrating that he had the authority to forgive sins and perform miracles.

### John Gill:
1. "Neither of them could be said by a mere man, with effect, so as that sins would be really remitted on so saying; or that a man sick of a palsy, by such a word speaking, would be able to stand upon his feet and walk; but both of them were equally easy to him, that is truly God."
2. "He that could cure a man of a palsy with a word speaking, ought not to be charged with blasphemy, for taking upon him to forgive sin."
3. "Our Lord meant, by putting this question, and acting upon it, to prove himself to be God, and to remove the imputation of blasphemy from him."
