# Luke 5:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As soon as Christ spoke these words, the man who was previously paralyzed immediately rose from his bed and stood before the astonished crowd. He wasted no time and went about his daily activities, giving glory and honor to God for his miraculous healing. This man's act of glorifying God came from a deep understanding of the power and authority of Jesus. He recognized Jesus as not only his physical healer, but also as the divine Son of God who forgave his sins. By glorifying Jesus, he acknowledged Him as the Messiah, his Savior, and his Lord.
