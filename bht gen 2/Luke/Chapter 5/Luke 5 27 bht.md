# Luke 5:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Matthew 9:9 and Mark 2:14, we read about Jesus encountering Levi, also called Matthew, and inviting him to become one of his disciples. Jesus not only saw Levi, but he observed him closely, demonstrating his attentive care. Levi, a tax collector, receives a special and powerful calling from Jesus, who commands him to leave his profession and follow him. This command to Follow me holds significant meaning, highlighting the transformative nature of Jesus' invitation to be his follower.
