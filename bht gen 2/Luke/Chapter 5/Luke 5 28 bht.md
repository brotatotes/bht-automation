# Luke 5:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He willingly gave up everything he had, including his business and all the profits that came with it. The power of Christ's words had such an impact on him that he couldn't resist following Him. This act of leaving everything behind not only referred to the physical possessions, but it also represented a spiritual surrender and a becoming of Christ's disciple.
