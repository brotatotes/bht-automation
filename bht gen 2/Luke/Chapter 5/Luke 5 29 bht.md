# Luke 5:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Levi, also known as Matthew, hosted a great feast for Jesus. This feast was not only a celebration of the radical change that had taken place in Levi's life, but also an opportunity for him to introduce Jesus to his fellow tax collectors and sinners. The feast was not just the sharing of a meal, but a powerful demonstration of the transforming power of God's grace. The gathering consisted of a diverse group of people, including Jews, Gentiles, publicans, and sinners. The presence of these individuals further highlighted the inclusive and compassionate nature of Jesus' ministry.
