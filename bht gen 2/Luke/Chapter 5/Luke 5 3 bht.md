# Luke 5:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ, desiring to teach the multitudes, requested Peter to put out the boat a little way from the shore. As He sat in the boat to teach, He applied the custom of sitting while teaching in Jewish culture. The act of putting out the boat held significance, as it was a nautical term signifying the disciples' obedience to Christ's command.
