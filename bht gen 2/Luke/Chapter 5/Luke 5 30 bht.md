# Luke 5:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Luke 5:36-38, the incongruities mentioned illustrate the difference between the old and new economies. The danger of mixing the two is emphasized. The new wine symbolizes the evangelical freedom that Christ was introducing, while the old represents the spirit of Judaism. It was expected that those accustomed to the old would not immediately embrace the new. This passage serves as a lesson for those clinging fiercely to obsolete practices as well as those impatient with the hesitancy of others. The Pharisees raised objections against Jesus and His disciples, murmuring at their actions and accusing Him to tarnish His reputation.
