# Luke 5:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus declared, I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.” This statement reminds us that only those who recognize their sinfulness are in need of a change of mind and lifestyle. In doing so, Jesus sets an example for all who seek to bring others to faith, showing them the path to follow in their own soul-winning endeavors. It is important to remember that those who are self-satisfied and resistant to repentance may prove to be the most challenging to win over, often resenting efforts made to bring them to Christ.
