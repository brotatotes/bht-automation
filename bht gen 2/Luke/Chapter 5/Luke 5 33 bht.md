# Luke 5:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples of John and the Pharisees questioned Jesus, asking why his disciples did not fast and make prayers as frequently as theirs did. While the disciples of John and the Pharisees had a strict and disciplined lifestyle of fasting often and offering solemn prayers, Jesus' disciples focused on being present and partaking in the joyous occasions of eating and drinking with him.
