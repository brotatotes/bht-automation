# Luke 5:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To join these together, in order to appear in a garment of righteousness before God, was as weak and ridiculous as putting a piece of new cloth into an old, threadbare garment. This teaches us that the Jews, by being drawn to the observance of traditions, were pulled away from obeying God's commandments. By attempting to combine the traditions of men with the ordinances of God, they ended up with a righteousness that was worse off - a ragged and torn one. This parable, likened to clothes and wine, is particularly fitting for a feast.

3. "represents to us the spoiling of both systems by an attempt to engraft the new upon the old: the new loses its completeness; the old, its consistency."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "No man having rent a piece from a new garment, putteth it, etc." 
2. "The new maketh a rent...He will rend the new." 
3. "In Luke the damage is twofold; first, in injuring the new garment by cutting out a piece; and second, in making the old garment appear patched, instead of widening the rent, as in Matthew and Mark."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This part of the verse differs from the parallel passages, in representing a double disadvantage."
2. "Our text is very significant, and represents to us the spoiling of born systems by the attempt to engraft the new upon the old: the new loses its completeness; the old, its consistency."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They are not called parables save here, but they are parables and Luke's language means that."
2. "Used of splitting rocks (Matthew 27:51). Our word schism comes from it."
3. "See on Matthew and Mark for distinction between καινος (fresh), νεος (new), and παλαιος (old)."

### John Gill:
1. "To join these together, in order to patch up a garment of righteousness, to appear in before God, was equally as weak and ridiculous, as to put a piece of new and undressed cloth into a garment that was old, and wore threadbare."
2. "By this Christ intimates, that the Jews, by being directed to the observance of the traditions of the elders, were drawn off from a regard to the commandments of God; so that instead of having a better righteousness, they had one much the worse, a ragged, and a rent one."
3. "The piece that was taken out of the new, agreeth not with the old; and so the statutes of men, and the ordinances of God, or the traditions of the elders, and the commands of God, are no more like one another, than the piece of a new and an old garment."

### John Wesley:
1. He spake also a parable — Taken from clothes and wine; therefore peculiarly proper at a feast.
