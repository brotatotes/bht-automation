# Luke 5:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage cautions against putting new wine into old bottles, symbolizing the resistance of the Scribes and Pharisees to receive the Gospel grace. They proved incapable of embracing these teachings, deeming them unendurable. The Scribes and Pharisees reacted with wrath and rejection, lacking the patience and love required to accept Jesus' profound message.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Gill:
1. "And no man putteth new wine into old bottles,.... To which the Scribes and Pharisees are here compared, into whose hearts the new wine of Gospel grace was not put; or to whom was not made known the love of God Comparable to new wine."
2. "Else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled; they not being able to receive and bear these things, no, not the relation of them: these were hard sayings to them, of which they said, who can hear them?"
3. "They could not hear them with patience, much less receive them in the love of them; but were at once filled with wrath and indignation, and rejected them."
