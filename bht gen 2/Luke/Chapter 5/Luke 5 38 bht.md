# Luke 5:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers in Christ, like the disciples and repentant sinners, experience a renewal through the work of the Spirit and grace of God. This renewal fills them with a deep spiritual joy and comfort, akin to being filled with new wine. Through this renewal, they are preserved for the kingdom and glory of Christ, as the grace within them becomes a wellspring of living water that leads to eternal life. These renewed ones, along with the Gospel and its blessings, are interconnected and intertwined in the work of God's redemption.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Must be put" (βλητεον). This verbal adjective in -τεος rather than -τος appears here alone in the N.T. though it is common enough in Attic Greek.
2. It is a survival of the literary style.
3. This is the impersonal use and is transitive in sense here and governs the accusative "new wine" (οινον νεον), though the agent is not expressed (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1097).

### John Gill:
1. "Such as the disciples of Christ were, and sinners called to repentance are, who are renewed by the Spirit and grace of God: and these are filled with spiritual joy and comfort, as with new wine."
2. "These [renewed ones] are preserved unto the kingdom and glory of Christ; and the grace that is put into them, which is a well of living water, springing up to everlasting life."
3. "both these renewed ones... and the Gospel, and its blessings."
