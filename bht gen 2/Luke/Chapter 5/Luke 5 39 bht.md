# Luke 5:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The old is familiar and comforting, like the religious customs of the Jews. The new wine represents the grace and freedom of the Gospel, but it was not palatable to the Jews who were accustomed to the old system. Over time, the new wine will become older and better, but it takes time for one to acquire a taste for it. This teaching is a reminder to be patient and not to be discouraged if one's enthusiasm for sharing their faith is not immediately embraced by others.
