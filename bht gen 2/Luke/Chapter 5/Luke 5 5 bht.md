# Luke 5:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Despite toiling all night and catching nothing, Peter still obeyed Jesus when He commanded him to let down the net once more. This illustrates the persistence and faithfulness of those who preach the Gospel, even when they face discouragement and lack of success. They continue their work because of the commission and word of command they have received from Christ, and rely on His promise to be with them. Just as Peter's obedience led to a miraculous catch of fish, the obedience of faithful preachers yields results beyond their own efforts.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Master—betokening not surely a first acquaintance, but a relationship already formed."
2. "all night—the usual time of fishing then (John 21:3), and even now Peter, as a fisherman, knew how hopeless it was to 'let down his net' again, save as a mere act of faith, 'at His word' of command, which carried in it, as it ever does, assurance of success."
3. "This shows he must have been already and for some time a follower of Christ."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word here used means a 'prefect,' or one placed 'over' others, and hence, it comes to mean 'teacher' or 'guide'."
2. "This was a remarkable instance of 'faith'. Peter, as it appears, knew little then of Jesus. He was not then a chosen apostle. Jesus came to these fishermen almost a stranger and unknown, and yet at his command Peter resolved to make another trial, and go once more out into the deep."
3. "Oh, if all would as readily obey him, all would be in like manner blessed. If sinners would thus obey him, they would find all his promises sure. He never disappoints. He asks only that we have 'confidence' in him, and he will give to us every needful blessing."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Master [επιστατα] . Used by Luke only, and always with reference to Jesus."
2. "Toiled [κοπιασαντες] . From korov, suffering, weariness; and therefore indicating exhausting toil."
3. "Relying on : on the ground of. The net [δικτυον] . A general term for a net, whether for fish or fowl. See on Matthew 4:18."

### John Calvin:
1. "But a particular instance of faith, rendered to a single command of Christ, would not have made Peter a Christian, or given him a place among the sons of God, if he had not been led on, from this first act of submission, to a full obedience."
2. "The deference which he pays to Christ is manifested by this, that, when worn out by fruitless toil, he commences anew what he had already attempted in vain."
3. "But, as Peter yielded so readily to the command of Christ, whom he did not yet know to be a Prophet or the Son of God, no apology can be offered for our disgraceful conduct if, while we call him our Lord, and King, and Judge, we do not move a finger to perform our duty, to which we have ten times received his commands."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Master. Not ‘teacher,’ but a title of respect, not involving a close personal relation."
2. "We toiled. Not ‘have toiled,’ for that implies that they had just stopped. Peter gives an account of the last night’s labor."
3. "At thy word. On account of thy word. This involved faith, yet the proverbial superstition of fishermen may have entered here."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This word recognizes Christ's authority."
2. "Peter's protest calls attention also to the whole night of fruitless toil."
3. "Acquiescence to show his obedience to Christ as 'Master,' but with no confidence whatsoever in the wisdom of this particular command."

### John Gill:
1. "We have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing...nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net." 
2. "Thus the faithful preachers of the Gospel, sometimes labour and toil in the ministry of the word a great while, with little or no success; and are discouraged from going on, and would be tempted to leave off, were it not for the commission and word of command they have received from Christ, which they dare not be disobedient to..."
3. "...and for the word of promise he has given them, to be with them, on which they depend."
