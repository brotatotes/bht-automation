# Luke 5:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The miraculous catch of fish caused the net to begin tearing under the immense weight and quantity of the fish. It is a demonstration of the power and authority of Christ, who gathered the fish together in that very spot. Even though the net started to tear, it did not completely give way, ensuring that none of the fish escaped.
