# Luke 5:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They beckoned to their partners from a considerable distance, using signs and gestures to call them over. The nets were so full of fish that they were on the brink of sinking, and they had to work together to take up the net and remove the fish from it. The sheer abundance of the catch was overwhelming, and it required the united effort of the fishermen to handle the massive quantity of fish.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "They beckoned, on account of the distance."
2. "μὴ δυνάμενοι λαλῆσαι ἀπὸ τῆς ἐκπλήξεως καὶ τοῦ φόβου."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Perhaps they were at a considerable distance, so that they could not be easily heard." 
2. "It was with some one of this sort, I suppose, that Simon had toiled all night without catching anything, but which, when let down at the command of Jesus, inclosed so great a multitude that the net broke, and they filled two ships with the fish until they began to sink."
3. "Indeed, every kind of fishing is uncertain. A dozen times the angler jerks out a naked hook; the hand-net closes down on nothing; the drag-net brings in only weeds; the bag comes up empty."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "They beckoned [κατενευσαν]. The word originally means to nod assent, and so, generally, to make a sign."
2. "Help [συλλαβεσθαι]. Lit., take hold with."
3. "Began to sink [βυθιζωσθαι]. Only here and 1 Timothy 6:9, of drowning men in destruction."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Beckoned. Probably on account of the distance; not from amazement, as some of the Fathers have thought. Fishermen's signals require little explanation."
2. "Their fellows, i.e., the sons of Zebedee (Luke 5:10). Not necessarily 'partners.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They beckoned (κατενευσαν). Possibly they were too far away for a call to be understood. Simon alone had been ordered to put out into the deep. So they used signs." 
2. "Unto their partners (τοις μετεχοις). This word μετοχος, from μετεχω, to have with, means participation with one in common blessings (Hebrews 3:1; Hebrews 3:14; Hebrews 6:4; Hebrews 12:8). While κοινωνος (verse Luke 5:10 here of James and John also) has the notion of personal fellowship, partnership."
3. "So that they began to sink (ωστε βυθιζεσθα αυτα). Consecutive use of ωστε and the infinitive (present tense, inchoative use, beginning to sink). An old verb from βυθος. In the N.T. only here and 1 Timothy 6:9."

### John Gill:
1. "And they beckoned unto their partners...and so were not within call; but they were obliged to make signs to them, and beckon with their hands to come to them." 
2. "Take up the net, and take the fish out of it."
3. "The vessels were so heavy laden, with the vast quantity of fish that was taken, that they were just ready to sink with their burden."
