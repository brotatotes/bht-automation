# Luke 5:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter, overcome by the presence and power of Jesus, fell down on his knees and confessed his unworthiness. He recognized the contradiction between his sinful state and the holiness of God. In his humility, he felt an overwhelming sense of awe. Like the centurion, Peter acknowledged his own inadequacy in the presence of the divine. He desired Jesus to depart from him because of his deep sense of unworthiness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This sense of unworthiness and self-loathing is ever the effect, in the depths of a heart not utterly hardened, of the Divine Power and presence."
2. "Below this, is the utterly profane state, in which there is no contrast, no contradiction felt, between the holy and the unholy, between God and man."
3. "Above it, is the state of grace, in which the contradiction is felt, the deep gulf perceived, which divides between sinful man and an holy God, yet it is felt that this gulf is bridged over, that it is possible for the two to meet, that in One who is sharer with both, they have already been brought together."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Did Peter then wish Christ to leave him? Verily no. His all was wrapped up in Him."
2. "Woe is me, Lord! How shall I abide this blaze of glory? A sinner such as I am is not fit company for Thee."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He fell down at Jesus’ knees - This was a common posture of 'supplication.' He had no doubt now of the power and knowledge of Jesus."
2. "In amazement, wonder, and gratitude, and not doubting that he was in the presence of some divine being, he prostrated himself to the earth, trembling and afraid."
3. "Peter’s feeling was not unnatural, though it was not proper to request Jesus to leave him. It was an involuntary, sudden request, and arose from ignorance of the character of Jesus."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Fell down at Jesus' knees."
2. "Zeus from the dark depths thundered, and the girls Heard it, and shuddering, at their father's knees Falling, they wept."

### John Calvin:
1. "Although men are earnest in seeking the presence of God, yet, as soon as God appears, they must be struck with terror, and almost rendered lifeless by dread and alarm, until he administers consolation."
2. "They have the best reason for calling earnestly on God because they cannot avoid feeling that they are miserable, while he is absent from them: and on the other hand, his presence is appalling because they begin to feel that they are nothing, and that they are overpowered by an immense mass of evils."
3. "Thus Christ sinks his own people in the grave, that he may afterwards raise them to life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Fell down, etc. Not an act of worship, but a recognition of God's power in Jesus."
2. "For I am a sinful man. It was not superstition, but a sense of unworthiness. In Jesus he recognized to some extent the holiness as well as the power of God. Such a feeling always exists in similar cases."
3. "Instead of departing from Peter, He drew Peter to Himself, and the reason Peter urged was the reason for making him cling more closely to his powerful and holy Master."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Just like Peter, from extreme self-confidence and pride to abject humilation."
2. "His impulse here was right and sincere."
3. "His confession was true. He was a sinful man."

### John Gill:
1. "he fell on his knees before him, and threw himself prostrate at his feet, as a worshipper of him, and a supplicant unto him" 
2. "this he said, not as though the presence of Christ was burdensome, or disagreeable to him; but as one amazed at the greatness of the miracle wrought"
3. "he had much the same sense of things as the centurion had"

### John Wesley:
1. Depart from me, for I am a sinful man — And therefore not worthy to be in thy presence.
