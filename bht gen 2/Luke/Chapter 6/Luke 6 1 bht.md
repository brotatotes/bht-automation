# Luke 6:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The phrase second Sabbath after the first is somewhat ambiguous, but it likely refers to the first Sabbath after a particular festival, such as the Passover or the start of the Jewish year. On this day, the disciples plucked and rubbed ears of corn, which was not inherently forbidden but frowned upon by the Pharisees due to their strict interpretation of the Sabbath law. However, their objections were more about the timing than the act itself. The disciples did not violate any rights of property, but they chafed against the Pharisees' rigid observance of the Sabbath.
