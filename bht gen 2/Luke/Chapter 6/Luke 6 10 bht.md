# Luke 6:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage in Mark's Gospel where Jesus heals a man with a withered hand is described as one of the most vivid and powerful scenes in the Gospels. Jesus is deeply moved by the hardness of heart exhibited by those around him. Despite their skepticism, Jesus demonstrates his divine power by restoring the man's hand to its original state. This miraculous healing serves as a poignant reminder of Jesus' compassion and his ability to bear our burdens even while he was on earth.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Mark adds μετ ʼ ὀργῆς συλλυπούμενος ἐπὶ τῇ πωρώσει τῆς καρδίας αὐτῶν one of the most striking and graphic descriptions in the Gospels."
2. "It was thus that He bore, even while on earth, our sins and infirmities."
3. "Their hearts were hardened, but He grieved for it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Thy hand. The arm was not withered.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He looked round about on them all (περιβλεψαμενος). First aorist middle participle as in Mark 3:5, the middle voice giving a personal touch to it all."
2. "Mark adds 'with anger' which Luke here does not put in."
3. "All three Gospels also have the first aorist passive indicative απεκατεσταθη with the double augment of the double compound verb αποκαθιστημ. As in Greek writers, so here the double compound means complete restoration to the former state."

### John Gill:
1. "Stretch forth thy hand, and he did so; he stretched it out... and his hand was restored well as the other."
2. "His withered hand was restored sound and well as the other, directly."
