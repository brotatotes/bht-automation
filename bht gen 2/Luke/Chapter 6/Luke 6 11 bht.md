# Luke 6:11 Commentary Help Text

The Pharisees and Herodians, filled with madness and senseless rage, were unable to answer Jesus' probing questions. In their frustration, they resorted to consulting with one another, plotting on how to deal with Jesus. This alliance between the Pharisees and Herodians reflects their shared opposition to Jesus, and their determination to find a way to ultimately eliminate him.
