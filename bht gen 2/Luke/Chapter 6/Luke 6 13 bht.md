# Luke 6:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After spending the night in prayer, Jesus called his disciples to him, selecting a group of twelve from among them. These chosen ones were named apostles, a title that Jesus bestowed upon them to indicate their future role and purpose. Jesus intended to make them his companions and later send them out to preach, heal, and cast out demons. What sets these twelve apart is that they were personally chosen and ordained by Jesus himself, with the purpose of being trained to interpret and proclaim his teachings to the world.
