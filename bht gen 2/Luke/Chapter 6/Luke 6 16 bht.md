# Luke 6:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jude, also known as the brother of James, was one of the twelve apostles. He is often referred to as Judas, not to be confused with Judas Iscariot, who became the traitor. The choice of the twelve apostles was significant, as they were sent out in pairs to preach and minister. This method of pairing was a common practice among the Jewish fathers and doctors. The selection of the apostles was made before Christ's time, indicating the foreknowledge and intentionality of God in choosing them.
