# Luke 6:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The sermon described in this passage is believed to have taken place on a plain at the foot of the mountain. Some suggest that the plain was a large and spacious area, suitable for accommodating a large number of people. It is interesting to note that both Matthew and Luke mention the location of the sermon, dispelling the notion that the places, audiences, and topics were different. The multitude of people who came to hear Jesus included not only his disciples, but also others who held him in high esteem, coming from various regions.
