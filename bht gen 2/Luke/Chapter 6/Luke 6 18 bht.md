## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

2. "Unclean spirits - Demons that were impure and unholy, having a delight in tormenting, and in inflicting painful and loathsome diseases."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Vexed [οχλουμενοι] . The best texts read ejnocloumenoi, occurring only here and Hebrews 12:15. From oclov, a crowd or mob, with the idea of want of arrangement and discipline, and therefore of confusion and tumult."
2. "Hence it is applied to the noise and tumult of a crowd."
3. "And so passes into the sense of the trouble and annoyance caused by these."


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The healings were repeated as often as they came."
2. "Note here both verbs, ιαομα and θεραπευω, used of the miraculous cures of Jesus."
