# Luke 6:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Pharisees questioned the disciples, asking them why they were doing something that was deemed unlawful on the Sabbath day, such as plucking ears of corn, rubbing them, and eating them. This incident is depicted in Matthew and Mark, where the Pharisees held the disciples accountable for their actions. However, it is worth noting that it was likely a later occurrence, as the disciples were addressed by the Pharisees.
