# Luke 6:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, focusing on his disciples, affirmed that those who are poor in spirit are truly blessed. This beatitude does not solely refer to being economically poor, but rather having a humble and dependent spirit. The kingdom of God is their inheritance, both in the present and future. Conversely, the wealthy and content will find that prosperity can often be deceptive, while affliction can be a means of growth. Therefore, let us not be lured by worldly success or praise, but embrace the teachings of Jesus, finding true happiness in poverty of spirit.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The discourse was spoken to the disciples generally, to the Twelve particularly, to the people prospectively; and its subject, both here and in Matt., is, the state and duties of a disciple of Christ."
2. "To suppose that Luke’s report of this discourse refers only to this world’s poverty, &c. and the blessings to anticipated outward prosperity in the Messiah’s Kingdom is surely quite a misapprehension."
3. "Comparing these expressions with other passages in Luke himself, we must have concluded, even without Matthew’s report, that they bore a spiritual sense."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In the Sermon on the Mount the benediction is pronounced upon the 'poor in spirit' and those who 'hunger and thirst after righteousness.'"
2. "Here it is simply on the 'poor' and the 'hungry now.'"
3. "In this form of the discourse, then, our Lord seems to have had in view 'the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which God hath promised to them that love Him,' as these very beatitudes are paraphrased by James."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The phrase kingdom of Heaven was common in the Rabbinical writings, and had a double signification: the historical kingdom and the spiritual and moral kingdom."
2. "The ultimate idea of the kingdom is that of 'a redeemed humanity, with its divinely revealed destiny manifesting itself in a religious communion, or the Church; a social communion, or the state; and an aesthetic communion, expressing itself in forms of knowledge and art.'"
3. "The kingdom of God in its present development is not identical with the Church. The Church is identified with the kingdom to the dgree in which it is under the power of the spirit of Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "His disciples, in the wider sense, though the Twelve were nearest and the people present."
2. "Blessed...Ye...Poor, i.e., 'poor in spirit' (Matthew)."
3. "The kingdom of God. Equivalent to 'the kingdom, of heaven' (Matthew)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus looked the vast audience full in the face. He spoke out so that the great crowd could hear."
2. "Luke's report is direct address in all the four beatitudes and four woes given by him."
3. "The kingdom of God...is the favourite word of Jesus for the rule of God in the heart here and now. It is both present and future and will reach a glorious consummation."

### John Gill:
1. "And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples... blessed be ye poor; not only in the things of this world, having left all for Christ, but poor in Spirit." 
2. "for yours is the kingdom of God; or heaven."

### John Wesley:
1. "He here again pronounces the poor and the hungry, the mourners, and the persecuted, happy; and represents as miserable those who are rich, and full, and joyous, and applauded: because generally prosperity is a sweet poison, and affliction a healing, though bitter medicine."
2. "Let the thought reconcile us to adversity, and awaken our caution when the world smiles upon us; when a plentiful table is spread before us, and our cup is running over; when our spirits are gay; and we hear (what nature loves) our own praise from men."
3. "Happy are ye poor — The word seems here to be taken literally: ye who have left al] for me."
