# Luke 6:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness and eternal life, who suffer in this present life but yearn for spiritual fulfillment, for they will be filled. They will be filled with spiritual joy and pleasure, comforted by the consolations of the Spirit, their present sufferings contrasting sharply with the future blessings that await them.
