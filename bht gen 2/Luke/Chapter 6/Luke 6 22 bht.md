# Luke 6:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus teaches his followers that they will be blessed when they face hatred, reproach, and being cast out by others for the sake of Him and the Gospel. This not only refers to excommunication from the religious congregation but also to being socially ostracized. The name of being a Christian, disciple, or Nazarene became a term of contempt and scorn. These words of Jesus are a prophetic warning of the persecution that the early believers would face.
