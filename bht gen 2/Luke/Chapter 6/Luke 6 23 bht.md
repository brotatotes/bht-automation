# Luke 6:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Luke 6:23, it is said to leap for joy in the day when one faces hatred and reproach, a reward given to the prophets who were similarly treated by their fathers. This exhortation to rejoice is seen as an expression of the honor and happiness that comes with enduring persecution. The reward for such suffering is not just immediate, but great in heaven, as exemplified by the treatment of the prophets throughout history.
