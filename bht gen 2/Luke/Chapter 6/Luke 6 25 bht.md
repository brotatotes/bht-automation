# Luke 6:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Woe to those who are filled with an abundance of worldly possessions and are consumed by their own self-righteousness, for they shall hunger for eternal blessings. Likewise, those who indulge in frivolous laughter and find joy in their own vain glory shall experience mourning and weeping in the darkness. These verses teach us the contrast between the temporal gratification sought by the world and the lasting fulfillment found in the kingdom of God.
