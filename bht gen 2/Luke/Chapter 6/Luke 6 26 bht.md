# Luke 6:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Beware when the world praises you, for if you are truly faithful in your beliefs and actions, the wicked will not admire or applaud you. Only the good word of good men should be valued, for it is the deceitful prophets who receive the favor and riches of the world. Just as their fathers of old spoke well of false prophets, so too will the wicked heap praise on those who speak smooth things. So be warned, for when all men speak well of you, it may be a sign that you have strayed from the path of righteousness.

3. "The address in Luk 6:27 is not (Meyer) a turning of the discourse to His own disciples, but ὑμῖν λέγω τοῖς ἀκούουσιν = ἐγὼ δὲ λέγω ὑμῖν, which introduces the same command Matthew 5:44, and τοῖς ἀκούουσιν serves the purpose of the ἐγώ to you who now hear Me."
