# Luke 6:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To bear injuries and affronts, Christ teaches patience and advises against seeking personal revenge. He tells us not to retaliate even when our honor and property are violated, as symbolized by being smitten on the cheek or having our cloak taken away. Instead, we are to offer the other cheek and not withhold even our coat, prioritizing Christian love over our own desire for retribution. This challenges us to display humility and forbearance in the face of adversity, choosing to suffer more rather than giving in to a retaliatory spirit.
