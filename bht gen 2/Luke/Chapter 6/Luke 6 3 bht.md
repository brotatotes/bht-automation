# Luke 6:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus vindicated the disciples by pointing out what David did and mentioning another instance, not mentioned by this evangelist, to show that their actions were not unlawful. The individuals questioning Jesus were eager to find something to accuse him of, hence their curiosity about his response. Furthermore, Jesus highlighted how the priests, who were granted specific exemptions regarding the Sabbath, conducted various works that could be seen as violating the Sabbath without facing any blame.

1. "Have ye not read so much as this? i.e. 'Are ye so utterly ignorant of the spirit of Scripture?'" 
2. "The remarkable substitution in [56] for Luk 6:5 seems to be an interpolation, but hardly an invention of a later time. Its form and contents speak for its originality and, I am disposed to believe, its authenticity."
3. "The text of the Codex Bezæ is a very peculiar one, deviating more from the received readings and from the principal manuscript authorities than any other... Its peculiarities are so great, that in many passages, while the sense remains for the most part unaltered, hardly three words together are the same as in the commonly received text."

### Marvin Vincent:
