# Luke 6:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When it comes to giving, it is important to exercise discernment. We should not give to those who may have malicious intentions or seek to take advantage of others. Instead, we are encouraged to give generously to those who are truly in need and to offer assistance within our means. It is also advised not to seek repayment from those who are unable to do so. By exercising patience and trusting in the justice of the Lord, we can navigate the complexities of giving with wisdom and compassion.
