# Luke 6:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By doing good, we are demonstrating grace and goodness, without expecting any thanks or reward. We should not consider ourselves righteous or superior to sinners just because we do good deeds. In fact, even sinners can perform acts of kindness, so we should not let our actions lead us to arrogance. We should remember that being kind to others is a natural inclination, observed even in the worst of people. So, let us continue to do good, not for personal gain, but out of true compassion and love for others.
