# Luke 6:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When we lend to others with the expectation of receiving something in return, what credit is that to us? Even sinners engage in this type of transaction, expecting to be repaid equally. However, true love goes beyond mere calculation and attachment. It is a love based on judgment and discernment. It is a love that is willing to lend without expecting anything in return, even to those who might not be able to repay us. In doing so, we reflect the very nature of God's love for us.
