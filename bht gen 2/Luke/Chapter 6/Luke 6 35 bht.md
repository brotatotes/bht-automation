# Luke 6:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
But love your enemies; do good and lend, not only to your friends but also to your enemies, without expecting anything in return. Even if it seems unlikely that they will repay, we are called to help those who appear to be in hopeless situations. As children of God, we are to imitate our Heavenly Father, who is kind even to the unthankful and evil. By showing love and generosity, our reward will be great, both in this world and in the life to come.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This last sense of the word is best supported by examples, both from Polybius...and the Apocrypha." 
2. "But as it is an ἅπαξ λεγόμενον in the N.T., perhaps the force of the context should prevail, and the ordinary interpretation be adopted, as there is nothing in analogy ( ἀπαιτῶ , ἀπολαμβάνω , …) to forbid the meaning."
3. "Meyer maintains that this must mean 'sons of God' in the sense of partakers of the glory of the Messiah’s Kingdom, but without reference to the state of believers in this life, which last he says is according to the usage of Paul, not of the three first Evangelists. But surely this is sufficiently answered by ὁ πατὴρ ὑμῶν in the next verse, where the actual present sonship to our heavenly Father is a reason why we should imitate Him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Hoping for nothing again...meaning originally to give up in despair...never despairing...thus Isaiah 29:19, 'The poor among men shall rejoice.'"
2. "According to this, the sense here is, 'do good as those who consider nothing as lost.'"
3. "Children of the Highest...rightly, sons."

### John Calvin:
1. "We now see, that the word nothing is improperly explained as referring to usury, or to any interest that is added to the principal: whereas Christ only exhorts us to perform our duties freely, and tells us that mercenary acts are of no account in the sight of God."
2. "Christ’s meaning, as I have already explained, is simply this: When believers lend, they ought to go beyond heathens; or, in other words, they ought to exercise pure liberality."
3. "He alone is truly beneficent to his neighbors, who is led to assist them without any regard to his own advantage, but looks only to the necessities of each."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Never despairing... μηδενα is translated 'despairing of no man.' The meaning here is to not despair about getting the money back. We are to help the apparently hopeless cases." 
2. "Sons of the Most High... all real children or sons of God (Luke 20:36) are so termed. He means the same thing that we see in Matthew 5:45; Matthew 5:48 by 'your Father.'" 
3. "Toward the unthankful and evil... God the Father is kind towards the unkind and wicked."

### John Gill:
1. "But love ye your enemies,.... As before urged in Luke 6:27and do good and lend; not to your friends only, but to your enemies;hoping for nothing again; either principal or interest, despairing of seeing either; lending to such persons, from whom, in all appearance, it is never to be expected again."
2. "and your reward shall be great: God will bless you in your worldly substance here, and will not forget your beneficence hereafter."
3. "for he is kind to the unthankful and to the evil; by causing his sun to rise, and his rain to fall on them, as on the righteous and the good."
