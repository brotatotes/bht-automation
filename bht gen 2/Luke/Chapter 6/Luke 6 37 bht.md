# Luke 6:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus teaches us to exercise caution and fairness in forming opinions about others, refraining from hasty and unjust judgments. If we are quick to condemn, we may find ourselves subject to the righteous judgment and condemnation of God. Instead, let us forgive, release, and show kindness when others offend or hurt us, knowing that by doing so, we open ourselves up to the forgiveness and mercy of God.
