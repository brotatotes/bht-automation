# Luke 6:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Give generously to those in need, according to your means and as the situations demand. In return, others will generously give to you, pouring into your life an abundance that overflows. As you give liberally, you will receive a large compensation, a bountiful harvest of good things. Remember, the measure with which you give will determine the measure with which you will receive. So, let your acts of kindness and generosity be plentiful, for what you sow, you will surely reap.

2. "Shaken together (σεσαλευμενον). Perfect passive participle again from common verb σαλευω."
