# Luke 6:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our Lord sometimes used parables to avoid inflaming his listeners, such as when he asked, Can the blind lead the blind? This question exposes the foolishness of the scribes who teach others while remaining blind themselves. Surely, both the blind leaders and their followers will perish if they continue down this path. However, those who desire to be true disciples of Jesus will be taught by God Himself, allowing them to grow and become like their Master.

1. "The parabolic saying, implying the unfitness of an uncharitable and unjustly condemning leader, leads to the assertion that no Christian ought to assume in this respect an office of judging which his Master never assumed." 
2. "Every well-instructed Christian will strive to be humble as his Master was." 
3. "Luk 6:44-49 show us, expanded in different images, what the beam in the eye is, to which our first efforts must be directed."

### John Calvin:
1. "Luke relates this saying without mentioning any occurrence, but states generally, that Christ made use of this parable..." 
2. "It is no doubt possible that Christ may have spoken this parable more than once; but, as no place more appropriate was to be found, I have not hesitated to insert here what Luke relates without fixing the time."

### Philip Schaff:

### John Gill:
1. "Though it should be observed, that these words were not spoken at the same time, nor on the mount, as the foregoing were; but this, and what follow, are a collection of various expressions of Christ at different times, some delivered on the mount, and others elsewhere."
2. "Can the blind lead the blind? They may do so, as the blind Scribes and Pharisees led the blind people of the Jews, which is what our Lord intends."
3. "But if they do, as they did, shall they not both fall into the ditch? Yes, verily, what else can be expected?"

### John Wesley:
1. "Our Lord sometimes used parables when he knew plain and open declarations would too much inflame the passions of his hearers."
2. "Can the blind lead the blind? - Can the scribes teach this way, which they know not themselves? Will not they and their scholars perish together?"
