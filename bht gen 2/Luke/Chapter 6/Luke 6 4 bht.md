# Luke 6:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The mention of the showbread incident in Luke is a unique account not found in Mark or Matthew. However, similar details are discussed in Mark 2:26. These details serve as the backdrop for Jesus' defense of his actions on the Sabbath. His defense is supported by arguments such as the example of David, the work of the priests on the Sabbath, the prophecy of Hosea 6:6, the purpose of the Sabbath for humanity, and Jesus' authority as the Lord of the Sabbath. This powerful response leaves his opponents unable to rebut, intensifying their anger.

2. "It was an overwhelming and crushing reply to these pettifogging ceremonialists to which they could not reply, but which increased their anger."
