# Luke 6:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The principle behind this teaching is that a disciple should not aim to surpass their teacher, but rather to emulate them. Disciples should aspire to be fully instructed and perfected, knowing and diligently performing their duties. The process of becoming like the master requires time and effort, just as broken objects or individuals are restored. It is important to be mindful of blind leaders who can lead others astray. Conversely, disciplined and dedicated disciples have the potential to become as proficient as their master through their earnest pursuit of knowledge and understanding.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "κατηρτισμένος (see reff.) fully instructed perfect, in the sense of ‘well-conditioned,’ knowing what is his duty, and consistently endeavouring to do it."
2. "De Wette, Kuinoel, &c., have given a strange rendering of this clause, making κατηρτ . ὡς ὁ δ . αὐτ . the predicate ‘every disciple will be instructed as his Master.’ But if I mistake not, the position of κατηρτ . as first in the sentence forbids this rendering."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The disciple aims to come up to his master, and he thinks himself complete when he does so."
2. "If you then be blind leaders of the blind, the perfection of one's training under you will only land him the more certainly in one common ruin with yourselves."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word [perfected] signifies to readjust, restore, set to rights, whether in a physical or a moral sense."
2. "In Galatians 6:1, it is used of restoring a brother taken in a fault."
3. "Used in medical language of setting a bone or joint."

### John Calvin:
1. "The disciple is not above his master, but every one shall be conformed to his master."
2. "Nothing is more suitable for a disciple than to be formed after the example of his master."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The disciple is not above his master, or teacher...The connection here is very different. There the principle is assigned as a reason for the disciples’ expecting persecution; here it admonishes to be like the Master in humility and charitableness."
2. "When he is perfected, or ‘fully instructed,’ knowing and consequently endeavoring to do his duty."
3. "Others explain thus: 'Only if a disciple surpassed his master could he hope to be preserved from the ditch into which he sees his blind leader fall. Since, however, the disciple does not commonly surpass the master, he has also the same danger to fear. As a rule, everyone is constituted like his master.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The disciple is not above his master. Literally, a learner (or pupil) is not above the teacher. Precisely so in Matthew 10:24 where 'slave' is added with 'lord.'"
2. "But everyone when he is perfected shall be as his master. The state of completion, perfect passive participle, is noted in κατηρτισμενος. The word is common for mending broken things or nets (Matthew 4:21) or men (Galatians 6:1)."
3. "So it is a long process to get the pupil patched up to the plane of his teacher."

### John Gill:
1. "If the leaders are blind and ignorant, those under their instructions will remain so likewise."
2. "Whoever is ambitious of being a thorough scholar, and is diligent and industrious, by all ways and means, to obtain such a character, shall be even as good an one as his master."
3. "Christ, in this last clause, seems to design his own disciples, who, when perfect in knowledge, which is not to be expected in this state, unless in a comparative sense, will be like himself."

### John Wesley:
1.  Matthew 10:24; John 15:20.
