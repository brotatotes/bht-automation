# Luke 6:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is a powerful picture of blind self-complacence and incompetence when one claims to be able to pull the mote out of their brother's eye while ignoring the beam in their own. This hypocrisy is evident in the contrast to the studied politeness shown when saying, let me pull out. One must first see clearly to cast out the beam in their own eye before they can clearly see the mote in their brother's eye and address it appropriately. Thus, it is important to reform oneself before seeking to reprove others for their sins.
