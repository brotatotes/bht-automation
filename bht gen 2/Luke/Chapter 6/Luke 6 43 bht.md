# Luke 6:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who claim to teach others but live in sin are not truly good in the eyes of God. It is futile to try to deceive others with fine-sounding words while having a corrupt heart. The word rotten accurately describes the nature of such teachings. However, it is important to note that the word for may not carry significant weight in this particular context. Genuine followers of Christ do not produce the fruit of sin as a constant pattern in their lives, unlike those who claim to be teachers but live in hypocrisy.
