# Luke 6:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The teachings of preachers can be distinguished as good or bad based on whether they align with the word of God. Just as a bramble cannot produce grapes, an unregenerate person cannot produce good works acceptable to God. It is through grace that a holy life is lived and fruitful deeds are displayed. The qualities of fruitfulness and righteousness are indicative of a person who has received God's grace.
