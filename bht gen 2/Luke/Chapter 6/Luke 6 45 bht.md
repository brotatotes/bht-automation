# Luke 6:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A person's words are often a reflection of their true character. Just as a good person brings forth good things from the goodness in their heart, the words spoken by an individual are an overflow of what is in their heart. It is important to pay attention to the words spoken by others, as they can provide insights into the nature and intentions of their hearts.
