# Luke 6:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage being discussed highlights the significance of both hearing and doing God's teachings. It is closely related to a similar teaching found in Matthew 7:24, which emphasizes the importance of building one's life on a strong foundation. In this context, the phrase I will show you to whom he is like serves to illustrate the comparison being made to a wise person who not only hears God's words but also puts them into practice. This exhortation encourages believers to not only listen to God's teachings but also actively apply them in their daily lives.
