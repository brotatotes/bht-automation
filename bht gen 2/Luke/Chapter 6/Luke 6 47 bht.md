# Luke 6:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus is describing a person who comes to him to be a disciple and follower, who hears his teachings and puts them into practice. This person is like someone who builds their house on a solid foundation. This analogy emphasizes the importance of not only hearing the words of Jesus, but also actively obeying and living by them. Just as a house built on a strong foundation stands firm against the storms, so a life grounded in the teachings of Jesus will be able to withstand the challenges and trials of life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. I will shew you to whom he is like. Peculiar to Luke. See on Matthew 7:24.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This verse is to be closely connected with Luke 6:16, which should end with a semicolon; this close connection seems to preclude the previous delivery of a discourse on the top of the mountain."
2. "On a level place...This refers more naturally to a plain below the mountain, but it can mean a level place on the mountain side. This sense is adopted by those who uphold the identity of the two discourses, and is favored by the appearance of the locality where the discourse was most probably delivered: the Horns of Hattin."
3. "The Apostles are here represented as immediately about Him, then a great multitude of his disciples (in the wider sense), then, a great number of the people, etc."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Hears and does  (ακουων κα ποιων). Present active participles. So in Matthew 7:24. (Present indicative.)I will show you  (υποδειξω υμιν). Only in Luke, not Matthew. 

### John Gill:
1. "Whosoever cometh to me, to be a disciple and follower."
2. "And heareth my sayings and doth them."
