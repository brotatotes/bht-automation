# Luke 6:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A wise builder not only digs deep into Scriptures to discover the truth of salvation by Christ, but also identifies Christ as the rock of ages, the unshakeable foundation laid by God. By building their hope of eternal salvation on Christ, nothing can shake their faith, for no flood or trial can move a soul that is firmly rooted in Him.
