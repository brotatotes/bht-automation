# Luke 6:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On another Sabbath, Jesus entered the synagogue and taught the people, explaining the Scriptures and instructing them in the doctrines of the Gospel. It was on this Sabbath that a man with a withered right hand was present, one of the hearers in the synagogue. Luke, a physician, provides us with unique details, noting that it occurred on a Sabbath and emphasizing the specific condition of the man's right hand. This attention to detail from Luke, along with the other Gospel accounts, helps us gain a comprehensive understanding of the events that transpired.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Matthew, as we see, describes the watching of the Pharisees (τοὺς διαλογισμοὺς αὐτῶν, Luke, Luk 6:8) as words actually spoken, and relates that they asked the question: which certainly arises from an imperfect report of what took place..."
2. "There can hardly be a doubt that in Matthew’s narrative the two occurrences are blended: and this may have taken place from the very circumstance of the question about an animal having been asked on both occasions..."
3. "ἡ δεξ. is a mark of accuracy, and from an eye-witness."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "His right hand [η χειρ αυτου η δεξια] . A very precise mode of statement. Lit., his hand the right one. Luke only specifies which hand was withered. This accuracy is professional."
2. "Ancient medical writers always state whether the right or left member is affected."
3. "Withered. See on Mark 3:1."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Right hand. Specified by Luke only."
2. "Luke 6:7-10 agree closely with Mark’s account."
3. "Matthew inserts in this connection a thought mentioned by Luke as uttered on a similar occasion (chap. Luke 14:1-5), but there is no reason for inferring a confusion in the statements."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "On another sabbath (εν ετερω σαββατω). This was a second (ετερον, as it often means), but not necessarily the next, sabbath." 
2. "Only Luke notes that it was on a sabbath. Was this because Luke as a physician had to meet this problem in his own practise?"
3. "Right hand (η δεξια). This alone in Luke, the physician's eye for particulars."

### John Gill:
1. "He entered into the synagogue...and taught; explained the Scriptures to the people, and instructed them in the doctrines of the Gospel." 
2. "There was a man whose right hand was withered; who was in the synagogue, and one of his hearers."

### John Wesley:
1.  Matthew 12:9; Mark 3:1.
