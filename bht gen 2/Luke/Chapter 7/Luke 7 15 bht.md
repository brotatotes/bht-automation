The miracle of the dead man being raised to life is truly awe-inspiring. As the man sat up and began to speak, it became evident that he had been brought back to life. Not only did Jesus display his power in raising the man, but he also revealed his compassion and tenderness by delivering him back to his mother alive. The scene must have been incredibly moving and emotional, highlighting the power and love of Jesus.
