# Luke 7:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the disciples of John came to him with reports of the miracles and teachings of Jesus, it was inevitable that such news would reach John, who was imprisoned. These disciples spoke of these things not to commend Jesus, but rather with envy and grief, as they couldn't bear seeing all the honor and glory being attributed to Jesus instead of their master, John. This passage in Luke 7:18-35 corresponds to the account in Matthew 11:2-19, which is part of the non-Marcan material found in both Matthew and Luke.
