# Luke 7:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus called two certain individuals to Himself, emphasizing His intentional choice. These disciples were not cut off from communication with Him, even in John's imprisonment. This title, the Lord, is significant and used eleven times in this Gospel, highlighting Jesus' authority. The Greek word used for another implies both a second in number and a different kind. It is clear that John the Baptist, although he knew Jesus was the Messiah, sent these disciples to inquire for their own assurance and to remove any doubts they may have had about Christ.
