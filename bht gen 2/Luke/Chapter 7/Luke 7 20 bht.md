# Luke 7:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Two men were sent by John the Baptist to Jesus, seeking confirmation if Jesus was the expected Messiah or if they should expect someone else. These disciples were dispatched from the castle where John was imprisoned, emphasizing the significance of their mission. Known for his role in administering baptism, John entrusted these messengers to seek the truth directly from Jesus. Their question, asking if Jesus was the one they awaited, demonstrated their desire for certainty and guidance.
