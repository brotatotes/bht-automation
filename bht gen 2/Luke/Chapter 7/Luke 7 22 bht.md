# Luke 7:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To the poor, the Gospel is preached ‚Äî the greatest mercy and miracle. The blind, some born blind, now see; the lame walk, fulfilling the prophecy of the Messiah. The dead are raised, either witnessed by the disciples or reported to John. The plural form of the dead are raised signifies a generic truth rather than multiple specific instances. These miracles demonstrate the transformative power of the Gospel, bringing hope to the hopeless and offering new life to the spiritually dead. The message of the Gospel is one of compassion, healing, and resurrection, offering salvation to all who believe.
