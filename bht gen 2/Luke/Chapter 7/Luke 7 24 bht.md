# Luke 7:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To avoid any appearance of flattery, Jesus refrained from speaking about John in the presence of his disciples. Instead, he waited until the messengers had departed to address the crowd, asking them what they had gone to see in the wilderness. Jesus quickly dismissed any notion that John was a wavering or unstable figure, emphasizing that he was not a mere reed shaken by the wind. By deferring his commendation until after the messengers had left, Jesus ensured that his words about John's character were sincere and unbiased.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

1. To see [θεασασθαι] . Rev. is correct but awkward, to behold. The verb implies steadfast, intent gazing. See on Matthew 11:7.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The vivid questions about the people's interest in John are precisely alike in both Matthew and Luke."
2. "Matthew 11:7 has the present middle participle πορευομενων, suggesting that Jesus began his eulogy of John as soon as the messengers (angels, Luke calls them) were on their way."
3. "Genitive absolute of aorist active participle."

### John Gill:
1. "He, 'Jesus', as the Persic version expresses it, began to speak unto the people concerning John; not caring to say anything about him to the messengers, or whilst they were present, lest he should be charged with flattery."
2. "What went ye into the wilderness for to see? a reed shaken with the wind? an inconsistent, wavering, and unstable man? if so, they were greatly mistaken."
3. "Or the motions and gesture of the man?"

### John Wesley:
1. "He did not speak the following things in the hearing of John's disciples, lest he should seem to flatter John, or to compliment him into an adherence to his former testimony."
2. "To avoid all suspicion of this kind, he deferred his commendation of him, till the messengers were gone; and then delivered it to the people, to prevent all imaginations, as if John were wavering in his judgment, and had sent the two disciples for his own, rather than their satisfaction."
