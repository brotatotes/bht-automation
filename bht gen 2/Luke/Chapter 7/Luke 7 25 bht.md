# Luke 7:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
John's appearance lacked attractiveness, as there was nothing appealing about his person, mien, and garb. Unlike those who dressed gorgeously or in rich clothing, John's appearance stood in stark contrast. He did not belong to kings' courts like others, but instead came to preach in the wilderness.
