# Luke 7:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the Scriptures, it is evident that there is no one who exists that is greater than John. This emphasizes the immense stature of John as a prophet and teacher. However, it is also noteworthy that even the least teacher in the kingdom of God surpasses the greatness of John. The concept of little and greater in Matthew 11:11 delves deeper into the discussion, providing insight into the hierarchy and significance of various individuals in terms of their role in teaching and prophetic ministry.
