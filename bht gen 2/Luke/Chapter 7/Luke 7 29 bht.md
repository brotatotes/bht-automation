# Luke 7:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people recognized and agreed that it was right for God to send John as a preparatory minister to lead them to Jesus. The Pharisees and lawyers, however, rejected both John's baptism and the merciful plan of God through Jesus, bringing judgment upon themselves. The common people and publicans, on the other hand, acknowledged God's wisdom and grace in the message of repentance and baptism preached by John. Their obedience signified their belief that God's ways were just and suitable for them.
