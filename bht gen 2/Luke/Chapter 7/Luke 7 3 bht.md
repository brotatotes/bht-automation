# Luke 7:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Hearing about Jesus' miracles and teachings in Capernaum, the elders of the Jews, being highly esteemed by the community, sent a message to Jesus on behalf of a Gentile centurion. The centurion recognized his own unworthiness and humbly requested Jesus to heal his paralyzed servant. He believed that Jesus had the authority to heal in any way He saw fit - whether through a touch or a spoken word. This story reflects the remarkable faith of the centurion and showcases the far-reaching impact of Jesus' ministry.
