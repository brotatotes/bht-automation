# Luke 7:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Pharisees and scribes, as legalistic interpreters of the law, refused to acknowledge their own need for confession of sin and rejected the counsel of God that was meant for their own advantage. In doing so, they set aside the baptism of John and annulled God's purposes of grace as it applied to them, resulting in their own ruin and destruction. Their rejection of the command of God, specifically the ordinance of baptism, despised the wisdom and counsel of God, which was intended for their benefit. Ultimately, they made void the gracious design that God had for them.
