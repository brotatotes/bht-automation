# Luke 7:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These children are described as froward and perverse, showing a lack of understanding and acting in ignorance. The suggestion is that these children represent those who reject or fail to comprehend the Gospel message and the call to repentance. They are likened to children who refuse to engage in joyful or mournful activities, symbolizing their reluctance to accept the teachings of Christ and John the Baptist. The stubbornness and unwillingness of these individuals can be compared to the unyielding nature of children who cannot be easily satisfied.
