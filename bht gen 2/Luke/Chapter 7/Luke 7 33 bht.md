# Luke 7:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
John the Baptist's ministry was distinct and unique. He preached with a solemn and mournful tone, and lived an austere life, and his disciples followed suit. Luke refers to him as the Baptist to set him apart from others and emphasize his baptism. Despite his earnestness and commitment, some accused him of being possessed or suffering from madness, which may have been due to their misunderstanding of his fervent preaching.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Bread and wine. Peculiar to Luke.

### John Calvin:
1. "Leading an austere life, he thundered out repentance and severe reproofs, and sung, as it were, a plaintive song; while the Lord endeavored, by a cheerful and sprightly song, to draw them more gently to the Father."
2. "Neither of those methods had any success, and what reason could be assigned except their hardened obstinacy?"
3. "Our Lord intended, by this diversity, and by assuming as it were a variety of characters, to convict unbelievers more fully; since, while he yielded and accommodated himself to their manners, he did not bend them to himself."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "John the Baptist is come. Second perfect active indicative where Matthew 11:18 has ηλθεν second aorist active indicative. So as to verse Luke 7:34."
2. "Luke alone has 'bread' and 'wine.' Otherwise these verses like Matthew 11:18; Matthew 11:19, which see for discussion of details."
3. "There are actually critics today who say that Jesus was called the friend of sinners and even of harlots because he loved them and their ways and so deserved the slur cast upon him by his enemies."

### John Gill:
1. "He preached very mournful doctrine, delivered it in a very solemn and awful manner, and lived a very austere life, and fasted much, as did also his disciples."
2. "The word 'Baptist' is here added by Luke, which Matthew has not, to distinguish him from others; and it may be, because he had just spoke of his baptism."
3. "And ye say, he hath a devil; is mad, or melancholy; for madness and melancholy, or the hypochondriac disorder, was by them sometimes imputed to a diabolical possession, and influence, as the cause of it."
