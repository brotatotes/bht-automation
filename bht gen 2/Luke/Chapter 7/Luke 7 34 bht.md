# Luke 7:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Outward austerity does not equate to the highest perfection, as seen in Jesus' example of freely eating and drinking with all people. However, this does not justify indulgence or neglect of spiritual worship. The Jews misinterpreted his actions and slandered him, despite his holy and innocent nature. True wisdom lies in recognizing and approving the various ways in which God calls sinners to repentance.

### John Calvin:
1. "Those who think that the highest perfection consists in outward austerity of life, and who pronounce it to be an angelical life when a person is abstemious, ought to attend to this passage."
2. "And yet we must not make this a pretense for giving a loose rein to the flesh, by indulging in luxuries and effeminacy: only we must beware of superstition, lest foolish men, imagining that perfection lies in matters of a purely elementary nature, neglect the spiritual worship of God."
3. "Besides, while Christ accommodated himself to the usages of ordinary life, he maintained a sobriety truly divine, and did not encourage the excesses of others by his dissimulation or by his example."

### John Gill:
1. "The son of man is come eating and drinking,.... That is, eating bread and drinking wine, as other people do; and shuns no man's company, goes to a wedding, dines with a Pharisee, and eats with publicans and sinners, and carries it freely and courteously to all men."
2. "and ye say, behold a gluttonous man and a wine bibber; an epicurian, a drunkard, a mere sot, one that gives up himself to sensual pleasures."
3. "such an ill use did the Jews make of our Lord's free, harmless, and innocent conversation with men; and in such a horrid manner did they traduce and vilify him, who was holy in his nature, harmless in his life, separate from sinners, knew no sin, nor ever committed any."

### John Wesley:
1. "But wisdom is justified by all her children." 
2. "The children of wisdom are those who are truly wise unto salvation." 
3. "The wisdom of God in all these dispensations, these various methods of calling sinners to repentance, is owned and heartily approved by all these."
