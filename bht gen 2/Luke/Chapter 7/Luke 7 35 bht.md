# Luke 7:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The enduring worth and rank of wisdom, though slandered by its own children, remains unimpaired. Just as Christ calls sinners to repentance and saves them, those who come to Him are redeemed and receive the adoption as children of God. Despite any revolts or apostasy, the faith of the elect and their commitment to living righteously and godly lives will always remain steadfast, justifying the teachings of Christ from scandalous imputations.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "Wisdom, however wickedly she may be slandered by her own sons, loses nothing of her worth or rank, but remains unimpaired."
2. "Let those who haughtily boast of being the children of Wisdom proceed in their obstinacy: she will, notwithstanding, retain the praise and support of her own children."
3. "Although many apostates may revolt from the Church of God, yet, among all the elect, who truly belong to the flock, the faith of the Gospel will always remain uninjured."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Of all her children  (απο παντων των τεκνων αυτης). Here Matthew 11:19 has "by her works" (απο των εργων αυτης). Aleph has εργων here. The use of "children" personifies wisdom as in Luke 7:8; Luke 7:9. 

### John Gill:
1. "Christ... called them to repentance, converted and saved them."
2. "These are his children... whom he redeemed, that they might receive the adoption of children... he gives power to become the children of God."
3. "These justify him from all such scandalous imputations... that the doctrine of Christ... teaches them to... live soberly, righteously, and godly."
