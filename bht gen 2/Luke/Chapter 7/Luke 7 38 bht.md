# Luke 7:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The woman, overcome with emotion, stood before Jesus, weeping for her sins and feeling a profound love for Christ. Instead of water, she used her tears to wash His feet, a gesture that demonstrated her humility and devotion. She took her hair -- an adornment she cherished -- and used it to wipe His feet clean. This act of reverence, kissing His feet, was a familiar expression of deep respect, particularly towards esteemed religious leaders. Her genuine display of love and gratitude through her tears exemplifies the profound impact Jesus had on her life.
