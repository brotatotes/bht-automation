# Luke 7:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He sneered within himself, not deigning to openly confront his guest. He believed that for someone to be a prophet, they must have knowledge of people and their characters, although this was not always the case. According to their customs, the touch of those deemed unclean was seen as defiling and to be avoided.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Pharisee assumes that our Lord did not know who, or of what sort, this woman was, and thence doubts His being a prophet."
2. "The possibility of His knowing this and permitting it, never so much as occurs to him."
3. "It was the touching by an unclean person which constituted the defilement. This is all that the Pharisee fixes on: his offence is merely technical and ceremonial."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Ha! I have Him now He plainly knows nothing of the person He allows to touch Him; and so, He can be no prophet."
2. "Not so fast, Simon; thou hast not seen through thy Guest yet, but He hath seen through thee."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If Jesus had been sent from God as a prophet, he supposed that he would have known the character of the woman and would have rebuked her."
2. "Jesus did not refuse the society of the guilty. He came to save the lost; and no person ever came to him so sure of finding a 'friend,' as those who came conscious that they were deeply depraved, and mourning on account of their crimes."
3. "The 'touch' of a Gentile, or a person singularly wicked, they supposed to be polluting, and the Pharisees avoided it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But he reasoned thus: a prophet would know what others must learn; this man cannot be a prophet, for He does not know who is touching Him since no one would knowingly allow himself to be touched by a woman of this character."
2. "The main error was in the last thought; for our Lord did allow Himself to be touched by such a person. Hence His reply sets forth why He allows this."
3. "Notice that the objection of the Pharisee was against the touch by an unclean person; a technical, ceremonial, and Pharisaical one."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This man (ουτος). Contemptuous, this fellow."
2. "The conclusion (apodosis), like the condition, deals here with the present situation and so both use the imperfect indicative."
3. "She was notorious in person and character."

### John Gill:
1. "he spoke within himself; not openly and publicly, being in good manners, though not in real respect to Christ, unwilling to affront his guest"
2. "according to his notion of a prophet, he must know persons and their characters; though this was not always requisite in a prophet"
3. "their notion with respect to the conduct of religious persons towards the common people, and those of a bad character, [...] was, that the touch of such persons was defiling, and therefore to be avoided"
