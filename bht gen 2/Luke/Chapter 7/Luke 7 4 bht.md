# Luke 7:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
With great vehemence, the elders eagerly and earnestly beseeched the centurion, pressing him with much urgency and importunity. Their persistence and zeal in advocating for their cause was fueled by their Pharisaic belief in the idea of merit, which differed from the humble self-perception of the centurion.
