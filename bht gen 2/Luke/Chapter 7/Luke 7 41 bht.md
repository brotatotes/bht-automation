# Luke 7:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our Lord is emphasizing Simon's subjective view of himself in this matter, reminding him that he is not the ultimate judge. The parable illustrates that the woman is righteous not because she pleased God, but because her sins were forgiven. The debt in question is the sense of sin, not an objective measure of guilt. This parable serves as a reminder that all sins are debts, and all sinners are debtors, and no one can repay God or merit anything by their own actions.

1. "We must remember that our Lord is here setting forth the matter primarily with reference to Simon’s subjective view of himself."
2. "The Lord speaks from the position of the debtors, and applies to their case the considerations of ordinary gratitude and justice."

### John Calvin:
1. "The scope of this parable is to demonstrate, that Simon is wrong in condemning the woman who is acquitted by the heavenly judge. He proves that she is righteous, not because she pleased God, but because her sins were forgiven."
2. "We cannot avoid wondering, therefore, that the greater part of commentators have fallen into so gross a blunder as to imagine that this woman, by her tears, and her anointing, and her kissing his feet, deserved the pardon of her sins."
3. "In a word, Christ argues from the fruits or effects that follow it, that this woman has been reconciled to God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The debt is sin, or strictly speaking, here the sense of sin."
2. "That the sense of sin is meant appears from the application, since gratitude for forgiveness of sin must be based upon that, not upon actual guilt which we cannot measure."
3. "Hence the truth that many great sinners do not feel their guilt is here left out of view."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'the creditor', God is meant, to whom men owe their beings, and the preservation of them, and all the mercies of life; and are under obligation to obedience and thankfulness."
2. "No man can merit anything of God or pay off any old debt, by a new act of obedience, since all is due to him."
3. "All sins are debts, and all sinners are debtors; not debtors to sin, for then it would not be criminal, but lawful to commit sin, and God must be pleased with it, which he is not, and men might promise themselves impunity, which they cannot."
