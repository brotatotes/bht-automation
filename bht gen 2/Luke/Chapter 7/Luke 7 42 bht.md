# Luke 7:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Man, being bankrupt and poor in his sinful state, has nothing to offer as payment or composition for his debt. The debt of sin, being committed against an infinite God, is an infinite debt that a finite creature can never repay, making them liable to eternal punishment. However, despite this dire situation, the grace of God shines through. The creditor, in his wonderful grace, frankly forgave both debtors without any consideration of their merits or conditions. This forgiveness was freely given solely out of the sovereign will, free grace, and rich mercy of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "What depth of meaning there is in these words, if we reflect WHO said them, and by what means this forgiveness was to be wrought!"
2. "The more sin, the more love: let us then sin, that we may love the more."
3. "It is an unquestionable fact, that the deepest penitents are, in one kind of love for Him who has forgiven them, the most devoted; in that, namely, which consists in personal sacrifice, and proofs of earnest attachment to the blessed Saviour and His cause on earth."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This is not designed to express anything about the way in which God forgives sinners. He forgives - forgives freely, but it is in connection with the 'atonement' made by the Lord Jesus."
2. "A parent might forgive a 'debt' without any equivalent; but he cannot pardon an offending child without regarding his own 'character' as a parent, the 'truth' of his threatenings, the good order of his house, and the maintenance of his authority."
3. "So, however much difference there is among people, 'all' need the pardoning mercy of God, and 'all,' without that, must perish."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Frankly forgave [εχαρισατο] . Rev. omits frankly, which is implied in the verb. See on ver. 21.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They found out and confessed that they could not pay the debt."
2. "Grateful love does not pay any part of the debt, according to the parable."
3. "The forgiveness was real and personal."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Will love him most."
2. "This is the point of the parable, the attitude of the two debtors toward the lender who forgave both of them."

### John Gill:
1. "Man has run out his whole stock, which the God of nature gave him, in his original creation and primitive state; and is become a bankrupt and a beggar, is poor, wretched, and miserable; he has no money, he has nothing to offer for a composition, much less for payment."
2. "Sin being committed against an infinite being, is in some sense an infinite debt, and requires an infinite satisfaction, which a finite creature can never give; and he is therefore liable to a prison, and that for ever."
3. "The wonderful grace of God, the creditor! He frankly forgave them both: their whole debts, without regard to any merits of theirs, which they could not have, or any motives in them, or any conditions to be performed by them, but purely of his sovereign will, free grace, and rich mercy."
