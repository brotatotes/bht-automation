# Luke 7:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parable of the forgiven debt teaches us that those who have been shown great forgiveness are more likely to respond with greater love and affection. The debtor who owed a larger debt and was forgiven fully would naturally feel a greater sense of gratitude and would be more inclined to demonstrate love towards the creditor. It is important to note that without the forgiveness of the debt, neither debtor would show any love towards the creditor. This highlights the understanding that it is only through the experience of forgiveness that love and gratitude can truly be expressed.
