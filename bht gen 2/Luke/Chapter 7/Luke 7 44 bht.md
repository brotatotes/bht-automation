# Luke 7:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus entered into the house of Simon, he expected to be treated with the customary hospitality of offering water to wash his feet. However, Simon failed to extend this basic courtesy. In contrast, the woman who came into the house poured out her tears on Jesus' feet and wiped them with her hair. She showed great honor and reverence to Jesus, going above and beyond the expected customs of hospitality. Her actions demonstrated her deep gratitude and had a profound impact on those present.
