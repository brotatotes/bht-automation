# Luke 7:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The woman went above and beyond in anointing Jesus by using costly ointment on his feet, which was a gesture that showed great love and reverence. In contrast, the host, Simon, did not provide even common oil for Christ's head. This woman's actions demonstrated her deep devotion, as she not only used the more precious ointment but also applied it to his feet, shedding tears and wiping them clean with her hair. Her acts of love and humility stand in stark contrast to Simon's lack of hospitality and indifference.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "What evidence was thus afforded of any feeling which forgiveness prompts?"
2. "Our Lord speaks this with delicate politeness, as if hurt at these inattentions of His host."
3. "The inference is plain—only one of the debtors was really forgiven, though in the first instance, to give room for the play of withheld feelings, the forgiveness of both is supposed in the parable."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The oil used was sweet oil or oil of olives, prepared in such a way as to give an agreeable smell."
2. "This 'ointment' was a mixture of various aromatics, and was therefore far more costly and precious than the 'oil' commonly used for anointing the head."
3. "Her conduct, compared with that of Simon, was therefore more striking. 'He' did not give even the common oil 'for his head' used on such occasions. 'She' had applied to 'his feet' a far more precious and valuable 'unguent.' 'He' therefore, showed comparatively 'little' love. 'She' showed 'much'."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Gill:
