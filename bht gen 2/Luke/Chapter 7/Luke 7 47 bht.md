## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Wherefore, seeing this is so, I say unto thee, she is no longer unclean her many sins are forgiven: for (thou seest that) she loved much: her conduct towards Me shews that love, which is a token that her sins are forgiven."
2. "The sense of forgiveness of sin is not altogether correspondent to the sense of forgiveness of a debt. The latter must be altogether past, and a fact to be looked back on, to awaken gratitude: the former, by no means so."
3. "The expectation, the desire, and hope of forgiveness, the πίστις of Luke 7:50, awoke this love; just as in our Christian life, the love daily awakened by a sense of forgiveness, yet is gathered under and summed up in a general faith and expectation, that ‘in that day’ all will be found to have been forgiven."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Those many sins of hers," our Lord, who admitted how much more she owed than the Pharisee, now proclaims in naked terms the forgiveness of her guilt.
2. "Little forgiven . . . loveth little"—delicately ironical intimation of no love and no forgiveness in the present case.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Grant that she has been as great a sinner as you affirm, and even grant that if she had 'continued so' it might be improper to suffer her to touch me, yet 'her conduct' shows that her sins have been forgiven."
2. "That her sins, so many and aggravated, have been forgiven - that she is no longer such a sinner as you suppose, is manifest from her conduct. She shows deep gratitude, penitence, love."
3. "A man's love to God will be in proportion to the obligation he 'feels' to him for forgiveness. [...] they who feel - as Christians do - that they are the 'chief of sinners,' will feel under infinite obligation to love God and their Redeemer."

### John Calvin:
1. "As this woman evinces by remarkable actions, that she is full of ardent love to Christ, it would be improper for the Church to act harshly and severely towards her; but, on the contrary, she ought to be treated with gentleness, whatever may have been the aggravations of her offenses."
2. "From the eager desire which she had manifested to discharge all the duties of piety, Christ infers that, although this woman might have been guilty of many sins, the mercy of God was so abundant towards her, that she ought no longer to be regarded as a sinner."
3. "Christ does not inquire at what price men may purchase the favor of God, but argues that God has already forgiven this wretched sinner, and that, therefore, a mortal man ought not to treat her with severity."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Her sins, which are many, are forgiven, 'have been and are forgiven.'"
2. "The forgiveness free; to the next clause, which plainly makes the forgiveness the ground of the love, not the reverse."
3. "The assumption that the woman was Mary Magdalene is used to support the false view mentioned above; the gratitude being regarded as called forth by the casting out of the demons, and the forgiveness of sins as first granted after this display of love."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Are forgiven (αφεωντα). Doric perfect passive form."
2. "But to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little (Hω δε ολιγον αφιετα ολιγον αγαπα)."

### John Gill:
1. "Though she had been a great sinner, yet she was now not such an one as he took her to be; she was a pardoned sinner, and not that guilty and filthy creature he imagined."
2. "Her great love was not the cause of the remission of her sins, but the full and free remission of her many sins, which had been manifested to her, was the cause of her great love, and of her showing it in the manner she had done."
3. "According to our Lord's sense, and even Simon's opinion of the case, forgiveness is the cause, and love the effect; and that according as the forgiveness is of more or less, love is proportionate."

### John Wesley:

2. "The fruit of her having had much forgiven."
3. "She knew that much had been forgiven her, and therefore she loved much."
