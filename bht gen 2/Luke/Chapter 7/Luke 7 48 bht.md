# Luke 7:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Thy sins are forgiven; a declaration made by Jesus to both the woman and the Pharisee. This assured the woman of her forgiven state, even amidst the Pharisee's judgement. It served as a reminder of her past and a source of comfort in the face of criticism. Moreover, it revealed Jesus' divine authority to forgive sins, highlighting his role as the ultimate forgiver and Savior. So, we see not only an unsought assurance, but also a demonstration of Jesus' compassion and power in granting forgiveness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "an unsought assurance, usually springing up unexpected in the midst of active duty and warm affections"


### Albert Barnes:
1. "Thy sins are forgiven - What a gracious assurance to the weeping, loving penitent!"
2. "How that voice, spoken to the troubled sinner, stills his anguish, allays his troubled feelings, and produces peace to the soul!"
3. "Here, then, Jesus gave indubitable proof that he was God as well as man; that he was Lord of the conscience as well as the pitying friend."

### John Calvin:
1. "Thy sins are forgiven... the voice of Christ again pronounces an absolution of the woman, who had already tasted his grace, and who was even convinced that he was her only refuge of salvation."
2. "Thus, at the present day, faith is previously necessary, when we pray that the Lord would forgive our sins; and yet this is not a useless or superfluous prayer, but the object of it is, that the heavenly Judge may more and more seal his mercy on our hearts, and in this manner may give us peace."
3. "Though this woman had brought with her a confident reliance on that grace which she had obtained, yet this promise was not superfluous, but contributed greatly to the confirmation of her faith."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Thy sins are forgiven. This does not forbid the view that a previous sense of pardon moved the woman to acts of love. It is rather a new assurance, a more formal personal declaration."
2. "Christians have a sense of pardon awakening gratitude, but ever need more assurance of it, ever hope for and desire more; that is our faith."
3. "As appears from Luke 7:50, it was precisely to this faith on the part of the woman, who has already felt enough to manifest her love in this way, that our Lord addressed the declaration of this verse. This is the constant and blessed action and reaction of Divine grace and Christian gratitude it awakens."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Are forgiven  (αφεωντα). As in verse Luke 7:47. Remain forgiven, Jesus means, in spite of the slur of the Pharisee. 

### John Gill:
1. "Thy sins are forgiven; which was said, partly on account of the Pharisee, to let him see, that he knew this woman, what she was, and had been"
2. "that she might have a fresh discovery of the forgiveness of her sins, for her comfort under the severe censure of the Pharisee, and that her faith in it might be strengthened"
3. "to show that he was not only a prophet that had extraordinary knowledge of persons, and their characters, but that he was the most high God, to whom belonged the prerogative of pardoning sin."
