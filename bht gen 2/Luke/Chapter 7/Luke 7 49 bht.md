# Luke 7:49 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They questioned in their hearts, not in a hostile but reverent spirit, reflecting their amazement at someone reclining at the same table and forgiving sins. Christ being the Great Creditor has the prerogative to forgive all sinners, regardless of the degree of guilt. Jesus, being both man and God, amazes and stirs up opposition, especially from hypocrites who slumber amidst their vices. It is by faith, not love, that one is saved, for faith lays hold of grace, convinces, and receives full absolution. As Jesus read their thoughts, they were offended by his authority to forgive sin, considering it blasphemy.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "They that sat...Who is this, c.—No wonder they were startled to hear One who was reclining at the same couch, and partaking of the same hospitalities with themselves, assume the awful prerogative of 'even forgiving sins.'"
2. "This wonderful scene teaches two very weighty truths: (1) Though there be degrees of guilt, insolvency, or inability to wipe out the dishonor done to God, is common to all sinners. (2) As Christ is the Great Creditor to whom all debt, whether great or small, contracted by sinners is owing, so to Him belongs the prerogative of forgiving it."
3. "Either then Jesus was a blaspheming deceiver, or He is God manifest in the flesh."

### Albert Barnes:

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Within themselves. Better, among themselves, as Rev., in margin."

### John Calvin:
1. "Ignorance of Christ's office constantly leads men to conceive new grounds of offense."
2. "No one examines his own wretched condition, which undoubtedly would arouse every man to seek a remedy."
3. "There is no reason to wonder that hypocrites, who slumber amidst their vices, should murmur at it as a thing new and unexpected, when Christ forgives sins."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Thy faith hath saved thee. Not love. Love is to convince others, faith lays hold of grace, and thus love is begotten."
2. "Growing as she wept and washed His feet, [faith] laid hold more and more fully of the pardon it expected, and received at length the full absolution."
3. "If we consider well to whom these words were spoken, we will not forget that grace is free, or exalt our love into a ground of pardon. All her tokens of penitence and affection could not, even in the eyes of sinful men, wash away the stain of her life, but the grace of Christ led her to true peace, as her abiding condition."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2.
