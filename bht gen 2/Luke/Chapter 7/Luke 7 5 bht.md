# Luke 7:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The centurion's love for the Jews, shown through his construction of a synagogue and his favor towards them, was a rare and commendable quality. As a Gentile, he went against the usual enmity between the Jews and the Gentiles. This act of building a synagogue from his own resources not only revealed his affinity for the Jews but also demonstrated his devotion to God. Additionally, it is possible that the ruins in Tell Hum might be the remains of this very synagogue, highlighting the significance of this event in breaking cultural barriers and widening the scope of the Gospel.
