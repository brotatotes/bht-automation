# Luke 7:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The centurion did not hesitate or delay when he was met by the second messenger. Instead, he complied immediately, showing a willingness to go with them. The centurion's humility is evident as he considered himself unworthy to have such an esteemed person in his home. He even sent messengers to prevent Jesus from coming, not wanting to trouble him or impose upon him. The centurion recognized the greatness of Christ and the privilege it would be to have Him in his house.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He was going, was on the way, when he was met by the second messenger from the centurion." 
2. "Trouble [σκυλλου]: Lit., worry."
3. "Worthy [ικανος]: Lit., sufficient. It is also used in the sense of much, many, long."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Went with them. There was no delay as in the case of the Syro-Phenician woman, because there was not the same necessity either for bringing out the faith of the person who asked the favor, or for thus giving a lesson to the disciples, to remove prejudice."
2. "Friends. 'A very delicate and thoroughly natural touch no intercessors, for these he needed no longer, but intimate friends of his family, who can in some measure take his place in greeting the highly honored Guest.' (Van Oosterzee.)"
3. "On the message itself, and the subsequent words of our Lord, see Matthew 8:8-13."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He 'puts the message of both into the mouth of the centurion himself' (Plummer)."
2. "Trouble not thyself (Μη σκυλλου). Present middle (direct use) imperative of σκυλλω, old verb originally meaning to skin, to mangle, and then in later Greek to vex, trouble, annoy."
3. "For I am not worthy that (ου γαρ ικανος ειμ ινα). The same word ικανος, not αξιος, as in Matthew 8:8, which see for discussion, from ικω, ικανω, to fit, to reach, be adequate for."

### John Gill:
1. "He at once complied, made no hesitation, or difficulty about it, but went with them very freely."

3. "He thought it too great a stoop for Christ to come into his house, and too high a favour for him to enjoy."
