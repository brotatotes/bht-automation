# Luke 7:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The centurion's words emphasize his humble recognition of authority, stating that as a man under authority, he understands the concept of obedience. He acknowledges that he has the power to give orders and be obeyed by soldiers and servants, and he believes that Jesus, being over all, has even greater authority and control. The centurion perceives Jesus as someone beyond merely human, implying a deeper understanding of His divine nature. His comparison suggests that just as he can command obedience and actions from his subordinates, Jesus can similarly command and heal diseases.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. "I am a man whose daily course of life and duty is appointed and arranged by superior authority."
2. "I know how to obey, being myself under authority; and I know how others obey, having soldiers under me. If then I, in my subordinate station of command, am obeyed, how much more thou, who art over all, and whom diseases serve as their Master."
3. "Just what estimate of Jesus these words imply we cannot say. It seems evident, at least, that the centurion regarded him as more than man. If that be so, it is a question whether the word man [ανθρωπος] may not imply more than is commonly assigned to it."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  "Set"  (τασσομενος). Genuine here, though doubtful in Matthew 8:9 where see discussion of this vivid and characteristic speech of the centurion. 

### John Gill:
1. "For I also am a man set under authority... and his sense is, that even he who was but an inferior officer, yet had such power as after related..."
2. "...and I say unto one, go, and he goeth, and to another, come, and he cometh, and to my servant, do this, and he doth it; as this his servant used to do, and whom he may intend, who now lay sick, and therefore was dear unto him."
3. "His meaning is, that Christ could as easily command, and call off a distemper, add it would obey him, as he could command obedience from his soldiers and servant, and have it, and more so."
