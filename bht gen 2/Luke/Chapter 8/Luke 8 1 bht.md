# Luke 8:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples went from town to town, spreading the good news of the kingdom of God, proclaiming the forgiveness of sins, justification through Christ's righteousness, and salvation by Him alone. They also instructed people on the ordinances of this new dispensation and encouraged them to submit to them. Through their preaching, they emphasized that the kingdom of God is not about outward things, but about inward holiness, peace, and joy. They revealed that entrance into the kingdom of glory requires regenerating grace and a righteousness that surpasses that of the religious leaders of the time.
