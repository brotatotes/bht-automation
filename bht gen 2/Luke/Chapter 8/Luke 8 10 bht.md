# Luke 8:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The mysteries of the Gospel, which require a special and peculiar gift of spiritual knowledge from God, are often explained in parables. This is because Jesus speaks in parables not only for those who have the opportunity to enter the kingdom but fail due to their unfitness, but also for the multitudes who see and hear without truly understanding. The parabolic delivery of the Gospel is intended for those who are outsiders, strangers, and not children, ensuring that their seeing may not truly see and their hearing may not truly understand the profound truths being conveyed to them.
