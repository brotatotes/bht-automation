# Luke 8:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The devil is relentless in his efforts to hinder the spread of the word of God. He snatches away the seeds of faith from the hearts of those who hear the message, preventing it from taking root. The devil's tactics are effective even among those who only casually engage with the word, as he distracts their minds and causes them to forget what they have heard. Therefore, preachers must be aware of the enemy's activity and remain vigilant in their mission to win souls, recognizing that Satan will go to great lengths to hinder their efforts.
