# Luke 8:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These individuals appear sincere and committed initially, but their faith is only superficial. Rather than receiving the word of God into their hearts, they keep it in their heads. Their belief is temporary, as they easily forget the teachings or allow doubt to enter their minds. They tend to fall away and lose interest in the faith, especially when faced with affliction or persecution. It is during these trying times that their lack of genuine faith is revealed and they withdraw from the path of righteousness.
