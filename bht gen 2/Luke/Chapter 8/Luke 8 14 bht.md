# Luke 8:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parable of the seed that fell among thorns represents individuals who hear the word, but are ultimately hindered by the distractions and temptations of this world. These distractions, which include the worries, wealth, and indulgences of life, can choke the word and prevent it from taking root and bearing fruit in their lives. As a result, these individuals fail to bring the message they have heard to completion, rendering it ineffective in their lives.
