## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "All receptivity of the seed is from God and all men have receptivity enough to make it matter of condemnation to them that they receive it not in earnest, and bring not forth fruit." 
2. "There is in this very receptivity a wide difference between men; some being false-hearted, hating the truth, deceiving themselves, others being earnest and simple-minded, willing to be taught, and humble enough to receive with meekness the engrafted word."
3. "In patience consistently, through the course of a life spent in duties, and amidst discouragements."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Honest and good heart. Peculiar to Luke. Honest; lit., fair, noble. Honest, not in the popular sense, but in the sense of the Latin honestus; noble, virtuous, worthy." 
2. "Keep (katecousin). Much better Rev., hold it fast, giving the force of the compound verb." 
3. "With patience. Or in patience. Peculiar to Luke. In contrast with fall away, ver. 13."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In an honest and good heart. It is not easy to translate. We have such phrases as 'good and true,' 'sound and good,' 'right and good,' no one of which quite suits the Greek...Certainly Luke adds new moral qualities not in the Hellenic phrase." 
2. "Hold it down' so that the devil does not snatch it away, having depth of soil so that it does not shrivel up under the sun, and is not choked by weeds and thorns. It bears fruit. That is the proof of spiritual life."
3. "In patience. There is no other way for real fruit to come. Mushrooms spring up overnight, but they are usually poisonous. The best fruits require time, cultivation, patience."

### John Gill:
1. "The seed that fell on good ground design such hearers, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it..."
2. "Who hear with an honest and good intention, and faithfully keep it, and hold it fast..."
3. "...and bring forth fruit with patience; with great constancy, suffering much for the sake of it; and the more they suffer, the more fruitful they are."

### John Wesley:
1. Who — keep it - Not like the highway side: And bring forth fruit - Not like the thorny ground: With perseverance - Not like the stony.
