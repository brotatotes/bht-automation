# Luke 8:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus said, No man having lighted a lamp, he wanted to emphasize the importance of sharing the light of the gospel with others. Like a lamp that is meant to be placed on a stand and not hidden under a bed, believers should not hide the knowledge and understanding they have received. Instead, they are called to let their light shine, spreading the message of Christ to others. This is the will of Christ for all who have been blessed with the gift of knowledge and faith.
