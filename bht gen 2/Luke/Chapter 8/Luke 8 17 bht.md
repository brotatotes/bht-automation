# Luke 8:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
No matter how we try to keep things hidden, nothing can remain concealed indefinitely. The truth will always be brought into the light, for nothing is secret that will not be made manifest. This message is reinforced in various parallel passages, emphasizing the futility of concealing information or hiding the truth. It serves as a reminder that secrets are temporary and the disclosure of hidden matters is inevitable, urging us to prioritize transparency and honesty in all aspects of our lives.
