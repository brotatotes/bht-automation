# Luke 8:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Beware of hearing carelessly, for what you now hear will be preached by you to others. To those who have knowledge and abilities, more will be given, but those who lack spiritual understanding will lose even what they think they have. (Matthew 13:12; Mark 4:25; Luke 19:26)

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The precept is very weighty."
2. "The 'having' of Matthew 13:12 (on which see), and this 'thinking he hath,' are not different."
3. "Hanging loosely on him, and not appropriated, it is and is not his."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "How ye hear [πως] . The manner of hearing."
2. "Come at him [συντυχειν] . Only here in New Testament. The word properly carries the idea of an accidental meeting, and slightly so here."
3. "22 - 25; Luke 9:57-62. Compare Matthew 8:18-27; Mark 4:35-41."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Some things should not be heard at all. Some that are heard should be forgotten. Others should be treasured and practiced." 
2. "For whosoever hath (Hος αν γαρ εχη). Present active subjunctive of the common verb εχω which may mean 'keep on having' or 'acquiring.'"
3. "Losses in business illustrate this saying as when we see their riches take wings and fly away. So it is with hearing and heeding. Self-deception is a common complaint."

### John Gill:
1. "Take heed therefore how ye hear,.... That ye hear not in a careless and negligent manner, since what truths and doctrines ye now hear with the ear, are to be preached by you unto others."
2. "For whosoever hath; that is, hath knowledge of the doctrines of the Gospel, and hath gifts and abilities to preach them to others:to him shall be given; more knowledge, and by using his gifts they shall be increased."
3. "But he that hath not; true, solid, spiritual knowledge of divine things, though he has had considerable advantages and opportunities of learning it, as the apostles especially had:from him shall be taken, even that which he seemeth to have; or "that which he thinks he has", as the Syriac version renders it; that which he seemed to others to have, or thought himself he had."

### John Wesley:
1. The word commonly translated seemeth, wherever it occurs, does not weaken, but greatly strengthens the sense. Matthew 13:12; Mark 4:25; Luke 19:26.
