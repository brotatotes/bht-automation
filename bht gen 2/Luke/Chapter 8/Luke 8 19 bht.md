# Luke 8:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Gospels do not provide an exact chronology or exhaustive account of everything Jesus said and did, but this ambiguity does not pose a significant challenge. The brothers of Jesus initially supported him, but as Jesus continued his work and faced rejection, their belief in him waned. In this particular instance, Jesus was teaching a large crowd when his mother and brothers arrived, likely out of concern for him or a desire to learn from him. The crowd was so dense that his family was unable to approach him or communicate with him privately.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "The Evangelists were not very exact as to the order of dates or even in detailing minutely everything that Christ did or said, so that the difficulty is soon removed."
2. "All the three Evangelists agree in stating, that while Christ was discoursing in the midst of a crowd of people, his mother and brethren came to him."
3. "The reason must have been either that they were anxious about him, or that they were desirous of instruction; for it is not without some good reason that they endeavor to approach him."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "At first the brothers of Jesus... were not unfriendly to the work of Jesus... But as Jesus went on with his work and was rejected... there developed an evident disbelief in his claims."
2. "They have apparently come with Mary to take Jesus home out of the excitement of the crowds, perhaps thinking that he is beside himself."
3. "Certainly the mother of Jesus could give no credence to that slander... she herself was deeply concerned and wanted to help him if possible."

### John Gill:
1. "These brethren of his were relations according to the flesh, either by Joseph, or his mother's  side: who they were, cannot be said with certainty."
2. "The multitude of people that were about him, who were so thick, that there was no coming near him, much less was there an opportunity of speaking privately, with him."
3. "The Syriac version renders it, 'they could not speak unto him for the multitude'."

### John Wesley:
1.  Matthew 12:46; Mark 3:31.
