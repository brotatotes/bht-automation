# Luke 8:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Although our earthly family ties are temporary, it is through hearing and doing the word of God that we become true children of God. This involves not only listening to His teachings but also putting them into practice. Jesus emphasized the importance of this hearing and doing combination in the Sermon on the Mount, as well as later when He declared that those who do His will are His friends. Ultimately, it is by aligning our lives with the will of God that we demonstrate our true identity as His children.
