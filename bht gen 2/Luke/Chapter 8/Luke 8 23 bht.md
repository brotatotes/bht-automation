# Luke 8:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Jesus sailed, he fell asleep, the only passage speaking of his slumber. Then came a storm of wind that descended upon the lake, originating from the surrounding heights and shaking the Sea of Galilee like a tempest. Although the disciples were not filled, their ship was, as it was flooded with water from the storm.
