# Luke 8:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus and his disciples arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, they encountered a demon-possessed man who immediately approached them. It is significant that they sailed down from the sea to the land, as this emphasizes their deliberate arrival in this specific location. Interestingly, the exact place where this encounter took place is debated among scholars, with some suggesting Gadarenes and others suggesting Gergesenes. Regardless, what is clear is that the power of Jesus is demonstrated in his ability to confront and deliver individuals from the dominion of the devil, even extending to the realm of death itself.
