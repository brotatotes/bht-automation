# Luke 8:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A certain man, who had devils for a long time, met Jesus as he went out of the city. It is important to note that the term devils is mentioned in plural, indicating that there were indeed many evil spirits in him, which the name legion also alludes to. Furthermore, this man would tear apart any clothing put on him, and he did not have a place to stay, dwelling instead among the tombs. This description of his behavior, such as going naked, tearing clothes, and residing in the tombs, is unique to the account given by Luke.
