# Luke 8:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The possessed man cried out in the midst of the ordering that our compassionate Lord was imposing upon the unclean spirit. The exorcism and the cry were simultaneous, as the Lord was commanding the spirit. This commanding was a result of the unclean spirit having caught the man many times, exerting incredible strength and fury upon him. Moved by compassion, the Lord quickly cast the spirit out of the man who had been driven into the wilderness by the devil.
