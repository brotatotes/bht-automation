# Luke 8:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, was among the followers of Jesus, and it is likely that her position granted her access to information about Him. Other women of means also supported Jesus and His disciples in their ministry. These women were grateful for the blessings they received from Christ and expressed their gratitude by using their worldly possessions to support Him. It is remarkable how these women overcame obstacles and formed the first missionary society, driven by their gratitude and zeal.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
