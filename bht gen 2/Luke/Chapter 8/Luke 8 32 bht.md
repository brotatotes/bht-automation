# Luke 8:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
About two thousand swine were feeding on the mountain. The demons, having been expelled from the possessed man, sought to enter the swine, but their presence there did not provide them with any lasting respite. They pleaded with Jesus for permission to enter the swine, and Jesus granted their request. However, it quickly became evident that the purpose of the swine was not to protect or accommodate the demons. Instead, the swine met a swift and tragic demise, illustrating the mighty power of Christ.
