Against their wills, the demons who had possessed the man for a long time were forced by the power of Christ to rush violently down a steep place into the lake, where they were choked and died.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. Ran violently [ωρμησεν] . Rev., more neatly, rushed. Only Mark gives the number of the swine, two thousand. A steep place. See on Matthew 9:32.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Rushed down the steep (ωρμησεν κατα του κρημνου). Ablative with κατα as in Mark 5:13; Matthew 8:32 and the same vivid verb in each account, to hurl impetuously, to rush."
2. "Were choked (απεπνιγη). Second aorist (constative) passive indicative third singular (collective singular) where Mark 5:13 has the picturesque imperfect επνιγοντο."

### John Gill:
1. "Being obliged by the power of Christ, sore against their wills, having had possession of him a long time."
2. "The herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake."
3. "And were choked; in the waters, and died."
