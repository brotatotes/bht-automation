# Luke 8:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people of Gergesenes, who were held in great fear, besought Jesus to depart from them. Instead of choosing to continue with Christ, they preferred to retain the presence of the demons among them. It seems that they valued their swine more than the well-being of their fellow countrymen or even Jesus himself. This response echoes a similar use of the verb in Luke 12:50, where Jesus expresses his own desire to be free from the burden of his impending death.
