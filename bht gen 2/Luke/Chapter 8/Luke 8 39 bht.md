The man who was healed had an incredible story to tell, and he made sure to share it throughout the whole city, recounting the great things Jesus had done for him. It is clear from the account that only God could have accomplished such a miraculous transformation in his life. By publishing this account, he not only declared the power of Jesus, but also the power of God, who had restored him physically, mentally, and spiritually.
