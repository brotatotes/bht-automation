# Luke 8:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, Jesus asked, Who touched me? not because He was unaware, but to bring attention to the woman who had touched Him and received healing through her faith. Even though the disciples and the crowd denied it, the woman boldly came forward to testify. Her actions were significant, as she reached out to Jesus in the midst of the pressing and thronging of the multitude.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The healing took place by His will, and owing to His recognition of her faith: see similar questions, Genesis 3:9, and 2 Kings 5:25."
2. "Thus Augustine, ‘Sic etiam nunc est corpus ejus, id est, Ecclesia ejus. Tangit eam fides paucorum, premit turba multorum’ (Serm. lxii. 3 (5), vol. v.)."
3. "Rather should we say, seeing it was one of those that thus crowded on Him who obtained grace from Him, that it is a blessed encouragement to us not only to crowd on Him, but even to touch Him: so to crowd on Him as never to be content till we have grasped if it be but His garment for ourselves."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 45. Who touched me?—"Askest
	Thou, Lord, who touched Thee? Rather ask who touched Thee not
	in such a throng."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Who touched [τις ο αψαμενος] . Lit., who is he that touched? Rev., who is it that." 
2. "Throng and press [συνεχουσιναποθλιβουσιν] . On the former word, see ver. 37, and ch. 4 38." 
3. "Rev. renders the latter, which occurs here only, more literally, crush. It means to squeeze out, as wine from grapes. See on tribulation, Matthew 13:21."

### John Calvin:
1. "It does appear to be absurd that Christ should pour out his grace without knowing on whom he was bestowing a favor."
2. "Beyond all question, he knowingly and willingly cured the woman; and there is as little doubt that he drew her to himself by his Spirit, that she might obtain a cure."
3. "If Christ had been the only witness of his miracle, his statements might not perhaps have been believed: but now, when the woman, struck with dread, relates what happened to her, greater weight is due to her confession."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The question of our Lord was to draw out the woman’s faith."
2. "The multitudes press thee, etc. ‘Press’ and ‘crush’ are strong terms."
3. "The touch of faith and the accidental touch differ: no virtue flows out in the case of the latter."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Press thee and crush thee" (συνεχουσιν σε κα αποθλιβουσιν). 
2. "Hold thee together, hold thee in" (συνεχω, see verse Luke 8:37).
3. "Crush thee" (αποθλιβω) here only in the N.T., a verb used of pressing out grapes in Diodorus and Josephus.

### John Gill:
1. "This he said, not as ignorant of the person that had done it, but in order to discover her to the people, and the cure she had received, as well as her faith."
2. "When all denied; both the disciples and the multitude, as many as were near him, and who might be thought to have done it; all excepting the woman, who afterwards came and declared it."
3. "Said, Master, the multitude throng thee, and press thee, and sayest thou, who touched me?"
