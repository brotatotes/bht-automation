# Luke 8:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Jesus was surrounded by a multitude, someone intentionally reached out and touched Him with the conscious, reliant touch of faith. Jesus immediately perceived that power had gone out from Him. This wasn't a random occurrence, but a deliberate act of faith that drew virtue out of Him. Many may come close to Christ, even within the means of grace, but without the active contact of faith, it becomes futile. It's important to emphasize the significance of Jesus being aware of this touch, as it demonstrates His infinite knowledge and understanding of all the circumstances surrounding the situation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Somebody hath touched—yes, the multitude 'thronged' and pressed Him—but one, one only—'Somebody TOUCHED' HIM, with the conscious, voluntary, dependent touch of faith, reaching forth its hands expressly to have contact with Him."
2. "Even so, as the Church Father AUGUSTINE long ago said, multitudes still come similarly close to Christ in the means of grace, but all to no purpose, being only sucked into the crowd."
3. "The voluntary, living contact of faith is that electric conductor which alone draws virtue out of Him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Rev. renders the two aorists strictly: did touch, and I perceived, with reference to Jesus' knowledge of the touch at the moment it was applied."
2. "The evangelists use the word frequently of miracles - mighty works. It is used here in the sense of virtue, according to its use by naturalists and physicians."
3. "Still, too much stress must not be laid upon it as a mark of Luke's professional accuracy, as Dean Plumptre in 'The Expositor,' 4 139; since Mark uses it in his narrative of the same incident, and in the same sense (Mark 5:30)."

### Philip Schaff:
1. Luke 8:46. Notice the correct reading, as proving our Lord’s knowledge of all the circumstances of the case.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For I perceived that power had gone forth from me." (εγω γαρ εγνων δυναμιν εξεληλυθυιαν απ' εμου). Jesus felt the sensation of power already gone.
2. "Who does not know what this sense of 'goneness' or exhaustion of nervous energy means?"

### John Gill:
1. "Not in a common and accidental way, but with design, and in the strength of faith."
2. "For the cure of the person that had touched him, and that not without his knowledge and will."
