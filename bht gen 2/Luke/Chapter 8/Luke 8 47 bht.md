# Luke 8:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This woman, desperate for healing, sought her cure in secret, hoping to go unnoticed by the crowd. But Jesus, with absolute knowledge, looked around to acknowledge her, drawing her forth to confess openly. Though trembling with fear of His response, she declared the whole truth of her affliction and her fruitless efforts to find a cure. In doing so, she not only testified to the facts of her case, but also demonstrated the importance of openly confessing Christ and bearing witness before all.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Our Lord (Mark 5:0;32) looked around to see τὴν τοῦτο ποιήσασαν — a wonderful precision of expression, by which His absolute knowledge of the whole matter is set before us."
2. "Her confession ἐνώπ. παν. τ. λ., is very striking here, as showing us that Christ will have Himself openly confessed, and not only secretly sought: that our Christian life is not, as it is sometimes called, merely ‘a thing between ourselves and God’; but a good confession, to be witnessed ἐνώπιον παν. τ. λ."


### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "declared . . . before all—This, though a great trial to the shrinking modesty of the believing woman, was just what Christ wanted in dragging her forth, her public testimony to the facts of her case—both her disease, with her abortive efforts at a cure, and the instantaneous and perfect relief which her touch of the Great Healer had brought her."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Falling down. Not in worship, but in terror. See on fell down, Luke 5:28.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Could not be hid. She felt that He knew of the cure He had wrought."
2. "In the presence of all the people. Peculiar to Luke, and significant. She sought a cure in secret, but is led to confess it openly."
3. "This our Lord desires and deserves. A caution to those believers who do not confess Him before men."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Vivid touch of the feeling of this sensitive woman who now had to tell everybody of her cure."
2. "She faced the widest publicity for her secret cure."

### John Gill:
1. "The Syriac and Arabic versions render it, 'that he had not forgot her'; she hoping he would be diverted from taking any notice of her and her action, through the crowd of people about him." 
2. "She came trembling; for fear of the anger and resentment of Christ, and lest the favour would be revoked, and the penalty of the law inflicted."
3. "She declared unto him before all the people; the whole truth of the matter, what a disease she had laboured under for so long a time, what means she had used to no purpose."
