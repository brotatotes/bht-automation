Jesus lovingly reassured the trembling woman, affirming that her faith had not only saved her when she touched Him but also when she confessed her actions.

Jesus spoke to her with kindness and affection, bidding her to be comforted and not afraid, assuring her that her faith was the source of her wholeness and granting her peace.

1. "How lovingly does our Lord re-assure the trembling woman; her faith saved her not merely in the act of touching, but as now completed by the act of confession; it saved her mediately, as the connecting link between herself and Christ."
2. "The δύναμις ἐξεληλυθυῖα ἀπʼαὐτοῦ, working through that faith, saved her energetically, and as the working cause."
3. "Mark’s addition, ἴσθι ὑγ. ἀπὸ τ. μάστιγός σου, is important, as conveying to her an assurance that the effect which she felt in her body should be permanent; that the healing about which she might otherwise almost have doubted, as being surreptitiously obtained, was now openly ratified by the Lord’s own word."
