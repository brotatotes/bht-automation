# Luke 8:49 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As the ruler's family came to him, who was with Jesus, a messenger arrived and declared, Thy daughter is dead, trouble not the master. This message discouraged the ruler from seeking further help, as all hope seemed lost. The variations among different versions, with some mentioning the ruler's family and others using 'him' or 'Jesus' instead of 'master', emphasize the independent authority of the narratives and provide insights into the precision and accuracy of the accounts. These details enrich our understanding of the situation and highlight the urgency and significance of the ruler's request for Jesus' help.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Little marks of accuracy come out in each of the two fuller accounts."
2. "In Mark again we learn not only that Jesus heard, but παρακούσας τὸν λόγον λαλούμενον, i.e. it was not reported to Him, but He overheard it being said, which is a minute detail not given here."
3. "Nothing could more satisfactorily mark the independent authority of the two narratives."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Dead is thy daughter."
2. "Trouble."
3. "Tyndale renders dis-ease, in the old verbal sense of disturb."

### Philip Schaff:
1. Luke 8:49.  There cometh one. Mark is less definite.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "From the ruler of the synagogue's house (παρα του αρχισυναγωγου). The word 'house' is not in the Greek here as in Mark 5:35 where απο is used rather than παρα, as here."
2. "But the ruler himself had come to Jesus (Luke 8:41) and this is the real idea."
3. "Trouble not (μηκετ σκυλλε). See on Luke 7:6 for this verb and also Mark 5:35; Matthew 9:36."

### John Gill:
1. "The Persic version here reads, 'some of the ruler's family came'; that is, to him, who was now with Jesus" 
2. "This messenger both came from his house, and to him: saying to him, thy daughter is dead, trouble not the master; to bring him any further, since all hope of help was now gone." 
3. "The Vulgate Latin version, instead of 'master', reads 'him'; and the Ethiopic version, 'Jesus'."
