# Luke 8:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A sower went out to sow his seed, representing Jesus Christ and every preacher of the Gospel. As he sowed, some seed fell by the wayside, symbolizing those who are unresponsive and lacking understanding of the word. These hardened and ignorant hearers trample the Gospel underfoot, rejecting and despising it as it is preached to them.
