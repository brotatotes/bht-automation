# Luke 8:51 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our Lord had entered the house, where He found a crowd of people, including musicians and onlookers, who were all following Him into the chamber of death. However, He allowed only three of His closest disciples - Peter, James, and John - to enter with Him. This selection of witnesses highlights their special relationship with Jesus and emphasizes their role in witnessing the forthcoming miracle. The exclusivity of their presence adds to the gravity and significance of the impending event.

### Henry Alford:
1. "Our Lord had entered the house, where He found θόρυβον , τοὺς αὐλητὰς καὶ τὸν ὄχλον (Matt., Mark), who were all following Him into the chamber of death."
2. "He declared who were to follow Him ( οὐκ ἀφῆκεν , κ . τ . λ .), and uttered the words ἀναχωρεῖτε · οὐ γὰρ κ . τ . λ ."
3. "Then He entered with His three Apostles and the parents. I say this, not for the sake of harmonizing, but to bring out the sequence in our narrative here, which unless we get the right meaning for ἀφῆκεν , seems disturbed."

### John Gill:
1. "And when he came into the house,.... Of the ruler of the synagogue;he suffered no man to go in: to the room, where the dead body lay: save Peter, James and John; not one of the multitude that followed him, nor any of the disciples, but these three; who were his favourite ones, and were a sufficient number to be witnesses of the miracle."
