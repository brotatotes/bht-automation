# Luke 8:52 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people were weeping and lamenting, some in a genuine display of grief and others merely following the expected mourning rituals. However, Jesus reassured them that there was no need for tears, as the girl was not truly dead but only sleeping. This distinction between death and sleep emphasizes the temporary nature of her passing and highlights the hope of resurrection that would soon come.
