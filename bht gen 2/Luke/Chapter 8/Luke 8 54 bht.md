# Luke 8:54 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus put everyone out of the room except for the parents of the child and his three disciples, showing the special intimacy of the moment. He then took the hand of the girl and called out to her in Aramaic, saying Talitha cumi, which means Little girl, I say to you, arise. By using these specific words, Jesus demonstrated the power of his touch and the authority of his voice in bringing the girl back to life.
