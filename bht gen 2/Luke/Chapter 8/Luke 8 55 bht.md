# Luke 8:55 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This incident serves as a reminder of the immortality of the soul, as it returns to the body after death in the resurrection. Her immediate ability to arise and walk confirms that she was fully alive and healthy. Although we may wonder where her spirit was during the separation, the scripture tells us that it simply returned to God.
