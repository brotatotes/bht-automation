# Luke 8:56 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The incredible miracle that took place left her parents in awe and amazement. They witnessed firsthand the resurrection of their daughter and saw her regain her strength and health. However, Christ's instruction was clear. He did not want them to make this miracle widely known or to share the details with others. Rather, he wanted them to keep it private and not draw unnecessary attention to the event.
