# Luke 8:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Some hearers are like the rocky ground, their hardened hearts unable to fully receive and respond to the word of God. These are the ones who, despite hearing the message, remain unaffected and unchanged by it, deceived by their own sins. They only have a shallow understanding of the word, quickly professing their faith but lacking depth and commitment. As a result, when faced with tribulation and persecution, they wither away, lacking the necessary grace and support from God to withstand the trials they encounter.
