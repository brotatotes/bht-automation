# Luke 8:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The hearts of some listeners are like ground with roots of thorns and briars, where worldly worries and desires take precedence. These distractions grow faster than the word of God within them, choking it and rendering it useless. The dangers faced by these listeners are emphasized by the imagery of thorns, highlighting the prominence of the threat they pose. Luke, the author, often uses powerful and descriptive language, such as compounds and sonorous words, to convey his message effectively.
