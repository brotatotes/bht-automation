# Luke 8:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parable of the sower teaches us about different types of hearers of the word. The seed that falls on good ground represents those who have good and honest hearts, prepared by the Spirit of God. These are the ones who receive the word and bear fruit. This fruitfulness may vary, with some producing thirtyfold and others sixtyfold, as the word of God is more fruitful in some hearers than others. Jesus emphasizes the importance of truly listening and understanding His message by crying out with a loud voice, urging those with ears to hear to pay careful attention.
