# Luke 8:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples, sensing a possible reflection on their own growth, eagerly and repeatedly questioned Jesus about the meaning of the parable. They asked him what this parable might signify, seeking to comprehend its sense and meaning. In response to their inquiry on why Jesus spoke in parables to the people, the subsequent words serve as a fitting answer. The change from the indicative to the optative in the question is merely a shift in grammatical form without altering its meaning.

1. "Eager and repeated questions on the part of the disciples, perhaps dimly perceiving a possible reflection on their own growth." 
2. "A mistranslation, What this parable was (or meant)."
3. "The optative ειη is merely due to indirect discourse, changing the indicative εστιν (is) of the direct question to the optative ειη of the indirect, a change entirely with the writer or speaker and without any change of meaning."
