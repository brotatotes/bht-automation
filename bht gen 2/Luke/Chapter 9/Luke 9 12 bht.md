# Luke 9:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the day began to wear away, the sun was declining towards the horizon and was almost set. The twelve disciples approached Jesus, urging Him to send the multitude away so that they could find lodging and food in the surrounding towns and country. The disciples emphasized that they were in a desert place, lacking both accommodation and provisions. The challenge of finding sustenance in such a barren setting led them to seek a practical solution for the pressing needs of the people.
