# Luke 9:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Every person received their portion and it was enough to satisfy their needs. The leftovers were collected in twelve baskets, demonstrating the abundance and provision of God. Even the broken pieces were not wasted, highlighting God's ability to take what seems insignificant or insufficient and turn it into something abundant and fulfilling for each person.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "κλασ. in Matt. is joined with τὸ περισσεῦον, in Mark with κοφίνους πλήρεις: here it may be taken with τὸ περισ. (ordinarily, and De Wette) or κόφ. (Meyer), but best, it appears to me, the latter, because the article is not expressed as in Matt."
2. "It is also an important observation, that the omission by Luke of the second miracle of feeding is not to be adduced against its historical reality, as has been done by Schleiermacher (transl. p. 144), since it is only omitted as occurring in the midst of a large section, which the accounts gathered by Luke did not contain."
3. "We see also, that the characteristic κοφίνους of the first feeding is preserved, without any confusion of terms: σπυρίδας being always used in relating and referring to the second, Matthew 15:37; Matthew 16:10; Mark 8:8; Mark 8:20."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "And there was taken up that which remained over to them, of broken pieces, twelve baskets."
2. "Baskets. See on Matthew 14:20."
3. "18 - 21. Compare Matthew 16:13-20. Mark 8:27-30."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Twelve baskets  (κοφινο δωδεκα). For discussion of κοφονο and σφυριδες as well as of κλασματα (broken pieces) see on Mark 6:43; Matthew 14:20. 

### John Gill:
1. "Every one had a part, and enough."
