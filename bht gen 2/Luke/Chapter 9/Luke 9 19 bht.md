# Luke 9:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The opinions about Jesus among the multitude were varied. Some thought he was John the Baptist, who had risen from the dead. Others believed he was Elijah, the prophet who was expected to come before the Messiah. Still, others believed he was one of the old prophets who had risen again. These differing viewpoints reflect the speculation and uncertainty that surrounded Jesus at that time.
