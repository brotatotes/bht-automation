# Luke 9:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus sent out his disciples with a twofold purpose: to proclaim the kingdom of God and to bring healing to the sick. The Gospel they preached was not only about the kingdom ruled by the Messiah, but also about the kingdom of grace established in the hearts of believers. By healing the sick, the disciples were able to authenticate their message and demonstrate the power and authority they had received from Christ. Through their preaching and acts of healing, they shared the good news of God's kingdom and brought physical and spiritual restoration to those in need.
