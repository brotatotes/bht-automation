# Luke 9:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, in a solemn and emphatic manner, charged his disciples not to reveal his true identity as the Messiah. This charge carried the weight of a penalty, emphasizing the significance of keeping this secret. To disclose this truth risked misunderstanding and political unrest among the Jews. Jesus knew that the revelation of his divinity and true nature as the Son of God was something that could only be unveiled through divine revelation, not through human understanding. Therefore, he commanded his disciples to keep this revelation hidden, as it was beyond the grasp of flesh and blood to comprehend.
