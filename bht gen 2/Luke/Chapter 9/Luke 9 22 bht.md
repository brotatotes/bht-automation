# Luke 9:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage emphasizes the necessity for the Son of Man to go through immense suffering and rejection. These hardships are far from what the people anticipated for the Messiah. However, there is a glimmer of hope as the passage also mentions his resurrection on the third day. While the phrase on the third day may not be meant to be taken literally, it signifies the importance and significance of his resurrection, bringing new life and redemption.
