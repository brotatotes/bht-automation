# Luke 9:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Every believer is called to deny themselves, take up their cross, and follow Jesus. This duty has been emphasized repeatedly in the Scriptures. By taking up our cross daily, we participate in the afflictions, trials, and persecutions that will come our way as followers of Christ. It is vital that we embrace these challenges cheerfully and with the understanding that each day presents an opportunity to bear our cross and grow in our walk with the Lord.
