# Luke 9:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
What profit is there for a man to gain the whole world but lose his own soul? Jesus presents this thought-provoking question, highlighting the inability of worldly possessions to bring true fulfillment and purpose. The transient nature of wealth and success becomes evident when we consider the eternal value of the soul. To lose one's soul is to forfeit oneself, to experience a devastating and irreversible loss that impacts not only the present but also the future. The consequence is an everlasting destruction and a missed opportunity for eternal happiness and glory.
