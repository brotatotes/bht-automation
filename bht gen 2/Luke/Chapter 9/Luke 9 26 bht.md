# Luke 9:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For whoever is ashamed of Jesus and His words, of His person, His offices, His grace, and His doctrines of the Gospel, he will experience a feeling of disgrace before the Father, the holy angels, and the whole heavenly assembly. However, Jesus, as the exalted Messiah, possesses a threefold glory: His own glory, the glory of God, and the glory of the angels who attend Him. Therefore, let us not be ashamed but stand firm in our faith, just as Jesus endured the shame of the cross and as Paul boldly declared that he was not ashamed of the Gospel.
