# Luke 9:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Some will witness the Son of Man's glorious coming, showing his judgment upon those ashamed of him. This does not refer only to the last day, as some present will see the kingdom of God. This occurred through the Gospel's establishment among Jews and Gentiles, following Christ's resurrection and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. This powerful Gospel coming would lead to conversions and the destruction of the Jewish nation for rejecting the Messiah.
