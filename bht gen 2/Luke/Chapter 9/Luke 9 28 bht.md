# Luke 9:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Jesus ascended the mountain with Peter, James, and John, it became clear that this was no ordinary journey. Luke notes that the purpose of this ascent was for Jesus to pray, and it is here that the magnificent transfiguration took place. In this moment, Jesus' face transformed in appearance, shining with a radiant brightness that is difficult to express. His garments became immaculate, dazzling white, revealing a glimpse of his majesty and divinity. This event, meticulously recorded by Matthew and Mark, serves as a powerful demonstration of the glory of his impending death and resurrection.
