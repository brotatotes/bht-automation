# Luke 9:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Matthew 17:2, as Jesus prayed, his countenance was altered, shining like the sun. This transformation of his appearance demonstrated a divine connection, as seen in the description of how Christ was heard and answered while still speaking. When believers are granted communion with God, their countenance is similarly changed, shifting from sadness to cheerfulness, reflecting the joy and blessing received through their connection with the divine.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "St. Luke seems to have declined the use of μετεμορφώθη (employed by the other two Evangelists here), that he might not awaken in his Greek readers any ideas or feelings connected with the fabulous metamorphoses of their heathen deities."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Thanks to God, transfiguring manifestations are not quite strangers here."
2. "Ofttimes in the deepest depths, out of groanings which cannot be uttered, God's dear children are suddenly transported to a kind of heaven upon earth."
3. "Their prayers fetch down such light, strength, holy gladness, as make their face to shine, putting a kind of celestial radiance upon it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Luke avoids Matthew's word, metamorfwqh, was metamorphosed. He was writing for Greek readers, to whom that word represented the transformations of heathen deities into other forms."
2. "White [λευκος] . In classical Greek very indefinite as an expression of color; being used, not only of the whiteness of the snow, but of gray dust. Its original sense is clear."
3. "Matthew, as the light. Mark, stilbonta, glistering (see on Mark 9:3). Luke, ejxastraptwn (only here in New Testament), flashing as with the brilliance of lightning."

### John Gill:
