# Luke 9:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The instruction for the disciples is clear - they are to refrain from carrying any extra provisions or money with them. This is because wherever they go, they will be provided for by others as a reward for their efforts. The prohibition is not against having two coats in total, but rather against each disciple having multiple coats or extra clothing. The wording of the passage effectively conveys the intended meaning of the command.
