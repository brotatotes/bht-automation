# Luke 9:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As they ascended the mountain, weariness overcame them, and they became heavy with sleep. However, it was not a mere vision that they saw in their slumber, but the true glory of Jesus Christ. This glory was so radiant that it startled them out of their sleep, and they were in awe of the majestic transformation of their Lord.
