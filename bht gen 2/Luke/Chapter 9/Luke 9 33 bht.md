# Luke 9:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter, in his awe and astonishment, suggested to Jesus that they stay on the mountain and build tabernacles for Him, Moses, and Elijah. His impulsive nature led him to speak without fully understanding the significance of his words. Peter's desire to commemorate this extraordinary experience on the mountain was not well considered. He did not realize that this departing manifestation of Moses and Elijah was a momentary glimpse into the glory of God's plan.
