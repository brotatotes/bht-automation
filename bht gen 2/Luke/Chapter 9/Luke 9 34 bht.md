# Luke 9:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A cloud, a symbol of the divine presence, appeared and overshadowed them all. The apostles, filled with fear, watched as Moses and Elijah entered into the cloud, which suddenly took them away. This event is reminiscent of when a cloud received Jesus out of the sight of his disciples during his ascension to heaven.
