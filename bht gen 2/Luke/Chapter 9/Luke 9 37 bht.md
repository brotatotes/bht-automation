# Luke 9:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On the following day, after their descent from the hill, Jesus encountered a large crowd. This event is mentioned in Matthew 17:14 and Mark 9:14. The fact that this encounter is referred to as happening on the next day suggests that the transfiguration may have taken place during the previous night. Luke's account, however, excludes the entire conversation related to Elijah.
