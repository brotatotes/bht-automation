# Luke 9:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, Luke provides medical details about the sudden and prolonged fits that afflict a possessed child. Aretaeus, a contemporary physician, acknowledges the possibility of demonic influence in such cases. The child's condition is described as violent, with terrifying cries and convulsions that cause him to foam at the mouth. The Greek word συντρίβον used to describe the child's actions suggests a crushing or rubbing together, resembling the sound of chains or the shattering of a vase. These details highlight the severity and distressing nature of the child's affliction.
