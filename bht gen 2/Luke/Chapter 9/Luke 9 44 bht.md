# Luke 9:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let the weight of these words penetrate your mind, for they hold great significance. Reflect deeply on the truth they convey and store them in your heart. Understand that the Son of man will be handed over to be killed by the very ones who have plotted against him, but he will rise after three days. Even in moments of triumph, remember the cross and the sacrifice it represents. Our Lord, in his infinite wisdom, beautifully intertwines moments of praise with the reality of suffering.
