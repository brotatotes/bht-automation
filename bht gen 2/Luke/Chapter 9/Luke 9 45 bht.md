# Luke 9:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples were perplexed by the words of Jesus, unable to reconcile them with their preconceived notions of a triumphant and earthly Messiah. They were kept in the dark about the true meaning of his saying, veiled by their limited understanding. Filled with fear of asking for clarification, they remained uncertain, unaware that Jesus spoke of his upcoming suffering and free will. Perhaps this lack of understanding was necessary for their spiritual growth and to ensure their unwavering commitment. Nonetheless, this was undoubtedly a difficult problem for them to grapple with.
