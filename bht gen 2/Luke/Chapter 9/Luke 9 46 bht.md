# Luke 9:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Amidst their journey, a debate arose among the disciples, occurring at the most inopportune moment. The dispute was not one of degrees of glory or grace, but rather, it concerned who would hold the esteemed position of prime minister in the future kingdom they anticipated the Messiah would establish. This unfortunate contention and ambition among the disciples were only glimpses of the rivalries and jealousies that would later manifest themselves among them.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Had our narrative stood by itself, we should have understood it, as I do now, of a dispute which had taken place or was taking place, and which, though not actually spoken out before the Lord, was yet open to His discerning eye, so that not only the words, but the disputing of their thoughts, was known to Him."
2. "The idea of τὸ τίς ἂν εἴη μ. meaning that each one thought 'Who is greater than I?' is absurd enough."
3. "Still more absurd however is the harmonistic attempt of Greswell, to make two distinct events out of (1) the incident in Mark and Luke, and (2) that in Matthew."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 46-48. (See on  :-).

### Marvin Vincent:
1. A reasoning [διαλογισμος] . A debate or discussion. See on ch. Luke 24:38, and James 1:22; James 2:4.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They were afraid to ask Jesus about that subject, but Matthew 18:1 states that they came to Jesus to settle it."
2. "But Luke makes it plain that it was not an abstract problem about greatness in the kingdom of heaven as they put it to Jesus (Matthew 18:1), but a personal problem in their own group."
3. "Rivalries and jealousies had already come and now sharp words. By and by James and John will be bold enough to ask for the first places for themselves in this political kingdom which they expect (Mark 10:35; Matthew 20:20). It is a sad spectacle."

### John Gill:
1. "And this was in the way, as they were travelling from Caesarea Philippi, to Capernaum."
2. "Which of them should be greatest; that is, 'in the kingdom of heaven', as in Matthew 18:1 in the kingdom of the Messiah, which they expected would be a temporal one: wherefore the dispute was not about degrees in glory, nor in grace."
3. "But who should be prime minister to the king Messiah, when he should set up his monarchy in all its grandeur and glory."

### John Wesley:
1. And there arose a reasoning among them — This kind of reasoning always arose at the most improper times that could be imagined.
