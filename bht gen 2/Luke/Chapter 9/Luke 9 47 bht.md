# Luke 9:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, being aware of the disciples' pride and discussions, called for a little child to come to him and placed the child beside him. This simple act was not merely to illustrate a lesson in humility, but it also revealed that Jesus had full knowledge of their intentions and thoughts. The child, positioned in the midst of them and before them, was a physical representation of the innocence, vulnerability, and teachability that the disciples needed to embody.
