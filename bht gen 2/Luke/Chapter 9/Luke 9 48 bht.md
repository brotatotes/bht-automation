# Luke 9:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus teaches that true greatness in the kingdom of heaven is not about seeking positions of power or authority, but rather about humbling oneself and serving others. When we welcome and care for the helpless and vulnerable, we are actually receiving Jesus himself. True greatness is not based on worldly standards, but rather on our humility and obedience to God's word. The one who is least in their own eyes and acts in humility is the one who is truly great in the eyes of God.
