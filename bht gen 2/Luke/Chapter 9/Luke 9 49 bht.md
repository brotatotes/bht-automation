# Luke 9:49 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples were embarrassed by their dispute concerning greatness and quickly changed the subject when they saw someone performing miracles in Jesus' name. However, this incident reveals their narrowness and pride, as they forbade the man because he did not belong to their group. They failed to recognize that he was doing the work of the Master in the Master's name and with His power, even though he didn't run with their chosen circle of disciples. This passage condemns the exclusive mindset that looks down upon those who worship God in different ways or belong to different sects.
