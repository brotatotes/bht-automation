# Luke 9:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When encountering those who do not receive you, Jesus instructs his disciples to shake off the very dust from their feet, signifying a clear and intentional separation. This act serves as a testimony against those who reject the message of the disciples, as it symbolizes the consequences of their refusal. Refusing to provide lodging or entertainment is also seen as a disadvantage and further emphasizes the seriousness of rejecting the disciples.
