# Luke 9:50 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Sometimes, what may appear to be against us is actually working in our favor. We should refrain from prohibiting others, or ourselves, from carrying out works in the name of Christ. The lesson here is to acknowledge that those who do not oppose us are actually on our side. This proverbial saying gives us insight into the need for tolerance when it comes to different approaches to serving Christ. In both parts of the saying, the focus is on not obstructing the efforts of those who align with our cause.
