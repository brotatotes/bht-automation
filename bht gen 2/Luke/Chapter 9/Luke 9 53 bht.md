## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Galileans, in going to the festivals at Jerusalem, usually took the Samaritan route and yet seem to have met with no such inhospitality."
2. "If they were asked to prepare quarters for the Messiah, in the person of one whose 'face was as though He would go to Jerusalem,' their national prejudices would be raised at so marked a slight upon their claims."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They did not receive him - Did not entertain him hospitably, or receive him with kindness."
2. "Because his face was ... - Because they ascertained that he was going to Jerusalem."
3. "Had he decided the question in that way, they would have received him as the Messiah gladly; but when they saw that he was going among the Jews - that 'by going' he would decide in their favor, they resolved to have nothing to do with him, and they rejected him."

### John Calvin:
1. "He steadfastly set his face. By this expression Luke has informed us that Christ, when he had death before his eyes, rose above the fear of it, and went forward to meet it..." 
2. "For if no dread, no difficulty, no struggle, no anxiety, had been present to his mind, what need was there that he should set his face steadfastly?"

3. "It was reason enough to the churlish Samaritans."

### John Gill:
