# Luke 9:54 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples, known as the sons of thunder, witnessed an insult or refusal to welcome Jesus into a village. In their fervent zeal, they desired to invoke fire from heaven to punish those who offended Jesus. This incident may have been influenced by the presence of Elijah on the Mount of Transfiguration, reminding them of a similar event in 2 Kings 1:10-12. Despite their readiness to exercise their power, they wisely sought permission from Jesus before taking any action. This moment serves as a reminder of the fiery zeal of the disciples and the need for discernment before enacting judgment.
