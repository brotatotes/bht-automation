# Luke 9:56 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Son of Man, illustrating His own divine saying, came not to destroy lives but to save them, as seen in His miracles of salvation. He demonstrated patience and forgiveness towards those who opposed Him, and we should imitate His spirit in dealing with opposition. It is unlikely that our Lord did not go further into Samaria after being rejected, but it is possible.
