# Luke 9:57 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A certain man, identified as a scribe by Matthew, expressed his determination to follow Jesus wherever he goes. The phrase wheresoever thou goest is a Greek idiom denoting complete commitment and devotion. Luke's account suggests that this conversation may have taken place out of chronological order, but it still highlights the intensity of the man's desire. Jesus, fully aware of the man's enthusiasm, recognizes the depth of his commitment.
