# Luke 9:59 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
One of the disciples, who had been following Jesus for some time, was called by Him to become a minister. In this encounter, Jesus directed His words to another person, showing His interaction with different individuals. The disciple grappled with the challenge of prioritizing his duties, as each responsibility presented its own importance. While honoring his obligations to his father, it seems that his father was still alive, making the urgency of the call to discipleship a pressing matter.
