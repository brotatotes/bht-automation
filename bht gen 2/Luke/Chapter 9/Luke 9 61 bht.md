# Luke 9:61 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage reminds us of the importance of fully committing ourselves to Christ. Just as Elisha left his plow and bid farewell to his family, this man sought to prioritize his worldly affairs before following Jesus. However, Jesus reminds us that discipleship requires immediate and wholehearted devotion. The man's request to bid farewell to those in his house reflects his attachment to the world, and Jesus calls him to prioritize the Kingdom of God over worldly attachments and responsibilities.

3. "The best illustration of which is that of those Hindu converts of our day who, when once persuaded to leave their spiritual fathers in order to 'bid them farewell which are at home at their house,' very rarely return to them."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jesus did not suffer this, because he probably saw that he would be influenced by a love of his friends, or by their persuasions, not to return to him."
2. "The purpose to be a Christian requires 'decision.' Men should not tamper with the world. They should not consult earthly friends about it. They should not even allow worldly friends to give them 'advice' whether to be Christians or not."
3. "God is to be obeyed rather than man, and they should come forth boldly, and resolve at once to give themselves to his service."

2. "Hence to dismiss one with orders."
3. "In the New Testament the word is used invariably in the sense of bidding farewell."

### John Calvin:
1. "It appears that he was too strongly attached to the world, to be ready and prepared to follow Christ."
2. "This is the true reason why Christ reproves him so severely: for, while he was professing in words that he would be a follower of Christ, he turned his back upon him, till he had despatched his worldly business."

2. "He also had something that was to come 'first.'"
3. "In itself that was a good thing to do. It is thus a formal function and this man meant to go home and set things in order there and then in due time to come and follow Jesus."

### John Gill:
1. "He moves it himself, to be a disciple of his, and a preacher of his Gospel, only with this condition."
2. "The phrase not only signifies that he desired to take leave of his friends, but to compose and set in order his family affairs, and dispose of his worldly effects among his domestics, relations, and friends, in the best manner he could; and then he should have leisure, and be at liberty to follow Christ, and attend his service."

1. "Suffer me first to bid them farewell that are in my house"
