# Mark 1:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Gospel of Jesus Christ begins with the ministry of John the Baptist, as he played a significant role in preparing the way for Christ. The purpose of this Gospel is not to recount the genealogy and early life of Jesus, but rather to focus on his ministry, miracles, sufferings, and death. The Gospel itself is found in the rest of the book, as it unfolds the good news of Jesus and his redemptive work.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This is probably a title to what follows, as Matthew 1:1, and not connected with Mark 1:4, as Fritzsche and Lachm., nor with Mark 1:2, as Meyer."
2. "If the genit. after εὐαγγ. is not a person, it is always that of the object, as εὐαγγ. τῆς βασιλείας, τῆς σωτηρίας κ.τ.λ."
3. "Here it decides for the latter (Mar 1:2-8). Render therefore, the glad tidings concerning Jesus Christ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The abruptness with which he announces his subject... have often been noticed as characteristic of this Gospel" 
2. "wherever the finer and subtler feelings of humanity, or the deeper and more peculiar hues of our Lord's character were brought out, these... are sure to be found here, and in touches of such quiet delicacy and power"
3. "These few opening words of the Second Gospel are enough to show... he recognized in Him, in common with the Fourth Evangelist, the glory of the Only-begotten of the Father."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'gospel' here has reference rather to the preaching of John, an account of which immediately follows, and means the beginning of the good news, or annunciation respecting the Messiah."
2. "The Son of God - This title was used here to attract attention, and secure the respect of those who should read the gospel."
3. "The history, therefore, 'commands' respect."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Beginning without the article, showing that the expression is a kind of title."
2. "It is 'the beginning, not of his book, but of the facts of the Gospel."
3. "He shows from the prophets that the Gospel was to begin by the sending forth of a forerunner."

### John Calvin:
1. "For the Law and the Prophets then came to an end... 'The Law and the Prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached.'"
2. "The Gospel was not an inferior appendage to the Law, but a new form of instruction, by which the former was set aside."
3. "Hence we infer, that the abrogation of the Law, and the beginning of the Gospel, strictly speaking, took place when John began to preach."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The beginning of the gospel. This is regarded by some as the title of the whole book: here begins the Gospel."
2. "The Son of God. Matthew (Matthew 1:1), writing for the Jews, says: ‘the Son of David, the Son of Abraham.'"


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The beginning (αρχη). There is no article in the Greek. It is possible that the phrase served as a heading or title for the paragraph about the ministry of the Baptist or as the superscription for the whole Gospel (Bruce) placed either by Mark or a scribe."
2. "And then the Gospel of Jesus Christ means the Message about Jesus Christ (objective genitive). The word Gospel here (ευαγγελιον) comes close to meaning the record itself as told by Mark."
3. "The Son of God (Hυιου θεου). Aleph 28, 255 omit these words, but B, D, L, have them and the great mass of the manuscripts have υιου του θεου. If this is a heading added to what Mark wrote, the heading may have existed early in two forms, one with, one without 'Son of God.' If Mark wrote the words, there is no reason to doubt the genuineness since he uses the phrase elsewhere."

### John Gill:
1. "The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ....this narrative Mark was about to write, began with the ministry of John the Baptist, and of Christ; which was a Gospel one, and was the beginning of the Gospel dispensation."
2. "The design of this evangelist, is not to give an account of the genealogy of Christ, of his conception and birth, of what befell him in his infancy...but to give an account of his ministry and miracles, sufferings and death."
3. "Mark begins his account of the Gospel...with the same article of the divine sonship of Christ...without which he could not be an able Saviour, nor the true Messiah."

### John Wesley:
1. "The beginning of the Gospel is in the account of John the Baptist."
2. "The evangelist speaks with strict propriety."
3. "The Gospel itself is in the rest of the book."
