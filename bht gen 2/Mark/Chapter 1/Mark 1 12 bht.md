# Mark 1:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As soon as Jesus was baptized and acknowledged as the Son of God, the Spirit immediately led him into the wilderness. This same Spirit that had descended on him at his baptism remained with him and guided him throughout his earthly life. It was not the evil spirit Satan who tempted him, but rather the Spirit who led him to be tempted by the devil. Just as in the case of Jesus, when we experience extraordinary favor from God, we should also expect to face extraordinary temptations.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The place is unknown. Tradition fixes it near Jericho, in the neighborhood of the Quarantania, the precipitous face of which is pierced with ancient cells and chapels..." 
2. "Dr. Tristram says that every spring a few devout Abyssinian Christians are in the habit of coming and remaining here for forty days, to keep their Lent on the spot where they suppose that our Lord fasted and was tempted."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Straightway. The same favorite word as in Mark 1:10. The E. V. uses seven different words to represent this one Greek word, which may always be rendered ‘straightway.’"
2. "The spirit driveth him forth. Comp. Matthew 4:1. The expression here used is stronger than ‘led up’ (Matthew), ‘led’ (Luke)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Driveth him forth (αυτον εκβαλλε). Vivid word, bolder than Matthew's 'was led up' (ανηχθη) and Luke's 'was led' (ηγετο)."
2. "The forty days in the wilderness were under the direct guidance of the Holy Spirit."
3. "The entire earthly life of Jesus was bound up with the Holy Spirit from his birth to his death and resurrection."

### John Gill:
1. "As soon as he was baptized, and this testimony had been given of his divine sonship, the very selfsame day, the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness."
2. "It was the same Spirit that descended on him at his baptism, which remained with him; by whose impulse he was moved, though not against his will, to go into this desert and forlorn place."
3. "For this was not the evil spirit Satan, by whom he was tempted; for Matthew expressly says, that he was 'led up of the Spirit—to be tempted by the devil', where the devil that tempted him is manifestly distinguished from the Spirit by whom he was led."

### John Wesley:
1. "So in all the children of God, extraordinary manifestations of his favour are wont to be followed by extraordinary temptations."
