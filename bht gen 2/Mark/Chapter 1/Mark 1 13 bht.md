# Mark 1:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Being in the wilderness for forty days, Jesus was exposed to the harsh conditions and wild animals that inhabited the region. The presence of these beasts, emphasized by Mark, adds to the unease of the scene. However, it is worth noting that these creatures were unable to harm Jesus, reflecting his lordship over them, similar to Adam's dominion in the Garden of Eden. Such a detail, unique to Mark, provides a valuable insight into Christ's experience during his temptations.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. With the wild beastsPeculiar to Mark. The region just alluded to abounds in boars, jackals, wolves, foxes, leopards, hyenas, etc.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "With the wild beasts. A graphic touch peculiar to Mark, enhancing the horror of the scene."
2. "Possibly a hint of His lordship over animals, who could not hurt or flee from Him: or an allusion to the second Adam as the restorer of Paradise."
3. "Ministered. Probably with food (comp. Matthew 4:11). The fasting, though not mentioned, is thus implied."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It was the haunt at night of the wolf, the boar, the hyena, the jackal, the leopard."
2. "Swete notes that in Psalms 90:13 the promise of victory over the wild beasts comes immediately after that of angelic guardianship cited by Satan in Matthew 4:6."
3. "But we are all tempted of the devil in the city even worse than in the desert."

### John Gill:
1. "This circumstance is only related by the Evangelist Mark, and is what adds to the uncomfortable situation Christ was in, when tempted by Satan..."
2. "...being the Lord of them, as Adam in Eden's garden, or Daniel in the lions' den."
3. "These creatures were more gentle to Christ and used him better than the wicked Jews, among whom he dwelt..."

### John Wesley:
1. "And he was there forty days, tempted by Satan — Invisibly."
2. "He was with the wild beasts — Though they had no power to hurt him."
3. "St. Mark not only gives us a compendium of St. Matthew's Gospel, but likewise several valuable particulars, which the other evangelists have omitted."
