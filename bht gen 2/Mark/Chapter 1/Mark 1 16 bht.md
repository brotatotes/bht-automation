# Mark 1:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Jesus walked by the sea of Galilee, He saw Simon Peter and Andrew casting a net into the sea, for they were skilled fishermen. This glimpse into the action of Christ shows His engagement with people in their daily lives. The brothers, Simon and Andrew, were partners in fishing and used nets to make casts and haul in their catch from the sea. It is through this encounter that Jesus called them to become fishers of men, leaving their nets behind and following Him.
