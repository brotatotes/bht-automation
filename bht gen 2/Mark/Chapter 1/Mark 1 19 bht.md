# Mark 1:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Jesus continued on, he went a little further and observed James the son of Zebedee and his brother John. These two were fishermen who were in the process of mending their nets, preparing for their next fishing excursion. Their focus was on repairing their nets so they could use them again for the same purpose of catching fish. It is worth noting that James would later be executed by Herod, while John would become the beloved disciple.
