# Mark 1:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the disciples responded to Jesus' call, they not only left their boat behind but also the responsibility of their father and the hired servants. The presence of the hired servants indicates that Zebedee was a prosperous fisherman and would not be left without support. The disciples willingly abandoned their familial duties and economic stability to heed the call of Jesus. This decision required great sacrifice, as seen in the example of young preachers who, by answering God's call, often place additional burdens on their families who have come to rely on their contributions.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "μετὰ τῶν μισθ. is inserted for particularity, and perhaps to soften the leaving their father alone."
2. "It gives us a view of the station of life of Zebedee and his sons; they were not poor fishermen, but had hired servants."
3. "Now may we not venture to say that both these accounts came from Peter originally?"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. With the hired servantsPeculiar to Mark. It may imply that Zebedee carried on his business on a larger scale than ordinary fishermen.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "With the hired servants. Peculiar to Mark. Zebedee was not poor, and was not left helpless by this act of his sons."
2. "Went after him, not simply ‘followed Him’ (Matt. and Luke). The great particularity of the brief account suggests that Peter himself told Mark the story."
3. "Peter being an eye-witness throughout."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They left the boat and their father with the hired servants." 
2. "The business would go on while they left all and became permanent followers of Jesus."
3. "Not the least of the sacrifices made in the education of young preachers is that made by the home folks who have additional burdens to bear because the young preacher is no longer a bread-winner at home."

### John Gill:
1. "It might seem unnatural, had they left their father alone in the ship, to have taken the care and management of it, and therefore it is added, 'with the hired servants'; who were hired for that purpose."
2. "And such was the power that went along with Christ's call, that notwithstanding natural affection to their parents, and the gain they might get by these servants and their trade, they cheerfully quitted all, and followed Christ."
