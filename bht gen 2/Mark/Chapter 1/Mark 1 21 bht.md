As soon as Jesus entered Capernaum on the Sabbath day, He went straight to the synagogue, where the people gathered to hear the law read and be instructed in divine things. It was His custom to teach and preach in the synagogues, and He took advantage of this opportunity to proclaim the Gospel and teach them about the kingdom of God. His ministry in Capernaum had just begun, and His reputation had already preceded Him. This event marked the start of many miracles and teachings that would unfold during His time in this city.
