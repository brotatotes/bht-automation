# Mark 1:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The demons had no interest or connection with Jesus as their Savior since He came to demonstrate His power over them and deliver humanity from their grasp. His purpose was not to destroy them completely, but rather to either cast them out of people's bodies or confine them to the prison of hell for their punishment. Jesus was recognized by the demons as the Holy One of God, both in His divine nature as the Son of God and in His human nature as the sinless and pure one born of a virgin.
