# Mark 1:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When faced with the challenge of a possessed man, Jesus responds with authority and power. He does not allow the demons to testify to His identity, silencing their attempts to flatter Him. Jesus is not swayed by their words and refuses to leave the man alone. Instead, He demonstrates His true nature by casting out the demons. This authoritative power displayed by Jesus is imitated by others who claim to cast out demons. Through this act, Jesus reveals His sovereignty and asserts His authority over the spiritual realm.
