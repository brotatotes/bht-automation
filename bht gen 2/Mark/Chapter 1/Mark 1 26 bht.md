# Mark 1:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the evil spirits were cast out by Jesus, he refused to let them speak, regardless of whether they were speaking against or in favor of him. He knew that their testimony was unnecessary and would only serve to mislead, as some might think that he was in league with them. By silencing them, Jesus emphasized his complete authority over both the demonic world and the power of evil.
