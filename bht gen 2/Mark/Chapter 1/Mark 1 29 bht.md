# Mark 1:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After Jesus finished his sermon in the synagogue and performed this miracle, he, along with his disciples Simon and Andrew, left the synagogue and entered Simon's house. Andrew, who was present during the healing, was also a disciple of Jesus. This incident reveals both Jesus' compassion and his authority over sickness. The mention of these specific details, such as the number of witnesses and the location of the miracle, highlights the significance of this event in the Gospel accounts.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The mention of these four—which is peculiar to Mark—is the first of those traces of Peter's hand in this Gospel, of which we shall find many more."
2.

3. "Andrew being present on this occasion, as the occurrence took place in his own house."

### John Calvin:

2. "A single word, in Luke’s narrative, presents to us more strikingly the power which Christ displayed; for he says, that Simon’s mother-in-law was held by a GREAT fever."
