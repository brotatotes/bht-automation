# Mark 1:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Mark 1:31. Jesus entered the room where she was lying, and as an eyewitness, Mark describes how he took her by the hand in order to restore her. In doing so, the power of Christ flowed through him, and immediately the fever left her. Not only did she experience physical healing, but she also demonstrated her gratitude by arising from her bed, getting dressed, and actively assisting in preparing food for Jesus and his disciples. This act of service was a testament to the perfectness and immediateness of her cure, as well as her deep gratitude towards her Saviour and physician.
