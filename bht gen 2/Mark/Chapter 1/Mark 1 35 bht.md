# Mark 1:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Rising a great while before day, he left the house and the city, venturing out into a solitary place where he could be alone in the presence of his Father.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἔννυχα, acc. plur. neut. of ἔννυχος, as in the sing. σήμερον, αὔριον, νέον, &c., a form not so used in the classics."
2. "We have however πάννυχα, Soph. Ajax, 911."
3. "ἐξῆλθ. from the house of Peter and Andrew, Mark 1:29."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "His choosing this day to inaugurate a new and glorious stage of His public work, should be noted by the reader."
2. "He was about to begin His first preaching and healing circuit; and as on similar solemn occasions, He spent some time in special prayer, doubtless with a view to it."
3. "What would one not give to have been, during the stillness of those grey morning hours, within hearing... of His calm, exalted anticipations of the work which lay immediately before Him, and the outpourings of His soul about it into the bosom of Him that sent Him!"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. A great while before day (å̓́ííõ÷á)Lit., while it was in the night. The word is peculiar to Mark.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A proof of the independence of Mark, since Matthew does not give these details."
2. "Just as in Luke. 'Solitary place' really expresses the uninhabited character of the region referred to, but the word is usually rendered 'desert' Evidently near Capernaum."
3. "Our Lord’s example enjoins secret prayer. His work and prayer are closely connected. The punctilious observance of the Sabbath in Capernaum gave the people their rest, and yet must have abridged our Lord’s repose. Prayer with Him seems to have been not only intimate communion with His Father, but a necessary preparation for His ministry. How much more needful for us!"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Flight from the unexpected reality into which His ideal conception of His calling had brought Him." 
2. "Jesus seems to retreat before his sudden popularity, to prayer with the Father 'that he might not be ensnared by this popularity, or in any way induced to accept the ways of ease instead of duty.'"
3. "Surely many a popular preacher can understand this mood of Jesus when in the night he slips away to a solitary place for prayer."

### John Gill:
1. "he rose up very early while it was very much within the night, as the light and day were coming on, and before the day broke"
2. "he went out; out of the house of Simon and Andrew, and out of the city of Capernaum, leaving his disciples and friends behind him"
3. "and departed into a solitary place, and there he prayed; as man, to his God and Father; it may be for his disciples he had lately chosen; for himself, as man, that he might be strengthened as such for service; and for success in his ministry, and that his Gospel might run and be glorified"

### John Wesley:
1. Rising a great while before day — So did he labour for us, both day and night. Luke 4:42.
