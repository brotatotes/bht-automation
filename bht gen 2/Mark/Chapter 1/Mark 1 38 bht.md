# Mark 1:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Recognizing the need to fulfill his mission and reach a wider audience, Jesus made the surprising decision to leave the eager crowds in Capernaum and journey to the neighboring towns and villages. These suburban areas, encompassing places with synagogues, presented opportunities to extend his teachings beyond a single location. Jesus understood that his purpose went beyond Capernaum, as he was sent by God to preach the Gospel throughout Judea. This intentional decision showcased his desire to spread the word and bless others by seeking them out, even while they sought him.
