# Mark 1:40 Commentary Help Text

A leper, full of leprosy, approached Jesus, kneeling down in submission, respect, and reverence, recognizing Jesus' power to make him clean if He willed. As Matthew and Luke explain, this man's condition was severe and likely deemed incurable.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. Mark 1:40.  A leper. See on Matthew 8:2. The variations from that account are only in the choice of words and the omission of ‘Lord’ here.
	

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Kneeling down to him  (κα γονυπετων). Picturesque detail omitted by some MSS. Luke 5:12 has "fell on his face." 

### John Gill:
1. "This man was full of leprosy, as Luke says, and very probably deemed incurable."
2. "Kneeling down to him; in token of submission, respect, and reverence, and to worship him."
