# Mark 1:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The man with leprosy was solemnly charged by Jesus, who perceived his disobedient spirit. Leprosy is often linked to sin, making it a symbol of the evils sin brings. By commanding the man to report to the priests and prohibiting him from sharing his healing, Jesus aligned with Mosaic regulations, seeking to calm excitement and avoid needless opposition. Sin was the usual cause of leprosy, as seen in the cases of Miriam, Gehazi, and Uzziah. This miraculous cure laid upon the man an obligation to avoid sin in the future.
