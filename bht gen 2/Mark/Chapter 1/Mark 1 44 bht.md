# Mark 1:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus healed the leper, he commanded him to go directly to the priests as a testimony of his cleanliness. This action would serve as undeniable proof for the priests and render them without excuse if they rejected Jesus as the minister of God. By fulfilling the requirements of the law and offering the prescribed sacrifices, the leper would provide evidence of his healing. While Jesus instructed him not to tell anyone, this charge served as a means to ensure his formal declaration of purity and to condemn the priests if they refused to recognize the miraculous work of God.

3. "In a word, if they were not past cure, they might be led to Christ; while, on the other hand, so solemn a testimony of God was sufficiently powerful to condemn them, if they were unbelievers."

### Philip Schaff:

### John Wesley:
1. "If he has made us clean from our leprosy of sin, we are not commanded to conceal it. On the contrary, it is our duty to publish it abroad, both for the honour of our Benefactor, and that others who are sick of sin may be encouraged to ask and hope for the same benefit." 
2. "The priests seeing him, pronouncing him clean, Leviticus 13:17,23,28,37, and accordingly allowing him to offer as Moses commanded, Leviticus 14:2,7, was such a proof against them, that they durst never say the leper was not cleansed."
3. "This is one great reason why our Lord commanded this man to say nothing."
