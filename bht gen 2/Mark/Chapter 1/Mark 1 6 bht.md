# Mark 1:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Mark 1:6, John the Baptist is described as wearing clothing made of camels' hair, which was actually rough cloth woven from camel's hair. John's choice of attire indicates his simplicity and detachment from the luxuriousness of the world. Additionally, the mention of locusts and wild honey refers to John's diet, which was simple yet sustainable. The wild honey was abundant in the clefts of the rocks, and some Bedouins even made a living by gathering it. Overall, John's clothing and diet reflect his humble and devoted lifestyle.
