# Mark 1:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
John the Baptist expressed through his words that he considered himself unworthy to perform the most humble act of unfastening the latchet of Jesus' sandals. This expression signifies the deep veneration John had for Jesus, recognizing his own insignificance compared to the greatness of Jesus' person, office, and work. Through this statement, John humbly acknowledged that he was not deserving of the high honor bestowed upon him as the messenger and forerunner of the Messiah.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The expression is common to Mark, Luke, and John. It amounts to the same as bearing the shoes, for he who did the last would necessarily be also employed in loosing and taking off the sandal." 
2. "But the variety is itself indicative of the independence of Matt. and Mark of one another."
 
3. "κύψας is added by Mark, who, as we shall find, is more minute in circumstantial detail than the other Evangelists."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. To stoop downCompare to bear; Matthew 3:11.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The denunciation and warning recorded by Matthew (Matthew 3:7-12) and Luke (Luke 3:7-14) are omitted by Mark, who merely gives the sum of John’s preaching as a forerunner of the Messiah."
2. "It is his peculiarity to mention gestures. The perfect independence of the Evangelists thus appears."
3. "Nothing could more vividly depict to an eastern audience the inferiority of John the Baptist to the Messiah, than these words."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Mightier than I (ο ισχυροτερος μου). In each of the Synoptics." 
2. "Gould calls it a skeptical depreciation of himself by John. But it was sincere on John's part and he gives a reason for it." 
3. "The Latchet (τον ιμαντα). The thong of the sandal which held it together. When the guest comes into the house, performed by a slave before one enters the bath. Mark alone gives this touch."

### John Gill:
1. "From whence it appears, that John was a preacher of Jesus Christ; of the dignity of his person, the excellency of his office, and the nature and importance of his work..."
2. "The latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose; expressing the great veneration he had for him, and the great sense he had of his own unworthiness..."
3. "...that he was far from being worthy of the high honour done him, to be his messenger and forerunner..."

### John Wesley:
1. The latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose — That is, to do him the very meanest service.
