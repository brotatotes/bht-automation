# Mark 1:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The water baptism performed by John served as a symbolic representation of the spiritual baptism to be administered by Jesus. While John baptized with water, Jesus would baptize with the Holy Ghost. The day of Pentecost, as recorded in Acts 2, marked the fulfillment of this prophecy, as the Apostles were baptized with the Holy Ghost. This spiritual baptism was a profound experience, far surpassing the water baptism that John had administered.
