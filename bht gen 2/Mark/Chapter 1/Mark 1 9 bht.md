# Mark 1:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, having completed his ministry in Nazareth, journeyed to the wilderness where John was preaching and baptizing. He humbly approached John, requesting to be baptized in the Jordan River. The act of baptism symbolized Jesus' submission and identification with humanity, as he entered the waters just as countless others had done before him. It was in this humble act that Jesus' mission was affirmed and inaugurated, establishing his divine purpose on earth.
