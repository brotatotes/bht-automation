# Mark 10:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus' private teaching on marriage and divorce was crucial for the disciples, as they were tasked with spreading new teachings to elevate women. The Pharisees were unfamiliar with these concepts and did not fully understand them. The disciples sought a private conversation with Jesus to gain a deeper understanding to effectively teach others. Unfortunately, some women who have benefited from these elevated teachings are unknowingly working against them, leading to the potential degradation of their own gender.
