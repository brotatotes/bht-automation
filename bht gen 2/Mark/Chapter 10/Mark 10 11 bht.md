# Mark 10:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When someone divorces their spouse and marries another without any wrongdoing or unfaithfulness, they commit adultery against their lawful wife. This act not only harms their wife but also tarnishes the sanctity of their marriage. It is important to note that some versions of the Bible exclude the phrase against her when discussing this matter. However, it remains clear that divorcing a spouse and remarrying without legitimate grounds is considered adultery.
