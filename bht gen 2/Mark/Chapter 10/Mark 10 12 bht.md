# Mark 10:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Mark's unique account of this incident presents the woman as the one initiating the divorce, deviating from the usual practice. This discrepancy may have originated from Mark's source material or aimed to cater to a Gentile audience. While the Mosaic law did not permit women to dissolve marriages, historical evidence suggests that such occurrences were not unheard of during that time. For instance, Justin Martyr mentioned a Christian woman who issued a bill of divorce to her husband. Understanding these cultural nuances enhances our comprehension of the complications surrounding divorce in the context of Jesus' teachings.
