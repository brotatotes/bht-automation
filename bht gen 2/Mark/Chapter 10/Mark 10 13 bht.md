# Mark 10:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The incident in Matthew 19:13 aligns with the discussion on the sanctity of marriage. People who had heard of Jesus' reputation as a great prophet and holy man brought their children to him, hoping for his touch. The disciples, engaged in their own deep conversations, rebuked those who brought the children, seeing it as an interruption. However, this act of bringing children to Jesus was a sincere, natural response and not motivated by any concerns of baptism or salvation.
