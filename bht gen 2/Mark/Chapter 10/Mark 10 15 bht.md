# Mark 10:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To enter the kingdom of God, one must approach it with the humility and meekness of a little child, setting aside all pride and prejudice. It means recognizing our unworthiness and relying on God's grace. This childlike disposition involves trusting and obeying God simply and lovingly. It is not a matter of being a child in years, but rather having the childlike faith that accepts the promises of God, knowing that His grace will not fail, even when our faith falters.
