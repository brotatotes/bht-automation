# Mark 10:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, Jesus responds to the young man's address of him as good in order to lead him towards a true understanding of his goodness and deity. Jesus is not denying his own goodness or disclaiming his deity. Rather, he uses the language of the Pharisees and the man himself to illustrate the impossibility of attaining eternal life through the keeping of the commandments. Jesus aims to guide the young man towards a genuine knowledge of him and his goodness, ultimately revealing the exclusive path to eternal life.
