# Mark 10:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To understand this passage, it's important to recognize that the young man was likely familiar with the commandments given by God to Moses on Mount Sinai. However, his understanding of these commandments seemed to lack depth and spirituality. One of the commandments mentioned, Do not defraud, is unique to Mark's account and highlights the importance of not wronging others in their possessions. This interaction serves as a reminder that no one can perfectly follow the law, and it underscores that eternal life cannot be attained solely through adherence to commandments, but rather through faith and grace.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Mark here takes exactly the commandments of the second table, Î¼á½´ á¼€Ï€Î¿ÏƒÏ„. standing for the tenth."
2. "Matt. adds their summary (á¼€Î³Î±Ï€. Ï„. Ï€Î»Î·ÏƒÎ¯Î¿Î½ ÏƒÎ¿Ï… á½¡Ï‚ ÏƒÎµÎ±Ï…Ï„.), omitting (with Luke) Î¼á½´ á¼€Ï€Î¿ÏƒÏ„., perhaps on account of Î¼á½´ ÎºÎ». having gone before."

### Philip Schaff:
1. Mark 10:19.  Do not defraud. This probably answers to the tenth commandment Matthew gives the sum of the second table of the law. See on Matthew 19:18-19.
	

### John Gill:
1. "Thou knowest the commandments,.... Which God gave to Moses on Mount Sinai; these the Jews taught their children; so that this young man might reasonably be thought to know what, and how many they were, though he was ignorant of the extent and spirituality of them."
2. "There is one precept, 'defraud not', wrong no man of his property, either by force or fraud, which none of the other evangelists have."
3. "If men fail short in keeping the lesser commands, it can hardly be thought they should be perfect in the observance of greater ones; and so consequently, and which is our Lord's drift, eternal life is never to be obtained by the works of the law."
