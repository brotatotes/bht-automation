# Mark 10:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Pharisees posed a question to Jesus in Mark 10:2 regarding divorce, with the intention of tempting Him and challenging His teachings. They sought to entangle Him by opposing the authority of Moses and exposing any inconsistencies in His doctrine. Their ulterior motive was to test Jesus' stance on divorce, possibly hoping that He would be stricter than what was taught by Moses. Furthermore, the Pharisees were aware that Jesus had already spoken on the subject in Galilee. Therefore, their question was not motivated by genuine curiosity, but rather by a desire to trap Jesus in His response.
