# Mark 10:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus looked upon the young man and saw the potential for goodness in his heart, and out of His deep love for him, Jesus pointed out the one thing that was missing - a true love for God. For without the love of God, all religious practices are meaningless. Jesus urged the young man to abandon his attachment to worldly riches, which had become an idol in his life, and to give up everything for the sake of following Him.
