# Mark 10:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The rich young ruler's countenance fell, reflecting his deep sadness upon hearing Jesus' instruction to sell all his possessions. This sadness was akin to the gloomy and somber appearance of a lowering cloud. Jesus' demand demonstrated the need to embrace the cross of reproach, affliction, persecution, and death. Moreover, it forced the man to surrender his self-righteousness and worldly wealth, both of which he held dear.
