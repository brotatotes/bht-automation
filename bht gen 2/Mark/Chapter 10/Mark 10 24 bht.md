# Mark 10:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus's statement about the difficulty for the rich to enter the kingdom of God reveals the disciples' astonishment. They had expected the Messiah's kingdom to bring worldly grandeur and were perplexed by Jesus's seemingly harsh truth. However, Jesus softened the blow by affectionately addressing them as children. Wealth was seen as a sign of God's favor, making it almost inseparable from the trust placed in riches. Jesus's powerful imagery of a camel going through the eye of a needle emphasizes the nearly impossible task for a rich person to enter the kingdom.
