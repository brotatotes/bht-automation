# Mark 10:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples were completely astounded by Jesus' words, as their understanding of the correlation between wealth and trust in it made them realize the immense difficulty for someone rich to enter the kingdom of God. This impossibility extended beyond their expectations, leading them to question who, then, could possibly be saved.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The disciples were quite as well aware as we must be, if we deal truly with ourselves, that οἱ τὰ χρήματα ἔχοντες and οἱ πεποιθότες ἐπὶ χρήμασιν are too nearly commensurate, for the mind to be relieved of much of its dread at the solemn saying which preceded."
2. "Of the καί at the beginning of a question, Kühner remarks, on Xen. Mem. p. 117 (in Meyer) 'cum vi auctiva ita ponitur, ut is qui interrogat cum admiratione quadam alterius orationem excipere, ex eaque conclusionem ducere significetur qua alterius sententia confutetur.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Astonished out of measure. Driven out of their wonted state of mind, dismayed."
2. "Evidently they felt that having riches almost inevitably led to 'trusting in riches.'"
3. "Because the impossibility was thus extended, the question, Then who can be saved? was so natural."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Then who  (κα τις). Matthew 19:25 has Τις ουν. Evidently κα has here an inferential sense like ουν. 

### John Gill:
1. "They were still more amazed, their surprise increased exceedingly upon our Lord's using the above comparison."
2. "Which, in their apprehension, showed, that it was utterly impossible for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God."
3. "And they expressed their astonishment, saying, among themselves, who then can be saved?"
