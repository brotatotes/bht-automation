# Mark 10:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's grace is declared to be equal to an impossible task that is beyond human capabilities. This passage emphasizes the opposition to the love of money, regardless of one's social status. The desire for wealth can hinder the entrance into a kingdom that values humility and self-denial. It is not just the possession of wealth, but the desire for it that interferes with this process. The focus is on the transformative power of God, who can break through the barriers of wealth and lead individuals to surrender their reliance on material possessions.
