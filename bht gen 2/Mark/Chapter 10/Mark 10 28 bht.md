# Mark 10:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter spoke up and said, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee. This statement demonstrates the contrast between the disciples and the young man who was unwilling to give up his possessions. The disciples had willingly abandoned everything to follow Jesus, while the young man could not bring himself to do the same. Peter's words highlight the sacrifice they had made and perhaps indicate a desire to know what they would receive in return for their commitment. The disciples' sacrifice and devotion serve as an example for us to consider the cost of following Jesus wholeheartedly.
