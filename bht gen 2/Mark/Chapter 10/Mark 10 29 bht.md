# Mark 10:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Mark's Gospel, there is a passage not found in Matthew's account, which may be attributed to Mark's personal reluctance in facing suffering for the sake of the Gospel. This omission regards the future reward promised to Peter and the other disciples for their faithful following of Christ. However, Mark seeks to convey the message that sacrificing worldly possessions and relationships for the sake of the Gospel brings its own reward. While some versions exclude the word wife in this context, the majority of editions and translations include it.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "Mark perhaps inserts this in both places, in consequence of his own shrinking from suffering on account of the Gospel."
2. "He would guard others against his own mistake."

### John Gill:
1. "This evangelist omits what Matthew relates; that whereas Peter, and his fellow disciples had followed Christ in the present time, hereafter when he appeared in his glory, they should sit upon twelve thrones, and judge the twelve tribes of Israel."
2. "There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sister, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the Gospel's; for the sake of preaching, or professing Christ, and his Gospel."
3. "The word 'wife' is left out in the Vulgate Latin version, perhaps because it is not repeated in the following verse; but all copies, and other versions have it."
