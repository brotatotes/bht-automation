# Mark 10:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this situation, Jesus aptly redirects the conversation by posing another question about the teachings of Moses on divorces. By doing this, he moves the discussion away from tradition and Rabbinical nuances, and towards the authority of Divine law. Jesus prompts the people to recollect the words of Moses on divorces, encouraging them to examine the true essence of his teachings. This strategic shift illuminates Jesus' wisdom and prompts a reconsideration of the ideal state described in Genesis.
