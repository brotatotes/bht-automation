# Mark 10:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, foreseeing His impending passion, reveals that He will be handed over to the chief priests and scribes by the will of God and through the treachery of Judas, His disciple. This act of betrayal leads to His condemnation to death, carried out by the Jewish authorities. However, what sets this event apart is the involvement of the Gentiles, represented by Pontius Pilate, who will receive Jesus and play a role in His crucifixion. This fulfillment of prophecy demonstrates the divine orchestration behind Jesus' sacrifice, encompassing both the Jewish and Gentile nations in the fulfillment of God's plan.
