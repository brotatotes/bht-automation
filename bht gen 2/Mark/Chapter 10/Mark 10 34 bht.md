# Mark 10:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After being scourged and mocked, Jesus would endure the further humiliation of being spit upon by those who rejected and despised him. This sequence of events - the mocking, scourging, and spitting - underscores the cruel and indecent treatment that Jesus would face before his crucifixion. It is notable that the order in which these things were executed is mentioned, with Jesus being first scourged, then mocked, and finally spit upon. Such explicit details serve to emphasize the extent of the suffering and degradation Jesus would endure for the sake of humanity.
