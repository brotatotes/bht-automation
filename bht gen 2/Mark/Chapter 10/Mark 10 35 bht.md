# Mark 10:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The request made by the two brothers and their mother immediately followed the conversation about Christ's death. The brothers, possibly prompted by the recent promise of thrones, approached the subject with caution. They were either both in agreement with the request or their mother spoke on their behalf. The nature of the request was questionable, as seen in the cautious and hesitant manner in which it was presented.
