# Mark 10:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this particular instance, our Lord desires the disciples to articulate the specific thing they wished for before granting any assurances, although he was already well-aware of their desires. He makes a deliberate choice to have the request openly declared in front of everyone, even though he already knows what it is they are seeking. This highlights the significance he places on honest communication and the act of voicing our needs openly.
