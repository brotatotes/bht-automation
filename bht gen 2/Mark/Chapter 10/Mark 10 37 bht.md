# Mark 10:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples, perhaps influenced by their close relationship with Jesus, sought positions of honor and power in his future kingdom, asking to sit on his right and left hands in his glory. This request reveals their expectation of a grand Jewish world empire, one where they would hold esteemed positions of authority. They seemed to overlook Jesus' teachings about his imminent death and resurrection, disregarding such talk as mere pessimism. Their desires and hopes for worldly honor caused them to miss the true meaning of Jesus' words and the true nature of his kingdom.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The semblance of a plea for so presumptuous a request might possibly have been drawn from the fact that one of the two usually leaned on the breast of Jesus, or sat next Him at meals, while the other was one of the favored three."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They are looking for a grand Jewish world empire with apocalyptic features in the eschatological culmination of the Messiah's kingdom."
2. "That dream brushed aside all the talk of Jesus about his death and resurrection as mere pessimism."

### John Gill:
1. "Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory."
2. "They might conclude from his having lately promised to all the twelve, that when he should sit on his throne, they should sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
3. "They might understand [his rising from the dead] of some revival, or breaking forth of this glorious state."
