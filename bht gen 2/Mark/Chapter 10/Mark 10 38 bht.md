# Mark 10:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Sometimes, in our prayers, we may be ignorant petitioners, lacking the understanding of what we truly need or the path we are asking to walk on. We may be influenced by our own desires rather than the Spirit of God. Jesus gently reminds us that the journey to glory often involves suffering, both inwardly and outwardly. We must be willing to drink the cup of suffering and be baptized in the trials of life, just as Christ Himself did. In this way, we can follow His example and be prepared to face the challenges that come our way.
