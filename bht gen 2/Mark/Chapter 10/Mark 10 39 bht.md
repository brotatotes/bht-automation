# Mark 10:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostles, although honorable and faithful, lacked self-awareness and understanding of their own weaknesses and the magnitude of Christ's suffering. They failed to mention God's grace or rely on the strength of Christ, revealing their limited perspective. However, Jesus assured them that they would indeed experience suffering and be baptized with His baptism. This prediction provided them with comfort, reminding them that if they suffered with Him, there would also be a future glory awaiting them.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "James, he was the first of the apostles who was honored, and showed himself able to be baptized with his Master's baptism of blood."
2. "John... lived to be the victim, after all the rest had got to glory, of a bitter persecution in the evening of his days, for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ."
3. "And Jesus said unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized—No doubt this prediction, when their sufferings at length came upon them, cheered them with the assurance, not that they would sit on His right and left hand—but that 'if they suffered with Him, they should be also glorified together.'"

### John Gill:
1. "They were unacquainted with themselves; they were ignorant of their own weakness as well as of the greatness of the sufferings Christ should endure or even they should be called unto."
2. "Had they had a just notion of either, they would not have expressed themselves in this manner without any mention of the grace of God or any dependence on the strength of Christ."
3. "But that they should endure sufferings in some sort like to his for his sake as they both afterwards did."
