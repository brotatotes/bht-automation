# Mark 10:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The principle of distribution is different from what the petitioners assumed, as the glories of the heavenly state or eternal life are not given based on personal desires or requests. Eternal life is prepared only for those who seek it through faithful and righteous living, and it is bestowed upon them as a reward in the future. Therefore, it is essential to focus on seeking God's kingdom and diligently serving Him rather than seeking self-centered positions or recognition.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But to sit on My right hand and on My left hand is not Mine to give, save to them for whom it is prepared." The principle of distribution is quite different from what these petitioners supposed.
2. Our Lord does not deny the petition of James and John, or say they shall not occupy the place in His kingdom which they now improperly sought.
3. All we are sure of is, that their asking it was displeasing to Him "to whom all judgment is committed," and so was not fitted to gain their object, but just the reverse.

### John Gill:
1. "There being no such places in his kingdom in the sense they petitioned; and as for the glories of the heavenly state or eternal life, the gift of these was not to be settled now..."
2. "...though he had a power to give yet only to them who were given him of his Father and who were ordained to such happiness..."
3. "Christ does not say he had no power to give this honour, but only describes the persons to whom he should give it; and these being persons for whom it is prepared by his Father instead of destroying, proves their unity."

### John Wesley:
1. "Them who by patient continuance in well doing, seek for glory, and honour, and immortality."
2. "For these only eternal life is prepared."
3. "To these, only he will give it in that day; and to every man his own reward, according to his own labour."
