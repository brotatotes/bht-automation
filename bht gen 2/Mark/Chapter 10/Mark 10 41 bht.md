# Mark 10:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples, being displeased with James and John, were filled with wrath and anger towards them. This reaction can be understood as more than what is explicitly stated, as their response suggests a deep indignation towards James and John's actions. Despite the recent warnings against rivalry and the solemn teachings they received, the disciples still harbored a competitive spirit that fueled their resentful reactions. Their emotions were intense, and they were on the verge of openly quarrelling because of this incident.
