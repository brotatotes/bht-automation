# Mark 10:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who are considered to be in power, sometimes only in name, are reminded not to boast and seek superiority over one another. The behavior of exercising authority and lording over others is a characteristic of the pagan rulers who do not know God. They govern in a despotic and tyrannical manner, which is far from the example Christ has set for His followers.
