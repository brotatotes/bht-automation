# Mark 10:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Jesus went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people following Him, He encountered blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, who was sitting by the highway side begging. Bartimaeus was one of the two blind men mentioned in Matthew's account. The location of this event, the new Jericho, was situated about five miles west of the Jordan and fifteen miles east of Jerusalem. This encounter with Bartimaeus took place before Jesus entered Jericho, as Luke's account suggests. Bartimaeus had a regular place where he would often sit and beg for his livelihood.

3. "A blind beggar. He was probably begging as he sat, as the E. V. states, but the original does not necessarily mean this.
