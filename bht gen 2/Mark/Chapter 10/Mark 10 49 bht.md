# Mark 10:49 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers find comfort in their effectual calling, which reproves the reprovers and brings joy. They are assured of God's love and can expect all good things because they are called according to grace. This calling represents the priestly spirit that tries to hinder direct access to Christ, but the Gospel messengers bring cheer and encourage believers to embrace their calling and approach the Lord with confidence. The calling stands as a reminder of God's faithfulness and the predestined grace bestowed upon them before the world began.
