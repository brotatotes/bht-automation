## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Ῥαββουνί = רַבּוֹנִי, Master, or My Master, see ref. John."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Master (or my Master). The word is 'Rabboni' (as in John 20:10), the most respectful of the three titles, Rab, Rabbi, Rabboni." 
2. "That I may receive my sight, or, 'see again.' Not how or why, but the desire, which he believes the Lord can grant in the best way."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "That I should do (ποιησω). Neat Greek idiom with aorist subjunctive without ινα after θελεις." 
2. "Rabboni (Ραββουνε). The Aramaic word translated Lord (Kurie) in Matthew 20:33 and Luke 18:41. This very form occurs again in John 20:16."
3. "That I may receive my sight (ινα αναβλεψω). To recover sight (ανα-), see again. Apparently he had once been able to see. Here ινα is used though θελω is not (cf. Mark 10:35). The Messiah was expected to give sight to the blind (Isaiah 61:1; Luke 4:18; Luke 7:22)."

### John Gill:
1. "What means this vehement cry? what is it thou designest by mercy?"
2. "thou, great master in Israel, and Lord, of the whole world"
3. "my request to thee, and which thou, art, able to effect; is, that I might receive my sight"
