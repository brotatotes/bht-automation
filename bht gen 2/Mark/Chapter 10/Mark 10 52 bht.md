# Mark 10:52 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The power of Christ in restoring sight to Bartimaeus exemplifies the faith that made him whole, emphasizing his belief in Jesus as the Messiah. Similarly, before conversion, the people of God are spiritually blind, lacking discernment. After conversion, like Bartimaeus, they follow Christ in the way, enlightened and guided by Him as their leader and commander, acknowledging Him as the source of salvation.
