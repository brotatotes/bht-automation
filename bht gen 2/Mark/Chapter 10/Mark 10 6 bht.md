# Mark 10:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
From the beginning of the creation, the account given by Moses in Genesis reveals that there was no creation before what is described. Adam and Eve were the first couple, created by God as one male and one female. This union of a man and a woman in marriage was established without the possibility of polygamy or divorce. Adam and Eve were brought together as husband and wife, in a state of innocence, with no provision made for any other practices or usages.
