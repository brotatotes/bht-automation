# Mark 10:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When a man and a woman are joined in marriage, they become one flesh, a union that goes beyond mere physicality. This oneness is a reflection of God's original design, seen in the creation of Adam and Eve. In this union, the husband is called to love his wife as his own body, and there should be no separation except in the case of adultery. The two individuals become a single unit, bound together in a deep and intimate connection that should be cherished and nurtured until death.
