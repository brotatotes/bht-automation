# Mark 11:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Upon entering the scene, it becomes clear that the events take place in the close proximity of Bethphage and Bethany. These two locations are intertwined, as Bethphage extends from where Bethany concludes, ultimately leading to the city. While different accounts highlight various details, it is notable that the Vulgate Latin references only Bethany. It is said that Jesus sends out two of his disciples, with the possibility that they may be Peter and John. This particular event serves as a prelude to the subsequent happenings.
