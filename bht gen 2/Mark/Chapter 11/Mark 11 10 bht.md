This recognition of our Lord as the royal Messiah, clothed with majesty and authority, reveals the hope and expectation of the people. It is a strange mixture of truth and error, as they associate the kingdom with the long-awaited fulfillment of the promises to David. May this kingdom that has now come be prosperous, established, and endure forever, bringing glory and happiness to its King and all its subjects.
