# Mark 11:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The triumphal entry of Jesus into Jerusalem marked the beginning of a significant time in His ministry. As He entered the city, He immediately went into the temple, showing His concern for and authority over the house of God. After spending time inspecting the temple and addressing what needed correction, Jesus left the city and went to Bethany for the night. The events of that day had surely left the disciples wondering about the significance of it all. It was a day filled with power, authority, and purpose, setting the stage for what was to come.
