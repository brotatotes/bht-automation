# Mark 11:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The following day, in the early morning, Jesus and his twelve disciples departed from Bethany. As they arrived, Jesus, who had not eaten anything, grew hungry. It is clear from the events leading up to this point that there was a purpose for Jesus being here. The Triumphal Entry had occurred on the previous Sunday, setting the stage for what was to come. This was not simply a casual visit, but rather a significant moment in the fulfillment of God's plan.
