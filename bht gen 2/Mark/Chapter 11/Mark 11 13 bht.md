# Mark 11:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus came across a tree that, from a distance, appeared to be fruitful with its large and spreading leaves, giving the impression of abundant fruit. However, upon closer inspection, he found that the tree had no fruit at all, which was contrary to his expectations. It was not the proper season for figs, but the tree's early display of leaves had raised hope for a fruitful harvest. This encounter with the barren fig tree serves as a powerful symbol of the pretentious hypocrisy of the Jewish hierarchy, representing their failure to produce the expected fruit of righteousness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "and therefore promising fruit, which in the case of figs come before the leaves."
