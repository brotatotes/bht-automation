# Mark 11:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The story of the barren fig tree carries a significant message. It serves as a symbol not only for the Jewish people, who appeared religious but lacked genuine righteousness, but also for any outwardly pious person who talks about good works without truly fulfilling them. Just as the tree only produced talk without fruit, individuals who do not bear the fruits of righteousness will face divine judgment. In the end, they will be cast aside and condemned. The disciples, recognizing the weight of this teaching, carefully marked and preserved it as an essential lesson for all followers of Christ.

1. "This tree may not only be an emblem of the Jewish people, who made a great show of religion, and enjoyed a great many privileges; and from whom, speaking after the manner of men, the fruits of good works, righteousness, and holiness, might have been hoped and looked for; when instead thereof, there was nothing but talk about them." 
2. "Also of any outward professor of religion, who enjoying the means of grace, and making great pretensions to devotion and piety, it might be expected that he should do good works, well pleasing to God, and bring forth fruit to the glory of his name: whereas he only talks of good works, but does none."
3. "At the last day, he will be cast as dry wood, as a withered branch, into everlasting burnings, being fit fuel for them."
