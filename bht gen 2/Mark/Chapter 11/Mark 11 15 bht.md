# Mark 11:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus entered the temple and began to cast out those who bought and sold there, causing chaos as he overthrew the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves. The ones involved in these transactions were individuals who traded lambs, sheep, oxen, and doves for various purposes such as the Passover and other religious ceremonies. Specifically, the tables of the money changers, who exchanged different types of currency, were overturned. This incident is also mentioned in Luke 19:45 and has implications for understanding a similar event in John 2:14.
