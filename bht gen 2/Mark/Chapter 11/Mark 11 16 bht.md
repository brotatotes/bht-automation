# Mark 11:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our Lord had strong notions about holiness and the respect that should be given to places dedicated to God. He did not allow anyone to carry a vessel through the temple, including the outer court that served as a thoroughfare. Even the use of the temple as a shortcut was not tolerated, as Jesus had a strict and severe approach to maintaining the sanctity of the temple.

"...it was agreeable to one of their own canons; for they say, 'a man may not go into the mountain of the house, with his staff (in his hands); nor with shoes (on his feet); nor with his girdle, and his money in it; nor with a bag thrown over his shoulders; nor with dust upon his feet; nor might he make it a thoroughfare, and much less spit in it.'"

### John Wesley:

2. "And of the regard due to those places (as well as times) that are peculiarly dedicated to God."
