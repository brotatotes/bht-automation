# Mark 11:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus denounced the abuse of His Father's house, proclaiming it as a house of prayer for all nations. He exercised Messianic authority in challenging the business and political corruption that invaded the realm of morals and religion. Despite objections, Jesus fearlessly exposed the buyers, sellers, money changers, and priests who exploited His Father's house for personal gain. His actions resonated with the prophecies of Isaiah and Jeremiah, calling for a house of prayer to be a sanctuary for all people, including the Gentiles who sought to worship sincerely.
