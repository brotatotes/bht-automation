# Mark 11:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The religious leaders, both Sadducees and Pharisees, were united in their determination to eliminate Jesus. They feared the impact of his teachings and the potential for him to make substantial changes, which would threaten their authority, reputation, and profits. The people, on the other hand, marveled at Jesus' doctrine and were astounded by both the content and the authoritative manner in which he taught. The fear of a potential uprising prevented the religious leaders from arresting Jesus openly, as they were wary of the public's admiration and support for him.
