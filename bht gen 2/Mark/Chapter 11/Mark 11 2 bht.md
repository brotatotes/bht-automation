# Mark 11:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus instructs his disciples to go into the village and, upon entering it, they will find a colt tied up at one of the first houses. This colt, which had never been ridden before, is significant because it adds to the marvel of Jesus choosing to ride on it. It was uncommon to use animals for sacred purposes that had not previously been put to work. Thus, Jesus intentionally selecting this unbroken colt speaks volumes about his authority and purpose.
