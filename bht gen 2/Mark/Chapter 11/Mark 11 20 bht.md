# Mark 11:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Passing by the fig tree in the morning, they were astonished to see it completely dried up from the roots. Not a single part of the tree remained alive - not its tender branches, not its trunk, and not even its roots. This drastic withering of the tree proclaimed its total death, signifying that it would never bear fruit again.
