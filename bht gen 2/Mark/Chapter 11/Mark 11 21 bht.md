# Mark 11:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples were amazed at how quickly the fig tree withered away. It was not just the physical appearance of the tree, but rather the connection they made between Jesus' words and the tree's demise that astonished them. Peter, with his quick memory, remembered that Jesus had cursed the tree, and it seemed as if Peter was almost blaming Jesus for what had happened. This event served as a powerful demonstration of the authority and power that Jesus possessed.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Master, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away—so connecting the two things as to show that he traced the death of the tree entirely to the curse of his Lord."
2. "Matthew gives this simply as a general exclamation of surprise by the disciples 'how soon' the blight had taken effect."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Calling to remembrance. Peter himself probably informed Mark of the circumstance. This minute detail, implying an interval, confirms the view that Mark gives the more exact account."
2. "Which thou cursedst. The language of Peter; yet our Lord’s act was a curse, i.e., a judicial word and act of condemnation (see on Matthew 21:19)."
3. "That it was judicial and just, not passionate and wanton, is evident not only from the character of our Lord, but from the lessons He connects with it Mark, who inserts Peter’s language, which might be misunderstood, alone tells us about forgiving (Mark 11:25)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Peter calling to remembrance (αναμνησθεις ο Πετρος). First aorist participle, being reminded. Only in Mark and due to Peter's story."
2. "For his quick memory see also Mark 14:72."
3. "It almost sounds as if Peter blamed Jesus for what he had done to the fig tree."

### John Gill:
1. "Not so much the tree, and its spreading leaves, and the greatness of it, and the flourishing condition it was in, the other day, as the imprecation of Christ upon it"
2. "which he observed, as matter of astonishment, and as an instance of Christ's surprising power and authority"
