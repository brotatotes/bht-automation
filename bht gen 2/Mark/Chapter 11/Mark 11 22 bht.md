# Mark 11:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Have faith in God reminds us to rely on the divine power that is available to us. This faith is not limited to a specific circumstance but has a broad application. It is a call to trust in God as the source of our strength and confidence. When we have faith in God, we can approach any situation with the assurance that He is able to provide and empower us. Just as Jesus taught his disciples to have faith, we too can trust in the unchanging character of God, His faithfulness, and His ability to work in and through us.
