# Mark 11:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By understanding the deeper meaning behind Jesus' words, we can see that the mountain mentioned represents the moral obstacles to the advancement of His kingdom. To overcome these obstacles, we must have unwavering faith and conviction in God, believing that whatever we command in alignment with His will shall come to pass. It is through this authoritative faith, devoid of doubt, that we can witness the fulfillment of God's promises.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "From the nature of the case supposed‚Äîthat they might wish a mountain removed and cast into the sea, a thing far removed from anything which they could be thought actually to desire‚Äîit is plain that not physical but moral obstacles to the progress of His kingdom were in the Redeemer's view."
2. "He designed to teach was the great lesson, that no obstacle should be able to stand before a confiding faith in God."
3. "Whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed . . . he shall have whatsoever he saith."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Shall come to pass [Œ≥ŒπŒΩŒµœÑŒ±Œπ] . Rather cometh to pass, as Rev.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Shall not doubt in his heart" - First aorist passive subjunctive with ŒøœÇ Œ±ŒΩ. The verb means a divided judgment (Œ¥ŒπŒ± from Œ¥œÖŒø, two, and Œ∫œÅŒπŒΩœâ, to judge). Wavering doubt. Not a single act of doubt (Œ¥ŒπŒ±Œ∫œÅŒπŒ∏Œ∑), but continued faith (œÄŒπœÉœÑŒµœÖŒ∑).
2. "Cometh to pass" - Futuristic present middle indicative.

### John Gill:
1. "For verily I say unto you, that whosoever shall say unto this mountain... be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea..." 
2. "...shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass..."
3. "...whatever he commands shall be done..."
