# Mark 11:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
And as Jesus and his disciples returned to Jerusalem, it was the day after Jesus had cursed the fig tree. While they were walking in the temple, the chief priests, Scribes, and elders, who made up the great council of the nation, approached Jesus. They sought to challenge his authority for cleansing the temple and teaching in it, forming a large committee of the Sanhedrin.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
