# Mark 11:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, with authority, entered the temple and acted as if he owned it, correcting any abuses he found. He also performed miraculous acts such as healing the lame and blind, proving his divine authority. Those who witnessed this asked him, Who gave you the authority to do these things?

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ταῦτα need not necessarily refer to the cleansing of the temple, as Meyer; but seems from [36] Luke, to extend over our Lord’s whole course of teaching and putting himself forward in public." 
2. "ἵνα ταῦτα ποιῇς is not a periphrasis of the infinitive, but contains the purpose of τὴν ἐξ . τ . ἔδ ." 
3. "When, in the Gospels, and in the Evangelic statement, 1 Corinthians 11:23-25 , the sign (║) occurs in a reference, it is signified that the word occurs in the parallel place in the other Gospels, which will always be found indicated at the head of the note on the paragraph. When the sign (║) is qualified, thus, ‘║ Mk.,’ or ‘║ Mt. Mk.,’ &c., it is signified that the word occurs in the parallel place in that Gospel or Gospels, but not in the other or others."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Mark with his fondness for solemn repetitions, adds to the second question: to do these things."
2. "This implies the only authority which could justify such acts is one given for this purpose."
3. "Their challenge thus becomes even more definite."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "By what authority." This question in all three Gospels was a perfectly legitimate one.
2. "Note present subjunctive here, that you keep on doing these things."

### John Gill:
1. "Enter into the temple, as if he was Lord of it; and correct in such a magisterial way every thing he thought an abuse in it..."
2. "...do the miracles he did, as healing the lame and blind..."
3. "And who gave thee this authority to do these things?"
