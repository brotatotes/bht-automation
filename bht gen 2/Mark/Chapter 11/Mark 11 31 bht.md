# Mark 11:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The individuals had a secret meeting to deliberate on their response, considering the options carefully. They were fully aware of what Jesus would say in return if they claimed that John's authority was from heaven. They knew that Jesus would point out their lack of faith in John's testimony and highlight their inconsistency. Their intention was to undermine Jesus' influence over the people, but any misstep would result in their plan backfiring.
