# Mark 11:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people had a deep fear of John, even after his death, comparable to the fear that Herod Antipas had. They were afraid of the people's potential anger if they disrespected John's memory, as they held him in high regard, recognizing him as a true prophet sent by God. This sentiment was widely shared among the people. Therefore, they were cautious and had a fear of the repercussions if they were not respectful towards John's memory.
