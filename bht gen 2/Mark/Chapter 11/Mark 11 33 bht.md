# Mark 11:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He faced a difficult situation, as those questioning him were intentionally ignorant and unwilling to take a stand on the Baptist who preceded him, thereby absolving Jesus from providing a straightforward answer. It's hard to say why they didn't answer, but perhaps they didn't want to reveal their true intentions. In the end, Jesus chose not to reveal the authority behind his actions, refusing to let them off the hook.
