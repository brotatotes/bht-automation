# Mark 11:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples obediently carried out Jesus' instructions, setting aside any concerns that may have arisen. They arrived in the village and discovered the colt tied by the door outside, possibly at the end of the street, attached to the house. Without hesitation, they swiftly freed the colt and made preparations to fulfill their task.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The report of one of those sent: qu. Peter?"
2. "Wordsw. interprets it, ‘the back way, which led round the house.’"
3. "[Archbp. Trench, on the A.V. p. 116. would render it 'a way round,' 'a crooked lane.']"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Amfodon is literally any road which leads round [αμφι] a place or a block of buildings. Hence the winding way."
2. "It is a topographical note, that could only be given by an eye-witness."
3. "The detail of verse 4 is peculiar to Mark."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Mark is more detailed here: perhaps Peter was one of those sent (comp. Luke 22:8), where Peter and John are the two sent into the city."
2. "At the door without. Probably the door of the owner’s house."
3. "In the open street, or, ‘lane.’ The E. V. following the Latin Vulgate, paraphrases: ‘in a place where two ways meet.’ The phrase refers first to a way round, i.e., round a block of houses, then to the street of a town (usually winding in the East)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The better class of houses were built about an open court, from which a passage way under the house led to the street outside. It was at this outside opening to the street that the colt was tied."
2. "The word αμφοδος (from αμφω, both, and οδος, road) is difficult. It apparently means road around a thing, a crooked street as most of them were."
3. "And they loose him (κα λυουσιν αυτον). Dramatic present tense. Perhaps Peter was one of those sent this time as he was later (Luke 22:8). If so, that explains Mark's vivid details here."

### John Gill:
1. "And they went their way,.... The two disciples went to the village, where Christ sent them, without objecting any difficulties that might present, in the execution of these orders"
2. "and found the colt tied by the door without; in the street, fastened to the door of the owner's house, at the town's end"
3. "and they loose him; as soon as ever they came to the place, they immediately began to untie the colt, and were going away with him."
