# Mark 11:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Jesus approached Jerusalem, his disciples brought him a colt to ride upon. It was a special moment, as the owners of the colt willingly surrendered it to Jesus, just as he had predicted. The disciples helped Jesus onto the colt, and he sat upon it, using their clothes as a makeshift saddle. In this humble yet triumphant act, Jesus rode on his way to Jerusalem, fulfilling prophecy and preparing for the events that would soon unfold.
