# Mark 12:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The man planted a vineyard, which can be understood as the vineyard of the Lord of hosts, the people of Israel. The hedge or wall around the vineyard represents the law, signifying both the ceremonial and moral law, as well as divine protection. Additionally, the tower built in the vineyard may symbolize either the city of Jerusalem or the temple within it, where the priests would watch and carry out their sacred duties.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The wine-press was constructed in the side of a sloping rock, in which a trough was excavated, which was the wine press proper. Underneath this was dug another trough, with openings communicating with the trough above, into which the juice ran from the press." 
2. "The word here used for the whole structure strictly means this trough underneath the press. This is the explanation of Wyc.'s translation, dalf, a lake."


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The circumstances called forth the parabolic mood, that of one whose heart is chilled, and whose spirit is saddened by a sense of loneliness, and who, retiring within himself, by a process of reflection, frames for his thoughts forms which half conceal, half reveal them."
2. "A pit for the winepress (υποληνιον). Only here in the N.T. Common in the LXX and in late Greek. Matthew had ληνον, winepress. This is the vessel or trough under the winepress on the hillside to catch the juice when the grapes were trodden."
3. "Husbandmen (γεωργοις). Workers in the ground, tillers of the soil (εργον, γη)."

### John Gill:
1. "The man planted a vineyard, which, by the 'vineyard' planted by him, is meant the vineyard of the Lord of hosts, the men of Israel."
2. "The hedge or wall around the vineyard symbolizes the law, whether the ceremonial and moral law or the wall of protection by divine power."
3. "The tower built in the vineyard may represent either the city of Jerusalem or the temple in it, where the priests watched and did their service."
