# Mark 12:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
How amazing is God's providence, working all things together for the benefit of His people! Even the rulers, who initially had the intention to seize and remove Him, were held back by the consciousness that the parable was directed at them and the fear of the people. The fear of the rulers was not unfounded, for the multitude had become so passionate about Jesus that they would have risen up in His defense. This fear alone prevented the rulers from taking any immediate action against Him, leaving Jesus unharmed in the temple.
