# Mark 12:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The religious leaders' plan was to entrap Jesus by trying to catch him in his words. They were hoping to trap him either by accusing him of disloyalty to the Roman government or by exposing him as unsupportive of their civil liberties. They thought that whichever way Jesus responded, they would have an opportunity to accuse him. Their intention was to undermine his authority and prove that he could not be the Messiah and deliverer the people were expecting.
