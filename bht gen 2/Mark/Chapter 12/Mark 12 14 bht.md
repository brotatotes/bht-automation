# Mark 12:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They asked Jesus, Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or not? This question was meant to trap Him and force Him into an absolute affirmation or negation. They recognized that Jesus was an honest and sincere man who taught the way of God with integrity and faithfulness, showing no partiality to anyone. They wanted to put Him in a difficult position, but Jesus, in His wisdom, would respond wisely.
