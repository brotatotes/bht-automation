# Mark 12:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The young men approached Jesus with a seemingly innocent question, but their true motives were deceptive. They wanted to trap Jesus, not just in his principles, but in his influence over the people. However, Jesus saw through their hypocrisy and their hidden agenda, which was revealed in their flattering titles and false pretenses. He responded with a request for a penny, asking to see the tribute money that was required. This interaction sheds light on the craftiness and deceitfulness of their hearts, as well as Jesus' discernment and wisdom in navigating their treacherous questions.
