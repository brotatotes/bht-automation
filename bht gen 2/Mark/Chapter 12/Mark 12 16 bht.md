# Mark 12:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The coin in question, which holds both image and superscription, is believed to be a Roman penny that had a significant value compared to our own currency. On this coin, it is highly likely that the image engraved was that of the reigning Emperor Tiberius. Additionally, the superscription would have denoted the emperor's name and, potentially, a motto accompanying it.
