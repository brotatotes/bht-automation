# Mark 12:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The mention of a season for fruits in this passage signifies a time of celebration and joy, with offerings brought to Jerusalem from different places. The reference to a servant highlights the collective responsibility to bear fruits of righteousness, emphasizing the obligation of a whole group rather than individual prophets. However, despite the advantages and blessings bestowed upon them, the people failed to live up to the expectations and bring forth the righteousness and judgment that were anticipated.
