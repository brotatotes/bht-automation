# Mark 12:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Luke 20:29, the word took a wife refers to marriage, as Matthew uses the term married. It is important to note that the Jews in the past understood the word seed to refer to a single person, even though modern Sadducees might argue otherwise. This is evident in the context of Luke 20:29, where it is stated that the first husband died without leaving any descendants.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Took a wife  (ελαβεν γυναικα). So Luke 20:29. Matthew has "married" (γημας). 

### John Gill:
1. "No child: hence it is clear that the ancient Jews used the word seed, of a single person..."
2. "...as these Sadducees did; though modern ones deny such an use of it in our present controversies with them about the sense of Genesis 3:15."
3. "...the first took a wife, and dying left no seed."
