# Mark 12:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this situation, there is an instruction given to the eldest brother to either marry his brother's widow or symbolically remove his own shoe. If he refuses, the responsibility is passed on to the other brothers, and if they decline as well, it eventually comes back to the eldest. While the command does not force him to marry, it does require him to carry out the action of removing the shoe as a sign of fulfilling his duty.

### John Gill:
1. "The command is, 'for the eldest' to marry his brother's wife: if he will not, they go to all the brethren; if they will not, they return to the eldest, and say, the command is upon thee, either pluck off the shoe, or marry."
2. "If a man dies, and leaves many brethren, the command is upon the eldest to marry, or pull off the shoe; as it is said, Deuteronomy 25:6, 'and it shall be the firstborn which she beareth'."
3. "And they do not compel him to marry, but they compel him to pluck off the shoe."
