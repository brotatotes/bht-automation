# Mark 12:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the context of the resurrection, when they shall rise, the question arises: whose wife shall she be among the seven? This question is asked because according to the Jewish customs, the wife would have belonged to all of them. Therefore, it is important to understand that she was legally the wife of all seven, and no one brother had a special claim to her.

### Henry Alford:
1.  23. ]  ὅταν ἀναστῶσιν  , here not, ‘  when men (the dead)  shall rise ,’ but  when they (the wife and seven brothers)  shall rise: see on Mark 12:25 .

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 23. In the resurrection therefore
	when they shall rise, &c.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  To wife  (γυναικα). Predicate accusative in apposition with "her" (αυτην). So Luke, but Matthew merely has "had her" (εσχον αυτην), constative aorist indicative active. 

### John Gill:
1. "In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise...because, perhaps, it might be thought superfluous; but this is agreeably to the way of speaking and writing with the Jews."
2. "The question put on supposition of a resurrection, and that these seven brethren, and the wife they all had should rise, then is, whose wife shall she be of them? of the seven brethren; for the seven had her to wife."
3. "She was, according to law, the lawful wife of all seven; what particular and special claim could one have to her above the rest?"
