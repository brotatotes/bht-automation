# Mark 12:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus responds to his audience's question with a rhetorical question, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the Scriptures, neither the power of God? By asking this, Jesus points out the error in their understanding, as they lack knowledge of both the Scriptures and the power of God. This indicates that their disagreement with him stems from their ignorance, and that their intellectual superiority is unfounded. The use of the interrogative form adds emphasis to this statement, making it a more forceful assertion.
