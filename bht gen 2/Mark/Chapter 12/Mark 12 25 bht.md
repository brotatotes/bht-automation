# Mark 12:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When people rise from the dead, the natural relations of marriage will no longer exist, as there will be no need for them. In the future state, there will be no marriages, as it is a state of immortality where the need for such unions ceases. Instead, they will be like the angels in heaven, where marriage is not a part of their existence.
