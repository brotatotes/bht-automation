# Mark 12:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the chapter containing the history of God appearing in the bush, when he was at the bush, he spoke to Moses, proclaiming, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. The Jews referred to this passage as the section concerning the bush, and the article used suggests that it was something familiar to them. In the book of Moses, specifically in the book of Exodus, God's declaration of being the God of the patriarchs serves as proof of the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead.
