# Mark 12:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage reveals that God is not associated with the deceased, but with the living. This implies that our souls are currently alive in the presence of God. Furthermore, for God to be the God of our whole being, it is necessary for our bodies to be resurrected. This underscores the importance of a future state of blessedness and the resurrection of our physical bodies. The error of assuming otherwise is far from insignificant, as it constitutes a profound misconception.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living." - The word in brackets is almost certainly an addition to the genuine text, and critical editors exclude it. "For all live unto Him." 
2. "It is true, indeed, that to God no human being is dead or ever will be, but all mankind sustain an abiding conscious relation to Him; but the 'all' here means 'those who shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world.'"
3. "It was concluded by some of the early Fathers, from our Lord's resting His proof of the Resurrection on such a passage as this, instead of quoting some much clearer testimonies of the Old Testament, that the Sadducees, to whom this was addressed, acknowledged the authority of no part of the Old Testament but the Pentateuch."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Ye do greatly err. An emphatic close, peculiar to Mark.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Ye do greatly err  (Ï€Î¿Î»Ï… Ï€Î»Î±Î½Î±ÏƒÎ¸Îµ). Only in Mark. Solemn, severe, impressive, but kindly close (Bruce). 

### John Gill:
1. "since God is the God of these persons, they must be now alive in their souls, for God is not the God of the dead"
2. "their bodies must rise again, or he will not be the God of their whole persons"
3. "ye therefore do greatly err; signifying, that it was not a slight mistake, an error of small importance, but a very great one"

### John Wesley:
1. "He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living." 
2. "since the character of his being the God of any persons, plainly intimates a relation to them, not as dead, but as living"
3. "there must needs be a future state of blessedness, and a resurrection of the body to share with the soul in it."
