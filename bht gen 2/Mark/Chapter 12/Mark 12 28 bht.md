## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The motive, as shown by the subordination of ἀκούσας to προσελθών, and of εἰδώς to ἐπηρώτησεν, seems to have been, admiration of our Lord’s wise answer, and a desire to be instructed further by Him."
2. "This was one of the μάχαι νομικαί (Tit 3:9), which was the greatest commandment. The Scribes had many frivolous enumerations and classifications of the commands of the law."
3. "πάντων, not πασῶν: πρώτη - πάντων is treated almost as one word, so that πάντων does not belong to ἐντ. understood, but, q. d. ‘first-of-all of the commandments.’"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "When Matthew ( :-) therefore says he came 'tempting,' or 'trying him,' as one of the Pharisaic party who seemed to enjoy the defeat He had given to the Sadducees, we may suppose that though somewhat priding himself upon his insight into the law, and not indisposed to measure his knowledge with One in whom he had not yet learned to believe, he was nevertheless an honest-hearted, fair disputant."
2. "This was a question which, with some others, divided the Jewish teachers into rival schools."
3. "Our Lord's answer is in a strain of respect very different from what He showed to cavillers—ever observing His own direction, 'Give not that which is holy to the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine; lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you'."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Well [καλως] . Lit., beautifully, finely, admirably. What [ποια] . Rather, of what nature.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This scribe no doubt rejoiced in the defeat of the Sadducees, but was also really pleased with our Lord’s answers."
2. "The fearfully belittling tendencies of Pharisaical legalism may be inferred from the following statement: ‘The Jews enumerated six hundred and thirteen ordinances; three hundred and sixty-five prohibitions, according to the days of the year; two hundred and twenty-eight commandments, according to the parts of the body. The Pharisees distinguished between lesser and greater commandments’(Braune)."
3. "The phrase may mean: ‘first of all things,’ however."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A few, among whom was the scribe, were constrained to admire, even if they were willing to criticize, the Rabbi who though not himself a Pharisee, surpassed the Pharisees as a champion of the truth."
2. "First in rank and importance. Matthew 22:36 has 'great'. Probably Jesus spoke in Aramaic. 'First' and 'great' in Greek do not differ essentially here."
3. "Mark quotes Deuteronomy 6:4 as it stands in the LXX and also Leviticus 19:18. Matthew 22:40 adds the summary: 'On these two commandments hangeth (κρεματα) the whole law and the prophets.'"

### John Gill:
1. "And perceiving that he had answered them well: in a most beautiful manner."
2. "The answer here was with great solidity, and judgment, and strength of argument, to their utter confusion and silence."
3. "Whereby he understood he had considerable knowledge in the law."

### John Wesley:
1. Which is the first commandment? — The principal, and most necessary to be observed. Matthew 22:34; Luke 10:25.
