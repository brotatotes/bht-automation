# Mark 12:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The foundation of all the commandments is the belief in the unity of God. The Lord our God is one Lord, and it is from this unity that we owe all our love and devotion to Him alone. This belief is not only foundational to the first commandment, but to all the commandments. It is the essential truth that the Lord our God, the God of all men, is one God, existing in the three persons of the Holy Trinity. Our faith, rooted in this belief, is what enables us to fulfill the commandments through love.
