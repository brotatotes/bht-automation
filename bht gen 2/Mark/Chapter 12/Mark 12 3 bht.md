# Mark 12:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This passage highlights the violent reception that fell upon the prophets of the Lord when they were caught by the people. They faced brutal physical assault, enduring beatings that left their skin flayed, and were then sent away empty-handed, devoid of any fruits from their labor. It serves as a powerful testimony to the hostility and lack of appreciation that often greeted those who boldly conveyed God's message to the world.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Gill:
1. "And they caught him,.... This clause is left out in the Syriac and Persic versions, though it seems proper to be retained; and denotes the rudeness and violence with which the prophets of the Lord were used by the Jewish nation."
2. "And beat him: either with their fists, or with rods, and scourges, till the skin was flayed off."
3. "And sent him away empty; without any fruit to carry with him, or give an account of, to the owner of the vineyard."
