## BHT:
Love for God is a whole-hearted and all-encompassing affection that extends to every aspect of our being.

Through regeneration, God's laws are inscribed in our hearts and minds, leading us to genuinely love the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This commandment urges us to love God fervently, expressing our affection with utmost intensity and the full strength of our inner grace.
