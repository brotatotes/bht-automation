# Mark 12:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This passage reminds us of the commandment to love our neighbor as ourselves, which encompasses our entire duty towards others. It urges us to demonstrate genuine affection and perform acts of kindness towards every person we encounter, regardless of their background or beliefs. This commandment holds equal importance as the commandment to love God with all our being. It emphasizes the need for selflessness and a genuine concern for the well-being of others, treating them with the same care and consideration we would want for ourselves.

### Henry Alford:
1. "The first is the Sun, so to speak, of the spiritual life: this the lesser light, which reflects the shining of that other."
2. "Both are laws of love: both deduced from the great and highest love: both dependent on 'I am the Lord thy God,' Leviticus 19:18."
3. "Stier sets forth beautifully the strong contrast between the requirements of these two commands, and the then state of the Jewish Church: see John 7:19."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Thou shall love thy neighbour
as thyselfâ€”Now, as we are not to love ourselves supremely, this
is virtually a command, in the first place, not to love our
neighbor with all our heart and soul and mind and strength. And thus
it is a condemnation of the idolatry of the creature."
2. "Our supreme and
uttermost affection is to be reserved for God. But as sincerely
as ourselves we are to love all mankind, and with the same
readiness to do and suffer for them as we should reasonably
desire them to show to us."
3. "The golden rule (Matthew 22:39- :) is here our best interpreter of the nature and extent of
these claims."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Gill:
1. "This commandment stands in Leviticus 19:18 and respects not an Israelite only, or one of the same religion with a man's self, or his intimate friend and acquaintance, but any man whatever, to whom affection should be shown, and good should be done to him, and for him, as a man would have done to and for himself."
2. "As much as lies in his power, both in things temporal and spiritual."
3. "There is none other commandment greater than these; in the whole law, moral or ceremonial."

### John Wesley:
1. "The second is like unto it â€” Of a like comprehensive nature: comprising our whole duty to man."
