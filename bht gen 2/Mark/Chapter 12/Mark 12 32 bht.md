# Mark 12:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Truly, you have spoken the truth, replied the Scribe to Jesus. The Scribe was not only convinced, but also felt compelled to openly commend Jesus's answer in front of the crowd and his fellow sect members. This was a remarkable act, as it went against the usual tendency of some to oppose the truth even when they are convinced of it. Jesus's statement emphasizes that there is only one God, a belief that aligns with the Christian doctrine of the Trinity. This assertion directly challenges the existence of false gods and idols worshipped by the Gentiles.
