# Mark 12:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To truly worship God, we must love and serve Him with our entire being, with all the united powers of our soul. Additionally, we are called to love our neighbor as ourselves, treating others with equitable and charitable temper and behavior. This duty of loving our neighbor is even more necessary and important than offering the most noble and costly sacrifices. It is more than just observing rituals and traditions, but rather a sincere and heartfelt love for God and a genuine care for those around us.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And to love him with all the heart ... and to love his neighbor as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices—more, that is, than all positive institutions; thereby showing insight into the essential difference between what is moral and in its own nature unchangeable, and what is obligatory only because enjoined, and only so long as enjoined."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Understanding [συνεσεως] . A different word from that in verse 30. From sunihmi, to send or bring together."
2. "Hence sunesiv is a union or bringing together of the mind with an object, and so used to denote the faculty of quick comprehension, intelligence, sagacity."
3. "Compare on sunetwn, the prudent, Matthew 11:25."

### John Calvin:
1. "Though the worship of God is greatly preferable, and is more valuable than all the duties of a holy life, yet its outward exercises ought not to be estimated so highly as to swallow up brotherly kindness."
2. "For we know that brotherly kindness, in itself and simply, is pleasing to God, though sacrifices are not regarded by him with delight or approbation, except with a view to another object."
3. "The same doctrine is to be found very frequently in the prophets, that hypocrites may know that sacrifices are of no value, unless spiritual truth be joined to them, and that God is not appeased by offerings of beasts, where brotherly kindness is neglected."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "With all the understanding." The scribe substitutes ‘understanding’ for ‘mind,’ which seems to express the same thought less abstractly. Mark preserves the answer in full.
2. "Is much more than." Better, ‘more acceptable to God, and more useful to the worshipper.’
3. "All whole burnt offerings and sacrifices." ‘Burnt offerings,’ i.e., those commanded in the law. Such things took up the whole attention of legalists. It was a bold saying in those times and in that place. Christ’s atoning sacrifice is the centre of the gospel, but he who has a correct theory on this subject, without being led to the love here spoken of, is but a Pharisee at heart, below the standard of this man.

### John Gill:
1. "And to love him with all the heart,.... That is, the one God, with a sincere hearty love and affection;and with all the understanding; of his being, perfections, and works, which will serve to draw the affections to him."
2. "and to love his neighbour as himself; which are the two great commandments of the law:is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices."
3. "This man had now at least a different sense of things, from the rest of his brethren; who placed religion chiefly in the observance of the rituals of the law, and the traditions of the elders; and neglected the duties of the moral law, respecting God and their neighbour."

### John Wesley:
1. "To love him with all the heart — To love and serve him, with all the united powers of the soul in their utmost vigour..."
2. "To love his neighbour as himself - To maintain the same equitable and charitable temper and behaviour toward all men, as we, in like circumstances, would wish for from them toward ourselves..."
3. "...is a more necessary and important duty, than the offering the most noble and costly sacrifices."
