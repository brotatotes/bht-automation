# Mark 12:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The statement Thou art not far from the kingdom of God suggests that the person addressed was in close proximity to entering into the realm of God's dominion. They may have shown a sincere desire for repentance and faith, indicating that they were on the brink of embracing the Gospel dispensation. However, it remains crucial for us as readers to take this admonition to heart and diligently pursue a genuine Christian life. Merely appearing religious or devout will not suffice. Instead, we must actively strive to draw near to God's kingdom and fully commit ourselves to following Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

2. "The Lord shows us here that even outside His flock, those who can answer Î½Î¿Ï…Î½ÎµÏ‡á¿¶Ï‚ who have knowledge of the spirit of the great command of Law and Gospel, are nearer to being of his flock, than the formalists."
3. "The enquiry which follows did more than silence their questioning: it silenced their answering too."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Thou art not far from the kingdom of God - for he had but to follow out a little further what he seemed sincerely to own, to find his way into the kingdom."
2. "He needed only the experience of another eminent scribe who at a later period said, 'We know that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold under sin': who exclaimed, 'O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me?' but who added, 'I thank God through Jesus Christ!'"
3. "Perhaps among the 'great company of the priests' and other Jewish ecclesiastics who 'were obedient to the faith,' almost immediately after the day of Pentecost, this upright lawyer was one. But for all his nearness to the Kingdom of God, it may be he never entered it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Discreetly [Î½Î¿Ï…Î½ÎµÏ‡Ï‰Ï‚] . From nouv, mind, and ecw, to have. Having his mind in possession : "having his wits about him." The word occurs only here in the New Testament.

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ stretches out the hand to him, and teaches us, by his example, that we ought to assist those in whom there is any beginning either of docility or of right understanding."
2. "By these words we are also taught that many, while they are still held and involved in error, advance with closed eyes towards the road, and in this manner are prepared for running in the course of the Lord, when the time arrives."
3. "But the more hardened their obstinacy, and the more incorrigible their rebellion, so much the more illustrious was Christâ€™s triumph over both."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Understandingly, intelligently, wisely; more than 'discreetly,' in the more modern sense."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Using the mind to good effect is what the adverb means."
2. "The critical attitude of the lawyer had melted before the reply of Jesus into genuine enthusiasm that showed him to be near the kingdom of God."

1. "Thou art not far from the kingdom of God: not meaning from heaven, and eternal happiness... but our Lord's sense is, that he was not far off from the Gospel dispensation, and was in a fair way of entering into it."
2. "Indeed there are some persons, who seem not far off from the kingdom of God... who will never enter into it: there are some that seem very devout and religious... and yet are destitute of the grace of God."
