# Mark 12:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
How could the scribes teach that the Messiah would be the son of David when David himself referred to the Messiah as his Lord? This question challenges their understanding of the Messiah's identity and prompts a deeper exploration of Jesus' person and work. Jesus is not denying or invalidating the truth of being the son of David, but highlighting the mystery of how he can simultaneously be the Lord of David. This inquiry exposes the complex nature of the Messiah, encompassing both his humanity and his divinity.
