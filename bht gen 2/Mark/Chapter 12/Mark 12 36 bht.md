# Mark 12:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The words of Psalm 110:1 hold great significance in the New Testament, as they are frequently referenced. This speaks to the influence of the Holy Spirit upon David when he penned the Psalms, under divine inspiration. David, in his inspired state, acknowledges Christ as his Lord and recognizes the authority and exaltation given to Him by God the Father. As Christ ascended and entered the most holy place, God the Father invited Him to sit at His right hand, signifying the completion of His redemptive work and the affection and honor bestowed upon Him in His human nature.
