# Mark 12:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, there is a mention of special seats in the synagogues and the top places at feasts. These seats and places were reserved for those with authority and high status. This reveals the human desire for recognition and distinction, even among the followers of Jesus. It serves as a reminder of how easily we can become consumed by the desire for prominence and recognition, regardless of our faith.
