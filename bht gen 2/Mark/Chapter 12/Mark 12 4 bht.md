# Mark 12:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we see a servant who is attacked and wounded by being stoned in the head. This act of violence mirrors the fate of those who have been subjected to stoning, sawn asunder, or slain with the sword. Another perspective suggests that the servant's purpose was to collect the fruits of the vineyard, yet his arrival is met with hostility as he is pelted with a stone, indicating that there is no fruit for him. Consequently, the servant is sent away disgracefully, enduring shame and humiliation.

### John Gill:
1. "And at him they cast stones, and wounded [him] in the head; for of these were stoned, as well as sawn asunder, and slain with the sword."
2. "Dr. Lightfoot thinks, the usual sense of the Greek word may be retained; which signifies 'to reduce', or 'gather into a certain sum': and so as this servant was sent to reckon with these husbandmen, and take an account from them of the fruit of the vineyard, one cast a stone at him, saying, there is fruit for you."
3. "And sent [him] away shamefully handled; with great ignominy and reproach."
