# Mark 12:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of the temple, Jesus sat opposite the treasury, observing as people cast their money into it. The treasury, a space of two hundred feet square, held thirteen chests shaped like trumpets, where the worshippers would contribute to the temple's needs. Some chests were designated for compulsory offerings while others were intended for voluntary gifts. As Jesus watched, he saw the wealthy giving large amounts, displaying their abundant possessions. These contributions were vital in acquiring essential provisions for the temple, such as wood for the altar and other necessities.
