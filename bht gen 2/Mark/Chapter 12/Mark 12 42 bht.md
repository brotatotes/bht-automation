# Mark 12:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The woman mentioned in this passage was a widow, indicating that she did not have a husband to support her. Additionally, she was considered poor, suggesting that she had very limited resources. The coins she gave, referred to as mites, were extremely small in value, comparable to the prutas mentioned in Jewish texts. It is important to note that even the offerings of the poor, no matter how small, were accepted by the Jews, as demonstrated by this example.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "Mark adds ὅ ἐστιν κοδ . for his Roman readers: the λεπτόν = ⅛ of an as."
3. "λεπτ . δύο, Bengel remarks, are noticed: she might have kept back one."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word translated 'mite' denotes a small coin made of brass - the smallest in use among the Jews."
2. "The precise value cannot now be easily estimated. It was much less than any coin we have, as the 'farthing' was less than an English farthing."
3. "It was in value about three mills and a half, or one-third of a cent."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A certain [μια]. Not a good translation. Lit., one as distinguished from the many rich."
2. "Mites [λεπτα]. From leptov, peeled, husked; and thence thin or fine. Therefore of a very small or thin coin."
3. "Farthing [κοδραντης]. A Latin word, quadrans, or a quarter of a Roman as; quadrans meaning a forth, as farthing is fourthing."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Possibly this widow was ‘poor,’ because her house had been ‘devoured’ (Mark 12:40)."
2. "The ‘mite’ (lepton) was the smallest Jewish copper coin. The Greek name means ‘fish-scale,’ suggesting its diminutive size."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The πτωχος is the pauper rather than the mere peasant, the extreme opposite of the rich (πλουσιο)."
2. "Λεπτος means peeled or stripped and so very thin. Two λεπτα were about two-fifths of a cent."
3. "Farthing (κοδραντες, Latin quadrans, a quarter of an as)."

### John Gill:
1. "She was a 'widow', had no husband to provide for her, and was a 'poor' one."
2. "These mites seem to be the same with the 'prutas', the Jews often speak of."
3. "And that the Jews took the freewill offerings of the poor as well as the rich, though ever so little, is clear from this canon of theirs."
