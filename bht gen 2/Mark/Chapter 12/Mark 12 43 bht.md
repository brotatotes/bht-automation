# Mark 12:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The account of the poor widow's offering reveals that her seemingly insignificant contribution holds greater value to God than all the lavish gifts given by the rich. While the rich give out of their abundance, the widow gives sacrificially from her poverty, reflecting a heart of true devotion. This serves as a reminder to be mindful of the intentions behind our actions, as God weighs the sincerity of our hearts rather than the outward appearance of our deeds. Thus, we should strive for selfless love and genuine devotion in our own worship and acts of service.

1. "πλεῖον more, in God’s reckoning; more, for her own stewardship of the goods entrusted to her care."
2. "Non quantum detur, sed quantum resideat, expenditur." Ambr. in Bp. Wordsw.

### Albert Barnes:

3. "This is the rule by which God will reward us."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. This poor widow [η χηρα αυτη η πτωχη] . The Greek order is very suggestive, forming a kind of climax : this widow, the poor one, or and she poor. 

### John Calvin:
1. "Whatever men offer to God ought to be estimated not by its apparent value but only by the feeling of the heart."
2. "The holy affection of him who according to his small means, offers to God the little that he has, is more worthy of esteem than that of him who offers a hundred times more out of his abundance."
3. "This widow must have been a person of no ordinary piety, who, rather than come empty into the presence of God, chose to part with her own living."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Our Lord directed their special attention to this act of the widow."
2. "Not more than a specific number, but than the many who had given and were still giving. The reason follows."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Called unto him..." - The disciples themselves had slipped away from him while the terrific denunciation of the scribes and Pharisees had gone on, puzzled at this turn of affairs.
2. "More than all..." - It may mean, more than all the rich put together.
3. "All her living..." - Her livelihood (βιος), not her life (ζωη). It is a tragedy to see a stingy saint pose as giving the widow's mite when he could give thousands instead of pennies.

### John Gill:
1. "That this poor widow, pointing to her, hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury: not that she had cast in more, or so much as any one of them as to value and substance, much less more than them all put together; but that she had cast in more in proportion to what she had, than they had in proportion to their substance."
2. "Hers, though very small in itself, and might be contemptible to others, yet it was more in the account of God and Christ, and more highly valued and esteemed of by them, than all that the rich men put in."
3. "What she gave, she gave in faith, and from a principle of love, and with a view to the glory of God; when theirs was given only in hypocrisy, to make an outward show, and to be seen of men."

### John Wesley:
1. "See what judgement is cast on the most specious, outward actions by the Judge of all!"
2. "And how acceptable to him is the smallest, which springs from self-denying love!"
