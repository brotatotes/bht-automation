# Mark 12:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage reminds us that the value of a gift should not be measured by its intrinsic worth, but rather by the sacrifice it represents. While some may give out of their abundance, showing no self-denial, the true measure of love for the cause of religion is giving according to our means. The poor widow exemplified this by giving all that she had, trusting in God's providence for her immediate needs. Her offering, though seemingly small, was esteemed highly by Jesus, who recognized her selflessness and wholehearted devotion.
