# Mark 12:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The tenants in this story were aware of Jesus' identity through the prophecies of the Old Testament and the miracles he performed, acknowledging him as the rightful heir to the throne of Israel. However, their desire to maintain their own power and keep control over the nation, temple, and worship led them to plot against Jesus, ultimately seeking to take his life.
