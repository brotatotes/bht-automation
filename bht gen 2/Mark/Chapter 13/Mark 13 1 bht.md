# Mark 13:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciple, likely Peter, directs the Master's attention to the magnificent stones and buildings of the temple, marveling at their splendor and grandeur. In doing so, he may have sought to shift the Teacher's focus away from the serious matters discussed earlier and highlight the aesthetic beauty of the temple's stonework and architectural design. The disciple's admiration reflects the awe-inspiring nature of the structures, which Josephus also acknowledges in his writings, describing the temple's stones as remarkable in size and the buildings as adorned with beautiful stones and lavish gifts.
