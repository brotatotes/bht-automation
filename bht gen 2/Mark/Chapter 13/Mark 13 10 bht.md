# Mark 13:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Before the end of Jerusalem, the Gospel had to be proclaimed among all nations, gathering in the elect Jews across the world, as Paul states in Colossians 1:6; Colossians 1:23. This was a necessary fulfillment of God's will and Christ's command. The spreading of the Gospel was not in vain, as their martyrdom played a role in its dissemination. This pattern of warning and judgment is seen throughout history and will continue until the end. Through these events, God shows that He never sends judgment without previous warning, highlighting the importance of proclaiming His message to all nations.
