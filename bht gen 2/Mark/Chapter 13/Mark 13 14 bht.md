# Mark 13:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The abomination of desolation, spoken of in Matthew 24:15 and Luke 21:20, refers to a specific event described by Daniel the prophet in Daniel 9:27. It involves the setting up of something detestable and impure in a place that is meant to be dedicated to God. This act symbolizes the invasion and defilement of a sacred space, ultimately pointing to the devastation brought upon Jerusalem by the Roman armies. Understanding the historical context and the fulfillment of these prophecies allows for a deeper understanding of the significance and urgency behind the call to flee to safety, as mentioned in these passages.

2. "That 'the abomination of desolation' here alluded to was intended to point to the Roman ensigns, as the symbols of an idolatrous, and so unclean pagan power, may be gathered by comparing what Luke says in the corresponding verse (Luke 21:20); and commentators are agreed on it."
3. "then let them that be in Judea flee to the mountains—The ecclesiastical historian, EUSEBIUS, early in the fourth century, tells us that the Christians fled to Pella, at the northern extremity of Perea, being 'prophetically directed'—perhaps by some prophetic intimation more explicit than this, which would be their chart—and that thus they escaped the predicted calamities by which the nation was overwhelmed."
