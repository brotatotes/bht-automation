# Mark 13:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the future, there will be a time of affliction that surpasses anything experienced from the beginning of creation. This will involve a great amount and complexity of suffering, potentially unprecedented, as seen in the Jewish war. However, it is worth pondering whether this affliction has already been fully realized or if there is more to come. Nonetheless, this period of affliction is unique and will not be paralleled by any other nation until the end of time.
