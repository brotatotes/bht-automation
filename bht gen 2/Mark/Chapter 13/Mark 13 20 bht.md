# Mark 13:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The days of affliction were divinely determined to be shortened, so that the chosen remnant of believers would not perish. God, in His sovereignty, had chosen these elect individuals and separated them from the world. This merciful shortening allowed for the salvation and preservation of the chosen ones, who were sanctified by the Spirit and believed in the truth. The divine decision to shorten these days was certain and would surely come to pass.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But for this merciful 'shortening,' brought about by a remarkable concurrence of causes, the whole nation would have perished, in which there yet remained a remnant to be afterwards gathered out."
2. "Till the fulness of the Gentiles be come in'—or, in our Lord's phraseology, 'till the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled'—does not mean 'till the general conversion of the world to Christ,' but 'till the Gentiles have had their full time of that place in the Church which the Jews had before them.'"
3. "After that period of Gentilism, as before of Judaism, 'Jerusalem' and Israel, no longer 'trodden down by the Gentiles,' but 'grafted into their own olive tree,' shall constitute, with the believing Gentiles, one Church of God, and fill the whole earth."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "He hath determined they shall be but few, that a remnant might be saved, and among them his elect; or from whom should descend, such as he had chosen, who should be saved with an everlasting salvation."
3. "Therefore it was the will of God to shorten those days of affliction, that they might not be entirely cut off, but that a number might be left, as a stock for future ages."
