# Mark 13:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During the days of tribulation and affliction, false Christs and false prophets shall rise, showing signs and wonders in an attempt to deceive. This fulfillment can be seen when reading Josephus' account of events before the destruction of Jerusalem. However, believers can find comfort in the fact that even the elect cannot be completely seduced by these false claims. The assurance that it is not possible to fully deceive the chosen ones is a precious reminder. Luke 17:23 also emphasizes the importance of not giving credence to such reports.
