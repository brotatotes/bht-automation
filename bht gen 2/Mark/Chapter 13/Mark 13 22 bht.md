# Mark 13:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
False Christs and false prophets will arise and perform signs and wonders, with the intention of leading astray as many people as possible. Their goal is to deceive, even the chosen ones, if it were possible. Their deception is so powerful that there is a real danger of being misled, were it not for the strong power and grace of God.
