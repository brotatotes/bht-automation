# Mark 13:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This passage speaks about the days that follow a period of tribulation, where the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light. These phrases draw from prophetic imagery found in the Old Testament and are not meant to be taken literally. They symbolize significant events, possibly the second coming of Christ. The mention of falling stars further adds to the vivid imagery. It is important to note that the ceremonial law, which was followed until the destruction of the temple, has now ceased. This signifies a significant shift in religious practices for early Christians.
