# Mark 13:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The instability and removal of the Jewish traditions, which were held in higher regard than the written word, should be understood as a sign that the old legal ordinances of the previous dispensation are being shaken and removed. The Jewish Rabbins and doctors, who deviated from the written word and prioritized their oral law, played a part in this shaking. These changes highlight the importance of recognizing the authority of the Bible and being cautious of elevating man-made traditions above it.

1. "The Jewish Rabbins and doctors, who fell off from the written word, and compiled their 'Misna', or oral law, their book of traditions, and set it up above the Bible..."
