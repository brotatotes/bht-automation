# Mark 13:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the son of man is seen, it is not a physical presence but rather a manifestation of divine wrath and vengeance. The sign of the son of man, described as coming with great power and glory, is the same event as the son of man coming in the clouds. This imagery points to the Second Personal Coming of Christ, where his regal claims and rights will be visibly asserted and manifested. The language used in these verses is consistent across the different accounts of the Gospel writers, providing a striking proof of their independent accounts.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "That this language finds its highest interpretation in the Second Personal Coming of Christ, is most certain."
2. "Well, after the doom of these has been pronounced and executed, and room thus prepared for the unobstructed development of the kingdom of God over the earth, what follows? 'I saw in the night visions, and behold, one like THE SON OF MAN came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they [the angelic attendants] brought Him near before Him.'"
3. "He seems to us, by 'the Son of man [on which phrase, see on Daniel 7:14- :] coming in the clouds with great power and glory,' to mean, that when judicial vengeance shall once have been executed upon Jerusalem, and the ground thus cleared for the unobstructed establishment of His own kingdom, His true regal claims and rights would be visibly and gloriously asserted and manifested."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "All three Evangelists give the thought of this verse with precisely the same details, and yet each varies from the other two in words. A striking proof of independence."
2. "With great power and glory."
3. "Matthew: ‘on the clouds of heaven,’ Luke: ‘in a cloud.’"

### John Gill:
