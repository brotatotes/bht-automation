# Mark 13:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When God gathers his chosen people together, he does so through the work of his angels, who preach and establish churches among both Jews and Gentiles. These ministers, appointed and empowered by God himself, are the means by which God gathers his elect. This gathering extends to every corner of the earth and reaches up to the very heavens, encompassing all people and places.
