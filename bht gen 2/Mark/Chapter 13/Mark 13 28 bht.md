# Mark 13:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As we examine the parable of the fig tree, we are reminded of the importance of learning from its teachings. Just as the fig tree's branch conveys an illustration of growth and new life, it serves as a metaphor for understanding the nearing of a certain season. In considering the example of the fig tree, we are urged to discern the signs and approach of the end times, recognizing that even in the simplest of instances, such as the fig tree's leaves, we can perceive the proximity of significant events.
