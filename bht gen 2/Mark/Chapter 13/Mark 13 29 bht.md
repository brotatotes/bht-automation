Know that the full manifestation of the coming events is close at hand, indicating the signs preceding the destruction of Jerusalem.

The kingdom of God, in all its glory and power, is also on the verge of being unveiled, leading to the destruction of Christ's enemies and the expansion of the Gospel to the Gentile world. All of these events are in the process of fulfillment, showing that the Son of man is truly near.
