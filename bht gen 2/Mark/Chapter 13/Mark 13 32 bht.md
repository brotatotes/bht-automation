# Mark 13:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus' reference to not knowing the day and hour pertains specifically to the destruction of Jerusalem. As the Son of Man, Jesus had limited knowledge, but as the Son of God, He possessed omniscience. The Father, as the ultimate authority, holds the power to determine the timing of such events. This distinction highlights the dual nature of Jesus and the divine plan at work in His earthly mission.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We must not deal unfaithfully with a plain and solemn assertion of our Lord... by such evasions as 'He does not know it so as to reveal it to us.'" 
2. "Of such a sense there is not a hint in the context: nay, it is altogether alien from it." 
3. "The account given by the orthodox Lutherans, as represented by Meyer, that our Lord knew this Œ∫Œ±œÑ·Ω∞ Œ∫œÑ·øÜœÉŒπŒΩ, but not Œ∫Œ±œÑ·Ω∞ œáœÅ·øÜœÉŒπŒΩ, is right enough if at the same time it is carefully remembered, that it was this Œ∫œÑ·øÜœÉŒπœÇ of which He emptied Himself when He became man for us, and which it belongs to the very essence of His mediatorial kingdom to hold in subjection to the Father."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But of that day and that hour‚Äîthat is, the precise time. knoweth no man‚Äîliterally, no one."
2. "This very remarkable statement regarding 'the Son' is peculiar to Mark."
3. "Whether it means that the Son was not at that time in possession of the knowledge referred to, or simply that it was not among the things which He had received to communicate‚Äîhas been matter of much controversy even among the firmest believers in the proper Divinity of Christ."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If Jesus had a divine nature, how could he say that he knew not the day and hour of a future event?"
2. "It is true that the word has sometimes that meaning, as in 1 Corinthians 2:2, but then it is natural to ask where has 'the Father' made it known?"
3. "He grew as a man in knowledge. As a man his knowledge must be finite, for the faculties of the human soul are not infinite."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Neither the Son. Here distinguished from ‚Äòangels,‚Äô as above them, since there is a climax, ‚Äòangels,‚Äô ‚Äòthe Son,‚Äô ‚Äòthe Father.‚Äô"
2. "The verse is to be taken in its plain sense (see on Matthew 24:36) as part of the mystery of Christ‚Äôs humiliation."
3. "A self-limitation, a self-emptying of the God-man."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "There is no doubt as to the genuineness of these words here such as exists in Matthew 24:36."
2. "This disclaimer of knowledge naturally interpreted applies to the second coming, not to the destruction of Jerusalem."
3. "The destruction of Jerusalem had been definitely limited to that generation as it happened in A.D. 70."

### John Gill:
1. "Of Jerusalem's destruction; for of nothing else had Christ been speaking..."
2. "Neither the Son; Christ, as the son of man; though he did know it as the Son of God, who knows all things..."

### John Wesley:

2. "Not as man: as man he was no more omniscient than omnipresent."
3. "But as God he knows all the circumstances of it."
