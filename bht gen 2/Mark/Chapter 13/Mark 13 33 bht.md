# Mark 13:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Take heed, watch and pray, for you do not know when the time will come. This exhortation cautions believers to be alert against false prophets, to watch in prayer and be cautious of falling into temptation. The uncertainty of the exact time emphasizes the need for constant vigilance. Even though the people of God had some notice, they still did not know the precise moment. The unbelieving Jews, in particular, remained in darkness until the very end. So, let us heed this admonition to be awake and attentive in our relationship with God (Matthew 24:42; Luke 21:34).
