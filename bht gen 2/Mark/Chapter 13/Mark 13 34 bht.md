# Mark 13:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our Savior, in this passage, portrays himself as embarking on a journey, leaving his household, and entrusting his servants and ministers with their respective duties until his return. The image of a man already gone emphasizes the uncertainty of his arrival. He commands the porter, or gatekeeper, to be vigilant and warn the people of impending danger. This parable underscores the importance of watchfulness and readiness, not just for the ministers of religion, but for all individuals, as we remain oblivious to the timing of the Master's return or the hour of our own death.
