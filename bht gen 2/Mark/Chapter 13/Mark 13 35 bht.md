# Mark 13:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Watch and be on alert, for you do not know when the Lord will return. He will come at an unexpected hour, like a master of the house rousing from sleep. Be vigilant against false Christs and prophets, protecting yourselves and the church. Just as the Jews divided the night into four watches, the Lord's coming could occur in the evening, at midnight, at cock-crowing, or in the morning.
