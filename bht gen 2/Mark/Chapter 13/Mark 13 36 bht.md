# Mark 13:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Be watchful and alert, for if the Lord comes without warning, He may find you unprepared and negligent in your duties. The Apostles, as representatives of the ministry, had a particular responsibility to be alert and vigilant. Neglecting this duty would be a grave mistake, as it disobeys the Lord's command to be awake and ready for His return.
