# Mark 13:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples asked two separate questions, one about the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem and the other about the end of the world. They were interested in knowing when these events would happen and what signs would indicate their fulfillment. The destruction of the temple was seen as part of a larger series of events that would come to pass, and Jesus addressed both questions in His response.
