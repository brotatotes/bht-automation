# Mark 13:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Many false messiahs will arise, claiming to be the true Christ, and they will deceive many people. These impostors will come in the name of Jesus, attempting to convince others that they are the long-awaited Messiah returned in glory to establish His kingdom. That is why Jesus warns His disciples not to follow after these false messiahs. Their deceitful words may sound convincing, but Jesus cautions against being led astray by their claims, for they are not the true Christ and their time of deception is drawing near.

2. "This gives peculiar force to the words, 'Go ye not therefore after them.'"
3. "For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ—'and the time draweth nigh,' that is, the time of the kingdom in its full splendor."
