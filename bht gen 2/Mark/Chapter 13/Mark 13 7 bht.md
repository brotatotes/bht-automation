# Mark 13:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be troubled. Instead, keep your place, continue your work, and preach the Gospel without distressing yourselves about the outcomes of worldly events. These things are necessary and inevitable, decreed by God, foretold by Christ, and made necessary by the sins of the people. It is important to remember that even though there will be distressing times, the end is not imminent. The end referred to here is the end of the temple, Jerusalem, and the Jewish state and nation. Before this ultimate end, worse things must come.
