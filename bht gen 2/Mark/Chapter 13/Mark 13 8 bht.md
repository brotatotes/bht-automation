# Mark 13:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. These are the beginnings of sorrows—of travail-pangs, as if heavy calamities are being compared to the pains of childbirth. Just as a woman experiences increasing pains before giving birth, these troubles signify the impending birth of something significant. Additionally, just as the Roman world was in turmoil before the destruction of Jerusalem, we can expect convulsions and conflicts before major events unfold. In the midst of these struggles, there will be earthquakes and famines, further signifying the gravity of the situation.
