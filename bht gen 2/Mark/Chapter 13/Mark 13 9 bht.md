# Mark 13:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Be cautious and vigilant, ensuring that you do not fall into the deceitful traps set by others. The mention of being delivered up to councils and beaten in synagogues signifies the religious persecution they would face. They were not only to bear testimony against the rulers and kings but also to be witnesses for the truth of Christ. It was important for them to be careful and take care of themselves, avoiding unnecessary danger and potential harm.
