# Mark 14:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The feast of the Passover was a significant event in the Jewish calendar, serving as a commemoration of God's deliverance of the Israelites from Egypt. It began with the eating of the Passover lamb, symbolizing the sparing of the Israelite firstborns. While the lamb was consumed on the first night only, the feast of unleavened bread lasted for seven days. The plot to arrest and ultimately kill Jesus was devised by the chief priests and scribes, who actively sought ways to capture him slyly.
