# Mark 14:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Judas, one of Jesus' disciples, willingly agreed to betray him for a specific sum of money, which was thirty pieces of silver. This fulfilled a prophecy and showed the fulfillment of divine providence. Judas actively sought opportunities to betray Jesus, looking for a chance when they could catch him without the crowds around. This act of treachery, considered a dispensation of Providence by the rabbis, allowed the authorities to avoid an uproar among the people. The betrayal by Judas, prompted by Satan, marked a dark moment in the narrative of Jesus' life and ministry.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him money—Matthew alone records the precise sum, because a remarkable and complicated prophecy, which he was afterwards to refer to, was fulfilled by it."
2. "And he sought how he might conveniently betray him—or, as more fully given in Luke, 'And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray Him unto them in the absence of the multitude.'"
3. "That he should avoid an 'uproar' or 'riot' among the people, which probably was made an essential condition by the Jewish authorities, was thus assented to by the traitor; into whom, says Luke, 'Satan entered,' to put him upon this hellish deed."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He kept seeking: busied himself continuously from that time."
2. "Might find a good opportunity."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "No doubt the rabbis looked on the treachery of Judas as a veritable dispensation of Providence amply justifying their plots against Jesus." 
2. "He claimed that he knew enough of the habits of Jesus to enable them to catch him 'in the absence of the multitude' without waiting for the passover to be over, when the crowds would leave." 
3. "Mark merely notes the promise of 'money' while Matthew mentions 'thirty pieces of silver,' the price of a slave."

### John Gill:
1. "That such an opportunity offered, and from such a quarter, by one of his own disciples; so that it might be done more secretly and effectually, and with less blame to themselves."
2. "Any sum he should ask; and what was agreed upon were thirty pieces, or shekels of silver."
3. "After this promise, and upon this agreement: henceforward he sought the most fitting opportunity, and the best season of betraying his master into the hands of these men."
