# Mark 14:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The preparations for the Passover would take place on the fourteenth day before the lamb was actually sacrificed at 6 P.M., which marked the beginning of the fifteenth day. According to tradition, the Passover lamb was slain by an Israelite, and the blood was received and passed on by a priest. However, it is important to avoid fanciful interpretations and focus on understanding the customary practices and significance of the Passover. It is worth noting that the Passover lamb would be sacrificed in the court of the temple after the middle of the day.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ὅτε τὸ π. ἔθυον, like Luke’s expression ᾗ ἔδει θύεσθαι τὸ π., denotes the ordinary day, when they (i.e. the Jews) sacrificed the Passover."
2. "We may notice that if this Gospel, as traditionally reported, was drawn up under the superintendence of Peter, we could hardly have failed to have the names of the two disciples given; nor again would our narrator have missed (and the omission is an important one) the fact that the Lord first gave the command, to go and prepare the Passover which Luke only relates."
3. "It becomes a duty to warn students of the sacred word against fanciful interpretations."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The paschal lamb (note πασχα) was slain at 6 P.M., beginning of the fifteenth of the month (Exodus 12:6), but the preparations were made beforehand on the fourteenth (Thursday)."
2. "When they sacrificed the passover  (οτε το πασχα εθυον). Imperfect indicative, customary practice."
3. "See on Matthew 26:17 for discussion of 'eat the passover.'"

### John Gill:
1. "Their canon runs thus... 'an Israelite kills (the passover), and a priest receives (the blood), and gives it to his neighbour, and his neighbour to his neighbour, and he receives (the basin) full, and returns it empty; the priest that is near to the altar sprinkles it, at one sprinkling, over against the bottom of it.'"
2. "The slaying of the passover by strangers... that is, such as are not priests, lawful."
3. "But then it was always killed in the court of the temple, and after the middle of the day."

### John Wesley:
1.  Matthew 26:17; Luke 22:7.
