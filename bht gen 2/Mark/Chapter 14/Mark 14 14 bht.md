# Mark 14:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus instructs his disciples to enter a house after him and speak to the owner, referred to as the goodman or master of the house. The master willingly directs them to a suitable room, as he is their master as well. Jesus then asks about the location of the guest chamber, where He intends to eat the passover with His disciples. The guest chamber is a room specifically set aside for the arrival of guests, ensuring a proper and comfortable environment for the observance of the passover meal.
