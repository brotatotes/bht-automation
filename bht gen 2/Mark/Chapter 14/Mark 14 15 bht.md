# Mark 14:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The discourse about the Passover meal necessitated careful arrangements, and Jesus provided specific instructions on where to find a suitable location. He mentioned a large upper room, suggesting that it could accommodate the entire group. Moreover, this space was not just bare but had been thoughtfully furnished and prepared for the occasion. With this directive, the disciples were tasked with making the necessary arrangements in this well-prepared space. The attention given to the details of the room indicates the significance Jesus placed on this final Passover meal.
