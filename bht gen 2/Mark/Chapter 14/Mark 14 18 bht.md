# Mark 14:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During the Last Supper, Jesus spoke to his disciples, revealing that one among them who shared in the meal would betray him. The choice of words used by Jesus, specifically mentioning eating together, highlighted the significance of their relationship. As the disciples reclined at the Passover meal, this detail added a poignant touch to the account. Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper painting, despite showing the apostles sitting, evoked the notion of hospitality and intimacy associated with reclining. This portrayal emphasized the sacredness of sharing a meal, a concept that still holds true today, as evidenced by Arab customs.
