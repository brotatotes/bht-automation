# Mark 14:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Mark 14:19, the disciples are saddened by Christ's words, with each one questioning if they would be the one to betray Him. This anguish spreads through the group until it reaches Judas himself, who utters the question, Is it I? The disciples, in a sequential manner, each express their concern individually. This order of questioning reflects the later Greek phrase, εἷς κατά εἷς, which serves as an adverb of distribution in this context. The broken construction, noted by Meyer, adds a graphic quality to the narrative, highlighting the emotional impact of this moment.

3. "Meyer remarks that such broken construction is suitable to the graphic tendency of our Evangelist."
