# Mark 14:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It was clear that the religious leaders had initially intended to kill Jesus during the feast, but the events leading up to it, such as the Triumphal Entry and the discussions with Jesus, caused them to delay their plans. Their hesitation was due to the fear of a potential uprising among the people, who largely saw Jesus as a prophet. They did not want any disturbances or for the crowd to intervene and rescue Jesus. Thus, they decided to wait for a more opportune time to carry out their plot.
