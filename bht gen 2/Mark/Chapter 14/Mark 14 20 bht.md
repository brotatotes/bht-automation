# Mark 14:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This poignant description of the betrayer does not single out a specific individual or portray an immediate action, but rather conveys a deep understanding of the betrayer's close relationship to the one being betrayed. The mention of dipping in the same dish highlights a profound connection and trust between them. The significance of this shared gesture, unnoticed by others, was fully grasped only by the betrayer, who knew that Jesus was aware of his intentions. Additional details and insights can be found in Matthew 26:21-24.
