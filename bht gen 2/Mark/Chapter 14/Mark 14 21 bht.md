# Mark 14:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The betrayal of the Son of Man is a tragic event, as it leads to His departure from this world through death. The one who betrays Him is destined for great woe, for their sin will not go unnoticed or be remedied by fulfilling God's plans and fulfilling Biblical prophecies. The severity of their actions is emphasized by the statement that it would have been better if they had never been born, as their crime is deeply aggravating and their punishment will be dreadful.
