# Mark 14:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, in the midst of his approaching sufferings and death, took bread, blessed it, and broke it. This act is the very initiation of a new feast, one that holds a profound significance for future generations. It is a commemoration, a remembrance of his sacrifice and the pain he would endure. The bread he held embodies his physical being, a symbolic representation of his body, which would soon be broken for the salvation of mankind.
