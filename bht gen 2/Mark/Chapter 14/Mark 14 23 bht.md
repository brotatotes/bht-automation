# Mark 14:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we see Jesus taking the cup, which is likely a mixture of the ordinary wine of the country and water. He gives thanks and then gives it to his disciples, including Judas. They all drink from the cup. It's important to note that Matthew 2626-29 and 1 Corinthians 11:23-26 provide further details about the institution of the Supper, and Luke 22:17-20 closely aligns with Paul's account in Corinthians.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. The cup. The wine was the ordinary one of the country, only red. It was mixed with water, generally in the proportion of one part to two of water.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A cup (ποτηριον). Probably the ordinary wine of the country mixed with two-thirds water, though the word for wine (οινος) is not used here in the Gospels, but 'the fruit of the vine' (εκ του γενηματος της αμπελου)."
2. "See Matthew 26:26-29 for discussion of important details."
3. "Mark and Matthew give substantially the same account of the institution of the Supper by Jesus, while Luke 22:17-20 agrees closely with 1 Corinthians 11:23-26 where Paul claims to have obtained his account by direct revelation from the Lord Jesus."

### John Gill:
1. "And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks..."
2. "...he gave it to them; his disciples..."
3. "...and they all drank of it; Judas, as well as the rest..."
