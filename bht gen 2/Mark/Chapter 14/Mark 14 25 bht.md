# Mark 14:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus declares, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, till I drink it new in the kingdom of God. This statement was made after the Lord's supper, indicating that the last cup had been consumed. Jesus implies that the next time He partakes of the wine, it will be in a figurative and mystical sense, representing the joys of heaven. It signifies the time of the general resurrection when the kingdom of the Mediator will be handed over and there will be no distinction of government, with God reigning in the saints for all eternity.
