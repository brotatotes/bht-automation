# Mark 14:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Jesus and his disciples concluded the Passover meal, they sung a hymn (Ï…Î¼Î½Î·ÏƒÎ±Î½Ï„ÎµÏ‚). This moment is mentioned in Matthew 26:30, Luke 22:39, and John 18:1. The inclusion of this act in the Gospel accounts signifies the willingness of Jesus to meet Judas, the one who would betray him. After singing the hymn, Jesus and his eleven remaining disciples departed to the Mount of Olives, where the events leading to his crucifixion would occur. It is worth noting that Judas separated from them to inform the chief priests about Jesus' location.
