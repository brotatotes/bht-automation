# Mark 14:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Within a mere twenty-four hours, and perhaps even before the cock crows twice, Jesus prophesied that Peter, despite his self-assuredness, would deny Him three times. This denial would occur before the sun had risen, specifically during the third watch of the night, which was known as the time of the cock crowing. The other disciples, likened to sheep, would be scattered when the shepherd, Jesus, was struck, fulfilling the foretold prophecy.
