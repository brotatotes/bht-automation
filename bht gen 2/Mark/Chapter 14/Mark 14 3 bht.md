# Mark 14:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Jesus sat at a meal in Bethany, a place near Jerusalem where he had previously prophesied the destruction of the temple, a woman approached him with a box of very costly and genuine nard pistic, a precious gum-like substance. She broke the box and poured the ointment on Jesus' head as an act of love and devotion. This act of pouring the ointment on his head was significant in that it symbolized her sincere and faithful offering to Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The modern interpretations of the word are principally of two kinds: the first, agreeing with Euth. and Theophyl., 'genuine,' 'unadulterated; ' which sense however of the word does not any where else occur."
2. "The uncertainty being so great, the best rendering would be to leave the word untranslated, as Jer. Taylor does in his 'Life of Christ' (sect. 15): 'Nard Pistick.' Bp. Wordsw. sees in the word the mystical sense, that 'offerings to Christ should be ... the fruits of a lively and loving πίστις, or faith, in Him.'"
3. "συντρ. τὴν ἀλάβ. can hardly mean only having broken the resin with which the cork was sealed. In ch. Mark 5:4: John 19:36; Revelation 2:27, the word is used of breaking, properly so called: and I see no objection to supposing that the ἀλάβαστρον was crushed in the hand, and the ointment thus poured over His head."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Very precious—'very costly' (John 12:3)."
2. "The only use of this was to refresh and exhilarate—a grateful compliment in the East, amid the closeness of a heated atmosphere, with many guests at a feast."
3. "Such was the form in which Mary's love to Christ, at so much cost to herself, poured itself out."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The best authorities define it genuine or unadulterated: pure nard."
2. "Possibly by striking the brittle neck of the flask. This detail is peculiar to Mark."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Spikenard, or 'nard pistic.' 'Nard' means an oriental gum, but the Greek word 'pistic' is akin to the word meaning 'faithful,' and probably refers to the purity of the precious gum." 
2. "Very costly. See Mark 14:5; comp. John 12:5."
3. "She brake the box. Crushing the neck of the cruse with the hand. See notes on Matthew. Mark alone gives this detail."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "As he sat at meat... Matthew 26:7 uses ανακειμενου, both words meaning reclining (leaning down or up or back) and in the genitive absolute."
2. "This use of πιστικος with ναρδος occurs only here and in John 12:3. The adjective is common enough in the older Greek and appears in the papyri also in the sense of genuine, unadulterated, and that is probably the idea here."
3. "She probably broke the narrow neck of the vase holding the ointment."

### John Gill:
1. "And being in Bethany, a place about two miles from Jerusalem, whither he retired after he had took his leave of the temple, and had predicted its destruction."
2. "Moreover, ointment of nard was made both of the leaves of nard, and called foliate nard, and of the spikes of it, and called, as here, spikenard. Now ointment made of nard was, as Pliny says, the principal among ointments."
3. "And she broke the box and poured it on his head."

### John Wesley:
1.  Matthew 26:6.
