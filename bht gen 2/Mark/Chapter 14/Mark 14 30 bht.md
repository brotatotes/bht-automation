# Mark 14:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This night, before it is past, thou shalt deny me thrice; as confident as thou art of standing by me and abiding with me. The cock-crowing, marking the third watch of the night, is the signal for more crows to follow. One crowing leads to another, and as the night progresses, Peter will deny Jesus not just once, but thrice. This prediction becomes more specific, specifying that his denial will occur before the usual time of the second cock-crowing, around three o'clock in the morning.
