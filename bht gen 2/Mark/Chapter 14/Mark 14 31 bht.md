## BHT:
Peter continued to speak, But he spake the more vehemently with even more passion, conviction, and certainty. The power of his words increased as he adamantly declared, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise. The other disciples, caught up in the fervor of Peter's statement, echoed his sentiments, saying, Likewise also said they all. Their collective voices filled the air, forming a resounding chorus of loyalty and commitment.
