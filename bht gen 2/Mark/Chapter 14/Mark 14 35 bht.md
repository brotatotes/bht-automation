# Mark 14:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, in the garden, began to pray. He fell on his face to the ground, assuming a posture of deep supplication. His prayer was a desperate plea for the hour of suffering that lay before him to pass. It was an expression of his desire for an alternate path, if it were possible, to be saved without enduring the excruciating pain that awaited him. This vulnerability and anguish in Jesus' prayer reflect his relatable humanity, as he grappled with the weight of his divine mission.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. Prayed [προσηυχετο] . Imperfect tense : began to pray.

### Philip Schaff:
1. Mark 14:35.  The hour might pass away from him.  The ‘hour’ representing the specific conflict of that hour in the garden. See Matthew 26:46.
	

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Fell on the ground" (επιπτεν επ της γης). Descriptive imperfect. See him falling.
2. "Prayed" (προσηυχετο). Imperfect, prayed repeatedly or inchoative, began to pray. Either makes good sense.
3. "The hour" (η ωρα). Jesus had long looked forward to this "hour" and had often mentioned it (John 7:30; John 8:20; John 12:23; John 12:27; John 13:1). See again in Mark 14:41. Now he dreads it, surely a human trait that all can understand.

### John Gill:
1. "He fell on his face to the ground, which was a praying posture."
2. "The supplication Christ made in this posture was, that it were possible, the hour might pass from him."
3. "That is, that it might pass without his enduring them, if there was any possibility of excusing him, and of his people's being saved without them."
