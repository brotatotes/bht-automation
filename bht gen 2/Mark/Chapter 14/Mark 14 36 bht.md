# Mark 14:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Abba, Father - St. Mark seems to add the word Father, by way of explication. It is not a case of translation, but the use of both terms as is Galatians 4:6, a probable memory of Paul's childhood prayers. The phrase expresses an intimate and personal relationship with God. The addition of Father further highlights the depth of Jesus' trust and submission to the will of the Father in the face of difficulty and the impending crucifixion.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἀββᾶ = אַבָּא, an Aramaic form, and after Mark’s manner inserted, as ‘Ephphatha,’ ch. Mark 7:34, ‘Talitha cum,’ ch. Mark 5:41."
2. "ὁ πατήρ is not the interpretation of ἀββᾶ, but came to be attached to it in one phrase, as a form of address: see reff."
3. "Meyer rightly supplies the ellipsis after ἀλλʼ: nevertheless, the question is not …: not οὐ γινέσθω, which would not come into construction with τί … τί."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Abba, Father. Mark gives, not only the substance of the prayer (Mark 14:35), but some of the words of our Lord."
2. "But before this Gospel was written, 'Abba Father' came into general use as an address to God (Romans 8:15; Galatians 4:6), probably from our Lord’s use of the former word."
3. "Howbeit, not what I will. The form differs from that of Matthew, and might be paraphrased: ‘But,  the great question is, not what I will, but what thou wilt.’"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Abba, Father": This is not a case of translation, but the use of both terms as is Galatians 4:6, a probable memory of Paul's childhood prayers.
2. "He was heard (Hebrews 5:7) and helped to submit to the Father's will as he does instantly." The humanity of Jesus is seen in its fulness both in the Temptations and in Gethsemane, but without sin each time. And this was the severest of all the temptations, to draw back from the Cross. The victory over self brought surrender to the Father's will.

### John Gill:
1. "Abba, my Father": or "my Father, my Father"; and so the Ethiopic version.
2. "all things are possible to God, and which are both difficult and impossible to be done by men."
3. "take away this cup from me; nevertheless, not what I will, but what thou wilt."

### John Wesley:
1. Abba, Father — St. Mark seems to add the word Father, by way of explication.
