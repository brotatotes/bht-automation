# Mark 14:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, Jesus addresses Peter directly, using his original name before he was given the name Cephas or Peter. This is significant because it highlights Peter's initial zeal and confidence, which contrast with his current state of failing loyalty during this critical moment. It shows that Jesus fully knows the weakness of human flesh, as evidenced by his question, Simon, sleepest thou? This questioning of Peter's lack of vigilance and watchfulness demonstrates Jesus' understanding and compassion towards Peter's shortcomings in that moment.
