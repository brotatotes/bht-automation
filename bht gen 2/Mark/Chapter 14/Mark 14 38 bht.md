# Mark 14:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Mark 14:38, Jesus warns his disciples to Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. This temptation refers to the danger of denying Christ and abandoning him when faced with his arrest. The disciples, particularly Peter, were vulnerable to the attacks of the evil spirit, Satan, who desired to sift them as wheat. While their spirits were willing, their flesh was weak. As human beings, they were no match for the power of Satan, highlighting the need for vigilance and prayer.
