# Mark 14:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples were heavily burdened (καταβαρυνομενοι) and weighed down. They were in a state of physical stupor, unable to make a reply (Mark 14:40). This heaviness was not a result of their failure, but rather a weakness of the flesh that prevented them from fully sympathizing with Jesus in his deepest experiences (Mark 14:40). Their confusion and shame, combined with their physical state of sleep and sorrow, left them at a loss for words and unable to excuse themselves (Mark 14:40).
