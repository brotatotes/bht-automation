# Mark 14:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Sleep on now, and take your rest, were words spoken by Jesus ironically. He was indicating that the disciples had failed to watch and pray as they should have. As the hour had come, it was enough, or the end, of their watchfulness. The Son of Man was about to be betrayed into the hands of sinners, by one of his own disciples, fulfilling the ultimate purpose of his mission.
