# Mark 14:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Immediately after Jesus had finished speaking, Judas, one of His twelve apostles, arrived with a large group of people, including chief priests, temple officers, and elders. This multitude was armed with swords and staves, ready to use force if necessary. Judas' arrival was sudden and intentional, as he had made a secret agreement with the Sanhedrin to betray Jesus. (Matthew 26:47; Luke 22:47; John 18:2)

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. One of the twelve. See on Matthew 26:47; as also on multitude.

### Philip Schaff:
1. Mark 14:43.  Straightway. Mark’s favorite expression; the appearance of Judas and his band was sudden.
	 The scribes. Peculiar to Mark, as in other cases.
	

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "And the scribes  (κα των γραμματεων). Mark adds this item while John 18:3 mentions 'Pharisees.' It was evidently a committee of the Sanhedrin for Judas had made his bargain with the Sanhedrin (Mark 14:1; Matthew 26:3; Luke 22:2)."
2. "See discussion of the betrayal and arrest on Matthew 26:47-56 for details."

### John Gill:

2. "and with him a great multitude; a band of men and officers, with many of the chief priests and captains of the temple, and elders of the people, that mixed themselves with the crowd, to see how things would issue."
3. "with swords and staves; which they intended to make use of, should any resistance be made in apprehending him, or any attempt to rescue him."

### John Wesley:
