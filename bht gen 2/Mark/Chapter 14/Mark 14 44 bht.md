# Mark 14:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, the betrayer uses a mere kiss as a sign to identify Jesus. The purpose of this act was to ensure that Jesus would not escape from the hands of those seeking to arrest him. Interestingly, the term safely is excluded in some versions of the Bible, highlighting the act of betrayal and emphasizing the Jewish custom of using a kiss as a sign of identification.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
