# Mark 14:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As the betrayer approaches, he goes directly towards Jesus, leaving the company behind. This action seems to be a deliberate attempt to isolate Jesus from the others. With his repeated use of the word rabbi, he not only expresses his affection and respect for Jesus but also reinforces his authority. And ultimately, this display of affection leads to the infamous act of betrayal through the kiss. For further insight into this event, one can refer to Matthew 26:49 and Matthew 7:21-22.
