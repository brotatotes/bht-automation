# Mark 14:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus was about to be arrested, one of His disciples took out a sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear. This disciple is not specifically named in Mark's account, but in other Gospels, it is mentioned that it was one of the disciples who stood by Jesus. The servant's name was Malchus, and Jesus responded to this act by telling His disciple to put the sword away, highlighting the need to submit to God's will rather than resorting to violence.
