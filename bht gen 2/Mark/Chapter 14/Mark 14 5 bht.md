# Mark 14:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The value of the item that could have been sold was estimated to be around nine pounds and seven shillings. Instead of using the money to help the poor, Mary chose to pour it on the head of Christ. This action caused the people around her to murmur and express resentment towards her. They believed that the money could have been better spent on charitable acts.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence—between nine and ten pounds sterling."
2. "And they murmured against her 'This he said,' remarks John (John 12:6), and the remark is of exceeding importance, 'not that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief, and had the bag'—the scrip or treasure chest—'and bare what was put therein'—not 'bare it off' by theft, as some understand it."
3. "What a remarkable arrangement was this, by which an avaricious and dishonest person was not only taken into the number of the Twelve, but entrusted with the custody of their little property!"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Murmured [ενεβριμωντο] . See on Mark 1:43.

### Philip Schaff:
1. Mark 14:5.  And they murmured against her. Peculiar to Mark. The original seems to indicate a harsh address to Mary, though there was probably also a general murmur against her.
	

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Above three hundred pence (επανω δηναριων τριακοσιων)." 
2. "The use of 'far above' may be a detail from Peter's memory of Judas' objection whose name in this connection is preserved in John 12:4."
3. "And they murmured against her (κα ενεβριμωντο αυτη). Imperfect tense of this striking word used of the snorting of horses and seen already in Mark 1:43; Mark 11:38."

### John Gill:
1. "It might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, to the value of our money nine pounds, seven shillings, and sixpence."
