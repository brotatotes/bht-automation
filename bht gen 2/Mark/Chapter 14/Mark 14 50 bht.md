# Mark 14:50 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During a time of great adversity, Jesus experienced the painful reality that his disciples forsook him and fled. It is specifically noted that it was his disciples who deserted him, as indicated by the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, Arabic, Persic, and Ethiopic versions. This emphasizes the abandonment of Jesus by those who had been closest to him, highlighting the depth of his suffering and isolation. The mention of the multitude whom Christ addressed serves to clarify that it was the disciples' abandonment, rather than that of the larger crowd, that is being focused on in this particular passage.
