# Mark 14:51 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A young man, not one of Christ's disciples, whose nakedness was covered by a piece of linen, ran out in response to the noise. The actions of this young man, not mentioned in any other Gospel, serve to illustrate the fierce rage and fury of those who sought Jesus and his followers. The disciples, protected by the extraordinary power of Christ, were spared from the relentless persecution displayed by these assailants.

3. "For it is probable that the young man, who is mentioned, had some attachment to Christ, and, on hearing the tumult by night, without stopping to put on his clothes, and covered only with a linen garment, came either to discover their traps, or, at least, that he might not be wanting in a duty of friendship."

"The word 'body', is not in the text, and the phrase επι γυμνου, may be rendered, 'upon his nakedness'; and answers to ערות, in Genesis 9:23 and Leviticus 20:11, and the meaning be, he had only a piece of linen wrapped about his middle, to cover his nakedness; and in this garb ran out, to see what was doing."
2. "The Roman soldiers...attempted to lay hold on this young man, taking him to be a disciple of Christ, or one at least affected to him, and did take hold of his linen cloth."
