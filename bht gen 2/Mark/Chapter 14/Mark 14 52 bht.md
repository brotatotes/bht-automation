# Mark 14:52 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the account found in Mark 14:52, a young man is depicted fleeing from the scene of Jesus' arrest, leaving his clothing behind. Bengel suggests that his modesty was overcome by fear in the face of this great danger. Some versions of the Bible omit the phrase from them, while the discussion surrounding the nature of the garment left behind suggests it may have been a linen cloth, commonly used for burial, or even a fine sheet or shirt. This incident raises questions about the identity of the young man and the significance of his sudden departure.
