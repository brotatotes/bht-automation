# Mark 14:54 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Peter followed Jesus from a distance, another disciple, possibly John, accompanied him. Both of them wanted to remain unnoticed and out of harm's way. Peter, not wanting to be associated with Jesus, sat among the servants and tried to blend in. He sought warmth and comfort from the fire, as the Greek word for fire can also mean light. This use of light and fire is significant because fire is symbolic of purification and punishment, such as the fire of hell and the fires of worship in ancient times.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The usage of φῶς for a fire is found in Xen. Cyr. vii. 5. 27"


### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The graphic details, here omitted, are supplied in the other Gospels."
2. "His wishing to 'see the end,' or issue of these proceedings, was what led him into the palace, for he evidently feared the worst."
3. "From this mode of replying, it is evident that our Lord saw the attempt to draw Him into self-crimination, and resented it by falling back upon the right of every accused party to have some charge laid against Him by competent witnesses."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The verb With the participle denoting continuousness. What occurred after occurred while he was sitting."

### Philip Schaff:
1. Mark 14:54. Warmed himself in the light of the Are. Lit, ‘in the light’ (comp. Luke 22:55-56). The open fire in the court gave light, and Peter was recognized by the light of the fire (Mark 14:67), comp, also John 18:15-16; John 18:18.
	

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Peter had followed him afar off." (Hο Πετρος απο μακροθεν ηκολουθησεν αυτω). Here Mark uses the constative aorist (ηκολουθησεν) where Matthew 26:58, and Luke 22:54 have the picturesque imperfect (ηκολουθε), was following.
2. "Possibly Mark did not care to dwell on the picture of Peter furtively following at a distance, not bold enough to take an open stand with Christ as the Beloved Disciple did, and yet unable to remain away with the other disciples."
3. "Warming himself in the light" (θερμαινομενος πρως το φως). Direct middle. Fire has light as well as heat and it shone in Peter's face. He was not hidden as much as he supposed he was.

### John Gill:
1. "And Peter followed him afar off,.... And did another disciple, perhaps John; John 18:15, who having somewhat recovered themselves from their fright, turned back, and followed Jesus, and the company that led him away; keeping at some distance, that they might not be observed, and exposed to danger..." 
2. "...he sat with the servants; as if he was one of them, and had no concern with Jesus:and warmed himself at the fire; or "light", as the Greek word signifies..." 
3. "So we read i of אור של גיהנם, "the fire of hell"; and Ur of the Chaldees has its name from the fire, that was worshipped there, as a symbol of the sun: and fire was the אור, or "light", created on the first day..."
