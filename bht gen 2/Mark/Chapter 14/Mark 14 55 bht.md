# Mark 14:55 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The accusers were determined to find a valid charge against Jesus to bring before Pilate, even though they knew they had no substantial evidence. They overlooked their own rules, seeking witnesses who would align with their purpose rather than seeking the truth. Their ultimate goal was to fabricate a crime that would warrant Jesus' death. This desperate attempt highlights the providence of God, as His plan for redemption was being fulfilled even in the face of false accusations.
