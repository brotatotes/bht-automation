# Mark 14:56 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Their testimonies did not agree with each other, which made it clear that their witness was false. According to the law, witnesses were required to be in full agreement or their testimony would be deemed invalid. The testimonies they presented were not enough to prove a serious accusation against him. These witnesses only focused on minor and insignificant matters, and their testimonies did not support charges of blasphemy or sedition. The evidences they provided were not sufficient to justify their desired outcome.
