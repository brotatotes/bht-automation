# Mark 14:57 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
At the trial, two false witnesses came forward, while others also attempted to testify against him. The need for duplicate testimonies stemmed from the fact that previous witnesses had never agreed on anything. Finally, these deceptive testimonies were brought forward, contradicting the truth and attempting to incriminate Jesus. It is important to note that credible witnesses should always remain standing while speaking the truth.
