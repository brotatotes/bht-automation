# Mark 14:58 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Despite the eagerness of His enemies to find fault with Him, they could only go back to the beginning of His ministry, three years prior, to find something to accuse Him of. Even then, they fixated on just a few words that they dared to use against Him. It is clear that the religious leaders prosecuting Him did not truly believe that was He was claiming. This alludes to an earlier statement Jesus made about the temple of His body. Their attempt to find fault in Him actually served as silent affirmation of His impeccable conduct.
