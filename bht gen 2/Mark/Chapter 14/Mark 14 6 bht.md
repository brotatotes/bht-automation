Jesus, in response to the criticism directed towards the woman, commanded, Let her alone. He instructed them to cease from chiding and reproving her for her actions. Jesus questioned why they would trouble her, causing her grief and accusing her of imprudence and extravagance. Instead, Jesus emphasized that the woman had done him an honor by expressing her faith and demonstrating her love, deserving commendation rather than reproach.
