# Mark 14:60 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The high priest, surrounded by the council, confronted Jesus in the midst, demanding an answer to the accusations brought against Him. Despite the numerous witnesses, Jesus remained silent, refusing to engage in any defense. The high priest, seeking to extract a confession, directly questioned Jesus, asking if the accusations were true or false. This intense questioning took place with the high priest seated at the head of the council, while the members sat in a semicircular formation, creating a setting of authority and judgment. (Mark 14:60)
