# Mark 14:61 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Knowing that responding would be futile and not dignifying the unworthy accusations against him, Jesus chose to remain silent. The term the holy blessed he, which is commonly used to address God in Jewish writings, highlights His divine nature and the source of all blessing. In this context, Jesus' silence speaks volumes, emphasizing the insignificance of the questions posed to him.
