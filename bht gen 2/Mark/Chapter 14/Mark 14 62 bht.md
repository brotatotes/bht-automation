# Mark 14:62 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
And Jesus said, 'I am the Son of God,' affirming the divine nature within him. He further reveals that they will witness the fulfillment of this truth, as they will see 'the son of man sitting on the right hand of power,' and 'coming in the clouds of heaven.' This points to the fulfillment of the prophecy found in Daniel 7:13, either at the destruction of Jerusalem or on the final day.
