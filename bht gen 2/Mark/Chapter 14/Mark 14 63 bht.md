# Mark 14:63 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Upon hearing what he perceived as blasphemy, the high priest expressed his horror by tearing his clothes, a symbolic act of distress. This response is comparable to the actions of the high priest in 2 Kings 18:37. Furthermore, the high priest questioned the need for additional witnesses, suggesting that he believed he had heard enough to make a judgment. His words imply that he did not see the necessity of seeking further evidence or testimonies.
