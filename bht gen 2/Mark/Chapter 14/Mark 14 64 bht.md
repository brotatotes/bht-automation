# Mark 14:64 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The religious leaders gathered to discuss the fate of Jesus. They asked for a verdict, wanting to hear what the people thought should happen to him. They condemned him to be guilty of a capital crime, deserving death according to the Jewish law. It is worth noting that Joseph of Arimathea was not present, as he did not consent to Jesus' death, and Nicodemus was apparently absent as well, possibly excluded due to his previous sympathy for Jesus. Overall, it is clear that all those present voted for Jesus' death, except for Joseph of Arimathea.
