# Mark 14:65 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The men who held him violently mocked Jesus, casting jeers at him and striking him with their fists. They blindfolded him, covering his face with a veil or linen cloth, and demanded him to prophesy. This cruel treatment fulfilled the prophecy in Isaiah 50:6, where it was foretold that he would endure being struck and have his back given to smiters.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The reading ἔλαβον is harsh in sense, but the coincidence of ἐλάμβανον in [47] [48] alli [49]. seems to stamp it with genuineness. The meaning must be ‘took Him in hand with,’ ‘treated Him with.’"
2. "Meyer understands it, took Him into custody, with …, for the further carrying out of the sentence against Him. But the unemphatic position of the verb seems to preclude this."
3. "Where D differs in unimportant points from the other Greek MSS., the difference appears to be traceable to the influence of Latin forms and constructions."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And the men that held Jesus mocked him"—or cast their jeers at Him.
2. "Ah! Well did He say prophetically, in that Messianic prediction which we have often referred to, 'I gave My back to the smiters, and My cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not My face from shame and spitting!'"
3. "This general statement is important, as showing that virulent and varied as were the recorded affronts put upon Him, they are but a small specimen of what He endured on that dark occasion."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Buffet. See on Matthew 26:67. Palms of their hands [ραπισμασιν] . An unclassical word, but used also by John (xix. 3). The word means blows."
2. "Did strike. Following the old reading, eballon. The Correct reading is elabon, received."
3. "Received him into custody."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The context (Mark 14:64) points to members of the Sanhedrin as engaged in this cruelty."
2. "The officers. Probably those who had been by the fire (Mark 14:54)."
3. "Received him with blows of their hands. The correct reading is thus translated, describing the conduct of the officers when they received Jesus again as their prisoner."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Put a veil around his face. Not in Matthew, but in Luke 22:64 where Revised Version translates περικαλυψαντες by 'blind-folded.'"
2. "All three Gospels give the jeering demand of the Sanhedrin: 'Prophesy' (προφητευσον), meaning, as Matthew and Luke add, thereby telling who struck him while he was blindfolded."
3. "With blows of their hands  (ραπισμασιν). The verb ραπιζω in Matthew 26:67 originally meant to smite with a rod. In late writers it comes to mean to slap the face with the palm of the hands."

### John Gill:
1. "The men that held him, Luke 22:6, fulfilling the prophecy in Isaiah 50:6."
2. "And to cover his face, with a veil, or linen cloth, to blindfold him."
3. "And to buffet him with their double fists, and to say unto him, prophesy."
