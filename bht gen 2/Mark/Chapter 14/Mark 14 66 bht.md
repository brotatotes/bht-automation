# Mark 14:66 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Matthew 26:69, Luke 22:56, and John 18:25, we read about the scene where Peter denied Jesus. It is important to note the word beneath used in these passages, which helps us understand the topography of the location. The courtyard, where the trial took place, was situated lower than the chambers surrounding it. Furthermore, one of the maids, possibly the same one mentioned by Matthew and Luke, approached Peter. Some translations even suggest that she may have been the daughter of the high priest. All these details provide a richer context to the unfolding events.
