# Mark 14:67 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Peter was warming himself by the fire, a woman noticed him and looked at him intently, recognizing him as the same person. She may have been prompted by someone from the high priest's household to pay attention to him, given that he was a stranger and appeared suspicious. The woman directly questioned Peter, stating that he was with Jesus of Nazareth, implying that he was one of His followers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "His demeanor and timidity, which must have attracted notice, as so generally happens, 'leading...to the recognition of him'." 
2. "The sense of this is given in John's report of it (John 18:17), 'Art not thou also one of this man's disciples?'"
3. "If so expressed in Peter's hearing—drawing upon him the eyes of every one that heard it...and compelling him to answer to it—that would explain the different forms of the report naturally enough."

### Philip Schaff:
1. Mark 14:67.  Thou also wast with the Nazarene, even Jesus. ‘Nazarene,’ used in contempt.
	

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Warming himself (θερμαινομενον). Mark mentions this fact about Peter twice (Mark 14:54; Mark 14:67) as does John (John 18:18; John 18:25). He was twice beside the fire."
2. "It is quite difficult to relate clearly the three denials as told in the Four Gospels. Each time several may have joined in, both maids and men."
3. "The Nazarene (του Ναζαρηνου). In Matthew 26:69 it is 'the Galilean.' A number were probably speaking, one saying one thing, another another."

### John Gill:
1. "And when she saw Peter warming himself... she looked upon him; very earnestly, knowing him to be the same." 
2. "She had let in at the motion of one, that was known in the high priest's family; and suspecting him, by being a stranger, and by his looks."
3. "[She] said, and thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth; that is, one of his disciples."
