# Mark 14:68 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter denied knowing Jesus, saying he did not understand what was being asked. He went out into the porch to consider his response, feeling surprised and confounded. The cock crowed, signaling the first time, but Peter did not take notice or recall what Jesus had previously told him. Perhaps he hoped he would not face another challenge or believed he would have the courage to withstand it.
