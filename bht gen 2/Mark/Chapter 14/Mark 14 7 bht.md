# Mark 14:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For ye have the poor with you always...and whensoever ye will ye may do them good. By feeding and clothing the poor, we have the opportunity to show them love and meet their physical needs. However, but me ye have not always reminds us that Jesus, in His bodily presence, would soon depart from His disciples. These words serve as a gentle hint of Jesus' upcoming departure, emphasizing the value and limited duration of His personal presence with them.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The agreement verbatim here of Matt. and John, whereas our narrative inserts the additional clause καὶ ὅταν θέλητε δύνασθε αὐτοὺς εὖ ποιῆσαι, is decisive against the idea that Mark compiled his account from the other two."
2. "In these words there appears to be a reproach conveyed to Judas, and perhaps an allusion to the office of giving to the poor being his."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For ye have the poor with you always—referring to Deuteronomy 15:11." 
2. "and whensoever ye will ye may do them good."
3. "but me ye have not always—a gentle hint of His approaching departure, by One who knew the worth of His own presence."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. And whensoever ye will, etc. Note Mark's amplification.

### Philip Schaff:
1. Mark 14:7.  Whensoever ye will ye can do them good.  Peculiar to Mark, but implied in the other accounts.
	

### John Gill:
1. "For ye have the poor with you always...and whensoever ye will ye may do them good." 
2. "By feeding them when hungry, clothing them when naked, and supplying them with the necessaries of life."
