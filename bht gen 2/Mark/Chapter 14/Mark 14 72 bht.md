# Mark 14:72 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter, deeply moved by his reflection on his denial of Christ and the weight of his sin, covered his head as a sign of mourning and shame. This act of veiling himself was a common practice among mourners, serving as a powerful expression of both the sorrow he felt and the sense of shame he carried. In this moment, Peter's overwhelming remorse led him to weep bitterly, fully recognizing his wrongdoing and expressing genuine repentance.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "he began to weep."
2. "addens flevit"
3. "casting or drawing his mantle over his head"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The most precious link, however, in the whole chain of circumstances in this scene is beyond doubt that 'look' of deepest, tenderest import reported by Luke alone."
2. "But the immediate cause of the blessed revulsion which made Peter 'weep bitterly' was, beyond all doubt, this heart-piercing 'look' which his Lord gave him."
3. "And remembering the Saviour's own words at the table, 'Simon, Simon, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat; but I prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not,' may we not say that this prayer fetched down all that there was in that look to pierce and break the heart of Peter, to keep it from despair, to work in it 'repentance unto salvation not to be repented of,' and at length, under other healing touches, to 'restore his soul?'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. When he thought thereon [επιβαλων] . From ejpi, upon, and, ballw, to throw. When he threw his thought upon it. ===Mr_15 CHAPTER XV Compare verses 1 - 5 with Matthew 27:1, Matthew 27:2, Matthew 27:11-14.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And when he thought thereon, he wept."
2. "Continued weeping is implied. The word translated 'thought thereon' means literally, 'casting on;' then casting it over, reflecting on it."
3. "The calling to mind was the momentary act of remembrance occasioned by the crowing of the cock, this the serious and continued reflection on the sin."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Called to mind (ανεμνησθη). First aorist passive indicative." 
2. "When he thought thereon (επιβαλων). Second aorist active participle of επιβαλλω. It is used absolutely here, though there is a reference to το ρημα above, the word of Jesus, and the idiom involves τον νουν so that the meaning is to put the mind upon something." 
3. "Wept (εκλαιεν). Inchoative imperfect, began to weep. Matthew 26:75 has the ingressive aorist εκλαυσεν, burst into tears."

### John Gill:
1. "Peter called to mind... the words of Christ, and on his sin in denying him, and on the aggravated circumstances of it."
2. "He cast his garment over his head, he veiled himself as mourners did, who covered their heads, and their faces, and even their lips."
3. "Peter... threw his garment over him, and he wept; as Matthew says, 'bitterly': being fully convinced of his sin, and heartily sorry for it."

### John Wesley:
1. And he covered his head — Which was a usual custom with mourners, and was fitly expressive both of grief and shame.
