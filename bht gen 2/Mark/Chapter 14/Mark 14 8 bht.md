# Mark 14:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Mary's actions were commendable because she did what she could, pouring out her heartfelt love and doing everything in her power to honor Jesus. Her act of anointing Jesus' body is significant, symbolizing her understanding, even if only partially, of his impending death. By anointing him in advance for burial, she anticipated the event and was ahead of those who failed to grasp the gravity of the moment. This act of Mary is Christ's affirmation and justification of her noble deed, an act that carried profound meaning beyond what others could comprehend.
