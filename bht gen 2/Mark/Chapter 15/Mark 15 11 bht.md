# Mark 15:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The crowd's fickleness is evident as they are easily persuaded by the religious leaders who employed various tactics and arguments to convince them. The people's preference for Barabbas, a murderer, over Jesus, the holy and just one, reveals their strong passion for political liberty. Notably, the religious leaders, including Caiaphas, played an active role in bringing about the death of Christ, driven by their envy, rage, and malice.
