# Mark 15:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The crowd, in a chorus of voices, continued their clamor, demanding the crucifixion of Christ once again. It is worth noting that they had already cried out in such a manner before, as Luke records in his account. The repetition of their call for crucifixion highlights the intensity and persistence of their desire for Christ to be put to death.
