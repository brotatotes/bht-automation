# Mark 15:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They put a purple robe on him, which was a color akin to royalty and what kings typically wore. This robe was meant to mock Jesus as a king, as they derided him with this mock purple robe. Additionally, Matthew recounts that they also placed a reed in his hand, symbolizing an impotent scepter, further ridiculing his supposed kingship. It is interesting to note that while Mark and John refer to the robe as purple, Matthew refers to it as scarlet, although both colors were often used interchangeably for royal garments.

2. "The staff must be a reed, the symbol of impotence; the crown must injure and pierce the brow; and so, too, must the purple present the symbol of miserable pretended greatness: and this was done by its being an old camp-mantle."
