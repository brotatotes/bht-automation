# Mark 15:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When faced with accusations of rivalry and revolution against Caesar, one must tread carefully, as even mere attention to the matter can invite charges. In a subsequent conversation, Jesus affirms the truth, stating, I am, which serves to satisfy Pilate's inquiry. This response holds significant weight, for it is the only question where Jesus' personal testimony becomes pivotal and necessary. His straightforward affirmation of being creates a pointed declaration.
