# Mark 15:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As they led him out of the city, they took off the purple robe he was wearing and put back on his own clothes. This was done so that people would recognize him as the same person. The soldiers who had the responsibility of executing him also benefited by being able to keep his clothes. Jesus was led out of the judgment hall and taken through the city to the usual place of crucifixion.
