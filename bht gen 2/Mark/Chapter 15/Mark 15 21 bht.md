# Mark 15:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The mention of Rufus, who is warmly greeted in the passage, suggests that he had become a prominent figure among the early Christians. It is noteworthy that Simon, who was compelled to carry Jesus' cross, is referred to as the father of Alexander and Rufus. This familial connection indicates that Simon's act of bearing the cross had a significant impact on his family, with Alexander and Rufus later becoming well-known Christians.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There is a Rufus saluted Romans 16:13."
2. "The words ἐρχόμ. ἀπʼ ἀγρ. determine nothing as to its being a working day or otherwise, any more than οἱ παραπορευόμενοι, Matthew 27:39: nothing is said as to the distance from whence he came."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Compel. Better impress, as Rev. in margin. See on Matthew 5:41. Note the accuracy in designating Simon.

### Philip Schaff:

2. "The father of Alexander and Rufus. Persons well known to the first readers of this Gospel."
3. "But the name was a common one. This 'Alexander,' can scarcely be the man put forward by the Jews at Ephesus, who may or may not be identical with the person mentioned in 1 Timothy 1:20; 2 Timothy 4:14."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They compel (αγγαρευουσιν). Dramatic present indicative again where Matthew 27:32 has the aorist." 
2. "Coming out of the country (ερχομενον απ' αγρου). Hence Simon met the procession."
3. "Luke adds 'after Jesus' (οπισθεν του Ιησου). But Jesus bore his own cross till he was relieved of it, and he walked in front of his own cross for the rest of the way."

### John Gill:
1. "And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian... to bear his cross."

### John Wesley:
