# Mark 15:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Mark's account suggests a sequence of events where Jesus was first nailed to the cross, then his garments were divided, and finally, the cross was erected. This aligns with the narratives found in Matthew, Luke, and John, which mention the crucifixion at Golgotha. The combined understanding of these accounts sheds light on the sequence of events leading to Jesus' crucifixion and provides a clearer picture of the circumstances surrounding his death.
