# Mark 15:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The timing details in the Gospel narratives pose a challenge in reconciling the sequence of events. Potential explanations include a difference in timing systems used by John compared to the other Evangelists or errors in copied texts. However, these variations do not undermine the authenticity or truthfulness of the accounts. It is important to acknowledge the honesty between the writers, as their differences suggest no collusion. While the precise timing remains uncertain, the essential message and significance of Jesus' sacrifice endure.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I own I see no satisfactory way of reconciling these accounts, unless there has been some very early erratum in our copies, or unless it can be shown from other grounds than the difficulty before us, that John‚Äôs reckoning of time differs from that employed in the other Evangelists."
2. "The difficulty is of a kind in no way affecting the authenticity of the narrative, nor the truthfulness of each Evangelist; but requires some solution to the furnishing of which we are not competent."
3. "Meanwhile the chronology of our text, as being carried on through the day, and as allowing time both for the trial, and the events of the crucifixion, is that which will I believe be generally concurred in."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Jews divided both the night and the day into four equal parts of three hours each."
2. "Mark professes to give the time accurately; John does not."
3. "Any other two men - any witnesses - might give just such an account now... and the circumstantial variation would 'prove' that there was no collusion, no agreement to 'impose' on a court - that they were honest witnesses."

### John Calvin:
1. "The whole time, from sunrise to the second part of the day, they called the first hour."
2. "The sixth hour commenced at noon, and lasted till three or four o‚Äôclock in the afternoon."
3. "It is highly probable that Christ did not hang on the cross longer than three hours."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A later hour would scarcely give time for all the incidents up to noon, at which time the darkness began."
2. "But John (John 19:14) says the final effort of Pilate to release Jesus, was ‚Äòabout the sixth hour.‚Äô"
3. "An apparent discrepancy of such long standing is a proof ( 1 ) that there was no collusion between the two writers, if the difference originally existed; ( 2 ) that those who have held these writings as sacred have been very honest, or such an apparent disagreement would have disappeared long ago."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  The third hour  (œâœÅŒ± œÑœÅŒπœÑŒ∑). This is Jewish time and would be nine A.M. The trial before Pilate was the sixth hour Roman time (John 19:14), six A.M. 

### John Gill:
1. "The time of the daily sacrifice of the morning, at which the priests ought to have been."
2. "This being an extraordinary case, and they in a hurry to put Jesus to death, had been sitting up all night."
3. "This was about nine o'clock in the morning, and takes in the time between that and twelve at noon."
