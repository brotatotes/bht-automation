# Mark 15:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The death of Jesus is marked by the superscription, or writing, on the top of the cross as an accusation against him. This accusation, which declares him to be the king of the Jews, stands out in all four accounts of the crucifixion. It is emphasized by Matthew and Mark as the sole charge against Jesus. The title given to Jesus on the cross is mentioned by John, adding further significance to the superscription.
