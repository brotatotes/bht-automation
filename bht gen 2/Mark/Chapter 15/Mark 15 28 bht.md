# Mark 15:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He was regarded as a sinner, bearing the sins of many, yet he himself was without sin. This passage, though contested by some scholars, highlights Jesus' perfect conformity to God's law. He lived a blameless life, utterly free from sin in every way. In a remarkable exchange, Jesus willingly took on the sins of humanity, assuming the role of a transgressor in order to satisfy God's justice. Through his death, he exemplified his holiness, innocence, and purity, becoming the just substitute for the unjust.
