# Mark 15:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The chief priests unleashed their venomous accusations against Jesus, accusing Him of being a magician, a blasphemer, claiming to be the Son of God, a self-proclaimed king, and stirring up discord and rebellion. Despite their accusations, Jesus chose to remain silent, refusing to respond to their false claims. This detail, which is present in the Greek text of the Complutensian edition and the Ethiopic version, aligns with Matthew's account in 27:12.
