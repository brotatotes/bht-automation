# Mark 15:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The darkness that covered the land from the sixth hour until the ninth hour as Jesus hung on the cross is more than just a natural phenomenon; it is a divine intervention with deep symbolism. It represents the forsakenness of Jesus by God, highlighting the weight and darkness of the sin he bore upon himself. This darkness serves as a powerful reminder of the severity and depth of Jesus' suffering on behalf of humanity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. Mark 15:33.  The sixth hour.  The form of the verse, as well as the connection, shows that our Lord had already hung for some time upon the cross (see Mark 15:25).
	

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The sixth hour (œâœÅŒ±œÇ ŒµŒ∫œÑŒ∑œÇ). That is, noon (Jewish time), as the third hour was nine A.M."

3. "We are not able to enter into the fulness of the desolation felt by Jesus at this moment as the Father regarded him as sin (2 Corinthians 5:21). This desolation was the deepest suffering."

### John Gill:
1. "Having hung upon the cross... there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour."
