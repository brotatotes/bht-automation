# Mark 15:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
At the ninth hour, Jesus loudly cried out, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? This cry, using the Syro-chaldaic form of the Hebrew ἡλί, demonstrates Jesus' reference to God as His own. It is significant that both Eli and Eloi are used interchangeably in Psalms 22:1. Moreover, the cry can be interpreted as Jesus claiming God as His own while lamenting the withdrawal of His Father's love and being treated as an enemy while carrying our sins upon Himself.
