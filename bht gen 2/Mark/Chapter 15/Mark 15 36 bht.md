# Mark 15:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The soldiers mocked Jesus on the cross, one even suggesting that they should wait and see if Elijah would come to save him. In this moment, Jesus, aware of his own thirst, fulfilled the prophecy in Psalms 69:21. The difference in accounts between Matthew and Mark may reflect different aspects of the same conversation, where the soldiers taunted Jesus with the idea that Elijah would come and take him down from the cross.
