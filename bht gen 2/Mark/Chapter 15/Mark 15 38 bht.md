# Mark 15:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus breathed his last breath on the cross, the vail of the temple was rent in twain, from the top to the bottom. Simultaneously, an earthquake occurred, causing the rocks to be rent and graves to be opened. The tearing of the veil signifies that all now have direct access into the Holy of Holies, symbolizing the fulfillment of God's plan through the sacrificial death of Jesus. This seismic event serves as a powerful reminder of God's immense power and his offer of grace and mercy to all who seek Him.
