# Mark 15:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Matthew 27:56, we encounter three women present at the crucifixion: Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the less, and Salome. Mary Magdalene, who had received great favors from Christ, was among the women who remained faithful throughout his crucifixion. Meanwhile, Mary, also known as the mother of James the less, is distinguished from another Mary to avoid confusion. Salome, who is the mother of Zebedee's sons James and John, shares a common name among the Jews. These details offer insight into the diverse individuals who witnessed the significant event of Christ's crucifixion.
