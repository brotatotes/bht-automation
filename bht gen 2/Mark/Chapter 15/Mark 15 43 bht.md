## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἐλθών, or ἦλθεν, is common to Matt., Mark, and John, but in different connexion."
2. "εὐσχήμων probably in its later sense of noble, ‘honourable,’ i.e. in station."
3. "τολμήσας εἰς ., characteristic of Mark’s narrative."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'honorable,' here, is not a mere title of 'office,' but is given in reference to his personal character, as being a man of integrity and blameless life."
2. "But this expression means more than an 'indefinite' expectation that the Messiah 'would' come, for all the Jews expected that. It implies that he believed 'Jesus' to be the Messiah, and that he had 'waited' for Him to build up the kingdom of God."
3. "To avow attachment for him now was proof of sincere affection; and the Holy Spirit has thought this worthy of special notice, and has set down this bold attachment of a senator for Jesus for our imitation."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Joseph, he from Arimathaea: the article indicating a man well known." 
2. "In its earlier use this adjective would, therefore, emphasize the dignified external appearance and deportment." 
3. "Daring all possible consequences."

### Philip Schaff:

3. "Came... having come, i.e., to the scene of the crucifixion... He had probably seen the breaking of the legs of the other two, and was aware of the request of the Jews that the bodies should be taken down." (Mark 15:43)

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A councillor of honourable estate (ευσχημων βουλευτης). A senator or member of the Sanhedrin of high standing, rich (Matthew 27:57)."
2. "Looking for the Kingdom of God (ην προσδεχομενος την βασιλειαν του θεου). Periphrastic imperfect. Also Luke 23:51. The very verb used by Luke of Simeon and Anna (Luke 2:25; Luke 2:38)."
3. "Boldly (τολμησας). Aorist (ingressive) active participle, becoming bold. It is the glory of Joseph and Nicodemus, secret disciples of Jesus, that they took a bold stand when the rest were in terror and dismay. That is love psychology, paradoxical as it may seem."
