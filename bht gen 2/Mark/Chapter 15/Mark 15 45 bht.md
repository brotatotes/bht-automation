# Mark 15:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The centurion's confirmation that Jesus was dead left no room for doubt. With this assurance, Pilate granted Joseph permission to take Jesus' body from the cross and bury it. This act of giving the body to Joseph was significant, as it demonstrated Pilate's satisfaction with the confirmation of Jesus' death. The centurion's report and Pilate's decision allowed Joseph to properly inter the body of Jesus.
