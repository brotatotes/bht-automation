# Mark 15:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Joseph, accompanied by others, took the body of Christ down from the cross and wrapped him in linen, according to Jewish custom. They then laid him in a sepulchre that was carved out of a rock. Joseph's act of rolling a stone in front of the tomb was likely done with the help of his servants, as it would have been too large for him to move alone.
