# Mark 15:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The two Marys followed Jesus and carefully observed where he was laid, witnessing his death and burial. They remained faithful even in the midst of their shattered hopes and dreams, sitting in silent contemplation as shadows fell upon them. They watched Joseph and Nicodemus, and even saw the body of Jesus being carried and laid to rest. These two women were loyal witnesses of Jesus' life, death, and eventual resurrection from the dead.
