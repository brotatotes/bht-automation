# Mark 15:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Pilate, recognizing the envy of the religious leaders, was convinced of Jesus' innocence. Yet, Jesus remained silent, refusing to defend Himself. Pilate marveled at Jesus' self-control in the face of such false accusations. The meaning of his silence was perplexing to Pilate, as Jesus was fully capable of defending Himself and was clearly innocent. This silence placed Jesus in great danger, as Pilate believed that speaking up in His defense could have easily resolved the situation.
