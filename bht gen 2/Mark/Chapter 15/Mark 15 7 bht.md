# Mark 15:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Barabbas had a significant role in the insurrection, being the leader among a group of murderers. This marked him as a desperate criminal who had engaged in sedition and rebellion against the Roman authorities. The choice of Barabbas over Jesus by the priests and people exemplifies their preference for a known criminal. The term fellow-rioters emphasizes the shared involvement in this act of rebellion. Pilate, as a Roman governor, would have been particularly concerned with addressing the crime of insurrection, making Barabbas and his actions of great significance in this context.
