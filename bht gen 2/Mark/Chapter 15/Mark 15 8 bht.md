# Mark 15:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The crowd gathered at the judgment seat, echoing the customary action of desiring a prisoner to be released, as Pilate had done in the past during the Passover festival. The scene captures the authenticity of the mob's request, as they demonstrated their expectation for Pilate to continue this tradition. One version suggests that the multitude went up to the pavement where the judgment seat was, while another maintains that the crowd cried aloud. The choice between the two readings may lean towards the latter.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This is also peculiar to Mark in Matt. it is Pilate who first offers them the choice"
2. "αἰτεῖσθαι καθώς i.e. αὐτοῖς ποιεῖν, καθώς."
3. "ἀναβάς probably implies the rising of the crowd in excitement or perhaps their coming up towards the palace."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Crying aloud [αναβοησας] . But the best texts read ajnabav, having gone up. So Rev., went up. Ever [αει] . Omitted by the best texts.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This picture of the mob in Jerusalem is true to the life."
2. "The crowd collected, partly to see the trial, partly to call for the usual release of a prisoner, partly to be in a crowd, as is always the case on festival occasions."
3. "Pilate proposed to the rulers the choice between Jesus and Barabbas (Matthew, Luke), but the mob had probably already desired the latter as a political prisoner."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  As he was wont to do unto them  (καθως εποιε αυτοις). Imperfect of customary action again and dative case. 

### John Gill:
1. "And the multitude crying aloud, began to desire [him to do] as he had ever done to them: that is, release a prisoner to them, as he had done at every passover, since he had been a governor over them."
2. "The Vulgate Latin and Ethiopic versions read, and when the 'multitude,' or 'people went up', to the place called the pavement, where the judgment seat was; and so it is read in Beza's most ancient copy; but the former reading is to be preferred."
