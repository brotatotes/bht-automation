# Mark 15:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The account here diverges from Matthew's and aligns with John 18:39, emphasizing the contrast between Jesus and Barabbas. This contrast is made clear through the mention of Jesus as The King of the Jews in the charge. Matthew 27:17 confronts the people with a choice between Barabbas and Jesus, further highlighting the differences. Despite recognizing Jesus' innocence and being inclined to release him, the one making the charge scoffs at both Jesus and the crowd. This attempt to appease them only serves to enrage, raising questions about the absence of justice, courage, or basic wisdom in the decision-making process.
