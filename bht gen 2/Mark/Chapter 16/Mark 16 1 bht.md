# Mark 16:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the Sabbath was over, the women—Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome—bought spices in order to come and anoint Jesus. This purchase occurred after sunset, when it was no longer the Sabbath. The act of anointing the body with spices after death was a reverential tradition amongst the Jews. There was even a specific market in Jerusalem where different types of spices could be purchased for this purpose.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It was strictly when the Sabbath was ended, i.e. at sunset, that they bought the spices." 
2. "Luke 23:55, places it on the evening before the Sabbath; a slight but valuable discrepancy, as shewing the independence of the accounts." 
3. "To suppose two parties of women (Greswell) or to take ἠγόρασαν as pluperfect (Beza, Grotius, &c.) is equally arbitrary and unwarranted." 
4. "This had not been done as yet. Nicodemus (Joh 19:40) had only wrapped the Body hurriedly in the spices with the linen clothes."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And when the sabbath was past...Mary Magdalene...and Mary the mother of James...and Salome...had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him."
2. "The word is simply 'bought.' But our translators are perhaps right in rendering it here 'had bought,' since it would appear, from Matthew 27:56- :, that they had purchased them immediately after the Crucifixion...and that they had only deferred using them to anoint the body till the sabbath rest should be over."
3. "On this 'anointing,' see on Matthew 27:56- :."

### John Calvin:
1. "The meaning is the same as in Matthew, In the evening, which began to dawn towards the first day of the Sabbaths, and in Luke, on the first day of the Sabbaths."
2. "We ought also to recollect what I have formerly suggested, that the custom of anointing the dead, though it was common, among many heathen nations, was applied to a lawful use by the Jews alone, to whom it had been handed down by the Fathers, to confirm them in the faith of the resurrection."
3. "For himself, he needed not those aids, but they were owing to the ignorance of the women, who were not yet fully aware that he was free from corruption."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Luke 22:56 does not necessarily imply that the preparation of spices took place on Friday, before the beginning of the Sabbath."
2. "The resting on the Sabbath is expressly affirmed by Luke."
3. "Nicodemus (John 19:39-40) had done this in a necessarily hasty manner."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "When the sabbath was past, the sabbath having come in between, and now over." 
2. "It was therefore after sunset. Bought spices." 
3. "It was to be a reverential anointing of the body of Jesus with spices."

### John Gill:
1. "Not 'when it was the Sabbath', as the Arabic version reads; for it was not lawful to buy spices, and anoint with on the Sabbath day."
2. "They might buy more for the same purpose, after the Sabbath was over: for this there was a particular market at Jerusalem; for we are told, that 'there were there three markets, one by another; in the first of which were sold, all kinds of precious things, silks, and embroidered work; in the second, various kinds of fruits and herbs; and in the third, all kinds of spices.'"
3. "Though they came to anoint his body; for this was one of the things which was customary in Israel to do to dead men."
