# Mark 16:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the disciples heard the report that Christ was raised from the dead and was certainly alive, they believed not, possibly thinking they were deceived by a mere apparition. Their disbelief stemmed from their forgetfulness of the words of Jesus, which had been repeated to them many times. This lack of belief demonstrated that nothing but the clearest evidence could convince them of Jesus' resurrection. Even though the women's testimony aligned with what Jesus had taught, the disciples remained stubbornly skeptical, refusing to accept the truth.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

### John Calvin:
1. "But the disciples must have been held bound by shameful indifference, so that they did not recall to their recollection that what they had often heard from their Master was accomplished."
2. "If the women had related any thing of which they had not formerly heard, there would have been some reason for not immediately believing them in a matter which was incredible; but now they must have been uncommonly stupid in holding as a fable or a dream what had been so frequently promised and declared by the Son of God, when eye-witnesses assured them that it was accomplished."
3. "Their unbelief having deprived them of sound understanding, they not only refuse the light of truth, but reject it as an idle fancy."

### Philip Schaff:
