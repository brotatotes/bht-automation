# Mark 16:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After these things, Jesus appeared in another form, not as they walked, but as they sat at meat. The disciples did not at first recognize him, for their eyes were holden by the Lord. This appearance took place on the journey to Emmaus, revealing the subtle and profound way in which Jesus made himself known to his followers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

2. "It was not as they walked, but as they sat at meat that He was manifested to them."
3. "ἐν ἑτέρᾳ μορφῇ a slight difference from Luke 24:15-16, which relates as the reason why they did not know Him, that their eyes were holden, his being in his usual form being declared by αὐτὸς ὁ Ἰησοῦς: but see notes there."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Marvin Vincent:
1. After these things [μετα ταυτα] . An expression never used by Mark. Another form [ετερα μορφη] . More correctly, a different form.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "After these things. This expression, peculiar to this section, marks definitely a second appearance, after the 'first' (Mark 16:9)."
2. "'Their eyes were holden.' But there was some actual difference in the bodily appearance of our Lord."
3. "The manifestation took place at the close of the walk, but this is the language of brevity."
