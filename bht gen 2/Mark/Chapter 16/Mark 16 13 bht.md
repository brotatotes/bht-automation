# Mark 16:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples who had remained in Jerusalem did not believe the testimony of those who had encountered Jesus on the road to Emmaus. Despite the repeated accounts and even Jesus himself joining them on the way, their state of mind was still one of doubt and disbelief. A conflict between doubt and belief was to be expected, and there may have been a division of opinion among the disciples, with some still doubting and others starting to believe. These disciples were not yet fully convinced and remained hesitant to accept the reality of Jesus' resurrection.
