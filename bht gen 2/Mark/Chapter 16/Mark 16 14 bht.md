# Mark 16:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After the resurrection, the disciples were gathered together, possibly not for a meal but to discuss the recent events. The appearance of Jesus surprised and shocked them, as they were still struggling with doubt and unbelief. Jesus scolded them for their hardened hearts and lack of faith, even though they were remorseful and sorrowful for their previous actions. Despite their initial unbelief, the disciples eventually became witnesses of the Risen Christ, a powerful testimony to the transformative power of encountering the resurrected Jesus.
