# Mark 16:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our Lord's commission is without limitations or restrictions, encompassing all nations and every creature. This mission extends beyond the apostles to all ministers of the Gospel throughout history. The command to preach to every creature was particularly provocative to the Jews. If there are those who have not heard the Gospel, it is due to the failure of either the preachers or the hearers. We see a parallel in Matthew 28:19.
