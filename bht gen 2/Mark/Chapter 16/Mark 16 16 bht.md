# Mark 16:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believing in the gospel is not just about agreeing with its teachings, but about a deep spiritual conviction that recognizes the value and sufficiency of Christ as our Savior. This faith should come before baptism, as seen in the words of Jesus and the examples in Scripture. Those who truly believe should be baptized as a proof of their faith and obedience to Christ. On the other hand, those who do not believe, whether baptized or not, will face everlasting perishment.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "These past participles must be noticed, as carrying on the thought to a time beyond the work of the preacher: when σωθ . and κατακρ . shall take place; and reserving the division of mankind into these two classes, till that day."
2. "Unbelief by which is meant the rejection of the gospel in heart and life, not weakness or doubt as in Mar 16:14 shall condemn a man, whether baptized or unbaptized. And, conversely, it follows that our Lord does not set forth here the absolute, but only the general necessity of Baptism to salvation; as the Church of England also teaches."
3. "These words cannot be taken, as those in Matthew 28:19-20, as setting forth the order in which faith and baptism must always come; belief and disbelief are in this verse the great leading subjects, and πιστεύσας must on that account stand first."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Baptism is here put for the external signature of the inner faith of the heart..."
2. "... this outward manifestation, once mentioned as the proper fruit of faith, is not repeated in what follows..."
3. "These awful issues of the reception or rejection of the Gospel, though often recorded in other connections, are given in this connection only by Mark."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He that believeth - That is, believeth the gospel. 'He who credits it to be true, and acts as if it were true.' This is the whole of faith."
2. "Faith is feeling and acting as if there were a God, a Saviour, a heaven, a hell; as if we were sinners and must die; as if we deserved eternal death and were in danger of it; and, in view of all, casting our eternal interests on the mercy of God in Christ Jesus."
3. "It is worthy of remark that Jesus has made 'baptism' of so much importance. He did not say, indeed, that a man could not be saved without baptism, but he has strongly implied that where this is neglected 'knowing it to be a command of the Saviour,' it endangers the salvation of the soul."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word is a judicial term, and, as Dr. Morison truthfully says, 'determines, by itself, nothing at all concerning the nature, degree, or extent of the penalty to be endured.'"
2. "See on the kindred noun, krima, judgment, rendered by A. V. damnation, 1 Corinthians 11:29."
3. "Rev., rightly, condemned."

### John Calvin:
1. "This promise was added in order to allure all mankind to believe; as it is followed, on the other hand, by a threatening of awful destruction, in order to terrify unbelievers."
2. "Baptism is joined to the faith of the gospel, in order to inform us that the Mark of our salvation is engraved on it; for had it not served to testify the grace of God, it would have been improper in Christ to have said, that they who shall believe and be baptized shall be saved."
3. "By this second clause in which Christ condemns those who shall not believe, he means that rebels, when they reject the salvation offered to them, draw down upon themselves severer punishment, and not only are involved in the general destruction of mankind, but bear the guilt of their own ingratitude."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The belief is belief in Jesus of Nazareth, crucified and risen again, as an all-sufficient Personal Saviour, It is belief of the gospel (Mark 16:15), because the gospel presents Christ."
2. "Baptism is generally but not absolutely necessary to salvation. It is not said: He that believeth not and is not baptized will be condemned."
3. "Nothing can be proved from this passage as to the order in which faith and baptism must always come. In Matthew 28:19-20, it is altogether different."


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The omission of baptized with 'disbelieveth' would seem to show that Jesus does not make baptism essential to salvation."
2. "Condemnation rests on disbelief, not on baptism. So salvation rests on belief."
3. "Baptism is merely the picture of the new life, not the means of securing it."

### John Gill:
1. "Not notionally only, or that gives a bare assent to the truth of the Gospel; but spiritually, who sees Christ, his need of him, and the worth and excellency, suitableness and fulness of him."
2. "Faith must precede baptism, as these words of Christ, and Scripture examples show; and such as have it, ought to make a profession of it, and be baptized."
3. "He that truly believes, ought to be baptized, and prove the truth of his faith, by his obedience to Christ, and such shall be saved."

### John Wesley:
1. And is baptized — In token thereof. Every one that believed was baptized.But he that believeth not — Whether baptized or unbaptized, shall perish everlastingly.
