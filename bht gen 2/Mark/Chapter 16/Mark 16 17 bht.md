# Mark 16:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
And these signs shall follow them that believe, signs that are necessary for confirming the Gospel and establishing Christianity in the world, signs that demonstrate the power and authority of Christ, signs that encompass various miraculous operations, including the casting out of devils and the ability to speak with new tongues, foreign languages they had never learned or understood before. These signs are not limited to the Apostolic times but extend to all Christians, even today, for the power of faith, though latent in many, continues to possess a miraculous ability through the effects of prayer.

2. "The meaning, therefore, is, that believers will be ministers of the same power which had formerly excited admiration in Christ, that during his absence the sealing of the gospel may be more fully ascertained, as he promises that they will do the same things, and greater."
3. "And certainly it was proper that men of eager curiosity, who, not satisfied with lawful proof, were every day asking new miracles, should be carried away by such impostures. This is the reason why Christ, in another passage, foretold that the reign of Antichrist would be full of lying signs."
