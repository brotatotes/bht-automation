In the Bible, believers are promised the ability to handle serpents without harm and drink deadly substances without being affected.

The practice of laying hands on the sick is also mentioned, showcasing the power of faith and healing through apostles like Peter and Paul. These examples demonstrate the potential for divine intervention and the importance of trusting in God's providence in difficult and challenging circumstances.
