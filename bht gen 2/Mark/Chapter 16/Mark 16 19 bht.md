# Mark 16:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After the Lord Jesus had spoken to his disciples, he was received up into heaven. This great truth of his ascension is related as a fact, not just in the Gospel history, but also as a manifestation of his exalted state in glory. Being seated at the right hand of God signifies that Jesus is exalted to the highest honor, a dignity that is unique to his human nature in union with his divine person. The Ascension, serving as the completion of his resurrection, marks his return to his Father's presence and the beginning of his eternal reign. (95 words)
