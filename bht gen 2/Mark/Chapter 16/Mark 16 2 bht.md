# Mark 16:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Very early, while it was still dark, they set out towards the tomb. As the sun began to rise and it grew light enough for them to see, they arrived to find the stone rolled away. Mary wasted no time and went to call Peter and John, and by the time they arrived and examined the tomb, the sun was fully risen.
