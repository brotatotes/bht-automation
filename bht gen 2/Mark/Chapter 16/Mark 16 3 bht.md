# Mark 16:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the women approached the sepulchre, their main concern was who would remove the stone that sealed it. They were aware of the size of the stone and the difficulty it posed, but little did they know that God had already taken care of it. They were unaware of the additional challenge of Pilate sealing the stone and stationing soldiers as guards. Despite their concerns, God had already prepared the way for them and removed the obstacle before they arrived.
