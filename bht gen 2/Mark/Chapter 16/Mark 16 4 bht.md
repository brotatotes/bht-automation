# Mark 16:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As they looked up, they noticed that the stone had been rolled away from the entrance of the sepulchre. It wasn't just a minor movement; it was clear that the stone had been moved some distance from its original position. The sheer size of the stone was noteworthy, making it impossible to miss. Its significant size raised questions in their minds about who could have possibly rolled it away. The sight of the rolled stone gave them a sense of relief and joy, knowing that someone had indeed opened the tomb.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "Looking up... absorbed in their conversation; the tomb was probably above them, cut horizontally in the face of the rock at a slight elevation."
2. "They see that the stone is rolled back... as if it had rested in a hollow at the door of the tomb."
3. "This does not mean that the greatness of the stone was the reason of their anxiety and questioning, although this was doubtless true, but that its size enabled them to notice the position even in the early morning."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Looking up they see...they had been walking up the hill." 
2. "Their problem is solved for the stone lies rolled back before their very eyes."
3. "Mark explains by the size of the stone this sudden and surprising sight right before their eyes."

### John Gill:
1. "They saw that the stone was rolled away; they perceived it lay at some distance from the door of the sepulchre, which doubtless was very grateful, and matter of rejoicing to them."
2. "For it was very great; these words are to be read in connection with the preceding verse; for they are not a reason, why when they looked towards the sepulchre, they saw the stone rolled because it was a very large one, and so easily to be seen at a distance."
3. "But a reason why they were so thoughtful and concerned, who should roll it away for them, it being so big, that they could not think that they were able to do it themselves."
