# Mark 16:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The large sepulchers of the Jews had entrances that allowed people to go inside and see where the graves and bodies were. In this case, the disciples entered the sepulcher and saw a young man. This young man was an angel, as angels often appeared in the form of humans. This account of the resurrection strengthens the evidence for the general fact that Jesus rose from the dead, as it is independent and provides different details of the incident.
