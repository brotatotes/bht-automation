# Mark 16:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do not be afraid, the angel reassures them, echoing a stronger word than Fear not in Matthew. The angel identifies Jesus as the Nazarene, the Crucified, emphasizing the significance of the Savior they are seeking. He is risen and not present in the tomb, inviting them to witness the empty place where Jesus was laid. This repetition of the message demonstrates its importance and confirms the truth of Christ's resurrection.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This word implies that the angel accompanied the women into the tomb; and if so, an imperfect narrative like that in the text might easily describe his whole appearance as taking place within."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Be not affrighted‚Äîa stronger word than 'Fear not' in Matthew." 
2. "Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified!‚Äî'the Nazarene, the Crucified.'"
3. "He is risen; he is not here‚Äîbehold the place where they laid him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Be not amazed."
2. "This is probably not identical with the message in Matthew 28:5-7, given outside the tomb, but a second one (reported by Luke also), which is, however, substantially a repetition of the previous one."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This description of his shame has become his crown of glory, for Paul (Galatians 6:14), and for all who look to the Crucified and Risen Christ as Savior and Lord."
2. "He is risen (Œ∑Œ≥ŒµœÅŒ∏Œ∑). First aorist passive indicative, the simple fact. In 1 Corinthians 15:4 Paul uses the perfect passive indicative ŒµŒ≥Œ∑Œ≥ŒµœÅœÑŒ± to emphasize the permanent state that Jesus remains risen."
3. "Behold the place  (ŒπŒ¥Œµ Œø œÑŒøœÄŒøœÇ). Here ŒπŒ¥Œµ is used as an interjection with no effect on the case (nominative). In Matthew 28:6 ŒπŒ¥ŒµœÑŒµ is the verb with the accusative."

### John Gill:
1. And he saith unto them, be not affrighted,.... :-, :-, where the same things, and almost in the same words, are said as here.
