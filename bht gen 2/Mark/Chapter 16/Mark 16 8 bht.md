# Mark 16:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The women hurriedly left the tomb, filled with a mix of awe and fear, and did not immediately share what they had witnessed. Their emotions were a blend of trembling, amazement, and joy upon hearing the news of Christ's resurrection. While they were afraid to speak of these things to anyone other than the disciples, their fear of being accused of stealing Christ's body held them back from sharing the message more broadly. The speed at which they departed, leaving the tomb, is emphasized in some versions of the text, underscoring the urgency and astonishment they felt.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The women fled in terror from the sepulchre, and did not deliver the message at the time, for they were afraid."
2. "All attempts to reconcile this with the other Gospels are futile."
3. "An addition to the narrative of a compendious and supplementary character, bearing traces of another hand from that which has shaped the diction and construction of the rest of the Gospel."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For tremor and amazement seized them."
2. "How intensely natural and simple is this!"

1. "Astonishment [εκστασις]. See on Mark 5:42."
2. "The wonder merges into fear."
3. "By a large number of the ablest modern critics the remainder of this chapter is held to be from some other hand than Mark's."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For trembling and astonishment possessed them. This was the reason of their fleeing."
2. "The ‘fear’ spoken of by Matthew is made prominent here; joined with the fright from what they had seen was a fear that their reports would be (as they actually were) deemed ‘idle tales’ by the disciples (Luke 24:11)."
3. "The remarkable events of that day produced mingled and indeed confused emotions. To that of fear and indecision, Mark gives prominence. Even these faithful women were full of doubt: a fact that upsets all theories resembling the Jewish falsehood, mentioned by Matthew."

2. "This excitement was too great for ordinary conversation."
3. "The continued fear explains their continued silence."

2. "For they trembled and were amazed; at what they saw and heard, and yet this dread and fear were mixed with joy at the news of Christ's resurrection."
3. "Neither said they any thing to any man... They were afraid to tell any but the disciples of these things, for fear of the Jews; lest they should be thought to have stolen the body of Christ, and so be taken up on that account, and punished."
