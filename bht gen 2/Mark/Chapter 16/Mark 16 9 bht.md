# Mark 16:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Mary Magdalene arrived at the tomb and was surprised to find the stone rolled away. This detail is interesting because it is mentioned after the accounts in Mark, indicating that it is a significant event. It is also worth noting that Mary Magdalene is described here as a separate character, even though Mark had mentioned her multiple times before. This highlights the importance of her role as the first to encounter the risen Redeemer.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This notice, coming so late, after the mention of Mary Magdalene in Mark 16:1, is remarkable."
2. "The instances quoted by De Wette to shew that the unexpected introduction of notices contained in the other Gospels is in Mark’s manner, do not seem to me to apply here."
3. "This verse agrees with John 20:1 ff. but is unconnected with the former narrative in this chapter."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "She had gone with the other women to the sepulchre, parting from them, perhaps, before their interview with the angel..." 
2. "To a woman was this honor given to be the first that saw the risen Redeemer, and that woman was NOT his virgin-mother."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "With Mark's well - known habit of particularizing, it is somewhat singular that this circumstance was not mentioned in either of the three previous allusions to Mary (xv. 40, 47; 16 1)."
2. "An unusual expression. Mark habitually uses the preposition ejk in this connection (i. 25, 26; Mark 5:8; Mark 7:26, Mark 7:29; Mark 9:25)."
3. "Moreover, ajpo, from, is used with ejkballein, cast out, nowhere else in the New Testament."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The emphatic repetition suggests that the readers knew the sacredness of ‘the first day’ among Christians."
2. "This fact has not been previously stated in this Gospel, and this is an argument in favor of the genuineness of this section."
3. "The first manifestation of our Lord’s victory over the grave was made to one in whom He had won such a victory over Satan."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus is not mentioned by name here, though he is clearly the one meant."
2. "Definite statement that Jesus appeared to Mary Magdalene first of all."
3. "This description of Mary Magdalene is like that in Luke 8:2 and seems strange in Mark at this point, described as a new character here, though mentioned by Mark three times just before."

### John Gill:
1. "That Jesus rose from the dead on the first day of the week, agrees with the accounts of all the evangelists, and is here expressly affirmed."
2. "The phrase, 'the first day of the week', is so indeed placed, as that it may be thought to connected with the following words; as it is by some; fancying there would otherwise be a disagreement with Matthew 28:1, whereas there is none."
3. "He appeared first to Mary Magdalene; in the habit of a gardener, for whom she took him at first; and this was at the sepulchre, where she staid after the disciples were gone."

### John Wesley:
1. John 20:11.
