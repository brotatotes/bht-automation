# Mark 2:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus displayed his authority as the Son of man by forgiving sins on earth, affirming his true nature as the Messiah.

His ability to forgive on earth also assures believers of his power to forgive sins now that he is exalted as a Savior in heaven. By addressing the sick of the palsy with majestic authority, Jesus demonstrates his power and authority to forgive sins.
