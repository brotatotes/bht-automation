# Mark 2:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, as a man on earth, had the authority and power to forgive sins. This forgiveness was not a contradiction to his divine nature but rather a demonstration of his divine power. Even in his human form, Jesus possessed the same power to forgive sins as he did in heaven. Despite being in a state of humility, his divine perfections, power, and prerogatives as God were not diminished. He exercised this forgiving power during his time on earth, showing that forgiveness was not limited to a future day of judgment but could be granted here and now.
