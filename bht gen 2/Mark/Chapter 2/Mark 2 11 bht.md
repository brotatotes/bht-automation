# Mark 2:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, the emphasis is on the personal interaction between Jesus and the paralytic man. Jesus's words are very specific, showing his authority and intention for the man to rise up from his bed. The act of the paralytic carrying his bed away in the presence of the crowd helps to prove the completeness and immediate nature of the healing. This visible demonstration allows the man to show his family and friends that he is now whole and able to resume his normal activities.
