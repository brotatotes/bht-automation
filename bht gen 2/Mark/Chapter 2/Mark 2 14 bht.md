# Mark 2:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Matthew, also known as Levi, was a tax collector who encountered Jesus. Jesus saw the potential in Matthew and called him to be one of his disciples. This demonstrates that no one is beyond the reach of Jesus' grace and calling, even those in seemingly unlikely professions. Jesus' invitation to Matthew challenges us to examine our own lives and consider if we are willing to leave everything to follow him.
