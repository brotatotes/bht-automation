# Mark 2:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus welcomed not only Matthew but also many publicans and sinners to dine with him. Some of these individuals, who were sinners of an abandoned character, were likely invited by Matthew, who felt compassion for his old companions in sin. These sinners were attracted to Jesus and his teachings, following him closely and pressing in after him.
