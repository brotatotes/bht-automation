# Mark 2:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The onlookers were taken aback when they witnessed Jesus dining, but this should not be taken too literally. These observers were scribes who belonged to the Pharisees and were surprised by Jesus associating with publicans and sinners. The meal took place at a house where Jesus was a guest, and it was after a feast, so these scribes were not present during the actual feast. It is important to note that these scribes were from the Pharisees, indicating their bias and potentially their readiness to find fault.
