# Mark 2:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus acknowledges the Pharisees' claim to righteousness, though in reality they fall short. However, he clarifies that he did not come to call those who believe themselves to be righteous, but rather to call sinners to repentance. Jesus recognizes that there are those who are blind to their own sinfulness, boasting in their own strength and purity. On the other hand, there are those who are aware of their spiritual sickness and recognize their need for a Savior. Jesus reaches out to those who are sick in their souls and offers them healing and salvation.
