# Mark 2:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples of John and the Pharisees were known for their frequent fasting. However, their question to Jesus about fasting revealed a misunderstanding of the true spiritual nature of his ministry. It seems that they expected Jesus and his disciples to conform to their own practices. This passage highlights the contrast between the asceticism of John and the Pharisees and Jesus' more inclusive approach. As believers, we should be cautious not to align ourselves with groups that oppose the true message of Christ.
