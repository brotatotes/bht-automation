# Mark 2:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus uses a powerful metaphor when he refers to himself as the bridegroom and his disciples as the children of the bride chamber. This imagery indicates a deep and intimate relationship between Jesus and his followers. By identifying himself as the bridegroom, Jesus signifies his role as the one who brings about a covenant relationship with his people. In this context, Jesus asserts that it is inappropriate for his disciples to fast while he is present with them. His response challenges the religious norms that prioritize external rituals over the importance of spiritual communion with him.
