# Mark 2:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parable is prompted by the traditions of the elders which led to the discussion. The religious leaders believed that the old traditions were to be combined with the new teachings of Jesus in order to attain righteousness before God. However, Jesus uses the metaphor of an old garment to teach that their own righteousness was insufficient and even made things worse. The self-righteousness they clung to became useless and unfit for its intended purpose.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "the filling-up takes away from it, the new from the old, and a worse rent takes place."
2. "the word occurs in the parallel place in the other Gospels, which will always be found indicated at the head of the note on the paragraph."
3. "When the sign (║) is qualified, thus, ‘║ Mk.,’ or ‘║ Mt. Mk.,’ &c., it is signified that the word occurs in the parallel place in that Gospel or Gospels, but not in the other or others."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Seweth [επιρραπτει] . A word found in Mark only. Matthew (ix. 16) and Luke (v. 36) use ejpiballei, throweth upon, as we speak of clapping a patch upon.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "That which filleth it up (lit, ‘the fulness’) taketh away from it, the new from the old, and a worse rent is made." 
2. "The variations show entire independence."
3. "Compare: the wine will burst the skins, and the wine perisheth, and the skins, with Matthew 9:17; Luke 5:37."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Seweth on." (επιραπτε). Here only in the N.T. or elsewhere, though the uncompounded verb ραπτω (to sew) is common enough.
2. "In Matthew 9:16 and Luke 5:37 use επιβαλλε, put upon or clap upon."

### John Gill:
1. "The traditions of the elders...occasioned this parable."
2. "The former were not to be joined with these, to make up a justifying righteousness before God."
3. "The old garment of their own righteousness...became much worse, even for the purpose for which it was intended."
