# Mark 2:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The concept conveyed here is the importance of embracing the newness and transformative power of the Gospel. The old bottles symbolize the Scribes and Pharisees who failed to recognize their spiritual need and rejected the Gospel. Their rejection would only lead to their further condemnation. On the other hand, the new wine represents the Gospel's ability to bring about renewal and transformation. It is meant to be received by repentant sinners, who have been renewed in their thinking and desire to grow in their understanding of God's Word and the Gospel message.

3. "New wine must be put into new bottles; into the hearts of sinners, who are called to repentance, and are renewed in the Spirit of their minds; are newborn babes, that desire the sincere milk of the word, and wine of the Gospel."
