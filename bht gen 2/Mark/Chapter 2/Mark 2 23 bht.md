# Mark 2:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Jesus and his disciples were walking, they began to pluck the ears of corn from the fields. This act of picking and rubbing the ears of corn was not about making a way through the standing corn, but rather about preparing food to eat. The Pharisees took offense to this, as they considered it a violation of the Sabbath. This incident is similar to the story of David eating the consecrated bread, emphasizing the idea that humanitarian needs sometimes override religious restrictions.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He urges the strict classical sense of ὁδὸν ποιεῖν, ‘to make a way,’ viam munire, or sternere, and insists on the sense conveyed by our narrative being, as distinguished from those in [9] Matt., Luke, that the disciples made a way for themselves through the wheat field by plucking the ears of corn."
2. "The classical sense of ὁδὸν ποιεῖν must evidently not be pressed: it here ὁδὸν ποιεῖσθαι."
3. "Could it be said that any necessity compelled them to clear the path by pulling up the overhanging stalks of corn? How otherwise could the remarkable addition in our narrative, Mark 2:27, at all bear upon the case?"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Began, as they went, to pluck...This does not mean that the disciples broke a way for themselves through the standing corn by plucking the ears, for in that event they would have been compelled to break down the stalks."
2. "The offense given the Pharisees was the preparation of food on the Sabbath."
3. "Matthew says to eat, stating the motive, and Luke, rubbing with their hands, describing the act."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "His disciples began. While so doing they were interrupted by the objection of the Pharisees."
2. "That they ate the grain, appears not only from the parallel passages, but from the reference to David’s eating (Mark 2:26)."
3. "Evidently this account also in Mark 2:27 points to an act of necessity. Mark chooses the phrase in accordance with his graphic style."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Through the cornfields (δια των σποριμων). See on Matthew 12:1. So Matt. and Luke 6:1. But Mark uses παραπορευεσθα, to go along beside, unless διαπορευεσθα (BCD) is accepted."
2. "Perhaps now on the edge, now within the grain. Mark uses also οδον ποιειν, to make a way like the Latin iter facere, as if through the standing grain, plucking the ears (τιλλοντες τους σταχυας)."
3. "The margin of the Revised Version has it correctly: They began to make their way plucking the ears of corn (grain, wheat or barley, we should say). See on Matthew 12:1-8 for discussion of this passage, parallel also in Luke 6:15."

### John Gill:
1. "His disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn, and to rub them, and get the grain out of them, and eat them."


### John Wesley:
1.  Matthew 12:1; Luke 6:1.
