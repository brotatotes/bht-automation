# Mark 2:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Pharisees in Mark 2:24 questioned Jesus about His disciples' actions on the Sabbath, pointing out that they were doing something unlawful. This incident reveals the Pharisaical views on the Sabbath and their emphasis on adhering to strict regulations. However, the purpose of keeping the Sabbath was to sanctify oneself to God and engage in true spiritual worship, not to be bound by man-made rules and traditions. The Pharisees' focus on the external observance of the Sabbath demonstrates the malicious and implacable nature of superstitious and hypocritical behavior when joined with ambition and hatred for others.
