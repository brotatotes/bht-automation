# Mark 2:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, Himself, takes up the cause of His disciples and does not leave their defense to themselves. The analogy lies in the necessity, as demonstrated by the reference to David's actions in 1 Samuel 21:1. The disciples, like David, were in a situation of need and hunger. This specific need is mentioned to highlight the unique circumstances they faced. In a similar case, this example from David's life is very appropriate to serve the purpose of illustrating Jesus' point.
