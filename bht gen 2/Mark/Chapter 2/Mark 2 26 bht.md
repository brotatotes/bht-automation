# Mark 2:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the time of Abiathar the High-priest, the house of God, the tent or tabernacle at Nob, provided the bread of God's presence, the loaves of presentation, for the priests. This bread, which was taken off, was distributed among the priests, serving as food as they came and went. David, in his time of hunger, was permitted to partake of this bread. This was not considered evil, for it happened during the time of Abiathar, who would later become the high priest.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The insertion of the art. before ἀρχ . has been apparently done to give the words the sense ‘In the time of Abiathar the High-priest,’ so that the difficulty might be avoided by understanding the event to have happened in the time of (but not necessarily during the high-priesthood of) Abiathar (who was afterwards) the High-priest."
2. "Who for instance would speak of the defeat of the Philistines at Ephesdammim, where Goliath fell, as happening ἐπὶ Δανεὶδ τοῦ βασιλέως ? Who would ever understand ἐπὶ Ἐλισσαίου τοῦ προφήτου , ‘in the time of Elisæus the prophet,’ as importing, in matter of fact, any other period than that of the  prophetic course of Elisha?"
3. "With the restoration of the true reading, even this resource fails."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The shewbread, i.e., the loaves which were set forth before the Lord."
2. "Each cake was made of about five pints of wheat."
3. "The bread which was taken off was deposited on the golden table in the porch of the sanctuary and distributed among the outgoing and incoming courses of priests."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "According to 1 Samuel 21:0 'Ahimelech' was the high-priest who gave David the hallowed bread."
2. "But the original (according to the correct reading) is almost equivalent to: during the high-priesthood of Abiathar."
3. "The father was certainly called 'Abiathar,' and, as actual high-priest, is here meant."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The house of God (τον οικον του θεου). The tent or tabernacle at Nob, not the temple in Jerusalem built by Solomon." 
2. "They had the most elaborate rules for the preparation of the shewbread (τους αρτους της προθεσεως), the loaves of presentation, the loaves of the face or presence of God." 
3. "This old bread was eaten by the priests as they came and went. This is what David ate."

### John Gill:
1. "Where should such go, who are hungering and thirsting after righteousness, but into the house of God? Here is bread enough, and to spare; here is a table furnished with excellent provisions; here the Gospel is dispensed, which is milk for babes, and meat for strong men."
2. "On the Lord's day, the day set apart for public worship, it becomes the saints to go up to the house of the Lord, and feed upon the provisions of it."
3. "If this was allowed to David and his men, when hungry, it ought not to be charged as an evil upon the disciples, for plucking and rubbing a few ears of corn to satisfy their hunger, though on a sabbath day; and especially when he, who was Lord of the sabbath, was present, and admitted of it."

### John Wesley:
1. "Abiathar himself not till some time after."
2. "This phrase therefore only means, In the time of Abiathar, who was afterward the high priest."
