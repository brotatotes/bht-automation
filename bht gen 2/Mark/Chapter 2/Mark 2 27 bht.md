# Mark 2:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Sabbath, a day of rest and worship, was created specifically for the benefit of humanity. It was meant to provide both physical and spiritual refreshment, allowing individuals to engage in divine worship and find respite from their labor. However, it is important to note that the Sabbath was intended for the Jewish people, not all of mankind. It is not a universal requirement, but rather a special observance for a specific group. Ultimately, the Sabbath serves man and his needs, and should not be seen as a burden or hindrance.
