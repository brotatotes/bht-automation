# Mark 2:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The man in Matthew 9:2 and Luke 5:18 suffered from a severe case of palsy, which had left him completely paralyzed. His condition was so debilitating that it seemed incurable by the art of medicine. Being carried by four men, he was a vivid illustration of the desperate state of a sinner in a state of nature, unaware of the gravity of sin, their perilous condition, and the need for the new birth and salvation through Jesus Christ.

### John Gill:
1. "This man's case appears to be a very bad one, and what seems to be incurable by the art of medicine: it was not a slight touch of the palsy, but a general one, which had deprived him of motion and sensation."
2. "Now this man's disease seems to be the perfect and general palsy, which affects the whole body, or the 'paraplegia', which reaches every part but the head; whereby all sense, as well as motion, are destroyed."
3. "This man is an emblem of a sinner in a state of nature, who is insensible of his condition, of the exceeding sinfulness of sin, of his danger and misery to which he is exposed, of his lost and undone state, of the necessity of the new birth, and of the need of salvation by Jesus Christ."

### John Wesley:
1.  Matthew 9:2; Luke 5:18.
