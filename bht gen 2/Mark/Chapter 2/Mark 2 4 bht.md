# Mark 2:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The friends of the sick man were determined to bring him into the presence of Jesus, but due to the crowd, they had to employ an unconventional method. They unroofed the roof of the house where Jesus was, which was a common feature in oriental houses. By breaking through the tiles and possibly the laths and plaster, they made a wide enough opening to lower the sick man down with his bed. This daring act demonstrated their faith and determination to bring their friend to Jesus for healing.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Their whole object was to bring the patient into the presence of Jesus; and this not being possible in the ordinary way, because of the multitude that surrounded Him, they took the very unusual method here described of accomplishing their object, and succeeded."
2. "Several explanations have been given of the way in which this was done; but unless we knew the precise plan of the house, and the part of it from which Jesus taught... it is impossible to determine precisely how the thing was done."
3. "One thing, however, is clear, that we have both the accounts from an eye-witness."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A modern roof would be untiled or unshingled; but an oriental roof would have to be dug to make such an opening as was required."
2. "On the houses of the poor in the country the grass grows more freely, and goats may be seen on the roofs cropping it."
3. "A rude pallet, merely a thickly padded quilt or mat, held at the corners, and requiring no cords to let it down."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They uncovered (unroofed) the roof where he was."
2. "The supposition that the parapet alone was broken through is open to the same objection."
3. "The bed...denotes a mattress, sometimes merely a sheepskin, used for the service of the sick, or as a camp-bed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They unroofed the roof (note paronomasia in the Greek and cognate accusative)."
2. "There were thus tiles (δια των κεραμων, Luke 5:19) of laths and plaster and even slabs of stone stuck in for strength that had to be dug out."
3. "Probably the four men had a rope fastened to each corner of the pallet or poor man's bed (κραβαττον, Latin grabatus. So one of Mark's Latin words)."

### John Gill:
1. "The place where Christ was, seems to be an upper room; for in such an one the Jewish doctors used to meet, and discourse together about religious matters."
2. "Over this upper room, was a flat roof, with battlements about it for so the Jews were obliged to build their houses...Hence we so often read of 'the way of the roofs', in distinction from 'the way of the doors'; by which they entered into their houses, and by which means, things might be carried from a court to a roof, and from a roof to a court."
3. "Now, when they had brought up the sick man to the roof of the house, by a ladder fastened on the outside, which was common; they took up this door, and let him down in his bed into the room where Jesus was."

### John Wesley:
1. "They uncovered the roof — Or, took up the covering, the lattice or trap door, which was on all their houses, (being flat roofed.)"
2. "And finding it not wide enough, broke the passage wider, to let down the couch."
