# Mark 2:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The paralyzed man's faith was seen by Jesus, as all three narratives mention their faith. Jesus rewarded their faith, and his response was not only to heal the man physically but also to forgive his sins. This act of forgiveness is significant because it highlights the man's status as a child of God, even in his afflicted condition. The forgiveness of sins is a blessing of great importance; those who receive it will never have their sins imputed to them again and are considered blessed.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is remarkable that all the three narratives call it 'their faith' which Jesus saw."
2. "This was the faith for which He was ever on the watch, and which He never saw without marking, and, in those who needed anything from Him, richly rewarding."
3. "Nor could such a style of address be justified on any lower supposition."

### Philip Schaff:
1. Mark 2:5. See on Matthew 9:2. ‘Be of good cheer,’ is omitted here, and in Luke’s account, the latter has ‘Man’ instead of ‘Son.’
	

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "There is no reason for excluding his faith. They all had confidence in the power and willingness of Jesus to heal this desperate case." 
2. "The astonishing thing both to the paralytic and to the four friends is that Jesus forgave his sins instead of healing him."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ calls him son, though, in this afflicted condition a person may be a child of God, and yet greatly afflicted by him; afflictions are not arguments against, but rather for sonship."
2. "He was a son of God by divine predestination, being predestinated to the adoption of children: he was a son by virtue of the covenant of grace, he was interested in, as appears by his enjoying pardon of sin, a blessing of it."
3. "The blessing Christ conferred on this poor man is of the greatest consequence and importance, forgiveness of sin...and blessed are they that are partakers of it, their sins will never be imputed to them; they will never be remembered more; they are blotted out of God's book of debts; they are covered out of his sight, and are removed as far as the east is from the west."
