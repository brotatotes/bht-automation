# Mark 2:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The scribes, the authoritative interpreters of the law, were present, observing Jesus' words and actions. However, it was not the common people who were offended, but rather these scribes, whose jealousy was aroused by Jesus' popularity and power. They engaged in internal reasoning, pondering His words within their hearts. Their silence and hidden murmurs did not escape Jesus' perception. These scribes were blind guides, and it would have been better if they had never existed. We should strive not to offend the innocent, allowing our words to bring light instead of confusion.
