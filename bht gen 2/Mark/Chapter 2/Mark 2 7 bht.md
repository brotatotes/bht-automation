# Mark 2:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people were taken aback by Jesus' words and questioned his authority to forgive sins. They believed only God had the power to forgive sins, and they saw Jesus' claim as blasphemous. It is true that no ordinary person can forgive sin, as forgiveness comes from the one who has been wronged. If there were others who had the ability to forgive sins, it would imply that Jesus was not the unique and incomparable God who pardons iniquity.
