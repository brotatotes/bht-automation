# Mark 2:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is easier to command the removal of disease than to bid away sin. When Jesus said to the paralytic, Rise, take up your bed and walk, he demonstrated both divine power and his ability to forgive sins. Both acts were instances of divine power, but while curing the paralytic was visible and undeniable, forgiving sins was a greater blessing and a greater evidence of divine power. So, when Jesus performed the physical healing, it served as a more tangible proof of his deity to the Scribes and Pharisees than simply pronouncing the forgiveness of sins.
