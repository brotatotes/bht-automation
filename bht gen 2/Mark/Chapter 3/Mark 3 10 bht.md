# Mark 3:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people were so desperate to be healed by Jesus that they pushed and pressed themselves upon Him, hoping to touch Him and receive a cure. They had various plagues and diseases, which were seen as divine scourges or strokes. These afflictions were seen as punishment for their sins, and they sought healing from Jesus as a way to alleviate their suffering. The word plagues here refers to the painful and afflictive disorders that they were experiencing, rather than a specific class of diseases.
