# Mark 3:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The moment they caught sight of Jesus, despite their unfamiliarity with him, they immediately prostrated themselves in reverence. The unclean spirits, though possessing the individuals, recognized Jesus as the Son of God and were compelled to acknowledge his authority. Even the demons cried out, affirming Jesus' divine nature and illustrating his supreme power over them, which he demonstrated through his miraculous healings and command over various diseases.
