# Mark 3:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He strictly commanded his followers not to disclose his identity or the miracles they had witnessed, for it was not yet the appropriate time for such revelation. This directive was necessary to prevent a premature rupture between him and the Pharisees, who would surely take offense at his actions. Furthermore, Jesus did not seek vain glory or the approval of men or devils, so he especially chose not to have any association with the latter, in order to avoid any accusations from his enemies. Instead, he remained focused on his mission and the divine plan for his ministry.
