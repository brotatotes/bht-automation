# Mark 3:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The twelve disciples were chosen by Jesus to be with him, to be his familiars and privy to all his affairs. They were taken into his family and were constantly with him, hearing his discourses and witnessing his miracles. This close proximity to Jesus was meant to train and prepare them for the great work he had planned for them. Ultimately, the purpose of their selection was twofold: to be with him and to be sent forth to preach the Gospel, starting in Judea and eventually throughout the world. This appointment as disciples preceded their official mission.
