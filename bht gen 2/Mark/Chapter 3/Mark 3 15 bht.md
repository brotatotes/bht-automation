# Mark 3:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Mark 3:15 speaks of the disciples being granted the authority to heal sicknesses and cast out demons. The mention of casting out demons specifically highlights its significance and underscores the need for divine authority. The power to exorcise was bestowed upon the disciples to validate their teaching and demonstrate the supernatural nature of their mission. Jesus, in choosing and appointing them as apostles, had intended to confer these extraordinary abilities to further their ministry.
