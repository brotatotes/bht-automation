# Mark 3:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Mark 3:18, the list of the Twelve apostles does not mention any pairs like in other Gospel accounts. One particular disciple mentioned is Simon the Zealot, a member of a fiery political faction who vehemently opposed Rome's presence in the Holy Land. This inclusion is significant because it showcases a remarkable transformation in Simon's convictions and loyalty, as he abandons his former extremist beliefs to become a follower of Jesus. This demonstrates the profound impact that encountering Christ can have on an individual's thoughts and heart.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "What revolution of thought and heart could be greater than that which had thus changed into a follower of Jesus one of the fierce war-party of the day, which looked on the presence of Rome in the Holy Land as treason against the majesty of Jehovah, a party who were fanatical in their Jewish strictures and exclusiveness?" (Geikie, "Life and Words of Christ").
2. "No name is more striking in the list than that of Simon the Zealot, for to none of the twelve could the contrast be so vivid between their former and their new position." (Geikie, "Life and Words of Christ").
3. "Probably he had two names."

### Philip Schaff:
1. Mark 3:18. Matthew arranges the Twelve by pairs; Mark does not. In other respects the lists of Matthew and Mark correspond most closely.
	 Cananaean, or, â€˜Zealot;â€™ see Matthew 10:4; Luke 6:15; Acts 1:13.
	

### John Gill:
