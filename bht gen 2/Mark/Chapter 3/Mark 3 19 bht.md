Judas Iscariot, known for his betrayal of Jesus, is mentioned in this passage. His name has become infamous among men for his actions. Despite Jesus' knowledge of Judas' future betrayal, He chose him to be among the apostles, fulfilling God's purposes and the prophecies of the Old Testament, ultimately leading to the redemption of mankind. In this particular instance, they entered a house in Capernaum, where they had become like a family to Jesus, sharing a close and intimate relationship with Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. Judas Iscariot. See on Matthew 10:4.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And he cometh into a house. This indicates a return to Capernaum; as the succeeding events probably took place there."
2. "If a particular house is meant, there is an undesigned coincidence. Matthew, in prefacing the parables of our Lord, tells us He went ‘out of the house,’ without having spoken of His entering one."
3. "Those parables were uttered just after the events next recorded by Mark, who speaks of this entering a house, without telling of His going out."


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He comes home from the mountain, probably the house of Simon as in Mark 1:29."
2. "Mark passes by the Sermon on the Mount given by Matthew and Luke on the mountain (plateau on the mountain in Luke)."
3. "We have to allow a reasonable interval for Mark's narrative. Mark's Gospel is full of action and does not undertake to tell all that Jesus did and said."

### John Gill:
1. "And Judas Iscariot...which also betrayed him...render his name infamous among men." 
2. "This man, with the rest, our Lord chose to be an apostle of his, though he knew he would betray him...to fulfill the purposes of God, the prophecies of the Old Testament, and bring on the work of man's redemption."
3. "They went into a house at Capernaum...they went home with him from the mountain; and from that time became his domestics, and were looked upon by him as his family, and were admitted to the greatest nearness and intimacy with him."
