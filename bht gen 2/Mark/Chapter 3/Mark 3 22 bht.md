# Mark 3:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The scribes and Pharisees, cunning and artful men, came from Jerusalem to Galilee with the malicious intent of opposing Jesus. They accused Him of being possessed by Beelzebub, claiming that there was a connection and familiarity between them. This was their attempt to undermine the power of Jesus and attribute His miracles to Satan. In their pride and knowledge, they sought to explain away the undeniable work of God within Jesus, dismissing the divine and attributing it to human means. Such was their blindness and refusal to acknowledge the hand of God at work.
