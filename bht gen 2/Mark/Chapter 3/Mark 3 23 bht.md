# Mark 3:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
How absurd would it be to think that Satan would cast out Satan? Such a thought goes against the unity and interests of the kingdom of darkness. If Satan and his kingdom are united, there is no reason for him to oppose and dispossess himself. So when Jesus questions the possibility of Satan casting out Satan, he is highlighting the absurdity of such a notion. If Satan were in league with Beelzebub, why would he ever cast him out of others?

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In crisp pungent thrusts that exposed the inconsistencies of the scribes and Pharisees."
2. "These short parabolic quips concern Satan's casting out (εκβαλλε, the very word used of casting out demons) Satan (rhetorical question), a kingdom divided (μερισθη, for a mere portion) against itself."
3. "Two conditions of the third class undetermined, but with prospect of determination."

### John Gill:
1. "How unreasonable is it to suppose [that Satan would cast out Satan]? Can it ever be thought that such, whose interest it is to unite, would ever oppose and dispossess one another?"
2. "If therefore, as if he should say, I am Beelzebub, or have him, and he is in me, and I am in confederacy with him; was this the case, can any think I should ever cast him out of others, as I do?"
