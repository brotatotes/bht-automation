# Mark 3:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus teaches in Mark that if Satan were to rise up against himself and be divided, he would not be able to stand, but would come to an end. This speaks to the idea that Satan's power and authority cannot endure if he is divided against himself. Additionally, the accusations against Jesus that he casts out demons by the ruler of demons suggest that if this were true, Satan's kingdom would not be able to stand for long, as it would be working against itself and ultimately be destroyed.
