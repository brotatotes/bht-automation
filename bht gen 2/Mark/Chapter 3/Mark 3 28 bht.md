# Mark 3:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Pardon is procured before it is applied. In Matthew 12:31 and Luke 12:10, it is stated that all sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme. This emphasizes the scope of forgiveness. Additionally, the placement of Ï€Î¬Î½Ï„Î± first and the separation from its noun through intervening words underscores its prominence. Comparing this with Matthew 12:31, we can see Mark's superior precision and fullness of detail in his account.
