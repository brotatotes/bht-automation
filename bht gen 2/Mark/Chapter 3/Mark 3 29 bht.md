# Mark 3:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By attributing the work of the Holy Spirit to the devil, those who commit the unpardonable sin (Mark 3:30) are guilty of an eternal sin. This sin points to an unending state of activity in sin, a perpetual wrongdoing that merits perpetual punishment. In the covenant of grace, there is no pardon provided nor obtained by the blood of Christ for those who call the work of Christ the work of the devil. Such individuals are forever deprived of the influences of the Holy Spirit and are in a state of eternally growing sin and guilt, leading to everlasting destruction.
