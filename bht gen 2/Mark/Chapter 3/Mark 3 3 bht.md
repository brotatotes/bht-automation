# Mark 3:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus commanded the man with the withered hand to stand forth, he chose a strategic position in the synagogue to reveal the miracle that would soon take place. This act not only caught the attention of the people but also provoked the hard-heartedness of the Pharisees. Jesus aimed to emphasize the man's genuine condition and expose any doubts of deceit in the upcoming healing. His confrontation challenged their hypocritical practices and further demonstrated the power and authority of Christ.
