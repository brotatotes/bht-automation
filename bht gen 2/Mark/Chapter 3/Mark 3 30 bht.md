# Mark 3:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is astonishing that anyone could doubt what constitutes blasphemy against the Holy Ghost after reading these words. This sin involves ascribing the miracles done by Christ through the power of the Holy Ghost to the power of the devil. It is a deliberate rejection of the clear evidence that these miracles were the work of the Holy Spirit, and it is a sin for which there is no forgiveness.
