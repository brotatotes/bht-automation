# Mark 3:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, with utmost sweetness, looked round on those who sat about him and declared, Behold my mother and my brethren. In this preference of his true disciples, he not only displays his high and tender affection for them, but also guards against excessive and idolatrous honors that would be paid to Mary in the future. Despite being his earthly mother, it is through the spiritual bond of doing God's will that Jesus identifies his true family as those who are born anew in him.
