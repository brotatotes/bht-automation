# Mark 3:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus poses a thought-provoking question to those who were seeking to trap him, asking if it is lawful to save life or to kill. In their silence, they were confounded by the weight of the question and the implications it held. By highlighting the importance of doing good and saving life, Jesus establishes the principle that acts of mercy and compassion are always appropriate, even on the Sabbath. He challenges them to consider what aligns with God's law, the nature of the Sabbath, and the well-being of humanity.
