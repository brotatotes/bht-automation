# Mark 3:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Out of sheer rage, the Pharisees stormed off, blinded by their evil intentions despite Christ having clearly exposed their wickedness. These were the same men who believed it was unlawful to heal on the Sabbath, yet they had no qualms about gathering together to plot on that day. In a bizarre twist, they allied themselves with the Herodians, a group they typically held deep animosity towards. This unusual collaboration demonstrates just how far they were willing to go, even seeking the advice of profane men, to destroy the life of an innocent person.
