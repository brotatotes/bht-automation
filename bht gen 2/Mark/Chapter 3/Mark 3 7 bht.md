# Mark 3:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus became aware of the evil intentions of the people, he wisely left the synagogue and the city of Capernaum. This was not out of fear but rather because he knew it was not yet the appointed time for him. In his divine wisdom, Jesus knew that he still had more important work to do. Despite this, a great multitude from different parts of Galilee and even Judea followed Jesus, eager to witness his teachings and miracles.
