# Mark 3:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus' actions were continuous, whether in the past or the present, as seen in the use of the imperfect tense. The crowd that gathered around him came from various regions, including Galilee, Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, beyond Jordan, Tyre, and Sidon. Some of these regions had Gentile inhabitants, many of whom may have only known the Greek language. The fame of Jesus and the miracles he performed spread throughout all the surrounding countries, drawing a large gathering of people from different places.
