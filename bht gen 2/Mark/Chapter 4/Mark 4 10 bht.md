# Mark 4:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After dismissing the multitude, Jesus either stayed in the boat or found a quiet place, perhaps at Simon's house in Capernaum. But even in this private setting, there were those who were close to Jesus, in addition to the twelve disciples, who sought to understand the parable. They came to Jesus and asked him for an explanation, wanting to know why he chose to speak in this way to the people.
