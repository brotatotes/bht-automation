# Mark 4:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To those who are not part of the community of believers, the mysteries of the kingdom of God are not given. These mysteries pertain to the hidden truths of the Gospel and the doctrines of grace. They are conveyed through parables and figurative expressions, which may be pleasing in sound but require spiritual insight to understand their true meaning. Those who are outside of the circle of disciples, the obstinate unbelievers, are unable to grasp these spiritual truths and therefore cannot enter into the kingdom of God, remaining in the darkness.
