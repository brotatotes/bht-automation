# Mark 4:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The purposeful act of blinding and hardening hearts, as emphasized in the passage, highlights the consequences of rejecting God. This blindness is not solely caused by God, but is a result of individuals' own choices and depravity. The preaching of God's word serves to reconcile and renew hearts, while also serving as a benchmark for spiritual knowledge. The language used to proclaim the doom of those who reject the truth resonates with the severity of God's judgments. It serves as a sobering reminder of the grave consequences that come from turning away from God.
