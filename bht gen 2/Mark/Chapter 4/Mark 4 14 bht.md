# Mark 4:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The sower soweth the word, which is the seed of God. This parable speaks to the diverse states of the human heart and emphasizes that the impact of the preaching of the word hinges upon the receptiveness of the hearer.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The sower soweth the word... the seed is the word of God." 
2. "However faithful the preacher, and how pure soever his message, the effect of the preaching of the word depends upon the state of the hearer's heart."
3. "The great general lesson held forth in this parable of the sower is, that the result is entirely different, the whole difference must lie in the soils, which mean the different states of the human heart."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. The sower soweth the word. More precise than either Matthew or Luke. Compare Matthew 13:19; Luke 8:11.

1. Mark 4:14. Peculiar to Mark, though involved in the other accounts.
	

### Archibald T. Robertson:
