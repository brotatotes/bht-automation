# Mark 4:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Some hearts are unbroken and hard, making them unfit for receiving the saving truth. These hearts do not apprehend the word as a means of restoration, and it fails to penetrate or make an impression. Instead, it lies loosely on the surface, easily distracted by other frivolous subjects that draw off their attention. The devil, symbolized by the fowl, takes notice of these hearers and fills their minds with other things, diverting their focus from the word that was sown in them.
