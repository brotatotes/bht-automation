# Mark 4:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who receive the word of God with enthusiasm but quickly lose their fervor due to trials or opposition are like the stony ground. Though they may have some understanding and affection for the truth, their hearts remain untouched and unyielding. They fail to grasp the depth of their sinfulness and need for salvation. Their delight in the word comes from a self-centered desire for personal gain rather than a genuine longing for eternal happiness and the divine plan of redemption.
