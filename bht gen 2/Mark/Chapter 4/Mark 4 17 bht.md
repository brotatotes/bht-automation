# Mark 4:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Many people have a superficial attachment to the Word of God, lacking a deep-rooted foundation in their hearts, leaving them as temporary and transient believers. They may show outward signs of affinity for the Word, but their affection is more superficial than genuine. These individuals lack true heart transformation and instead hold onto speculative notions and flashy affections. When faced with tribulation or any form of loss or hardship because of their faith, they stumble and cannot endure, revealing the shallowness of their belief.
