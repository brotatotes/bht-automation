# Mark 4:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The seed sown among thorns represents a certain group of hearers who are excessively attentive to worldly concerns, as the thorns denote. These hearers, whose minds are preoccupied with acquiring material riches and satisfying their carnal desires, still find themselves compelled to attend to the preaching of the word, whether due to ingrained habits or personal convictions. However, their primary focus on earthly matters hinders them from truly grasping the significance and impact of the word in their lives.
