# Mark 4:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The distractions of the world and the pursuit of riches can hinder the growth and productivity of the word of God. The desires and cares of this world can overshadow the spiritual, leading to unfruitfulness. Even innocent desires can become a snare, preventing the word from bearing fruit. It is important to guard our hearts and not let other desires choke out the word, for when this happens, the word becomes unfruitful, even after promising much growth.
