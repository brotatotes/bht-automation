# Mark 4:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He taught them many things by parables, using this method to make his instructions more agreeable and memorable, as was common in the eastern culture. A parable is not just a simile or proverb, but a form of instructive speech that uses natural examples to explain and illuminate spiritual truths. It is important to understand both the literal sense and the spiritual interpretation of a parable, as the literal sense alone may not lead to true understanding, but the spiritual interpretation brings life.
