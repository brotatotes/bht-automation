# Mark 4:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parable's conclusion is echoed in the interpretation. The 'honest and good heart' refers to those whose hearts are stirred by eternal matters, safeguarded from worldly distractions. These individuals bring forth fruit with endurance and perseverance, unlike those whose hearts are choked and unproductive. The degrees of fruitfulness are depicted in the 'thirtyfold', 'sixtyfold', and 'hundredfold'. This highlights the transformative power of the Word, producing a consistent quality of good fruit in those who receive it.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Notice the concluding words of the interpretation exactly reproducing those of the parable."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "A heart soft and tender, stirred to its depths on the great things of eternity, and jealously guarded from worldly engrossments, such only is the 'honest and good heart'."
2. "Such 'bring forth fruit with patience', or continuance, enduring to the end; in contrast with those in whom the word is 'choked' and brings no fruit to perfection."
3. "The 'thirtyfold' is designed to express the lowest degree of fruitfulness; the 'hundredfold' the highest; and the 'sixtyfold' the intermediate degrees of fruitfulness."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Such as. A good rendering of the pronoun oitinev, which indicates the class of hearers.

### Philip Schaff:
1. Mark 4:20. The closing words of the parable (Mark 4:8) are repeated in the last clause of this verse, as in Matthew, and the same difference in order is preserved.
	

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Bear fruit  (καρποφορουσιν). Same word in Matthew 13:23 and Luke 8:15. Mark gives the order from thirty, sixty, to a hundred, while Matthew 13:23 has it reversed. 

### John Gill:
1. "Such hearers who are intended by the good ground on which other seed fell, are those who are made good men by the grace of God..."
2. "...these are such who hear the word, and receive it; as the word of God, in whose hearts it works effectually..."
3. "...all bring forth good fruit of the same quality, though not of the same quantity."
