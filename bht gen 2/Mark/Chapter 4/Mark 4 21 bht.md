# Mark 4:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Gospel is like a candle, meant to give light to humanity. Just as a candle is not meant to be hidden, but to illuminate a room, the Gospel is not meant to be concealed but imparted to others. Jesus used parables to explain the truth, not to obscure it. He wanted his disciples to understand the parables and, in turn, share the light of the Gospel with the world. The purpose of these teachings was not to keep them secret, but to ultimately make them known and manifest to all.
