# Mark 4:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For there is nothing hid which shall not be manifested, sooner or later, to his disciples. Neither was anything kept secret, but that it should come abroad. This passage reminds us that nothing remains hidden forever; the truth will ultimately be revealed to those who seek it. It also highlights the importance of openly sharing and proclaiming the Gospel, holding nothing back that may be beneficial to the church. As ministers of the Gospel, we are called to faithfully disclose the mysteries of grace and declare the complete purpose of God.
