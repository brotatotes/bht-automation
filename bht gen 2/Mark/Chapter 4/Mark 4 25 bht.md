# Mark 4:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For those who diligently attend to the words of Jesus and apply them to their lives, they will continue to increase in the knowledge of the truth. However, those who do not actively engage with the truth they have received will find that even what they think they have will be taken away. Just as a seed grows from its earliest stage to produce a fruitful harvest, so must we continue to grow and improve in our understanding and practice of God's will. Let us not be content with mere knowledge, but diligently seek to increase in wisdom and righteousness.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For he that hath, to him shall be given; and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath." 
2. "This 'having' and 'thinking he hath' are not different; for when it hangs loosely upon him, and is not appropriated to its proper ends and uses, it both is and is not his."
3. "This beautiful parable is peculiar to Mark. Its design is to teach the Imperceptible Growth of the word sown in the heart, from its earliest stage of development to the ripest fruits of practical righteousness."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "The few things which he had learned he will forget, and his trifling knowledge will be diminished."
3. "All will be in vain unless we go forward, and improve every opportunity of learning the will of God and the way of salvation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For he that hath, etc. See on Matthew 13:12, where this thought precedes the explanation of the parable of the sower."
2. "It was possibly repeated, since it is equally apt in both cases."
3. "There is nothing arbitrary in this rule; it is a law of Godâ€™s dealing in the kingdom of nature as well as of grace."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Even that which he hath... It is possible that ÎµÏ‡Îµ here has the notion of acquiring."
2. "The man who does not acquire soon loses what he thinks that he has."
3. "This is one of the paradoxes of Jesus that repay thought and practice."

### John Gill:
1. "He that has the truth of grace, though its beginning is but small, yet that making and keeping him humble, as it always does, he shall have more grace."
2. "He that has only a speculative notion of the Gospel, and is without any experience and practice of it, in course of time his candle is put out; his light becomes darkness; he drops and denies the truths he held, and relinquishes the profession of them."
3. "Judas had doubtless all the appearance of a true Christian; he had the Gospel committed to him, and the knowledge of it, and gifts qualifying him to preach it, and a commission from Christ for it, yea, even a power of working miracles to confirm what he preached; and yet not having true grace, all was taken away from him, and were of no use unto him in the business of salvation."

### John Wesley:
1. He that hath â€” That improves whatever he has received, to the good of others, as well as of his own soul. Matthew 13:12; Luke 8:18.
