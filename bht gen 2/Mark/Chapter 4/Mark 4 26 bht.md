# Mark 4:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parable compares the seed of the kingdom of God to a man who casts seed into the ground and goes about his daily routine, leaving it to the natural processes of growth. This can be understood as a parallel to the preaching of the Gospel, which is done with care and commitment, but also with an understanding that the growth and development of faith is ultimately in God's hands. The farmer's continuous thoughts reflect the preacher's constant concern for the message, and the necessity for both human agency and heavenly influence in bringing forth fruit.

1. "The design of it is to set forth the nature of the word, and the ministration of it; the conduct of the ministers of the Gospel, when they have dispensed it; the imperceptibleness of its springing and growth; the fruitfulness of it, when it has taken root, without the help of man; the gradual increase of grace under the instrumentality of the word; and the gathering of gracious souls, when grace is brought to maturity" 
2. "By 'casting' it into the earth, the preaching of the word is designed; which, like casting seed into the earth, is done with the same sort of seed only, and not with different sorts, with plenty of it, and at the proper time, whatever discouragements there may be, and with great skill and judgment, committing it to God to raise it up again."
