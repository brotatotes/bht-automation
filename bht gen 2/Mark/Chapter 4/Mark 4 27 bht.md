# Mark 4:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The sowers of the good seed often sleep, unaware that in their sleep, undesirable influences may sow tares alongside the good seed. This can also be seen as a metaphor for the sleep of death, where those who have sown the seed of the word of God do not witness its fruits among the churches until after they have passed away. Yet, even in their unknowing, divine grace works powerfully and secretly to bring about the growth and increase of the seed, emphasizing that while humans are instruments in the process, ultimately, all the increase is from God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The seed sown in the heart is in its growth dependent on other causes than mere human anxiety and watchfulness."
2. "The working of [the power implanted by God] is hidden from human eye."
3. "Beware of the mistake of Erasmus, who takes ὁ σπόρος as the subject of all the verbs in this verse."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "By this we are not to infer that men are to use no diligence in the obtaining and in the growth of piety; but the illustration shows only that as we cannot tell how grain grows, so we cannot tell the mode in which piety increases in the heart."
2. "After all the researches of philosophers, no one has been able to tell the way in which grain grows. They can observe one fact after another; they can see the changes; they can see the necessity of rains and suns, of care and shelter, but beyond this they cannot go. So in religion."
3. "As God unseen, yet by the use of proper means, makes the grass to flourish, so God unseen, but by proper means, nourishes the soul, and the plants of piety spring up, and bloom, and bear fruit."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Grow [μηκυνηται] . Lit., lengthen; be extended by the seed lengthening out into blade and stalk."
2. "He knoweth not how (wJv oujk oiden aujtov). The Greek order is very lively : how knoweth not he."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He who sows does not know how that takes place which he expects to occur, and to occur for his benefit."
2. "A true picture, since such knowledge is not permitted to the wisest of men, and what is known helps the growth very little."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The process of growth goes on all night and all day...He knoweth not how." 
2. "The mystery of growth still puzzles farmers and scientists of today with all our modern knowledge."
3. "When man has done his part, the actual process of growth is beyond his reach or comprehension."

### John Gill:
1. "And should sleep... as they sleep, tares are sown, and they spring up, and not the good seed of the word."
2. "But rather, this may be understood of the sleep of death; for so it often is, that the seed sown by them does not appear in the fruits of it to the churches of Christ, among whom they have ministered, until after they are fallen asleep in Jesus."
3. "This work is done secretly, and powerfully, under the influence of divine grace, without their knowledge, though by them as instruments; so that though the sowing and planting are theirs, all the increase is God's."
