# Mark 4:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Grace is a gift from God, not something we can produce on our own. It is the Holy Spirit who works in our hearts to make the seed of God's word grow and bear fruit. This growth is not dependent on human effort or the presence of ministers, but on God's grace. It starts small but gradually increases, as light shines brighter and faith becomes stronger. Through this process, we learn the importance of patience and trust in God's ultimate establishment of His kingdom, regardless of any obstacles we may face.

2. "The growth of the kingdom of God, in general and in individuals, is according to a development which is natural, i.e., in accordance with certain laws in the realm of grace, which are analogous to what are called natural laws, and like them acting with a certain spontaneousness; though Godâ€™s constant energy is present in both."
3. "The repeated â€˜then â€˜marks the gradual progress better than â€˜after thatâ€™ The same word is used in the Greek in both clauses. The lesson is therefore one of patience."

2. "The Holy Spirit works on the heart and uses the seed sown and makes it germinate and grow, 'first the blade, then the ear, then the full corn in the ear.'"
3. "This single fact creates the confidence shown by Jesus in the ultimate establishment of his kingdom in spite of the obstacles which obstruct its progress."

### John Gill:
1. "this is said, not to denote that man of himself, upon hearing the word, can bring forth the fruit of grace in himself...it is the gift of God"
2. "without human power, without the Gospel minister, the word having taken root under divine influence, through the sun of righteousness, the dews of divine grace, and operations of the blessed Spirit, it rises up and brings forth fruit"
3. "Grace at first appearance is very small, like the small green spire, when it first shoots out of the earth...in process of time there is a growth and an increase; light increases, which shines more and more unto the perfect day; faith grows stronger and stronger"
