# Mark 4:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Hearken! A solemn prefatory word, introducing the whole discourse and deserving great attention. The sower who went out to sow represents Jesus Christ, who came forth from God as a teacher, proclaiming the Gospel. He sows spiritual things among men, and this can be applicable to any faithful minister of the word. The word hearken was likely spoken with a loud voice to capture the attention of the crowd and draw them into listening attentively.
