# Mark 4:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
How can we illustrate it? In what parable can we present it? These questions demonstrate Jesus' desire to teach his disciples and convey clearer understanding of the Gospel. Despite the seemingly unpromising circumstances, Jesus provides encouragement. This method of questioning was common among Jewish teachers when using parables to illustrate their teachings.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "] This Rabbinical method of questioning before beginning a discourse is also found in Luke 13:18, without however the condescending plural, which embraces the disciples, in their work of preaching and teaching, and indeed gives all teachers an example, to what they may liken the Kingdom of God."
2. "θῶμεν, as ἐτίθει, of Hephæstus, Il. σ. 541, &c., 'sollers nunc hominem ponere, nunc deum,' Hor. Od. iv. 8. 8, see also de Art. Poet. 34."
