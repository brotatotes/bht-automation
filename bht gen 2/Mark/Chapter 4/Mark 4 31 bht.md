# Mark 4:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The kingdom of God is compared to a mustard seed, one of the smallest seeds, yet it grows into a plant that is larger than all other plants. This parable captures the gradual and pervasive growth of the Gospel church state - where Christ dwells and rules as king. Initially, the Gospel was preached by a few insignificant individuals, but it spread rapidly and impacted many lives. Even though the grace of God in the hearts of his people may seem small and easily disregarded, it has the power to transform lives and establish His kingdom on earth.
