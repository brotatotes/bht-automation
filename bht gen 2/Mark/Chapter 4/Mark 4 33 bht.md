# Mark 4:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus spoke in parables, using familiar and easily understandable similes to convey the mysteries of the kingdom of God. He knew the capacity of his hearers and tailored his teaching according to their level of understanding, even though they did not fully comprehend what they heard. This approach showed his compassion and wisdom in accommodating the weaknesses of his audience and delivering the message in a way that would not alienate or overwhelm them. It serves as a reminder for all who instruct others to consider the readiness and ability of their listeners when sharing the word of God.
