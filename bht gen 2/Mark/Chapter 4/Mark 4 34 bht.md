# Mark 4:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus often spoke to the crowds in parables to gradually introduce them to the truths of his kingdom. However, when he was alone with his disciples, he would explain everything to them in plain language without the use of parables. This method served a dual purpose - to prepare his disciples to fully understand the nature of his kingdom and to overcome the prejudice and misunderstanding of the Jewish people. Through these private discourses, Jesus not only clarified his teachings, but also revealed new insights and fresh revelations about the mysteries of the kingdom of God.
