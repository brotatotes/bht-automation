# Mark 4:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As evening approached, after Jesus had shared the profound parables about the sower and the seed and had taken the time to explain them to his disciples, it was time to head towards the other side of the lake. This move was not only to seek rest and respite from the crowd, but also for the purpose of performing a miraculous act that would bring about awe and wonder among the people. The day had been eventful, but now it was time to embark on a new journey across the sea.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And the same day—on which He spoke the memorable parables of the sower, and of the seed—when the even was come." 
2. "This must have been the earlier evening—what we should call the afternoon—since after all that passed on the other side, when He returned to the west side, the people were waiting for Him in great numbers." 
3. "He saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side—to the east side of the lake, to grapple with a desperate case of possession, and set the captive free, and to give the Gadarenes an opportunity of hearing the message of salvation, amid the wonder which that marvellous cure was fitted to awaken and the awe which the subsequent events could not but strike into them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Mark is most definite."
2. "This vivid form of the command indicates a sudden departure."
3. "He would thus seek rest, which could be obtained more easily on a lake subject to storms than in a crowd already excited."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "When even was come (οψιας γενομενης). Genitive absolute. It had been a busy day." 
2. "The blasphemous accusation, the visit of the mother and brothers and possibly sisters, to take him home, leaving the crowded house for the sea, the first parables by the sea, then more in the house, and now out of the house and over the sea."
3. "Let us go over unto the other side (διελθωμεν εις το περαν). Hortatory (volitive) subjunctive, second aorist active tense. They were on the western side and a row over to the eastern shore in the evening would be a delightful change and refreshing to the weary Christ. It was the only way to escape the crowds."
