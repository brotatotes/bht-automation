# Mark 4:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Without any preparation, Jesus was taken in the boat where He had been teaching all day. Other boats accompanied Him, perhaps filled with passengers eager to be near Him. After leaving the multitude, they set off without delay, with the crowd following them. These additional boats served as witnesses to the miracle that was to come.
