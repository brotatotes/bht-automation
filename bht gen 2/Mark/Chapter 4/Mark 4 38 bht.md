# Mark 4:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of a fierce storm, Jesus found rest on the cushion at the stern of the boat. His weariness from the day's teaching and the disciples' lack of faith led them to cry out to Him, questioning His concern for their safety. Their words were not just a plea for help, but also a complaint and reproof. It is a reminder that even in times of trial, our faith may waver, but we must trust that Jesus is with us, even when He appears to be sleeping.

### Henry Alford:
1. "τὸ προσκ. ... the cushion or seat at the stern, used by our Lord as a pillow."
2. "Pollux, Onom., proves from Cratinus that the word is put for the cushion used by rowers."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Evening; and after the fatigues of a busy day of teaching under the hot sun, having nothing to do while crossing the lake, He sinks into a deep sleep, which even this tempest raging around and tossing the little vessel did not disturb."
2. "Unbelief and fear made them sadly forget their place, to speak so. When those accustomed to fish upon that deep thus spake, the danger must have been imminent. They say nothing of what would become of Him, if they perished; nor think, whether, if He could not perish, it was likely He would let this happen to them; but they hardly knew what they said."

2. "Master, arise, and save us, or we are lost: hast thou no concern for us? how canst thou lie sleeping here, when we are in such danger?" 
3. "They seem to say this, not so much praying and interrogating, as complaining and reproving."

### John Wesley:
1. On the pillow — So we translate it, for want of a proper English expression, for that particular part of the vessel near the rudder, on which he lay.
