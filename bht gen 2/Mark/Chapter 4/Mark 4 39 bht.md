# Mark 4:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Upon witnessing the stormy sea, the Master arose and displayed His authority by commanding both the wind and the sea to be silent and still. The power of His words went beyond a mere request, as He rebuked the wind and spoke to the sea, personifying them as servants who had exceeded their limits. This act of calming the storm and bringing a sudden calmness to the turbulent waters serves as a clear proof of His divinity, showing that He is the Almighty God who has control over the elements.

### Henry Alford:
1.  39.   σιώπα  ,   πεφ  . ] These remarkable words are given only here. On the variations in the accounts, see on Matthew 8:25 .

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And he arose, and rebuked the wind... and said unto the sea, Peace, be still—two sublime words of command, from a Master to His servants, the elements."
2. "The sudden hushing of the wind would not at once have calmed the sea, whose commotion would have settled only after a considerable time. But the word of command was given to both elements at once."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Peace, be still [σιωπα, πεφιμωσο] . Lit., be silent! be muzzled! Wyc., rather tamely, wax dumb! How much more vivid than the narratives of either Matthew or Luke is this personification and rebuke of the sea as a raging monster."
2. "Ceased [εκοπασεν]. From kopov, meaning, 1, beating; 2, toil; 3, weariness. A beautiful and picturesque word. The sea sank to rest as if exhausted by its own beating."
3. "There was [εγενετο]. More strictly, there arose or ensued. The aorist tense indicates something immediate. Tynd. has followed. Calm. Wyc., peaceableness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. Mark 4:39.  Peace, be still.  Mark alone preserves these words.
	

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Rebuked the wind  (επετιμησεν τω ανεμω) as in Matthew 8:26 and Luke 8:24."
2. "He spoke to the sea also."
3. "All three Gospels speak of the sudden calm (γαληνη) and the rebuke to the disciples for this lack of faith."

### John Gill:
1. "He arose and rebuked the wind, as if it was a servant that had exceeded his commission; at which he shows some resentment."
2. "As if that which was very tumultuous and boisterous, and threatened with shipwreck and the loss of lives, had raged too much and too long."
3. "A clear proof this, that he must be the most high God, who gathers the winds in his fists, and stills the noise of the seas and their waves."

### John Wesley:
1. Peace — Cease thy tossing: Be still - Cease thy roaring; literally, Be thou gagged.
