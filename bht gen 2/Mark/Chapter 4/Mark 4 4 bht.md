# Mark 4:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As the preacher shared the message of the Gospel, he encountered various responses. Some of the seed of the word fell by the wayside, on the hard path through the field, where the soil was not receptive, rendering the growth of the word impossible. The devil, ever present to hinder the effectiveness of the preached word, sought to ensure that not only could the seed not penetrate beneath the surface, but also that it would be trampled upon and eventually consumed by the fowls.
