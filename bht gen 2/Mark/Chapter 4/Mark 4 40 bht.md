# Mark 4:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the face of danger, the disciples exhibited a mix of faith and unbelief. Although they sought Christ's help, their fear revealed the smallness of their faith. While they recognized Jesus as their Savior, they lacked the full understanding of His power and authority, as evidenced by their doubts during the storm. The disciples' experience reflects our own struggles in times of trouble, reminding us to grow in faith and trust that even in the midst of storms, the Lord of wind and waves remains our Master.
