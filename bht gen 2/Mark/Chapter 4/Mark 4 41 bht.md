Witnessing the astonishing display of power over the wind and sea, the disciples were filled with a deep and profound fear. Their fear was not ordinary, but rather a profound awe and reverence. This extraordinary event prompted them to question and wonder about the nature of the one who could command the elements. They recognized that this person must be more than a mere man, but someone with divine authority and power. This remarkable demonstration of power further affirmed their belief in the deity of Christ and solidified their understanding of His extraordinary identity.
