# Mark 4:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Some people have hearts that are hardened like a ground with stones beneath the surface, preventing the word from taking root. Others respond quickly and superficially to the word, without allowing it to deeply impact their lives. If the word had taken root in a deeper layer of soil, it would have required more time and work before a true profession of faith could be made. This reminds us of the thorny ground, where the distractions of the world hinder the growth of the word. The condition of our hearts determines the fruitfulness of the word in our lives.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The thing intended is, not ground with stones in it which would not prevent the roots striking downward, but ground where a quite thin surface of earth covers a rock."
2. "What means this? See on Matthew 13:5."
3. "Third Case: THE THORNY GROUND."

### John Gill:
1. "The word was preached to some persons who had hearts of stone, and which remained so."
2. "A sudden and hasty profession of the word was made, without a powerful experience of it."
3. "If it had [depth of earth], it would have been longer in coming up; more work would have been done by it, which would have required more time, before a profession of it had been made."
