### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This case is that of ground not thoroughly cleaned of the thistles...which...choke or smother it, excluding light and air, and drawing away the moisture and richness of the soil."
2. "The evil here is neither a hard nor a shallow soil—there is softness enough, and depth enough; but it is the existence in it of what draws all the moisture and richness of the soil away to itself, and so starves the plant."
3. "What now are these 'thorns?' See on Matthew 13:22."

### Marvin Vincent:
