# Mark 5:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Matthew 8:28 and Luke 8:26, the Gospel writers mention the region where Jesus and his disciples arrived after crossing the sea. Some manuscripts refer to the area as the country of the Gadarenes, while others use the term Gerasenes. The Gerasenes likely refers to the city of Gerasa, approximately thirty miles away, whereas the Gadarenes likely refers to the city of Gadara, a city within the country of the Gergesenes. The location is associated with pagan customs and was close to the hot baths of Gadara.

### John Gill:
1. "The Vulgate Latin reads, 'of the Gerasenes', and so some copies, from Gerasa, a place in the same country; but the Syriac and Persic versions read, 'Gadarenes', as do most copies; so called from Gadara, a city either adjacent to, or within the country of the Gergesenes; which was called by both names, from these different places."  
2. "Chammath was a mile from Tiberias, and this Chammath was so near to the country of Gadara, that it is often called, 'Chammath of Gadara'; unless it should be rather rendered, 'the hot baths of Gadara'."
3. "It appears to be a Heathen country, both from its situation, and the manners of the people."
