# Mark 5:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The devils, recognizing the authority of Christ, pleaded with him to not just send them away, but to allow them to go into a herd of swine instead. Even though they despised Jesus, the demons were willing to humble themselves in order to accomplish their malevolent objectives. It is possible that they had a particular interest in staying in that region because it was a land of idolatry and wickedness, where their influence and power over the blind Gentiles and apostate Jews held great sway.
