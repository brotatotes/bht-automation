## BHT:
In Mark 5:11, the mention of the mountain can be understood as referring to either the mountains of Galaad or the mountains surrounding Tiberias.

The presence of a great herd of swine feeding on one side of the mountain, which consisted of about two thousand hogs, further highlights the significance of this detail. This context helps us to understand the subsequent events that unfold in the passage.
