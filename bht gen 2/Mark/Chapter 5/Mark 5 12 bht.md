# Mark 5:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The evil spirits pleaded to continue their destructive work by entering the swine, as they preferred causing havoc in a smaller way rather than being completely restrained. They were unwilling to leave the country or be sent into the deep abyss, and they were relentless in their pursuit of mischief. While they desired to harm the physical bodies of individuals, it is important to recognize the greater impact they would have if allowed to touch lives and ruin souls.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If we must quit our hold of this man, suffer us to continue our work of mischief in another form, that by entering these swine, and thus destroying the people's property, we may steel their hearts against Thee!"

### John Gill:
1. "They chose to be any where, rather than depart the country; and especially than to be sent into the deep, the abyss, or bottomless pit."
2. "The devils are unwearied in doing mischief, they cannot rest unless they are about it; and they choose to be concerned in doing it in a lesser way, if they are not allowed to do it as largely as they would."
3. "If they are not suffered to touch the lives of men, or ruin their souls, it, is some satisfaction to them to be suffered to hurt their bodies."
