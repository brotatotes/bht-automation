# Mark 5:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The incident recorded in this passage reveals the devastating influence of evil spirits. It is remarkable to see how these spirits can move from person to person, demonstrating their limitations in terms of space. While it may be challenging to comprehend how a single man could be possessed by so many demons, it is no more perplexing than understanding how a solitary demon can inhabit a person. The swine rushing towards the sea and perishing vividly portrays the chaotic frenzy induced by these malevolent forces. It is worth noting that Jesus did not directly destroy the herd; rather, the devils themselves caused their demise.
