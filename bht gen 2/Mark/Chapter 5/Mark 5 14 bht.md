# Mark 5:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the men arrived in the city, they immediately went to inform the owners of the swine about what had happened. They did this to avoid any blame or suspicion of negligence. As they journeyed through the fields and the city, they shared the news with everyone they came across, which resulted in a large crowd gathering to witness the aftermath. People from all parts of Gadara, whether they lived in the city or in the remote areas, went out to see for themselves and verify the truth of the swineherds' account.
