# Mark 5:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The whole city came out to meet Jesus, beholding Him with wonder and curiosity. This man, who once had wild and wandering habits, was now completely transformed. The Undesigned Coincidences among the different Evangelists reveal the remarkable nature of this event. The man, now sitting, clothed, and in his right mind, symbolizes the power of Christ to bring about true change. The onlookers, however, were filled with fear, trepidation, and awe at this incredible display of divine grace and authority.
