# Mark 5:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Witnesses who observed the incident described in vivid detail what they saw. They recounted how the man possessed by the devil recognized Jesus, prostrated himself before him, and was miraculously delivered from a legion of demons with just a word from Jesus. Additionally, they recounted the fate of the swine, as they explained how the demons, with permission from Jesus, entered the pigs and caused them to run madly towards the sea, where they eventually drowned.
