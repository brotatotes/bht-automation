# Mark 5:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people in this passage were both irritated and awe-struck by this great person among them. They could not order Him away, but did not understand His true nature as the Son of God. They saw Him as a threat, someone with power to harm rather than help. Their concern for material possessions outweighed their desire for spiritual healing. Sadly, they hesitated to let go of their sinful ways to fully embrace Him.
