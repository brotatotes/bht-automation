# Mark 5:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Jesus was entering the boat, a restored man beseeched Him with a grateful heart, still fresh from the hand of demons. This man's plea was not delayed until after Jesus had embarked but was made in the very act of Him stepping into the boat. The purpose of his entreaty was likely a personal expression of gratitude towards his Deliverer, desiring to separate himself from those who rejected Christ and perhaps fearing a relapse into his previous state. In this moment, we witness a soul filled with gratitude, seeking continued communion and protection from its wondrous Benefactor.
