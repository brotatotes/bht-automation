# Mark 5:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Go back to your hometown, to your own people, and share with them the amazing things the Lord has done for you. Your previous life may have caused harm, but now you have been blessed by Jesus, given the difficult task of being a witness in the place where you were known. There is no danger of too much enthusiasm for Christ in this environment, so go and declare in Zion the great things God has done for your soul. It will bring joy to the hearts of God's people and glorify His abundant grace.
