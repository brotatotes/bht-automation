# Mark 5:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Desiring the return of Jesus, the ruler of the synagogue promptly approached Him upon His arrival. This act suggests that the ruler, being a member of the synagogue council, had eagerly been waiting for Jesus' return and immediately sought Him out. It is important to note that synagogues were governed by a council of respected individuals, with a president known as the ruler of the synagogue. The ruler's reverential gesture of falling at Jesus' feet demonstrates his recognition of Jesus as a revered prophet and a man of God, expressing deep respect and reverence.
