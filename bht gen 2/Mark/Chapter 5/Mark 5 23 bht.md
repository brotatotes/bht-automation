## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Notice the affectionate diminutive θυγάτριον, peculiar to Mark."
2. "It is branded as an idiom of lower Greek by Phrynichus."
3. "To do this without any filling up, 'My daughter is, &c., in order that,' &c., is far-fetched, and savours too much of the sentimental."

2. "Matthew (Matthew 9:18) gives it thus: 'My daughter is even now dead'—'has just expired.'"
3. "In one of the class to which this man belonged, so steeped in prejudice, such faith would imply more than in others."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "My little daughter lieth at the point of death - that thou come, etc. In his anguish he speaks brokenly and incoherently."
2. "The multitude kept following and thronging as he went along. The preposition sun, together, in the latter verb, indicates the united pressure of a crowd."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "‘Little daughter,’ one word in the original, a diminutive of affection... Mark probably gives the exact words of the ruler."

3. "[I pray thee] come and lay thine hands on her, that she may be healed, and she shall live; expressing faith in the power of Christ to restore his daughter, though in the utmost extremity; yet seemed to think his presence, and the imposition of his hands were necessary to it" (commentary).
