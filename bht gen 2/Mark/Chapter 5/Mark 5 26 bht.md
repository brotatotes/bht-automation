# Mark 5:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The woman in question underwent various treatments but found no relief, highlighting the ineffectiveness of human remedies. Jesus' miraculous healing challenges societal norms by emphasizing compassion and proper care, especially for marginalized individuals. Similarly, many people struggle with spiritual maladies, uncertain of the true cure. Relying on human efforts and prescriptions can lead to bondage instead of freedom. Only through Christ can we find the healing and liberation we seek from our spiritual ailments.
