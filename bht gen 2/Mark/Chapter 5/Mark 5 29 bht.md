# Mark 5:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The woman knew in her body that she was healed, her disorder entirely gone after many years of affliction. The healing she experienced was not just physical, but a representation of the forgiveness of sin and the application of Christ's blood to the soul, resulting in spiritual joy, peace, and comfort. The effects of this healing are as tangible as a bodily cure, clear and perceptible to those who experience it.
