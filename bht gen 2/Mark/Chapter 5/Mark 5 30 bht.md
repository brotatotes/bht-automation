# Mark 5:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus had an internal, essential virtue within himself that enabled him to heal diseases. This power was not derived from another or exercised under another's influence; it was his own, the power of the Lord God omnipotent. Whenever he chose, this infinite virtue went forth from him to cure any disease he deemed fit, and it was not diminished by frequent exertions. In a similar way, Christ has the power to forgive all trespasses, and when he wills to extend his pardoning mercy to his people, there is an exertion of power along with a display of grace.
