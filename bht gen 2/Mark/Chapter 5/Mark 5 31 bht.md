# Mark 5:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples were taken aback by Jesus' question, almost perceiving it as weak and impertinent. They thought it was strange and unnecessary for Him to ask who touched Him, considering the crowded environment where He was constantly being jostled and pressed by the multitude. They failed to comprehend the significance of one particular touch, the deliberate and faith-filled touch of someone who sought to have a personal contact with Him amidst the crowd.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Askest thou, Lord, who touched Thee? Rather ask who touched Thee not in such a throng."
2. "Yes, the multitude 'thronged and pressed Him'—they jostled against Him, but all involuntarily; they were merely carried along; but one, one only—'a certain person—TOUCHED HIM,' with the conscious, voluntary, dependent touch of faith, reaching forth its hand expressly to have contact with Him."
3. "The voluntary, living contact of faith is that electric conductor which alone draws virtue out of Him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The denial of all is mentioned by the same Evangelist."
2. "This natural answer of the disciples, according to Luke, called forth an express declaration from our Lord."
3. "He perceived power had gone out from Him."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The disciples were amazed at the sensitiveness of Jesus to the touch of the crowd."
2. "They little understood the drain on Jesus from all this healing that pulled at his heart-strings and exhausted his nervous energy even though the Son of God."

### John Gill:
1. "They seem astonished at his question, and answer with some degree of warmth, and almost ready to charge it as weak: and impertinent."
2. "Since, as there was such a crowd about him, pressing him on every side, he could not but be touched by many; and therefore to ask who touched him, when this was the case, they thought was a very strange and unnecessary question."
