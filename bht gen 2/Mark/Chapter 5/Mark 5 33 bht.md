# Mark 5:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After experiencing the transformation of conversion and receiving forgiveness and healing, believers may still struggle with fear and apprehension, even though they have no reason to. This woman knew exactly what had happened to her and was fully aware that she was the one who had touched Jesus, resulting in her miraculous healing. Unable to hide any longer, she boldly came forward and confessed before everyone, no longer able to keep her faith hidden.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "alarmed, as a humble, shrinking female would naturally be, at the necessity of so public an exposure of herself, yet conscious that she had a tale to tell which would speak for her."
2. "trembling, and falling down before Him, she declared unto Him before all the people for what cause she had touched Him, and how she was healed immediately."
3. "This, though it tried the modesty of the believing woman, was just what Christ wanted in dragging her forth, her public testimony to the facts of her case—the disease, with her abortive efforts at a cure, and the instantaneous and perfect relief which her touching the Great Healer had brought her."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Her experience in the past well accounts for her conduct; rough physicians, painful treatment, loss of means, constant diminution of health, the nature of her disease, all led to the secret mode she adopted, and this was in keeping with that." 
2. "Her faith is brought out and triumphs thus over her timidity."
3. "To this day, physicians complain of want of candor in female patients, or at least of a failure to accurately state their symptoms, etc. So that the naturalness of the picture is remarkable."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "These participles vividly portray this woman who had tried to hide in the crowd."
2. "She had to come and confess, for something 'has happened' (γεγονεν, second perfect active indicative, still true) to her."
3. "Secrecy was no longer possible. She told 'the pitiful tale of chronic misery' (Bruce)."

### John Gill:
1. "After conversion, after souls have laid hold on Christ for righteousness and life; after they have had the pardon of their sins, and are cured of their diseases, they are not without their fears and tremblings, though there is no just reason for them."
2. "Knowing what was done in her, and by her; being conscious to herself that she was the person that had touched him, and that upon it the fountain of her blood was dried up, and she was thoroughly healed of her disease."
3. "In some copies it is added, 'before all'; before Christ and his disciples, and the throng of people that were along with him: she that came behind Christ, and privately took hold of the hem of his garment, her faith secretly going out unto him; now appears openly before him, not being able to hide herself any longer."
