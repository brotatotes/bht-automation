# Mark 5:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The messengers from the ruler of the synagogue came to Jesus to bring news of his daughter's death, expecting that it would no longer be necessary to trouble the Teacher any further. They believed that although Jesus had performed many powerful miracles, raising the dead was beyond his abilities. However, they were unaware of Jesus' miraculous raising of the widow of Nain's son. With their limited understanding, they believed the situation was hopeless and that Jesus could not possibly bring the ruler's daughter back to life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 35. Thy daughter is dead; why
	troublest thou the Master any further?—the Teacher.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "From the ruler of the synagogue. From his house; for the ruler himself is addressed."
2. "Troublest [σκυλλεις]. See on Matthew 9:36. Compare Luke 11:22, where occurs the cognate word skula, spoils, things torn or stripped from an enemy."
3. "Wyc., travailest. Tynd., diseasest."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Why troublest thou the master any further?" The underlying thought is: the case is now beyond the help of Jesus, who might have cured, but cannot raise her.
2. "The language is kind, and indicates faith."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Nowhere does Mark preserve better the lifelike traits of an eyewitness like Peter than in these incidents in chapter 5."
2. "It was all over, so they felt. Jesus had raised from the dead the son of the widow of Nain, but people in general did not expect him to raise the dead."
3. "There was no further use in troubling the Teacher about the girl."

### John Gill:
1. "These brought him the account that his daughter was actually dead, which he himself feared before; and therefore they thought it was in vain to give Christ any further trouble to drag along through a crowd of people pressing him..."
2. "Whom they looked upon as a very worthy person, an eminent doctor and prophet, a master in Israel, and one that had done great cures on living persons in distress; yet imagined it was wholly out of his power to raise one from the dead..."
3. "...unless the raising of the widow of Nain's son was before this, as indeed it seems to be; but perhaps persons, who were some of the relations, or domestics of the ruler, had heard nothing of it; for if they had, they might have hoped he would have exerted his power in raising the ruler's daughter, as well as the widow's son."
