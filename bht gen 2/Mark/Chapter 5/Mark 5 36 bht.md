# Mark 5:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, in his omniscience, overheard the doubtful message but chose to disregard its import. Instead, he lovingly encourages Jairus to not be discouraged or doubtful, but to believe in his power to help, even in the face of death. For when one truly believes, there is no reason to fear, knowing that nothing is impossible for the almighty power of God. Moreover, faith is not something we conjure up on our own, but a gift from God, made alive through the operation of his Spirit and the influence of his efficacious grace.
