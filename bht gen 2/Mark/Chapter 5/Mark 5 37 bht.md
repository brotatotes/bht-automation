# Mark 5:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus had a specific purpose when he allowed only Peter, James, and John to follow him and witness certain events. This trio formed an inner circle, chosen by Jesus to accompany him during significant moments, such as the Transfiguration. The close relationship between Jesus and these three disciples is evident through their exclusive presence at the Mount of Transfiguration and in the Garden of Gethsemane. This demonstrates Jesus' intention to share intimate experiences with a select few, allowing them to witness his divinity firsthand and carry forth his teachings with authority.
