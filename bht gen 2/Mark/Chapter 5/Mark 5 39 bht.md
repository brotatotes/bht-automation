# Mark 5:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The mourning crowd filled the house with their ostentatious noise, distracting from the reality of the situation. Jesus, aware of their skepticism, told them that the girl was not dead, but merely asleep. This metaphorical language hinted at the future resurrection and the temporary nature of death. He emphasized that her condition was not one of permanent dormancy, but rather a short state in which she would soon be awakened by his miraculous power. The use of the term sleep served as a beautiful and reassuring word, highlighting the certainty of her imminent revival.
