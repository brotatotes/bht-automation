## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The διὰ τό gives the reason, not why he could not be bound, but why the conclusion was come to that he could not."
2. "The πέδαι are shackles for the feet, the ἁλύσεις chains in general, without specifying for what part of the body."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Often times it [the unclean spirit] had caught him" and after mentioning how they had vainly tried to bind him with chains and fetters, because, "he brake the bands," he adds, "and was driven of the devil [demon] into the wilderness."
2. The dark tyrant-power by which he was held clothed him with superhuman strength and made him scorn restraint.
3. He was the terror of the whole locality.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "With fetters and chains [πεδαις και αλυσεσιν]. pedh, fetter, is akin to peza, the instep; just as the Latin pedica, a shackle, is related to pes, a foot. The Anglo - Saxon plural of fot (foot) is fet; so that fetter is feeter."
2. "The verb suntribw means originally to rub together, to grind or crush. It has been suggested that the fetters might have been of cords which could be rubbed to pieces."
3. "Wyc. renders, Had broken the stocks to small gobbets."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

3. "Broken in pieces...rubbed together, crushed together."

### John Gill:
1. "His arms had been bound with chains, and his feet with fetters, which was very proper to prevent doing hurt to himself, and injury to others."
2. "The chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces; as if they had been twine threads; such was his strength, through the force of madness, and the possession of Satan, and his diabolical influence."
3. "This man was so furious and outrageous, that he was not to be managed any way, either by art or force."
