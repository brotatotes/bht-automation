# Mark 5:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The phrase I say unto thee is added to the Syriac words spoken by Christ, emphasizing his authority over death. The transformation of Tali to Talitha carries the tender meaning of girl, and its usage echoes throughout the Talmud and Targums. In this context, the girl, being only twelve years old, is aptly described by this endearing name.
