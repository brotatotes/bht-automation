## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The whole account is probably derived from the testimony of Peter, who was present."
2. "The ἦν γὰρ ἐτῶν δώδεκα is added, as Bengel, to shew that she 'rediit ad statum ætati congruentem.'"
3. "Notice in the last words, that her further recovery of strength is left to natural causes."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Straightway the damsel arose. Luke, the physician, speaks of her spirit returning."
