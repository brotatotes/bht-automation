# Mark 5:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This man, in a state of unregeneracy, was a vivid representation of a person corrupted by sin. His soul and spirit were tainted with iniquity, just like every person who is not yet transformed by the regenerating work of God. No human effort can free him from this defilement. Only the cleansing power of Christ's blood has the ability to remove all sin. The man was completely under the control of Satan, with a multitude of demons afflicting him. This serves as a reminder that Satan exercises dominion over those who remain in disobedience to God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Terrible as he was to others, he himself endured untold misery, which sought relief in tears and self-inflicted torture."


### Marvin Vincent:
1. Crying [κραζων] . Rev., crying out. The verb denotes an inarticulate cry; a shriek. Aristophanes uses it of the frogs (" Ranae, "258), and of the bawling of a boor (" Equites," 285).

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He was crying out, and cutting himself with stones. Further vivid details by Mark." 
2. "Night and day his loud scream or screech could be heard like other demoniacs."
3. "Perhaps he was scarred all over with such gashes during his moments of wild frenzy night and day in the tombs and on the mountains."

### John Gill:
1. "This man was a lively emblem of a man in a state of nature and unregeneracy: he had 'an unclean spirit', as every natural man has; his soul or spirit is defiled with sin, particularly his mind and conscience."
2. "Nothing that he can do, or can be done for him by a mere creature, can free him from it: nothing but the blood of Christ, and that cleanses from all sin."
3. "This man was altogether under the power and influence of Satan, and had a legion of devils within him. Satan is in every unconverted man, in every child of disobedience; and works effectually in him, and leads him captive at his will."
