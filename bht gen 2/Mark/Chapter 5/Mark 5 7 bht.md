# Mark 5:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The demons in the possessed man in Luke acknowledge Jesus as the Son of the Most High God, recognizing His supreme authority. Their plea for Jesus to not torment them reflects their understanding of the impending judgment they face. They implore Him to deal with them as God does, extending their respite before their final doom. This confession of Jesus' divinity highlights that even demons recognize His true nature, while humans may have knowledge of Christ without a personal connection or interest in Him.
