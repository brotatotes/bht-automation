# Mark 5:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ has the absolute power to drive out Satan from the hearts where He intends to reside. By His mighty power, Jesus binds the strong man armed and sanctifies the heart to be fit for His dwelling. It is crucial to understand that we cannot deliver ourselves from the clutches of Satan or purify ourselves on our own. The deliverance from the power of evil and the transformation of our hearts are entirely the result of Christ's efficacious grace at work within us.

"Christ will not dwell where Satan does; when therefore he is about to take up his residence in the hearts of any, he outs with Satan; he binds the strong man armed, and dispossesses him; he causes the spirit of uncleanness to depart; he sanctifies the heart by his grace and Spirit, and so makes it a proper habitation for him to dwell in by faith; and this is done by mighty power."
2. "A man cannot deliver himself out of the hands of Satan, or cause him to quit his hold of him, or the unclean spirit to depart; nor can he sanctify and cleanse himself, and make himself meet for the master's use."
3. "This is all owing to efficacious grace."
