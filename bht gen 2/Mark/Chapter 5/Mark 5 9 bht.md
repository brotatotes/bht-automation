# Mark 5:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
What a wretched state this poor man was in, plagued and tormented by such a vast assembly of demons. They were so numerous that they referred to themselves as a legion, a term used by the Romans to denote a large number of soldiers. These demons were organized and united under one leader, who spoke on behalf of the entire group. It is clear from this account that there is a multitude of demons who actively seek to harm and oppress humanity.
