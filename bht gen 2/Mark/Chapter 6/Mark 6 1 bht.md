# Mark 6:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus left the place he was in and returned to his hometown. This visit to his own country is separate from the one mentioned in another Gospel, emphasizing the significance of Jesus coming back to the place where he was conceived and educated. Despite facing rejection in both visits, it is not surprising that Jesus would give his hometown a second chance. This decision to revisit his own country highlights the natural inclination of a true disciple of Jesus to nurture and maintain relationships with family and loved ones.
