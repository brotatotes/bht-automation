# Mark 6:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus sent out his disciples, he instructed them to choose their dwelling place wisely and not to be restless or dissatisfied. He emphasized the importance of settling in one house and remaining there until their departure. This was not a prohibition against accepting invitations or showing hospitality to others, but rather a practical instruction for the disciples to focus on their mission and avoid distractions. They were to make a thoughtful decision about where to stay and commit to it during their time in each city or town.
