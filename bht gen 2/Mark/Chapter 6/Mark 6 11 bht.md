# Mark 6:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When encountering resistance and rejection, we are instructed to shake off the dust under our feet, a symbolic act that signifies testimony against those who reject the Gospel message. By shaking off the dust, we demonstrate that we have been with them and attempted to share the Good News. This action serves as a reminder that there will be a future day of judgment, appointed by God, that is unknown to us. However, the punishment for those who reject the Gospel will be milder and more tolerable compared to those who had the privilege of hearing and rejecting it.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The dative αυτοις in Mark is the dative of disadvantage and really carries the same idea as επ in Luke." 
2. "The dramatic figure of shaking out (εκτιναξατε, effective aorist imperative, Mark and Matthew), shaking off (αποτινασσετε, present imperative, Luke)."

### John Gill:
1. "shake off the dust under your feet, for a testimony against them; that they had been with them, and attempted to preach the Gospel to them, but they despised and rejected it"
2. "It is certain that there will be a day of judgment; it is fixed, God has appointed it, though it is not known by men or angels"
3. "their punishment will be milder and more tolerable, than that of the inhabitants of such places, where the Gospel has been preached, and they have despised and rejected it"
