# Mark 6:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The anointing with oil described in the Bible had multiple purposes. It served as a symbol of healing power beyond the oil itself, a connection between Christ or the apostles and the person being healed, and a representation of anointing by the Holy Spirit. While it had a soothing effect, it was not solely for medicinal purposes. This practice continued in the early Church, but it is distinct from the Roman sacrament of extreme unction. Ultimately, the anointing with oil was a means of divine healing through the blessing of God and carried a symbolic significance.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This oil was not used medicinally, but as a vehicle of healing power committed to them; a symbol of a deeper thing than the oil itself could accomplish."
2. "That such anointing has nothing in common with the extreme unction of Romanists, see proved in note on James 5:14."
3. "See for instances of such symbolic use of external applications, 2 Kings 5:14; Mark 8:23; John 9:6, &c."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Anointing with oil was in common use among the Jews in cases of sickness. It was supposed to have a mild, soothing, and alleviating effect on the body." 
2. "It need not be supposed, however, that the apostles used oil for mere 'medical' purposes. It was used, probably, like the imposition of hands, or like our Saviourâ€™s anointing the eyes of the blind with clay; also as a sign, in expectation of imparting that aid and comfort from God which was sought, and which was 'represented' by the soothing and gentle effect of oil."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "'The vehicle of healing power committed to them' (Alford), an external sign such as our Lord sometimes used to connect Himself and the person cured."
2. "It was probably also a symbol of anointing by the Holy Spirit."
3. "A practice of this kind continued in the Apostolic Church (see James 5:14); but neither the fact nor the symbolical meaning justify the Roman sacrament of extreme unction."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They cast out many demons and they anointed with oil... This is the only example in the N.T. of Î±Î»ÎµÎ¹Ï†Ï‰ ÎµÎ»Î±Î¹Ï‰ used in connection with healing save in James 5:14."
2. "In both cases it is possible that the use of oil (olive oil) as a medicine is the basis of the practice."
3. "The only problem is whether Î±Î»ÎµÎ¹Ï†Ï‰ in Mark and James is used wholly in a ritualistic and ceremonial sense or partly as medicine and partly as a symbol of divine healing."

### John Gill:
1. "And they cast out many devils...in confirmation of their mission and doctrine...as a prelude of what they were to be the instruments of, in casting Satan out of the souls of men."
2. "This they were doubtless directed to by Christ, as an outward sign of healing; but not as a medicine; otherwise there would have been no miracle in the cure."
3. "The healing virtue was not in the means, nor was it tied to any...it might show, that they were sent forth by Christ the anointed one...it might be symbolical of the grace of the Spirit...and it might be significative of the Gospel itself, which brings light and joy, health and comfort along with it."

### John Wesley:
1. "And it seems this was the great standing means of healing, desperate diseases in the Christian Church, long before extreme unction was used or heard of, which bears scarce any resemblance to it."
2. "The former being used only as a means of health; the latter only when life is despaired of."
3. "He shall be restored to health: not by the natural efficacy of the oil, but by the supernatural blessing of God."
