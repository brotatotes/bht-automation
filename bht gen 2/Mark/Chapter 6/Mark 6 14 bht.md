# Mark 6:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Matthew 14:1 and Luke 9:7 tell the story of Herod, who though not a king in the proper sense, was referred to as such by his courtiers and the common people. As governor of the region, he would have heard about the fame of Jesus and the miraculous things being done by Him. Having previously put John the Baptist to death, the news of Jesus' ministry haunted Herod, as he was reminded of his guilt and the consequences of his actions.
