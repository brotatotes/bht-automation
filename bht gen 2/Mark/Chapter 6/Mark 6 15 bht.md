# Mark 6:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of differing opinions about the identity of Jesus, some believed that he was Elias, while others thought he was a prophet, or as one of the prophets. This notion of him being a prophet like those who came before him suggests that he possessed a similar level of authority and divine wisdom as the great prophets of old, such as Isaiah and Jeremiah. However, it also indicates that he was not the ultimate Prophet that everyone was waiting for. Despite this, Jesus's prophetic role was still significant, as he demonstrated through his teachings and miraculous works.
