# Mark 6:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Herod, the ruler, ordered his guards to capture and imprison John, who was bound in prison. This happened in the castle of Machaerus, a fortified structure near the southern part of Herod's territory. John's imprisonment was due to Herodias, the granddaughter of Herod the Great, who became Herod Antipas' wife after leaving her first husband, Philip. This complex marital situation led to the downfall of John.
