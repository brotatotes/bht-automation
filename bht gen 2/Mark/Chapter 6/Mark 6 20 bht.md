# Mark 6:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Herod both feared and preserved John, preventing Herodias from executing her plans against him. John's righteousness and holiness gained him high regard. Yet, Herod's joy in hearing John's teachings was merely superficial, as Herodias still held a place of sway in his life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Preserved him; not, ‘esteemed him highly:’ kept him in safety that he should not be killed by Herodias." 
2. "The reading ἠπόρει is remarkable, and perhaps has some connexion with the διηπόρει of Luke 9:7."

### Marvin Vincent:
