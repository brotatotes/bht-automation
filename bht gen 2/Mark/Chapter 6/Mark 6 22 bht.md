# Mark 6:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Salome, the daughter of Herodias, was the one who danced in front of Herod and his guests. This was not just any ordinary dance, but it had a specific purpose. Herodias put forward her own daughter, instead of a professional dancer, to accomplish her malicious intent. The fact that Salome was Herodias' own daughter emphasized the severity of the situation. The dance pleased not only Herod but also everyone present at the supper, including his lords, captains, and principal men. Herod was so delighted by Salome's performance that it brought pleasure to his entire company.
