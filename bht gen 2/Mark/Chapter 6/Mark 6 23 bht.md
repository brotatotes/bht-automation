# Mark 6:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The ruler, referred to as a king, emphasizes the seriousness of his statement with an oath. He confirms his commitment by adding an additional oath, assuring the girl that he will grant her request. The phrase to the half of my kingdom is a proverbial expression to emphasize the extent to which he is willing to fulfill her desires. This oath mirrors a similar oath made by another ruler in a different context.
