# Mark 6:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Although Herod experienced great remorse, he could not bring himself to reject the dancing girl's request due to his fear of appearing unsteady and unreliable. His hesitance to break a hasty promise overshadowed his conscience and led him further down a destructive path. This pattern of prioritizing worldly reputation over moral principles is a common pitfall, causing many to stumble and fall into detrimental choices. The allure of false shame and the desire to avoid being seen as troubled by religious or moral scruples has proven to be a fatal snare for countless individuals throughout history.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "With his feelings regarding John, and the truths which so told upon his conscience from that preacher's lips, and after so often and carefully saving him from his paramour's rage, it must have been very galling to find himself at length entrapped by his own rash folly."
2. "See how men of no principle, but troublesome conscience, will stick at breaking a rash oath, while yielding to the commission of the worst crimes!"
3. "Under the influence of that false shame, which could not brook being thought to be troubled with religious or moral scruples. To how many has this proved a fatal snare!"

2. "No inward feelings of religion constrained Herod to do this, but the mere love of power drove him headlong; for he reckoned that he would sink in the estimation of those who were present, if he did not fulfill his engagement."
3. "Hence it follows, that monastic vows, which are attended by open impiety, do not bind the conscience any more than the enchantments of magicians; for it is not the will of God that his sacred name shall give support to what is sinful."

### Philip Schaff:
