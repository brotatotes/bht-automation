# Mark 6:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage tells us that the king quickly sent a member of his body-guard, who was not only a lookout but also an executioner, to fulfill his command. The use of the word executioner implies that the task was carried out promptly, as the guard was accustomed to such duties. The phrase he went and beheaded him in the prison indicates that this sad and fearful Tetrarch, who was now under the control of Herodias, followed through with the order to take John's life.
