# Mark 6:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Herodias wanted John the Baptist killed, she didn't physically shed his blood herself, but she was the one who orchestrated it and took pleasure in it. The fact that John's head was presented in a dish was an added insult, turning his death into a grotesque spectacle for the amusement of Herod and his guests. This horrific scene serves as a chilling warning that those who sit at the tables of the powerful can easily be drawn into wickedness and associated with great evil.
