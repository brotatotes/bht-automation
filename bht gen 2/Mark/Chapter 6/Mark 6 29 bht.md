# Mark 6:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples of John, having heard about the execution of their master, came and told Jesus. It was a mournful time for them, as they saw their teacher's corpse and witnessed the cruelty of Herodias in having his head carried away. In the end, they lovingly laid John's body in a tomb, honoring him even in death.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If these disciples had, up to this time, stood apart from Him, as adherents of John, perhaps they now came to Jesus, not without some secret reflection on Him for His seeming neglect of their master; but perhaps, too, as orphans, to cast in their lot henceforth with the Lord's disciples."
2. "How Jesus felt, or what He said, on receiving this intelligence, is not recorded; but He of whom it was said, as He stood by the grave of His friend Lazarus, 'Jesus wept,' was not likely to receive such intelligence without deep emotion."
3. "And one reason why He might not be unwilling that a small body of John's disciples should cling to him to the last, might be to provide some attached friends who should do for his precious body, on a small scale, what was afterwards to be done for His own."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "This man, whose inner life was burnt out; who was made up of contradictions, speaking of his kingdom like Ahasuerus, and yet the slave of his Jezebel; willingly hearing the prophet, and unwillingly killing him" (Stier).
2. "Who will be a Sadducee, and yet thinks of a resurrection; who has a superstitious fear of the Lord Jesus, and yet a curiosity to see him" (Stier).

### John Calvin:
