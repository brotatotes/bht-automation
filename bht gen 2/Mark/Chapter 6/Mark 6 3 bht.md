# Mark 6:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The expression the carpenter used to describe Jesus is significant as it suggests that Jesus actually worked in the trade of his reputed father, Joseph. This points to the fact that Jesus likely followed in the footsteps of his earthly father and engaged in carpentry himself. By doing so, he not only exemplified industry and diligence but also shared in the toil and labor that came as part of the curse placed on humanity after the fall.

3. "Tynd., hurt."

### John Gill:
1. "Such may Christ be reasonably thought to be, since his father was; and which business he might follow, partly through the meanness and poverty of his parents; and partly that he might set an example of industry and diligence; and chiefly to bear that part of the first Adam's curse, which was to eat his bread with the sweat of his brow"

### John Wesley:
1. Is not this the carpenter? — There can be no doubt, but in his youth he wrought with his supposed father Joseph.
