# Mark 6:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus instructed his disciples to come aside to a secluded place and find rest. The disciples, who had been working tirelessly in preaching and performing miracles, were in need of refreshment and renewal. The multitude of people, constantly coming and going, left them with no leisure time, even to eat. The demand on their time and energy was great, and Jesus understood the importance of taking moments of solitude for reflection, prayer, and physical replenishment. This episode serves as a reminder for all preachers and teachers to prioritize self-care and occasional retreats for spiritual and physical rest.
