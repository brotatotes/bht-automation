# Mark 6:33 Commentary Help Text

In Mark 6:33, we see a striking picture of the continued fascination with Christ as the multitude saw him and his disciples embarking on a ship. This caused many to recognize him and hasten to the place they perceived he was headed. Their eagerness was so great that they arrived before Jesus and the disciples. The people were drawn to Jesus not only to witness his miracles but also to hear his profound teachings.
