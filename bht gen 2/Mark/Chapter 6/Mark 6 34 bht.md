# Mark 6:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Jesus came out of the vessel, he immediately saw the multitudes before him. Just as a shepherd tends to his flock, Jesus had a heart filled with compassion for the people, who were like lost sheep in need of guidance and protection. He willingly set aside his own personal rest and privacy to minister to them and meet their needs.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "To shew how arbitrary is the assumption of Mark having combined Matt. and Luke, see how easily the same might be said of Luke himself, with regard to Matt. and Mark here."
2. "There is nothing in Matt. to imply that He had reached his place of solitude before the multitudes came up."
3. "He may very well have mounted the hill or cliff from the sea before He saw the multitudes, and this would be on his disembarkation."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "At the sight of the multitudes who had followed Him by land and even got before Him, He was so moved, as was His wont in such cases, with compassion, because they were like shepherdless sheep, as to forego both privacy and rest that He might minister to them."
2. "This accounts for the multitudes that now crowded around Him. They were on their way to keep that festival at Jerusalem."

### Philip Schaff:
