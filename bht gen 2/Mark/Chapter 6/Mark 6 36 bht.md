# Mark 6:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus instructed his disciples to send the crowd away and dismiss the assembly, urging them to go into the surrounding fields and villages. He acknowledged their need for food and told the disciples to buy bread for themselves since they had nothing to eat. It was well past the usual time for dining, and the people needed some refreshment. His statement served as a test to see how Philip and the others would respond, even though Jesus already knew what He was going to do.
