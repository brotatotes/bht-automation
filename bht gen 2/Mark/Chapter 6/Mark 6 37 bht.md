# Mark 6:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples were faced with a challenging situation, for there were a multitude of people who needed to be fed. Jesus posed a question to test their faith and pave the way for a miracle. Philip, acknowledging the limited resources they had, responded with doubt, questioning whether it was appropriate to spend their money to buy food for the multitude. The disciples were astounded by Jesus' suggestion, as it seemed impossible to meet such a great need.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This verse is to me rather a decisive proof that (see above) Mark had not seen John’s account; for how could he, having done so, and with his love for accurate detail, have so generalized the particular account of Philip’s question?"
2. "That generalization was in the account which he used, and the circumstance was more exactly related by John, as also the following one concerning Andrew."
3. "I prefer placing the interrogation at the end of the sentence, as simpler and less harsh than the arrangement of Lachm. (interrog. af [21]. ἄρτους, full stop at the end) or Tischd [22]. (comma, full stop). The two verbs will then be rendered must we go and buy, &c…, and shall we (thus) give them to eat?"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Give ye them to eat—doubtless said to prepare them for what was to follow."
2. "Philip answered Him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Shall we go and buy, etc. This question and Christ 's answer are peculiar to Mark.

### John Gill:
1. "This he said to try their faith, and make way for the following miracle."
2. "Shall we lay out the two hundred pence, which is all we have in hand, to buy bread for this multitude? Is it proper we should? Is it thy will that so it should be?"
3. "They say this, as amazed that he should propose such a thing unto them."
