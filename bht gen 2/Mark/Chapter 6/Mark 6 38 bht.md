# Mark 6:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples, realizing their limited provisions, expressed their concerns to Jesus. Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, shared that there was a lad in the crowd who had only five barley loaves and two small fishes. They were unsure of how these meager resources could possibly feed the multitudes. Jesus, however, already knew their situation and posed the question to test their faith and to demonstrate a greater miracle. He instructed them to go and see if there were any other provisions available.
