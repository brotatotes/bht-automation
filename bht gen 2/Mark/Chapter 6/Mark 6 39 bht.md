# Mark 6:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Upon the green grass, the disciples were commanded by Christ to have the multitude seated or lying down, resembling their usual manner of dining. They were arranged by companies, creating a sense of order, akin to being seated at tables. This arrangement served the purpose of allowing everyone to witness the forthcoming miracle more clearly, and facilitated the organized distribution of provisions to the multitude.
