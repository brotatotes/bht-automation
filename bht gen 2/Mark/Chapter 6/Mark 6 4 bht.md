# Mark 6:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Despite being a prophet, Jesus found that he was not honored in his hometown, among his own relatives, and even in his own house. This lack of honor was unique to Mark's account, emphasizing the rejection Jesus faced from those who were familiar with him. His own kindred and people were envious of his gifts and doubted his authority, disregarding his wisdom and dismissing his miracles. Even though Jesus had grown up among them, they could not accept him as the Messiah.
