# Mark 6:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The crowd was arranged in a neat and orderly manner, appearing like garden beds or rows of vines in a vineyard. Each group consisted of either a hundred or fifty individuals, resembling the structure of a parterre or bed in a garden. In this organized arrangement, there were fifty seated in a row and a hundred seated in a column. By multiplying a hundred by fifty, the total number of people fed by the miracle amounted to five thousand.
