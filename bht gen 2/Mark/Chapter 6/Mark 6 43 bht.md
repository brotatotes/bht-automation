# Mark 6:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The first three Evangelists wrote independently of one another, using different words to describe the baskets used to gather the fragments. However, their accounts complement each other, providing a cohesive picture of the miracle. There may be variations in their descriptions, but this goes to show the authenticity of the narratives. Ultimately, the baskets were filled with an abundance of fragments, both from the bread and the fish, enough to satisfy everyone's needs and leaving no room for doubt regarding the veracity of this miraculous event.
