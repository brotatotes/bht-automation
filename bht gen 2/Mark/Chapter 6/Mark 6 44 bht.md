# Mark 6:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The remarkable miracle recorded in all Four Gospels is evidence of the nature of God's work. The fact that the word about is omitted in several versions shows the certainty of there being five thousand men who ate from the loaves and fishes. It is worth noting that Matthew includes the detail of women and children being present, highlighting the vast number of people who were witness to this extraordinary event.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Of these, however, there would probably not be many; as only the males were obliged to go to the approaching festival."
2. "One very important particular given by John alone introduces this portion: 'When Jesus therefore perceived that they would take Him by force, to make Him a king, He departed again into a mountain Himself alone.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Men [ανδρες] . Not generic, including men and women, but literally men. Compare Matthew 14:21, beside women and children; a detail which we should have expected from Mark.

### Philip Schaff:
1. Mark 6:44.  Five thousand men. Mark, usually so exact, does not speak of the ‘women and children’ (Matthew). An evidence of independence.
	

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This remarkable miracle is recorded by all Four Gospels, a nature miracle that only God can work."
2. "No talk about accelerating natural processes will explain this miracle."
3. "The evidence is overwhelming."

### John Gill:
1. "And they that did eat of the loaves,.... And also of the fishes; for they all ate of both; were about five thousand men." 
2. "The word ωσει, 'about', is omitted in the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, Arabic, Persic and Ethiopic versions, reading five thousand men certain." 
3. "The Evangelist Matthew adds, 'beside children and women', Matthew 14:21."
