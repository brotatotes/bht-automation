# Mark 6:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After a long day of ministering to the crowds, Jesus found solace in solitude. He withdrew to a mountain to commune with His Father, seeking the privacy and rest that had eluded Him throughout the day. This mountain became a place of respite, where Jesus could pour out His soul and pray for His disciples, even observing them from afar. It was a place of refuge and prayer, where Jesus could prepare Himself for the next phase of His ministry.
