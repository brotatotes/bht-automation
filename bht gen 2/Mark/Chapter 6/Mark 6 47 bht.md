# Mark 6:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of the sea, the disciples faced distress and a hard gale of wind, all while their master was not with them. It seemed impossible for Jesus to get to the ship, especially in such a storm. This situation serves as an illustration of the upcoming miracle, where Jesus walks on water in the midst of a stormy, blustering night to reach his disciples. The circumstances highlight the disciples' desperate need for Jesus's presence and the incredible power that he possesses.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It had come even when the disciples embarked (Matthew 14:23; John 6:16)."
2. "Perhaps they made no great effort to push across at first, having a lingering hope that their Master would yet join them, and so allowed the darkness to come on."
3. "And the sea arose" (adds the beloved disciple, John 6:18), "by reason of a great wind that blew."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "When evening was come." - The second or late evening, six P.M. at this season, or sunset on.
2. "He alone on the land." - Another Markan touch. Jesus had come down out of the mountain where he had prayed to the Father. 
3. "He is by the sea again in the late twilight." - Apparently Jesus remained quite a while, some hours, on the beach. "It was now dark and Jesus had not yet come to them" (John 6:17).

### John Gill:
1. "This is observed, partly to show what distress the disciples were in, in the midst of the sea, having a hard gale of wind, and their master not with them."
2. "Partly to show that there was no way, humanly speaking, of Christ's getting to the ship, in order to go over."
3. "And is an illustration of the following miracle, of walking so many furlongs, as he must, upon the water, in a stormy, blustering night, to get to it."
