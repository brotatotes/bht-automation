# Mark 6:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He observed them in their distress, fully aware of their situation even in the darkness. It seemed as though he intended to pass by them without intervening, walking as if he was simply passing by.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "A silent note of Inspiration. He was about to pass by them. He intended so to do. But what man could say this? Who knoweth the mind of Christ but the Spirit of God? Compare 1 Corinthians 2:11." 
2. "But it may be doubted whether this is either a safe or a sober comment. ἤθελεν has here but a faint subjective reference, and is more nearly the 'would have passed by them' of the E. V. See on Luke 24:28, for the meaning."
3. "Lange, Leben Jesu, ii. p. 788 note, well remarks, that this ἤθελεν παρελθεῖν, and the ἤθελον οὖν of John 6:21, mutually explain one another."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He 'saw' this from His mountain top, and through the darkness of the night, for His heart was all with them: yet would He not go to their relief till His own time came."
2. "So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, rather more than halfway across. The lake is about seven miles broad at its widest part. So that in eight or nine hours they had only made some three and a half miles."
3. "He cometh unto them, walking upon the sea... And would have passed by them—but only in the sense of Luke 24:28; Genesis 32:26; Genesis 18:3; Genesis 18:5; Genesis 42:7."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He saw [ιδων] . Participle. Rev., seeing. Better, however, the literal having seen. It was this which induced him to go to them."
2. "Toiling [βασανιζομενους] . Lit., tormented. Rev., distressed. See on Matthew 4:24. Wyc., travailing. Tynd., troubled."
3. "Fourth watch. Between 3 and 6 A. M. Would have passed by them. Peculiar to Mark."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Distressed in rowing. Lit., ‘tormented.’ In consequence of the contrary wind."
2. "Would have passed by them. Mentioned by Mark only: This was to try them."
3. "This passing on was, as it were, to show them the way, to show that they need no longer toil to meet Him at eastern Bethsaida, but might pass directly over."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They drove the boat with oars."
2. "The wind was contrary to them, that is in their faces and rowing was difficult."
3. "He wished to pass by them, praeterire eos."

### John Gill:
1. "He saw them either with his bodily eyes from the mountain on which he was; or he perceived in his Spirit, he knew, by virtue of his omniscience as God, what distress his disciples were in."
2. "Being in this distress, Christ came down from the mountain to the sea side; and then, by his divine power, as the mighty God, that treadeth on the waves of the sea, he walked upon the surface of the waters of it."
3. "By the course he steered, by the swiftness of his motion, and his seeming negligence of them, it looked as though he intended to have gone by them, and said nothing to them, though this was far from his real design."

### John Wesley:
1. And he saw them — For the darkness could veil nothing from him.And would have passed by them — That is, walked, as if he was passing by.
