# Mark 6:49 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of a storm, the disciples were terrified when they saw a figure approaching them on the water. At first, they mistook it for a spirit, a dark moving speck that evoked fear and confusion. Their cries revealed their fright and the belief that the figure could bring harm or was a premonition of evil. This reaction is reminiscent of another incident where the disciples, upon seeing the resurrected Jesus, also thought He was a spirit. Both events highlight the common human response of fear and uncertainty when confronted with the supernatural or the unexpected.
