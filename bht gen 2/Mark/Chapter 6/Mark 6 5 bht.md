# Mark 6:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus' inability to perform miracles in a specific place was not due to a lack of power, but rather it was because it was not fitting for Him to do so in that circumstance. He demonstrated His omnipotence through the miracles He performed in other locations. In this particular situation, it was inconsistent with His wisdom and goodness to perform miracles, as it would not have served His greater purpose and may have even intensified their condemnation.
