# Mark 6:53 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus and His disciples had crossed over to the other side, they arrived at the land of Gennesaret, near Capernaum, where they drew the boat to the shore. It is significant to note that the disciples moored the boat, casting anchor or lashing it to a post. This indicates that their sailing was not miraculous, but rather a natural course of action. The land of Gennesaret was known for its excellent spring and was situated several miles south of Bethsaida.
