# Mark 6:56 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In his ministry, Jesus traveled to various places - villages, cities, and countryside. Wherever he went, they brought the sick to him, laying them in the streets. People were desperate for healing and sought to touch even the border of his garment, believing that it would bring them restoration. The remarkable thing is that anyone who did touch him was made whole. This shows the extent and effectiveness of Jesus' healing power, and the desperation and faith of the people who sought after it.
