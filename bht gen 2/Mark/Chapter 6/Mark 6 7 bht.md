# Mark 6:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By sending the apostles out in pairs, Jesus ensured that they would have companionship and support during their ministry, as well as serve as witnesses to the truth of His teachings. Additionally, this method allowed for greater efficiency in spreading their message, as they could cover more ground and reach more people by dividing into smaller groups. The pairing of the apostles also exemplifies their interdependence and the importance of mutual aid in their work.
