# Mark 6:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our Lord's instructions to the disciples were clear: take nothing with you for the journey except a staff. They were to rely on the hospitality of others, remaining unencumbered and ready to move at a moment's notice. It was a call to simplicity and trust, as they were not to carry provisions or money with them but depend on the grace and provision of those they encountered. Being unburdened by material possessions would enable them to fully focus on their mission and the work to which they were called.
