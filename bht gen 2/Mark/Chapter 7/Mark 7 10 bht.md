# Mark 7:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The commandments in Exodus 20:12 and Exodus 21:17 serve as reminders to honor and provide for parents, not only in actions and words but also in times of need and old age. Neglecting or disrespecting parents, whether through imprecating harm on them or through any kind of neglect or disregard, breaks these commandments. The importance of these laws is highlighted by the fact that they were often transgressed by the Jews, leading to the need for Jesus to address this issue in the scriptures.
