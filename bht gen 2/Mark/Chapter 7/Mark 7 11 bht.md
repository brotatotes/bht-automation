# Mark 7:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The term Corban used here refers to a gift or offering to God. It was a word employed to avoid providing financial support to one's parents. This practice was endorsed by the religious leaders of the time, who allowed individuals to declare that their resources were devoted to sacred purposes, thereby preventing them from fulfilling their responsibilities towards their parents. By doing so, they prioritized adherence to ritualistic rules over familial obligations. This behavior was seen as a clever tactic to evade caring for family, highlighting the legalistic and hypocritical nature of these religious leaders.
