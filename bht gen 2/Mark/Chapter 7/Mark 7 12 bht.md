# Mark 7:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Some teachings at the time virtually permitted individuals to neglect their parents altogether by prioritizing vows made to God. Even if a person regretted their vow and desired to help their parents, they were bound by the vow and not allowed to assist their parents in any way, regardless of their parents' vulnerability or poverty. This comment from the Lord Himself indicates that while the Pharisees questioned why the people did not financially support their parents, they were actually promoting a practice that hindered filial responsibility. This is a parallel to a similar message conveyed in Matthew 15:6.
