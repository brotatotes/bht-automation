# Mark 7:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Mark 7:13 speaks of the Pharisees making void the word of God by their traditions. They sought to bind people to their own traditions and teachings, even above the commands of God. This is seen in how they considered a vow made according to their traditions to be more binding than the law of God itself. Jesus confronted them, pointing out that their traditions were invalidating the word of God. The Pharisees relied on the authority of their wise men and doctors, and even had other traditions besides the one mentioned, which further undermined the true essence of the written law.
