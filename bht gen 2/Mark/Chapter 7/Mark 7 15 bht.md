# Mark 7:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
According to Mark, it is implied that there is nothing from outside of a person that can defile them. This is in line with Matthew's account where it is emphasized that what truly defiles a person is not what goes into their mouth, but rather the sinful words that come out of it. While certain actions may bring guilt and harm to one's health, the ultimate pollution and defilement stem from the wickedness of the heart.
