# Mark 7:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After Jesus entered into a house, possibly Simon and Andrew's house in Capernaum, he was alone with his disciples. The disciples had questions for Jesus about the parable he had just spoken to the crowd regarding what defiles a person. Specifically, Peter, on behalf of the other disciples, approached Jesus to ask for an interpretation of the parable. The disciples sought clarification on Jesus' statement that nothing entering a person defiles them, but rather it is what comes out of a person that defiles them.
