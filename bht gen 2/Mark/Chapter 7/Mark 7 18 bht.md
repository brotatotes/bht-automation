# Mark 7:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Are you all so unintelligent as to not understand what I explained to the crowd? This was a moment of disappointment for Jesus, as even his own disciples, who had been trained in the legalistic beliefs of Judaism, still struggled to grasp his teachings. They were ingrained with the concept of clean and unclean, and could not comprehend his statement that what enters a person cannot defile them. Jesus charges them with both intellectual dullness and spiritual blindness.
