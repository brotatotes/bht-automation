# Mark 7:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ is highlighting the insignificance of Levitical laws regarding uncleanness, such as eating with unwashed hands, in comparison to moral defilement. He emphasizes that it is not what enters the body that defiles a person, but what comes out of their heart. The physical process of digestion purges all foods, leaving behind pure and nourishing substances. This cleansing action also demonstrates God's provision for purifying the body. Therefore, there should be no concern about external rituals or restrictions when it comes to spiritual purity.
