# Mark 7:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The incident in question highlights the constant and intrusive surveillance that Jesus and his disciples faced. It is mentioned that they ate bread with unwashed, defiled hands, prompting criticism from the Pharisees. This objection was based on ceremonial, not sanitary grounds, as washing hands held deep religious significance for the Jews. The act of washing hands distinguished Jews from Gentiles and was considered a mark of particularity. By disregarding this practice, Jesus and his disciples challenged traditional customs and emphasized the importance of the heart over external rituals. This incident underscores the tension between religious traditions and true spiritual devotion.
