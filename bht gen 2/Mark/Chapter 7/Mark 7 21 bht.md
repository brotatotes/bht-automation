# Mark 7:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The heart of man is the source of both good and evil. It is the inner laboratory where thoughts, both good and evil, are formed. The evil thoughts that arise from the heart are the root cause of various crimes and sins, such as murders, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, and pride. These evil thoughts are not to be taken lightly, as they manifest in actions that harm others and demonstrate the depravity of the human heart. It is important to be aware of the nature of our thoughts and guard against the evil that can originate from within us.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Thoughts, those which are evil."
2. "The word dialogismoi, thoughts, does not in itself convey a bad sense; and hence the addition of adjectives denoting evil."
3. "Radically, it carries the idea of discussion or debate, with an under-thought of suspicion or doubt."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "Murders (φονο, growing out of the others often), wickednesses (πονηρια, from πονος, toil, then drudge, bad like our knave, serving boy like German Knabe, and then criminal), deceit (δολος, lure or snare with bait), lasciviousness (ασελγεια, unrestrained sex instinct), evil eye (οφθαλμος πονηρος) or eye that works evil and that haunts one with its gloating stare."
3. "Pride (υπερηφανια, holding oneself above others, stuck up), foolishness (αφροσυνη, lack of sense), a fitting close to it all."

### John Gill:
1. "The inside of man is very bad, his inward part is not only wicked, but wickedness itself."
2. "Out of the abundance of it, proceed the evil things hereafter mentioned; all its powers and faculties are vitiated, there is no place clean."
3. "What good thing therefore, can come out of such a Nazareth as this? Nothing, but what follows: evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders."
