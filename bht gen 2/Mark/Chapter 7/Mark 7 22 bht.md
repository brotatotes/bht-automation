# Mark 7:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Wickedness encompasses dangerous and destructive actions, as Satan himself is referred to as the wicked one. The evil servant in Matthew represents someone lacking in fidelity and diligence in their service. Moreover, an uplifted heart against God and man reflects the sinfulness of pride. These sins can manifest in various forms, from covetousness and deceit to blasphemy and foolishness. By understanding the depths of these sinful tendencies, we can be aware of the dangers they pose and strive to live a righteous life.
