# Mark 7:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
All evil thoughts, words, and actions originate from within, specifically from the corrupted heart. These impure streams of evil do not come from external influences or the imitation of others, but rather emerge from the depths of one's own being. Such evil not only defiles the person's soul but also affects the entirety of their being, making them partake in sinful behavior like any ordinary sinner.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Gill:
1. "All these evil things come from within,.... All evil thoughts, words, and actions, take their rise from the inward parts of man; from his heart; which is sadly corrupted, and is the fountain from whence all these impure streams flow."
2. "And if these come from within, then not from without; they are not by imitation or are the mere effects of example in others: example may indeed, and often does, draw out the evil that is within; but it does not produce it there; if it was not there before, it could not draw it out from thence."
3. "And defile the man; both soul and body; all the powers and faculties of the soul, and all the members of the body; or 'make a man common': these show him to be one of the common people, a very sinful man; as such were reckoned, and therefore are called emphatically, 'sinners'."
