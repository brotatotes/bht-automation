# Mark 7:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus went away from Galilee and entered a house in the region of Tyre and Sidon, seeking privacy and rest after the strain in Galilee. He desired to avoid notice and withdrew to heathen land, ensuring that nobody would know who He was to prevent the Gentiles from flocking to Him and creating envy and disgust among the Jews. Despite these precautions, Jesus had become so well-known and had performed such remarkable miracles that it was almost impossible for Him to remain unknown in this place.
