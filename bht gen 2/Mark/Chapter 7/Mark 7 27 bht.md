# Mark 7:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The understanding of divine order is reflected in this passage, emphasizing the priority given to the Jewish people in receiving the Gospel. The phrase let the children first be filled conveys the idea that the Jews were to have the initial opportunity to be enriched spiritually through Christ's teachings and miracles. Only after the Jews had their chance would the Gentiles receive the Gospel. This intentional sequence was necessary for the fulfillment of God's plan and purposes. By granting the Jews first access, God allowed them to demonstrate their response before extending the Gospel to the Gentiles.
