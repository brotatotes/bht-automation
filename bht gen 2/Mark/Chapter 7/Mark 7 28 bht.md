# Mark 7:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Canaanite woman in Matthew 15:27 displays remarkable humility and faith. When Jesus remarks that it is not right to give the children's bread to the dogs, she cleverly responds by acknowledging that even the little dogs under the table eat the crumbs. She recognizes that she is unworthy, but her desire for her daughter's healing drives her to seek even the smallest blessing. This interaction highlights her humility and her understanding that even Gentiles like her can receive God's favor without disadvantaging the Jews.
