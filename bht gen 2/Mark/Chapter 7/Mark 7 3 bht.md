# Mark 7:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Pharisees and all Jews were very diligent in observing the tradition of washing hands before eating, even going so far as to wash their hands up to the elbow. This tradition was considered essential among the Jews, with the requirement to wash hands to the joint being strictly followed. However, there were different levels of washing depending on the type of food being consumed. For common food, they would wash their hands, but for more sacred offerings, they would dip their hands. The underlying belief was that if the hands were defiled, it would defile the entire body.
