# Mark 7:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Jesus departed from the coasts of Tyre, He journeyed through the regions of Sidon and crossed the Jordan, approaching the Sea of Galilee from its eastern side. This deliberate detour allowed Him to find solitude and avoid the Pharisees who sought His life. His circuit led Him to the Greek cities of Decapolis, where He encountered great multitudes of people, bringing with them those who were afflicted with various ailments. Witnessing the miraculous healing power of Jesus, the multitude marveled and glorified the God of Israel.
