# Mark 7:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This man, brought before Jesus, reminds us of the spiritual condition of a sinner who is deaf to the words of the law and the Gospel. Just as this man cannot hear the commanding voice of the law, a sinner cannot hear or obey its precepts. They are deaf to the instructions and exhortations of ministers and even loved ones. Through this story, we are reminded of the need for Christ's power to open our ears and hearts to receive His message of salvation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In their eagerness they appear to have been somewhat too officious."
2. "Though usually doing as here suggested, He will deal with this case in His own way."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "One that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech - Not entirely mute, but who spoke indistinctly or with difficulty."
2. "His deafness might not have been of long standing, and his speech, therefore, not entirely ruined."
3. "Blessings were commonly imparted by laying on the hands."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "Had an impediment in his speech [μογιλαλον] . Mogiv, with difficulty; lalov, speaking."
3. "Not absolutely dumb. Compare he spake plain, verse 35."

### John Calvin:
1. "The laying on of hands would of itself have been sufficiently efficacious, and even, without moving a finger, he might have accomplished it by a single act of his will; but it is evident that he made abundant use of outward signs, when they were found to be advantageous."
2. "Thus, by touching the tongue with spittle, he intended to point out that the faculty of speech was communicated by himself alone; and by putting his finger into the ears, he showed that it belonged to his office to pierce the ears of the deaf."
3. "Readers of sobriety and judgment will be satisfied with this single instruction, that we obtain from Christ, in answer to our prayers, both speech and hearing; for he pours his energy into our tongues, and pierces our ears with his fingers."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Had an impediment in his speech.  Lit, ‘hardly speaking.’ It is more probable that he was ‘deaf and dumb’ than a ‘stammerer,’ etc."
2. "Deafness usually causes dumbness. An actual and separate defect in the vocal organs is, however, suggested both by the form here used and the mode of healing."
3. "This man was not possessed, as many thus afflicted were. Possession and such diseases and deformities are to be distinguished; the more so, since Mark is specially apt to tell of our Lord’s power over unclean spirits."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  And they bring unto him  (κα φερουσιν αυτω). Another of Mark's dramatic presents. This incident only in Mark. 

### John Gill:
1. "The case of this man much resembles that of a sinner in a state of nature, who is deaf to the voice, both of law and Gospel."
2. "He does not hearken to the commanding voice of the law, or attend to its precepts, nor can he be subject to it."
3. "He is deaf to all the instructions, directions, cautions, and exhortations, of the ministers of the word; and even of his best friends, relations, and acquaintance."
