# Mark 7:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus took the blind man by the hand and led him aside, it was to focus his attention and direct it towards the source of his healing. Through symbolic actions, Jesus signified the healing power that resides in Him. By moistening the man's tongue with saliva from His own mouth, Jesus indicated that the healing virtue came from Himself. The secretive manner in which Jesus performed these miracles was to avoid excitement and to demonstrate His supreme power and authority. Ultimately, these actions were not done for their natural virtue but to show the divine power of Christ.
