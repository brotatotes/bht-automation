# Mark 7:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, in an act of prayer and acknowledgement of His Father, looked up to heaven. He sighed, showing His compassion for humanity and the damage caused by sin. Using the word ephphatha, which means Be opened, Jesus not only healed the physical ailments of the man but also symbolized the spiritual healing and blessings that come from God above. His power was not dependent on an external source, for Christ had unlimited authority and the ability to perform miracles at any moment. This included even raising the dead, demonstrating His sovereignty and divine power.

2. "These actions of looking up to heaven and sighing, as they may be understood in a spiritual sense, or with relation to the spiritual healing of a sinner, may show that such a blessing comes from above."
