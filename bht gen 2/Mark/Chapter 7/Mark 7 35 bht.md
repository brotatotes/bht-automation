# Mark 7:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The man's hearing was instantly restored when Christ spoke, allowing him to hear as clearly as he did before. Similarly, when individuals experience a spiritual opening of their ears and freedom of speech, they confidently and eloquently speak of their encounters with Christ, His love for them, the wonders of His grace, and their deep faith and hope in Him. Guided by the Spirit, they can openly discuss the transformative work of God in their lives and eagerly anticipate the glorious promise of the future.
