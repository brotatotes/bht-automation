# Mark 7:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The mentioned practices of immersing themselves or washing things bought in the market illustrate the broader usage of the terms 'baptism' and 'baptize' in the Greek language, encompassing not only immersion but also pouring or sprinkling. The dispute about the form of baptism is reminiscent of the rebuke given by our Lord in the subsequent discourse, and it is imperative to consider the distinctive meanings of the words used. It is important to examine the subject in its entirety, as suggested by Lightfoot.
