# Mark 7:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Mark 7:9, Jesus uses irony by saying, Well did Esaias prophesy of you hypocrites, referring to the prophecy of Isaiah 29:13. This prophecy not only described the hypocrites of Isaiah's time but also had relevance to the Jews in later generations during the time of Christ. It highlighted the disconnection between their outward expressions of honor and devotion to God and the true state of their hearts. Despite their outward displays of piety in the synagogues and temples, their worship lacked sincerity and authenticity.

1. Well [Œ∫Œ±ŒªœâœÇ] . Finely, beautifully. Ironical.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Well  (Œ∫Œ±ŒªœâœÇ). Appositely here, but ironical sarcasm in verse Mark 7:9. Note here "you hypocrites" (œÖŒºœâŒΩ œÑœâŒΩ œÖœÄŒøŒ∫œÅŒπœÑœâŒΩ). 

### John Gill:
1. "Well did Esaias prophesy of you hypocrites, for the prophecy of Isaiah not only described the hypocrites of his time, but had respect chiefly to the Jews in succeeding ages, in the times of Christ."
2. "This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me."
3. "They presented their bodies before the Lord in the synagogues, or in the temple, and prayed to him with an air of devotion and fervency, but, alas! this was all lip labour."

### John Wesley:
1. Isaiah 29:13.
