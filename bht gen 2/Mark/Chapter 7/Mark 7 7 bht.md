# Mark 7:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Their worship, though seemingly filled with sanctity and religion, was ultimately empty, lacking in life, power, and spirituality. This worship did not bring glory to God nor did it bring true pleasure or lasting peace to those who engaged in it. Rather, they would discover that their hope of finding favor with God and receiving eternal happiness through their worship would be proven futile and in vain.
