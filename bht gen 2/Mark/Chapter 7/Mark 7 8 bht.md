# Mark 7:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus sharply contrasts the command of God with the traditions of men, exposing the Pharisees' tendency to prioritize human authority over divine authority. The elders, whom the Jews revered, are called men in contrast to God, whose commands they neglected. These religious leaders were more concerned with the oral teaching of the scribes and elders than with the written law of God. The Pharisees' meticulous observance of countless rules about the cleanliness and uncleanness of various objects, as detailed in the Misna, extended even to the vessels used in the sanctuary.
