# Mark 8:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On that occasion, a great multitude had gathered, marking a significant moment in the triumph of Christianity. Their lack of provisions was evident, with nothing to eat in the deserted place. Jesus called his disciples to him, setting the stage for a remarkable miracle. About four thousand men were fed, repeating a nature miracle similar to the feeding of the five thousand. While some may be skeptical of this repetition, it is more reasonable to believe that Jesus performed two such miracles rather than dismissing it as a jumbled account.
