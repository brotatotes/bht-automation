# Mark 8:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After Jesus had dismissed the multitude, he took ship with his disciples, and sailed to a region near Magdala. This village, Dalmanutha, was likely a nearby village from Magdala, where Mary Magdalene resided. Though the exact location of Dalmanutha cannot be pinpointed now, it is believed to have been in Galilee, not far from Tiberias. Mark describes this episode as unique, showing the independence of his narrative from Matthew's. The use of parts and borders interchangeably suggests the same region on the western side of the lake, and the phrase with his disciples is implied in Matthew's account.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Dalmanutha was probably a village in the neighbourhood, a striking instance of the independence of Mark."
2. "Called by the Harmonists 'an addition to St. Matthew's narrative, to show his independent knowledge of the fact.'"
3. "What very anomalous writers the Evangelists must have been!"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Magdala and Dalmanutha were both on the western shore of the lake."
2. "From the former the surname 'Magdalene' was probably taken, to denote the residence of Mary Magdalene."
3. "Dalmanutha may have been a village, but it cannot now be identified with certainty."

### Albert Barnes:
1. Dalmanutha - In Matthew 15:39 it is said that he came into the coasts of “Magdala.” See the note on the place.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. With his disciples. Peculiar to Mark.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The two were probably near each other, north of Tiberias, and our Lord seems to have landed at some retired point between them."
2. "The theory that they were on the south-eastern shore of the lake is altogether unsupported, and makes of these journeys of our Lord an aimless wandering."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Both names are unknown elsewhere, but apparently the same region of Galilee on the western side of the lake not far from Tiberias."
2. "Mark here uses 'parts' (μερη) in the same sense as 'borders' (ορια) in Mark 7:24 just as Matthew reverses it with 'parts' in Matthew 15:21 and 'borders' here in Matthew 15:39."
3. "Mark has here 'with his disciples' (μετα των μαθητων αυτου) only implied in Matthew 15:39."

### John Gill:
1. "As soon as ever he had, dismissed the multitude, he took shipping with his disciples."
2. "Matthew calls, 'the coasts of Magdala.'"
3. "It was a city in the coasts of Magdala, and is thought by Dr. Lightfoot to be the same with Tzalmon, or Salmon, a place often mentioned in the Jewish writings."
