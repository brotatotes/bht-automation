# Mark 8:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, after encountering the stubbornness and unbelief of the Pharisees and Sadducees, chose to depart from them, leaving behind a generation of people who were perverse and hardened in their ways. He then got into the ship, which was waiting for him, and departed to the other side, specifically towards Bethsaida on the sea of Galilee. This action of Jesus was not only a physical departure, but also a symbolic separation from the negative influence of those who opposed him.
