# Mark 8:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples, unexpressed as the subject, had forgotten to take more than one loaf, as mentioned only in Mark. This detail is significant because there were thirteen hungry men on the ship, implying that one loaf would not have been sufficient. Furthermore, it is important to note that the conversation may not have necessarily taken place in the boat itself. Hence, when they landed, they found themselves without provisions for their land journey, as they had overlooked bringing any bread with them on the ship.
