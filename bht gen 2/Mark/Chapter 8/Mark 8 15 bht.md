# Mark 8:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of Herod, as well as the Sadducees, which represent two opposite extremes. Their teachings, characterized by traditions, denial of resurrection, and political beliefs, posed a danger to true faith. Jesus warns against their hardened hearts, lack of perception, and failure to understand spiritual truths, similar to what was described in Matthew 13. These cautionary words indicate the present lack of spiritual understanding rather than an eternal condition.
