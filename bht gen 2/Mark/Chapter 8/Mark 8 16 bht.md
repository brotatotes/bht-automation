# Mark 8:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples' failure to grasp the spiritual significance of Jesus' actions and teachings is evident in the rapid succession of questions he posed to them. His disappointment is reflected in their low thoughts of him. Additionally, the disciples, who were accustomed to Jesus taking care of their physical needs, felt undeserving of his trust when they found themselves with only one loaf of bread. This caused them to assume that he was reproaching them for their lack of foresight. These glimpses into the disciples' mindset offer profound insights into the profound lessons that can be drawn from this passage.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "It will be seen... that He ever left the whole care for His own temporal wants to the Twelve: that He did this so entirely, that finding they were reduced to their last loaf they felt as if unworthy of such a trust, and could not think but that the same thought was in their Lord's mind which was pressing upon their own."
3. "Who that, like angels, 'desire to look into these things' will not prize such glimpses above gold?"
