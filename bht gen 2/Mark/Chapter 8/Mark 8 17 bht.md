# Mark 8:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples were questioned about their hardened hearts, which may seem surprising for true-hearted followers. It is a reminder of their previous lack of understanding and perception, even after witnessing Jesus' miracles and provision of food with minimal resources. It was expected that their faith and understanding would have grown, but their doubts and unbelief remained. This serves as a lesson for us to continually seek a deeper understanding of God's teachings and to guard against hardening our hearts.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 17. have ye your heart yet
	hardened?—How strong an expression to use of true-hearted
	disciples! See on Mark 6:52.

### John Gill:
1. "Perceive ye not yet, neither understand? the meaning of the parabolical expressions, which he had used them to; or his power in providing food for them, and supporting a great number of persons with very little food..."
2. "Have ye your heart yet hardened? as after the first miracle..."
3. "...it might have been expected, that by a second miracle of the loaves, their understandings would have been more enlightened, and their faith increased, and that they would have relinquished their gross notions, their anxieties, doubts, and unbelief."
