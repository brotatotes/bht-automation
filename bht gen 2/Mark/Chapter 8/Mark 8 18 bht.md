# Mark 8:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Despite having physical eyes to witness the miracles of Jesus and spiritual enlightenment to understand them, the people failed to truly see and comprehend His teachings. Their understanding was clouded, causing them to overlook the divine significance of the events unfolding before them. Even though they were given spiritual ears to hear, they remained slow in their comprehension and remembrance of these profound truths.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 18. Having eyes, see ye not? and
	having ears, hear ye not?—See on  :-. 
	and do ye not remember?

### John Gill:
1. "Having eyes, see ye not?.... Meaning perhaps both the eyes of their bodies, and of their understandings: they had bodily eyes, and with them saw the miracles he wrought, and yet took little notice of them." 
2. "The eyes of their understandings were enlightened by Christ, and yet saw things but very darkly."
3. "And though they had spiritual ears given them to hear, yet were very dull of understanding, and taking in things."
