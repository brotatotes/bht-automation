# Mark 8:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During the miraculous feeding of the five thousand, Jesus asked His disciples how many baskets of fragments they had gathered. This question served to jog their memories and remind them of the abundant provision that came from just five loaves of bread and two fish. The disciples were able to recall that they had collected a number of baskets filled with fragments, exceeding the original amount of food. This emphasizes the magnitude of the miracle and the fact that the multitude was fed with more than double the number of loaves that were initially present.
