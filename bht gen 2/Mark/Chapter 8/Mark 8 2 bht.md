# Mark 8:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For three days now, the multitude has been without food, showing their deep need and the urgency of the situation. Yet, in this desperate moment, the compassionate heart of Christ is stirred. His bowels yearn with a deep and tender affection for each person present. His compassion is not limited to physical needs, but encompasses their souls as well. In their close attachment to Christ, the people demonstrate their fervent zeal and great affection. This outpouring of compassion from the Savior assures us that He will provide for both their physical and spiritual well-being.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Now three days  (Œ∑Œ¥Œ∑ Œ∑ŒºŒµœÅŒ± œÑœÅŒµŒπœÇ). This text preserves a curious parenthetic nominative of time (Robertson, Grammar, p. 460). See on Matthew 15:32.
