# Mark 8:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This man, who was blind, symbolizes those who are spiritually blind. Just as he had no natural sight until Christ touched him, those in a state of nature are completely in darkness until the Lord brings them light. They have no awareness of their sinful and lost condition, remaining blind to their wretched and poor state. This incident, where Christ restores sight to the blind man, is only recorded in the book of Mark, highlighting the unique significance of this moment.
