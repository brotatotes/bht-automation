# Mark 8:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, in His humility, led the blind man out of the town by hand, seeking to avoid any appearance of evil or ostentation. His use of saliva and touch were not the source of power, but rather served as symbolic gestures, representing the means of spiritual conversion and enlightenment. Through this miracle, Jesus demonstrated His authority and the transformative power of the Gospel. By withholding further miracles from the people of Bethsaida and instructing the man not to share his healing, Jesus expressed His displeasure towards their unbelief and obstinacy.
