# Mark 8:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As the man's sight gradually returned, he could perceive the figures of men, yet they appeared to him as trees walking. It was not until later that he could clearly discern the distinction between humans and trees. This gradual process of restoration serves as a reminder that the work of Christ in our lives often unfolds in stages, gradually opening our eyes to the truth and deepening our understanding of His grace.
