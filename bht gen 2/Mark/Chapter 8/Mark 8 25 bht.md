# Mark 8:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The man mentioned in this passage serves as a symbol for someone who experiences spiritual enlightenment through God's grace. Initially, this enlightenment is faint, with only a limited understanding of Christ's glory and righteousness. However, as believers grow, their understanding becomes clearer and more distinct, illuminating the true nature of Christ and deepening their knowledge. This process mirrors the current experience of believers, who, though they may have increasing insights and speak about them with clarity, still have limited understanding compared to the future beatific vision, in which they will see face to face and fully know.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He saw clearly (the work of that instant), and was thoroughly restored."
2. "(Thence-forward) saw all things plainly."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is the only recorded example of a progressive cure, and it certainly illustrates similar methods in the spiritual kingdom."
2. "Of the four recorded cases of sight restored, all the patients save one either came or were brought to the Physician."
3. "In the case of the man born blind, the Physician came to the patient. So some seek and find Christ; of others He is found who seek Him not."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Though our Lord did not by this, probably, 'intend' to teach any lesson in regard to the way in which the mind of a sinner is enlightened, yet it affords a striking illustration of it."
2. "The effect of religion, or of the influence of the Holy Spirit, is to open the eyes, to show the sinner his condition and his danger, and to lead him to 'look' on him as a Saviour."
3. "Yet at first he sees indistinctly. He does not soon learn to distinguish objects... It is only by repeated applications to the Source of light that he sees all things clearly."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Instead of vaguely staring, he fixed his eyes on definite objects." 
2. "He saw and continued to see. Compare the aorist tense above : He looked stedfastly, fastened his eyes, denoting the single act, the first exercise of his restored sight." 
3. "The farthest things were clearly seen."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He saw clearly (the work of that instant), and was (thoroughly) restored; and he (thenceforward) saw all things plainly."
2. "The gradual cure would remove the notion of magical influence."
3. "The work of grace, though always wrought by Christ, is often a gradual process, in which other agencies are apparently involved; a protest against the notions, which look for magical power in sacramental forms, or insist upon sudden illumination and joy as a necessary accompaniment of conversion."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He looked steadfastly...and kept on seeing all things clearly or at a distance."
2. "He saw thoroughly now...he was completely restored...and kept on seeing."
3. "Some manuscripts read δηλαυγως, from δηλος, plain, and αυγη, radiance."

### John Gill:
1. "This man, as before observed, was a very lively emblem of one that is spiritually enlightened by the grace of God."
2. "As at first conversion, the enlightened soul has but a very glimmering view of things, particularly of Christ, the glory and fulness of his person, the efficacy of his blood, the excellency of his righteousness... But as this man afterwards had a more clear, and distinct view of objects; so it is with true believers in Christ; their shining light increases, and shines more and more unto the perfect day."
3. "Indeed, they that know most see things most clearly and speak of them most distinctly know but in part and prophesy but in part in comparison of the beatific vision; when saints shall see face to face and know, as they are known; they now see but through a glass darkly."
