# Mark 8:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter's confession goes beyond the expectations of the people, as he declares Jesus not just the forerunner, but the Messiah himself. In asking the disciples for their understanding, Jesus affirms the truth in Peter's response, which distinguishes it from other faulty opinions. As a result of this confession, Peter is blessed and recognized for his knowledge, which is attributed not to human understanding, but to divine revelation from the Father.
