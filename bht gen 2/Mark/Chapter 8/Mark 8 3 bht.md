# Mark 8:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Some of the people who had gathered around Jesus had come from faraway places. They had followed him eagerly, not considering the need for provisions during their journey. Jesus, however, was aware of their situation and did not want to send them away hungry, as he knew that without food, their strength would be depleted and they would not be able to complete their journey. This concern for their well-being showed Jesus' compassion and care for his followers.
