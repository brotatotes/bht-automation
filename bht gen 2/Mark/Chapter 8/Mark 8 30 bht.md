# Mark 8:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus asked his disciples not to reveal his true identity, it was because he did not want to be prematurely hailed as a temporal king or provoke the scribes and Pharisees to destroy him before the appointed time. Instead, he desired to withhold the evidence of his Divine character until it could be fully manifest after his resurrection, as he had just declared his approval of Peter's confession and his intention to build his church on that rock.
