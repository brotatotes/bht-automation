# Mark 8:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus began to teach his disciples about the forthcoming sufferings, rejection, and death that he would face at the hands of the elders, chief priests, and scribes. He emphasized that these events were not metaphorical, but a reality that would occur in a violent manner. Jesus further clarified that his resurrection would take place after three days, specifically on the third day. It is important to note that after three days does not mean on the fourth day, but on the third day itself.
