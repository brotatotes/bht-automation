# Mark 8:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus said, He spake the saying openly, he wasn't just hinting or speaking in riddles. He spoke it clearly and directly, with no ambiguity or concealment. It wasn't a secret or a mystery, but rather an explicit statement. This openness may have caught Peter's attention, leading him to grasp Jesus, perhaps by the arms or clothes, in a moment of concern or confusion. Jesus' straightforward communication left no room for misunderstanding or misinterpretation.
