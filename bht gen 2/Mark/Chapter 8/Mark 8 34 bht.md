# Mark 8:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If anyone desires to follow Jesus, they must not only believe in him, but they must also deny their own desires and embrace the will of God, even if it means enduring pain and suffering on a daily basis. It requires a complete surrender of self and a willingness to accept the crosses that come with discipleship. Following Jesus is not about seeking worldly advantages, but about living a holy life that leads to eternal glory.
