# Mark 8:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Whoever denies Christ and the Gospel in order to save their life or gain worldly riches may seem to benefit in the short term, but in the end, it will be of no avail. The enjoyment of the world is only temporary and comes with its own troubles and burdens. Meanwhile, the soul is eternal, and if it is lost and damned, the torment will last forever. Its suffering will be unending, with its fire never being quenched and its worm never dying.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. Gain - lose. See on Matthew 16:26.

### John Gill:
1. "In the long run, in the issue of things, who by denying Christ, and his Gospel, may not only save his life for the present, but procure for himself great riches and wealth."
2. "Supposing he had his desire, of what avail would this be in the upshot of things, should the following be his case, as it will, and lose his own soul?"
3. "The world can only be enjoyed for a season, and that with a great deal of fatigue and trouble; but the soul continues forever; and if it is lost and damned, its torment always abides, and the smoke of it ascends for forever, its worm never dies, and its fire is never quenched."
