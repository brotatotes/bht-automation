# Mark 8:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
What can compare to the value of a person's life? The words in brackets may be omitted, emphasizing that nothing in this world can serve as an equivalent or ransom for it. Riches may hold no profit in the day of wrath and cannot deliver one's soul from damnation. Even if one possessed the entire world, it would be futile in trying to redeem the soul. It is clear that the value of a life surpasses any worldly possession, and once lost, it is beyond recovery.
