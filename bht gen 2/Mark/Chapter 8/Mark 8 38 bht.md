# Mark 8:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who are ashamed of Christ and choose to reject His teachings will find themselves disowned by Him. It is not sufficient to merely have a general confession of faith; we must openly and boldly profess our faith in Christ and His words. This includes embracing the call to self-denial and carrying our cross daily. To be ashamed of Christ is to withhold our full confession and deny His authority and truth.
