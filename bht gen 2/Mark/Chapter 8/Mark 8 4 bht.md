# Mark 8:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples, seemingly forgetting the previous miracle of feeding five thousand with only a few provisions, now find themselves in a similar situation but with even less food. They question how it is possible to satisfy such a large number of hungry men in a deserted place, not fully realizing the unlimited power of Jesus. Their faith is wavering, and they fail to comprehend that Jesus can work miracles beyond their human understanding.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "From whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness?"—Though the question here is the same as when He fed the five thousand, they evidently now meant no more by it than that they had not the means of feeding the multitude; modestly leaving the Lord to decide what was to be done.
2. "And this will the more appear from His not now trying them, as before, by saying, 'They need not depart, give ye them to eat'; but simply asking what they had, and then giving His directions."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The disciples feel as helpless as when the five thousand were fed."
2. "They do not rise to faith in the unlimited power of Jesus after all that they have seen."

### John Gill:
1. "Forgetting the late miracle of feeding five thousand with five loaves and two fishes..." 
2. "...they had now a less number, and more provisions."
3. "From what place, and by what ways and means can it be thought, that such a quantity of bread can be got at any rate in a desert, as to satisfy so large a number of hungry men?"
