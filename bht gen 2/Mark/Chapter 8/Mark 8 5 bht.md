# Mark 8:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we see the significance of the specific number of loaves being highlighted. The disciples were asked how many loaves they had, and they responded with seven. This detail is important because it sets the stage for the subsequent miracle. Additionally, Matthew adds that there were also a few little fishes, indicating the abundance of food available for the miracle to be performed. The precise number of loaves and the mention of the fishes serve to emphasize the uniqueness and individuality of this particular miracle.
