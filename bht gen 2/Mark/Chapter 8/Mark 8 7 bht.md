# Mark 8:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
According to the accounts, it seems that in this particular instance, the few small fishes were blessed and distributed separately after the bread had been blessed, broken, and distributed. This order is different from what is mentioned in Mark, where the fishes are mentioned last as if they were served after the food. However, Matthew's account suggests that the fishes were blessed, broken, and distributed together with the bread. It is reasonable to assume that both the bread and fishes were eaten together during this miraculous feeding.
