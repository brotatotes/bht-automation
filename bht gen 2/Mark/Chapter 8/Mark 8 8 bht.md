# Mark 8:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The miracle of the multiplication of loaves and fishes is astonishing in its abundance and sustenance. It shows that Jesus is the true bread from heaven, providing not only physical satisfaction but also spiritual nourishment. With only a few loaves and fishes, everyone was not only given a portion, but they had more than enough to be fully satisfied. The leftovers alone filled seven baskets, a testament to Christ's power and provision. This miracle serves as a reminder of our constant need for the heavenly bread, prompting us to pray for it to be given to us continually.
