# Mark 8:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, it is clear that the feeding of the five thousand and the feeding of the four thousand are distinct miracles, as our Lord himself refers to them separately. Despite this, some critics mistakenly attempt to identify these two miracles as one and the same. However, the details given in the Scriptures, such as the mention of additional baskets and the absence of certain details in different Gospel accounts, support the idea that these were indeed separate events. Notably, while feeding the four thousand, Jesus also performed remarkable healings, demonstrating his immense power and compassion.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Had not our Lord distinctly referred, in this very chapter and in two successive sentences, to the feeding of the five thousand and of the four thousand as two distinct miracles, many critics would have insisted that they were but two different representations of one and the same miracle..."
2. "But even in spite of what our Lord says, it is painful to find such men as NEANDER endeavoring to identify the two miracles."
3. "In view of these things, who could have believed that these were one and the same miracle, even if the Lord Himself had not expressly distinguished them?"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Baskets. See on Matthew 14:20. Four thousand. Matthew (xv. 38) here adds a detail which we should rather expect in Mark : beside women and children.

### Philip Schaff:
1. Mark 8:9. Mark again omits â€˜besides women and children.â€™
	

### John Gill:
1. "And they that had eaten were about four thousand"
2. "he sent them away; some...dumb, with their speech, and deaf, with their hearing; others...maimed, with perfect healing of their wounds, and with their limbs sound and whole...lame, he dismissed leaping; and others...blind, with their sight restored to them, and all of them full."
