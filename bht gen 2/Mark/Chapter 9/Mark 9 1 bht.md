# Mark 9:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the kingdom of God is revealed in its fullness, accompanied by the empowering work of the Holy Spirit, the Gospel spreads among both Jews and Gentiles, leading to the conversion of countless souls through the grace of God. This declaration of Jesus as Lord and Christ not only brings about the expansion of the kingdom, but also signifies the eventual destruction of the Jewish nation. Furthermore, it is worth noting that this profound moment occurs in a location, Cesarea Philippi, that is distinct from the expected Galilee or Judea, adding to its remarkable nature.
