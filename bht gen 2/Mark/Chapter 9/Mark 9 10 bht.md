# Mark 9:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples kept the saying to themselves, as Jesus had instructed, pondering its meaning and struggling to understand the enigmatic connection between His death and resurrection. This specific saying about the resurrection was a secret they held, continuing to question and discuss amongst themselves what it could possibly signify. It wasn't until later that they realized Jesus had been alluding to His rising from the dead, a concept that initially eluded their comprehension.
