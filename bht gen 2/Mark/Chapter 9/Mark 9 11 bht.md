# Mark 9:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Before the Messiah comes or before the setting up of his kingdom in greater glory, the Scribes and Pharisees ask, Why say that Elias must first come? This question arises from being reminded of Elias on the mount or from what Christ had previously said about his resurrection. They seek to understand why there is a belief that Elias must come before the fulfillment of these events.
