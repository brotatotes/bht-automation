# Mark 9:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus responds to his disciples' question concerning the coming of Elijah by pointing out the consistency between Elijah's coming and his own suffering. He emphasizes that while Elijah has come and fulfilled his role, Jesus will still face his own suffering and death. In doing so, Jesus not only addresses their question about Elijah's coming but also corrects their misunderstanding that he, as the Messiah, would reign indefinitely.

### Henry Alford:
1. "Our Lord answers it by telling them that it is even so; and returns the question by another: And how is it (also) written of the Son of Man, that He, &c.?"
2. "Just as the first coming of the Son of Man is to suffer and to die, so has the first coming of Elias been as it was written of him; but there is a future coming of Elias ἀποκαθιστάνειν πάντα, and of the Son of Man in glory."
3. "The first καί in Mar 9:13 is also, binding what is said of Elias to that which has been said of the Son of Man: the second καί is simply and."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Most later scholars take the first half only as a question: And how is it written of the Son of man? then the answer: That he should suffer, etc." 
2. "Others take the whole as one question."
3. "The next verse shows that the main point is not so much to prove that the Son of man must soon suffer, as that the predicted Elijah had come, and, like the Old Testament. Elijah, had suffered as the Messiah also would, hence that this Elijah was John the Baptist (Matthew 17:13)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
