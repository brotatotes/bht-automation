# Mark 9:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The coming of Elias, fulfilled by John the Baptist, was not directly prophesied to include suffering. However, it can be inferred that the forerunner of the Messiah, referred to as Elias, would experience hardship, as the prophet Elijah did. This understanding was shared by the disciples, as evidenced in Matthew 17:13. The sufferings endured by John were evident through the rejection of his ministry and message, which resulted in remaining impenitent and unbelieving. The prophecies regarding his coming, including the one in Malachi 4:5, were ultimately fulfilled, solidifying John's significant role preceding the arrival of the Messiah.
