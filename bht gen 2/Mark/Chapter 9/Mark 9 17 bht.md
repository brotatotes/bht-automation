# Mark 9:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The man approached Jesus and explained the situation with his son, who had a dumb spirit, causing him to be speechless. The scribes, who had been debating with Jesus' disciples, did not respond to Jesus' question. It was clear that the boy's condition was not simply a natural illness, but rather a diabolical possession.
