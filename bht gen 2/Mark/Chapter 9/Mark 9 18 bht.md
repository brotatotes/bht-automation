# Mark 9:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The child is seized with violent, convulsive fits, causing him to be tormented and tortured. He foams at the mouth and gnashes his teeth, showing the intense pain he is experiencing. As a result, his body wastes away, becoming withered and dried up. This tragic situation led the father to seek help from Jesus, explaining that he had previously asked the disciples to cast out the spirit, but they were unable to do so.
