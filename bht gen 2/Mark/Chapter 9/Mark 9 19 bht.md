# Mark 9:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The quote, Bring him unto me, highlights the disciples' failure and unbelief that led to their inability to help the man. They were part of the faithless generation that Jesus addresses with frustration, questioning how much longer he had to be with them. This rebuke is not strictly directed at the disciples alone, but at the multitude representing the unbelieving generation. Nevertheless, amidst their profound unbelief, Jesus remains the one to whom we can always come for help.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The question is not asked in a spirit of longing to be gone from them, but of holy impatience of their hardness of heart and unbelief."
2. "The additional words καὶ διεστραμμένη (Matt. Luke) are probably from Deuteronomy 32:5."
3. "The race and generation among whom the Lord’s ministry was fulfilled."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is to us surprising that some interpreters, as CHRYSOSTOM and CALVIN, should represent this rebuke as addressed, not to the disciples at all, but to the scribes who disputed with them."
2. "With BENGEL, DE WETTE, and MEYER, we regard it as addressed directly to the nine apostles who were unable to expel this evil spirit."
3. "And though, in ascribing this inability to their 'want of faith' and the 'perverted turn of mind' which they had drunk in with their early training, the rebuke would undoubtedly apply, with vastly greater force, to those who twitted the poor disciples with their inability, it would be to change the whole nature of the rebuke to suppose it addressed to those who had no faith at all, and were wholly perverted."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Faithless has acquired the sense of treacherous, not keeping faith."
2. "But Christ means without faith, and such is Tyndale's translation."
3. "Unbelieving would be better here."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Not to the man alone (as the incorrect reading implies), though he was included, but to the multitude, whom our Lord addresses as representing that faithless, or, ‘unbelieving,’ generation."
2. "How long, etc.? This indicates ‘holy impatience of their hardness of heart and unbelief. In this the father, disciples, scribes, and multitude are equally involved’ (Alford)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Bring him unto me (φερετε αυτον προς με). The disciples had failed and their unbelief had led to this fiasco."
2. "Even the disciples were like and part of the faithless (απιστος, unbelieving) generation in which they lived."
3. "We can always come to Jesus when others fail us."

### John Gill:
1. "O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you?" 
2. "Bring him unto me."
