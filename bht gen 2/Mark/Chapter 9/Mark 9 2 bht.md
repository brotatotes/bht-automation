# Mark 9:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus chose Peter, James, and John, his favoured and trusted disciples, to be witnesses of his transfiguration, taking them apart from the multitude. He was transfigured before them, revealing his divine nature in a glorious change from the form of God to the form of a servant. This event occurred on a mountain--though not necessarily Mount Tabor--as a significant manifestation of his divine power and glory.
