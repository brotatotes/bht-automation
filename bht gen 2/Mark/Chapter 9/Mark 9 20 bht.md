# Mark 9:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the child caught sight of Christ, knowing that deliverance was imminent, the demon within him made a final desperate attempt to harm him. It is often the case that before Satan is driven out of a person who has long been under his control, he puts up a fierce fight.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The kingdom of Satan, in small and great, is ever stirred into a fiercer activity by the coming near of the kingdom of Christ. Satan has great wrath, when his time is short." (Trench, Mir. 365.)
2. "Mar 9:21-27 are peculiar to Mark."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Just as the man with the legion of demons, 'when he saw Jesus, ran and worshipped Him,' so this demon, when he saw Him, immediately 'tare him.' The feeling of terror and rage was the same in both cases."
2. "Still Jesus does nothing, but keeps conversing with the father about the case—partly to have its desperate features told out by him who knew them best, in the hearing of the spectators; partly to let its virulence have time to show itself; and partly to deepen the exercise of the father's soul, to draw out his faith, and thus to prepare both him and the bystanders for what He was to do."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Mark is more specific in his detail of the convulsion which seized the lad as he was coming to Jesus."
2. "He notes the convulsion as coming on at the demoniac's sight of our Lord. 'When he saw him, straightway the spirit,' etc."
3. "Also his falling on the ground, wallowing and foaming. We might expect the detail of these symptoms in Luke, the physician."

### John Calvin:
1. "That the devil should rage with more than ordinary cruelty against the man, when he is brought to Christ, ought not to excite surprise; for in proportion as the grace of Christ is seen to be nearer at hand, and acts more powerfully, the fury of Satan is the more highly excited." 
2. "We ought to be prepared beforehand with such meditations, that our faith may not be disturbed, when the approach of the grace of Christ is met by more than ordinary violence on the part of our enemy." 
3. "It must also be taken into account that, by means of the furious attack of Satan, our Lord lights a torch to cause his grace to be seen; for, when the spectators were appalled at the dreadful spectacle, the display of the power of Christ, which immediately followed, was more distinctly perceived."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The kingdom of Satan, in small and great, is ever stirred into a fiercer activity by the coming near of the kingdom of Christ Satan has great wrath, when his time is short" (Trench).
2. "When the lad saw Jesus, the spirit convulsed him. But the original gives a stronger hint of the intimate connection between the demon and the possessed person" (Trench).

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Tare him grievously" (συνεσπαραξεν αυτον).
2. "This compound with συν- (together with), strengthens the force of the verb."
3. "Wallowed" (εκυλιετο). Imperfect passive, was rolled."

### John Gill:
1. "Knowing his time was short, and being filled with indignation and rage, that he should be obliged, as he knew he must, to leave the child very speedily..."
2. "Thrown into a violent fit, shook him, and convulsed him in a dreadful manner..."
3. "Rolled about from side to side, foaming at the mouth, and in the most exquisite rack and torture."

### John Wesley:
1. "When he saw him — When the child saw Christ; when his deliverance was at hand."
2. "Immediately the spirit tore him — Made his last grand effort to destroy him."
3. "Is it not generally so, before Satan is cast out of a soul, of which he has long had possession?"
