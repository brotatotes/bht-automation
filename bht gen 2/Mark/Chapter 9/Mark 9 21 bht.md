The father is questioned by the Lord to test his faith amidst the trial. The severity and persistence of the illness is revealed to highlight the remarkable nature of the eventual cure and display the power and goodness of Jesus. The affliction is not a result of personal sin, as it would contradict God's justice and mercy. It serves as a test of obedience and a reminder of the effects of original sin, which is the root of all afflictions and judgments.
