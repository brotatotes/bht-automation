# Mark 9:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The power of Jesus to heal and perform miracles is not in question here. Instead, it is the faith of the one seeking the miracle that is being tested. The emphasis is on the individual's belief and trust in Jesus' ability to bring about the desired outcome. Jesus challenges the person to examine their own faith and believe in his power.
