## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The poor father is drawn out into a sense of the unworthiness of his distrust, and 'the little spark of faith which is kindled in his soul reveals to him the abysmal deeps of unbelief which are there.'"
2. "Thus does the Redeemer show himself to the father as a μαιευτὴς πίστεως first, before He heals his son. In the struggle of his anxiety, the strength of Faith is born, by the aid of Christ, in the soul empty of it before."
3. "There is strong analogy in the Lord's treatment of the father here, for the sponsorial engagement in infant baptism. The child is by its infirmity incapacitated; it is therefore the father's faith which is tested, and when that is proved, the child is healed."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is useless concealing from Thee, O Thou mysterious, mighty Healer, the unbelief that still struggles in this heart of mine; but that heart bears me witness that I do believe in Thee; and if distrust still remains, I disown it, I wrestle with it, I seek help from Thee against it."
2. "The felt and owned presence of unbelief, which only the strength of the man's faith could have so revealed to his own consciousness."
3. "His appeal to Christ for help against his felt unbelief—a feature in the case quite unparalleled, and showing, more than all protestations could have done, the insight he had attained into the existence of a power in Christ more glorious than any he had besought for his poor child."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Cried out and said [κραξαςελεγεν] . The former denoting the inarticulate cry, the ejaculation, followed by the words, "Lord, I believe," etc.

### John Calvin:
1. "There is none of us that does not experience both belief and unbelief in himself."
2. "It is our duty to carefully shake off the remains of infidelity, strive against them, and pray to God to correct them."
3. "If we duly inquire what portion has been bestowed on each, it will evidently appear that there are very few who are eminent in faith, few who have a moderate portion, and very many who have but a small measure."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The full form; ‘the father of the child,’ not only implies that the son was a child in years, but suggests the spiritual connection between ‘father ‘and ‘child ‘in this matter, and the effect of the faith of the former upon the cure of the latter."
2. "When the father’s faith had been sufficiently tested, the helpless child was healed."
3. "I believe, help thou mine unbelief, i.e., want of faith. The man’s faith is further awakened by the challenge of our Lord; but this increase of faith only shows him how great his doubt is; and he at once adds to his confession of belief a new prayer for help, help for himself, that thus help might come to his only son."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Cried out (κραξας). Loud outcry and at once (ευθυς). The later manuscripts have 'with tears' (μετα δακρυων), not in the older documents."
2. "I believe; help my unbelief (Πιστευω: βοηθε τη απιστια). An exact description of his mental and spiritual state. He still had faith, but craved more."
3. "The word comes from βοη, a cry and θεω, to run, to run at a cry for help, a vivid picture of this father's plight."

### John Gill:
1. "Lord, I believe, help thou mine unbelief; not forward, but out of the way: he found in himself some small degree of faith in the power of Christ, but it was mixed with much unbelief, through the greatness of the child's disorder; and therefore desires it might be removed from him, and he might be helped against it."
2. "He saw it was not in his own power to believe; nor had he strength of himself to oppose his unbelief; but that both faith must be given him, and power against unbelief."
3. "He found his faith very weak, he desires it might be strengthened, that he might be strong in faith, and give glory to God; and in this way belief is helped, or men helped against it."

### John Wesley:
1. Help thou mine unbelief — Although my faith be so small, that it might rather be termed unbelief, yet help me.
