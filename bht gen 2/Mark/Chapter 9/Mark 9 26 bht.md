# Mark 9:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The demon, filled with rage and fury, cried out in agony as he was forced to leave the person he had possessed for so long. The child, lying motionless and lifeless, appeared dead to many onlookers, who believed there was no hope for him to ever regain consciousness. It is remarkable how the physical body can suffer when God intervenes to free the soul from the clutches of the enemy.
