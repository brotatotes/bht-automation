# Mark 9:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples' failure in casting out the evil spirit was a result of their lack of prayer and fasting. The power to confront such a malignant spirit required a deeper level of spiritual discipline and self-denial. Not only did their unbelief hinder their ability to drive out the spirit, but their self-complacency also contributed to their defeat. It was through prayer and fasting that they could cultivate the moral power necessary to conquer such forces. This incident served as an admonition for the disciples to rely on prayer and fasting as they faced spiritual challenges in the future.
