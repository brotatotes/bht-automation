The raiment of Jesus became shining, glistening with each separate portion reflecting His glory. It was white as snow, so bright that no fuller on earth could make it any whiter. The dazzling brightness of His clothes surpassed any human efforts of splendor. It was a glimpse of His future glory as the Son of man, and reminded us of how Moses' face shone with glory after being in the presence of God.
