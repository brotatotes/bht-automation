# Mark 9:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus spoke to his disciples, urging them to pay close attention to his words. He emphasized that he would soon be delivered into the hands of men, as it had been determined and agreed upon. This delivery would result in his violent death, in a manner that went against all laws and justice. However, amidst the sadness, Jesus also brought forth hope by mentioning his resurrection on the third day. This assurance of his resurrection served as comfort to his disciples, reminding them that even in the face of death, Jesus would triumph over it.
