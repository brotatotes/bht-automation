# Mark 9:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples were deeply shaken by the shocking announcements that shattered their cherished beliefs. Filled with uncertainty, they were hesitant to seek clarification, fearing the rebuke that had been directed at Peter before. Their lack of understanding stemmed partly from their own preconceived ideas and biases. They struggled to comprehend how the death and resurrection of such a holy and innocent man could align with their expectations of the Messiah establishing an earthly kingdom. Their confusion and trepidation were driven by their limited understanding of how these puzzling events could be reconciled with Jesus' divine nature.

3. "Strife among the Twelve, with Relative Teaching."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They were agnostics on the subject of the death and resurrection even after the Transfiguration experience."

2. "They could not understand how this could consist with his character, as the Son of God, the Messiah, and king of Israel; and with the notions they had of the Messiah's abiding forever, and setting up a temporal kingdom on earth."
3. "They were afraid to ask him; lest they should be upbraided with their ignorance and stupidity."

### John Wesley:
