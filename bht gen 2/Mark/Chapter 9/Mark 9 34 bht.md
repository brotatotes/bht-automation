# Mark 9:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In their desire for worldly grandeur and recognition, the disciples hesitated to answer Jesus' question about who should be the greatest in his kingdom. Their silence revealed their fear of reprimand for their vanity and pretentiousness. Deep down, they struggled to reconcile their former principles with the concept of Jesus' impending death, giving them a reason to remain ignorant rather than relinquish their beloved notions of power and superiority. This dispute over precedence arose from Christ's previous teachings and their subsequent private discussions, ultimately fueling a heated contest for the esteemed position of prime minister in his kingdom.
