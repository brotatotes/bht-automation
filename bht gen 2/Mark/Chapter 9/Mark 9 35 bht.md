# Mark 9:35 Commentary Help Text

If anyone desires to be the first, they should be prepared to take the last and lowest place. The only way to achieve greatness in the kingdom of Christ is through humility, meekness, and serving others diligently and cheerfully. Jesus reaffirmed this principle multiple times throughout his teachings. By willingly assuming the lowest position and serving all, one can truly be considered the greatest.
