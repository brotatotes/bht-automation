# Mark 9:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus spoke of receiving a little child, He was not only referring to age but to the qualities of innocence and humility. This act of receiving is equivalent to receiving Him, emphasizing the importance of showing love and kindness to even the least significant believer. It is a rebuke to any arrogance or conceit and serves as a reminder that respect shown to others reflects respect to Christ and His Father. By embracing a mindset of humility and love towards others, we can truly understand the attitude of Jesus and avoid contention over primacy.
