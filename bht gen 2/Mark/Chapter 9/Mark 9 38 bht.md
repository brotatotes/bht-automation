# Mark 9:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is interesting to ponder the disciples' question regarding receiving those who do not follow them. The Bible provides insight into this by highlighting the case of a man who was casting out demons in Jesus' name, even though he was not part of their group. The disciples' reaction to forbid him shows a narrowness of spirit, as religion should not be confined to only those who follow us. We should learn from this and avoid the temptation to envy or exclude others based on their different paths of faith.

### Henry Alford:
1. "If the receiving any one, even a little child, in thy Name, be receiving Thee; were we doing right when we forbade one who used thy Name, but did not follow us?"
2. "This man actually did what the very Apostles themselves were specially appointed to do: and our Lord, so far from prohibiting, encourages him."
3. "Notice the repetition of Œø·ΩêŒ∫ ·ºÄŒ∫ŒøŒª . ·º°Œº . as characteristic of Mark."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbade him, because he followeth not us. Were we right, or were we wrong?" Answer‚Äî"Ye were wrong."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There is no improbability in supposing that this might have been one of the disciples of John, or one of the seventy whom Jesus had sent out..."
2. "There is no evidence that he was merely an 'exorcist,' or that he used the name of Jesus merely as a pretence."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. In thy name. John's conscience is awakened by the Lord 's words. They had not received the man who cast out devils in Christ 's name.

### John Calvin:
1. "It is possible that he who is here mentioned had embraced the doctrine of Christ, and betaken himself to the performance of miracles with no bad intention."
2. "For the Lord was pleased, in this way also, to throw luster around his name, as he sometimes does by means of those of whose ministry he does not approve as lawful."
3. "Hence it follows, that they had rashly taken on themselves the right to forbid; and therefore every man who undertakes more than he knows that he is permitted to do by the word of God is chargeable with rashness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It was an answer in the wide sense; for the command to receive a child in His name would suggest the question of John."
2. "This unknown man had wrought such miracles as the Apostles did and by the same power, though it had not been directly committed to him as to them."
3. "This forbidding may have so disturbed his faith, that he could no longer exorcise."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "John evidently thought to change the subject from the constraint and embarrassment caused by their dispute."
2. "Perhaps what Jesus had just said in verse Mark 9:37 raised a doubt in John's mind as to the propriety of his excessive narrowness."
3. "One needs to know the difference between loyalty to Jesus and stickling over one's own narrow prejudices."

### John Gill:
1. "Taking notice of what Christ just now said, and observing how well pleasing it was to him, to receive in a meek and humble manner, the least believer in his name..."
2. "The case related, very probably happened, when the disciples being sent forth by Christ to preach the Gospel and cast out devils, took a tour through Judea and Galilee, where they saw this man."
3. "This person not only attempted to cast out devils, but really did; and that more than one; but in which of Christ's names he did it, is not expressed..."

### John Wesley:
1. "But ought we to receive those who follow not us?"
2. "How often is the same temper found in us? How readily do we also lust to envy?"
