# Mark 9:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, Jesus teaches us an important lesson about acceptance and inclusivity. He encourages us not to discourage or hinder anyone who is doing good work in His name, regardless of their background or affiliation. The ability to perform miracles in His name is evidence of a genuine connection to Him, and thus we should avoid speaking ill of those who demonstrate such faith. This passage reminds us to not limit the working of the Holy Spirit to any specific group or denomination, but instead to embrace and support all those who are promoting the kingdom of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The very success of the miracle will awe him, and prevent him from soon or lightly speaking evil of me."
2. "We must beware of supposing that the application of this saying is to be confined to the working of a miracle [...] it is a weighty maxim of Christian toleration and charity, and caution to men how they presume to limit the work of the Spirit of God to any sect, or succession, or outward form of Church."
3. "See the way in which the nearly opposite inference is extracted from the words, in the very curious note of Bp. Wordsw. here."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name." 
2. "That can lightly speak evil of meâ€”soon, that is, readily 'speak evil of me'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If he can work a miracle in my name, it is sufficient proof of attachment to me, and he should not be prevented."
2. "Our Lord taught him differently. He opposed no one who gave evidence that he loved him. Wherever he might be or whatever his work, yet, if he did it in the name of Jesus and with the approbation of God, it was evidence sufficient that he was right."
3. "True likeness to the Saviour would lead us to rejoice in all the good accomplished by whomsoever it may be done - to rejoice that the kingdom of Christ is advanced, whether by a Presbyterian, an Episcopalian, a Baptist, or a Methodist."

### John Calvin:
1. "When by any occurrence God is glorified, we ought to bear with it and rejoice."
2. "It is impossible for any man who works miracles in the name of Christ to speak evil of Christ, and therefore this ought to be reckoned as gain."
3. "Christ declares that we ought to reckon as friends those who are not open enemies."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The success of the miracle would strengthen the faith, the germs of which were manifested in the attempt to work it in the name of Christ."
2. "This is a warning against limiting 'the work of the Spirit of God to any sect, or succession, or outward form of church.'"
3. "While the Apostles were taught this lesson in toleration, the man receives only negative praise. There are always earnest Christian laborers who decline to be orderly in their methods. Their irregularity calls for toleration, not approval."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Forbid him not  (Î¼Î· ÎºÏ‰Î»Ï…ÎµÏ„Îµ). Stop hindering him (Î¼Î· and the present-imperative) as John had been doing. 

### John Gill:
1. "There is no man which shall do a miracle in my name; or 'miracles'... that can lightly speak evil of me."
2. "No man can call Jesus accursed, who casts out devils in his name; see 1 Corinthians 12:3."
3. "His conscience will not admit of it; and besides, it would be contrary to his interest; it must sink his credit, and he lose the esteem and applause of men, he had gained by his miracles; for to dishonour that name, would be to reproach himself."

### John Wesley:
1. "Christ here gives us a lovely example of candour and moderation."
2. "He was willing to put the best construction on doubtful cases, and to treat as friends those who were not avowed enemies."
3. "Forbid him not â€” Neither directly nor indirectly discourage or hinder any man who brings sinners from the power of Satan to God."
