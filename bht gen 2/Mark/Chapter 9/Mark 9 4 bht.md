# Mark 9:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Mark 9:4, we see the striking presence of both Elijah and Moses on the scene. Elijah, the eminent prophet, takes a more prominent role in this account, while Moses, although highly significant, seems to be less expected. The appearance of both these figures together serves as a confirmation of the things Jesus had been teaching his disciples, shining a light on their prophetic ministry and the fulfillment of divine plans.
