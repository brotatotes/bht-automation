# Mark 9:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who do not oppose the cause of Christ and His disciples can be considered as allies. While there may be outward differences in how they worship or govern, as long as they believe in and preach Jesus Christ without bitterly opposing each other, they are helpers forward of each other's work. It is important to refrain from rashly criticizing those who promote the kingdom of God, even if their methods differ. Instead, we should focus on the unity of purpose and the reverence they have for the name of Christ.
