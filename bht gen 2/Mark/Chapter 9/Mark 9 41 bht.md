# Mark 9:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Even the smallest act of service done in my Name shall not go unrewarded. This includes something as simple as offering a cup of water to drink in my Name, for those who belong to me. It is important to remember that every act of service, no matter how small, holds great significance in the eyes of Jesus. As we strive to follow Him, let us not lose sight of the value of even the simplest acts of kindness and service, for they will not go unnoticed or unrewarded by our gracious Savior.
