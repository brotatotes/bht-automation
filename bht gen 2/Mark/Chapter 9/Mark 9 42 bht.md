# Mark 9:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For even the smallest act of harm or offense committed against someone who believes in Christ, the consequences are severe. It is said that it would be better for the offender to have a heavy millstone hung around their neck and be thrown into the sea. This warning emphasizes the importance of treating all believers with respect and refraining from causing them to stumble. Offending others, particularly those who are vulnerable in their faith, is something that should be avoided at all costs.
