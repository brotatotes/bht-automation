# Mark 9:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is better to renounce any hindrances, whether they be friends or possessions, that obstruct one's spiritual welfare and enter into eternal life, than to cling to them and risk being cast into the fire of Gehenna. Gehenna, a place near Jerusalem, is associated with burning garbage and bones of defilement, serving as a vivid depiction of eternal punishment. To achieve spiritual growth, one must separate from anyone or anything that hinders their relationship with God. This renunciation extends not only to individuals but also to objects that may impede our journey of faith.
