# Mark 9:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The absence of certain verses in the oldest manuscripts brings attention to the repetition of Mark 9:48. However, the significance lies in the depiction of perpetual torment for sinners. The worm symbolizes an unceasingly agonizing conscience, constantly reminding them of their sins. This brings about anguish, remorse, and despair without end. Additionally, the fire represents the unquenchable wrath of God, which continues to torment their souls indefinitely. Consequently, these verses serve as a solemn reflection on the eternal consequences of unrepentant sin.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The oldest and best manuscripts do not give these two verses."
2. "They are a mere repetition of verse Mark 9:48."
3. "Hence we lose the numbering 44 and 46 in our verses which are not genuine."

### John Gill:
1. "By their worm is meant, their conscience; for as a worm that is continually gnawing upon the entrails of a man, gives him exquisite pain; so the consciences of sinners, will be continually flying in their faces, bringing their sins to remembrance, accusing them of them, upbraiding them with them, aggravating them, tormenting them for them, filling them with dreadful anguish and misery, with twinging remorses, and severe reflections, and which will never have an end."
2. "Conscience will be ever distressing, racking, and torturing them; it will never cease, nor cease doing this office."
3. "By 'the fire' may be meant the fire of divine wrath let into their souls, which will never be extinguished."

### John Wesley:
1. "Where their worm â€” That gnaweth the soul, (pride, self will, desire, malice, envy, shame, sorrow, despair,) dieth not - No more than the soul itself."
2. "The fire (either material, or infinitely worse!) that tormenteth the body, is not quenched for ever."
