# Mark 9:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who provide support and sustenance to others are comparable to the foot in relation to the body, essential for the overall functioning. It is preferable to enter heaven alone rather than being accompanied by those who would lead one astray, risking the consequence of being cast into an unending fire.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Gill:
1. "Such who are that to men, as the foot is to the body, the support of them through whom they have their maintenance and subsistence."
2. "It is better to go alone without such company into heaven than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched."
