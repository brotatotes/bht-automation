# Mark 9:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is better to enter the kingdom of God with one eye, even though it may seem drastic, than to be cast into hell-fire with two eyes. This metaphor highlights how dearly loved God's people are to Him, and the tender concern He has for them. Even beloved and intimate friends should be let go if they become stumbling blocks or lead others into sin. The kingdom of God, which He has prepared for His people, far outweighs any earthly attachment and offers eternal enjoyment of God's presence.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell-fire." 
2. "On the words 'hell' and 'hell-fire,' or 'the hell of fire,' see on [previous reference]."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. With one eye [μονοφθαλμον] . Lit., one - eyed. One of Mark's words which is branded as slang. Wyc. oddly renders goggle - eyed.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  With one eye  (μονοφθαλμον). Literally one-eyed. See also Matthew 18:9. Vernacular Koine and condemned by the Atticists. See Matthew 18:8. Mark has here "kingdom of God" where Matthew 18:9 has "life." 

### John Gill:
1. "Than which, nothing is dearer to man, it being very tender, and exceeding useful: this metaphor the Lord sometimes makes use of, to show how dear his people are unto him, and what a tender concern he has for them."
2. "And here it may design such, as are most beloved by men, and are their most intimate acquaintance, and bosom friends; and yet these are to be parted with, when they prove snares and stumbling blocks, or give offence, by endeavouring to draw into sin, and from Christ."
3. "It is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye; that kingdom, which God has prepared for his people, from the foundation of the world, and of his rich grace, gives unto them, and in which they will enjoy him to all eternity; than having two eyes, to be cast into hell fire."
