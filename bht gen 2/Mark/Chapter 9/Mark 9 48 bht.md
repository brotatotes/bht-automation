# Mark 9:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The repeated phrase where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched serves to both authenticate the truth of the relentless nature of this punishment and to impress its severity upon our hearts. The vivid imagery of an undying worm relentlessly consuming an unconsumable body and the unquenchable fire depicts the dreadful reality of eternal damnation. The closing words of the prophet, which form the foundation of future Jewish teachings on punishment, reflect the indescribable horror and finality of this ultimate fate. No mere words or figurative language can adequately capture the magnitude of this eternal sentence.
