# Mark 9:49 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The concept of being salted with fire is used metaphorically in the Bible to represent the process of divine purification and refining. Just as salt preserves and purifies, the fire of God's judgment serves to burn away impurities and refine His people. This refining fire, though painful, is ultimately a means of preservation, as it purges what is impure and preserves what is intended to endure. It serves as a powerful reminder of the consequences of unrepentant sin and the need for repentance. Through the grace of God, we are kept safe and preserved for His kingdom and glory.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Fire is the symbol of the divine purity and presence: our God is a consuming fire, not only to his foes, but to his people: but in them, the fire shall only burn up what is impure and requires purifying out."
2. "This very fire shall be to them as a preserving salt."
3. "And in and among this purifying fire shall the people of God ever walk and rejoice everlastingly."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Every disciple of Mine shall have a fiery trial to undergo, and everyone who would be found an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable and well-pleasing to God, must have such a salting, like the Levitical sacrifices."
2. "The reference to salting the sacrifice is of course to that maxim of the Levitical law, that every acceptable sacrifice must be sprinkled with salt, to express symbolically its soundness, sweetness, wholesomeness, acceptability."
3. "Our Lord has still in His eye the unseemly jarrings which had arisen among the Twelve, the peril to themselves of allowing any indulgence to such passions, and the severe self-sacrifice which salvation would cost them."

### John Calvin:
1. "To be salted with fire is an incorrect phrase; but as salt and fire possess the same quality of purifying and refining, Christ applied the same term to both."
2. "He shows, that believers are salted by the word of the Gospel, that they may be sanctified."
3. "When men have lost, by their carelessness, that savor which they obtained by the grace of God, there is no farther remedy."

### John Gill:
1. "That fire shall be to them, what salt is to flesh; as that keeps flesh from putrefaction and corruption, so the fire of hell, as it will burn, torture, and distress rebellious sinners, it will preserve them in their beings."
2. "These words are a reason of the former, showing and proving, that the soul in torment shall never die, or lose any of its powers and faculties; and particularly, not its gnawing, torturing conscience; and that the fire of hell is inextinguishable."
3. "Such who are seasoned with the grace of God, are preserved from the corruptions of the world, are acceptable in the sight of God, and are kept safe to his kingdom and glory."

### John Wesley:
1. "Who does not cut off the offending member, and consequently is cast into hell, shall be, as it were, salted with fire, preserved, not consumed thereby."
2. "Every acceptable sacrifice shall be salted with another kind of salt, even that of Divine grace, which purifies the soul, (though frequently with pain) and preserves it from corruption."
