# Mark 9:50 Commentary Help Text

Jesus referred to his disciples as the salt of the earth, emphasizing their role in bringing seasoning, preservation, and purity to the world around them. This analogy highlights the importance of their faith and the grace of God in their lives, which enables them to have a positive impact on others.

This exhortation encourages unity among the disciples, reminding them to focus on serving others rather than seeking personal greatness.
