# Mark 9:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter's words were a result of his fear and religious awe, as all three Evangelists mention. His remarks, as Luke explains, were spoken out of ignorance and not knowing what to say. It is clear that Peter and the other disciples were unaware of the significance of the conversation Jesus had with Moses and Elijah. Their lack of understanding and recent display of stupidity, as mentioned in Mark, further exemplify their confusion and lack of comprehension in that moment.
