# Mark 9:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
And there was a cloud that overshadowed them, a bright cloud of glory, similar to the cloud that accompanied Israel in the wilderness. This cloud departed at the death of Moses but reappeared in honor of Jesus, the great Prophet of the Church, bearing witness to his sonship. The voice of God the Father was directed not to Moses and Elijah, but to the disciples, commanding them to listen and obey Jesus, the one in whom all the law and prophets find their culmination.
