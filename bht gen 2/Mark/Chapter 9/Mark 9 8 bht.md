# Mark 9:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of the disciples' fear and astonishment upon hearing the voice, they took a sudden glance around, hoping to catch sight of the source of the voice and ascertain if anyone else was present on the mountain. However, to their surprise, they could discern no one else, neither Moses nor Elijah, at that moment or ever again. It became clear to them that only Jesus remained with them, and the voice they heard was intended only for Him and for their alertness.
