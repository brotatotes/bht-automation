# Mark 9:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After witnessing the transfiguration, Jesus instructed his disciples to keep the experience a secret, not revealing it to anyone, including their fellow disciples. The significance of this instruction lies in the fact that the event was a high and holy secret experience, intended for the future good of the chosen three and for the benefit of all. Furthermore, this secrecy was to be maintained until after the resurrection of the Son of Man. The disciples were entrusted with a powerful narrative, one to be shared at the appropriate time, after Jesus' triumph over death.
