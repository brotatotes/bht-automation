# Matthew 1:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the book of the generation of Jesus Christ, we find both his birth and genealogy. Though some may find difficulties in reconciling the genealogies given by Matthew and Luke, they ultimately prove that Jesus is indeed from the family from which the promised seed was to come. These genealogies were significant in establishing Jesus as the long-awaited Messiah and would have been important in preventing disputes between the Jews and the disciples of Jesus. This title also highlights the special connection between Jesus and the family of David, as he was more specifically promised to descend from them.
