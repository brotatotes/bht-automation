# Matthew 1:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The book of the generation of Jesus Christ specifically refers to the account and lineage of Jesus' birth. These genealogical records serve the purpose of proving that Jesus is indeed from the family line through which the promised seed was to come. Jesus is called the son of David and the son of Abraham because these were the ancestors to whom the promise of the Messiah was specifically made. Through these lineage records, it becomes evident that Jesus is the fulfillment of these prophecies.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "βίβλος γενέσεως] Not always used of a pedigree only: see reff. Here however it appears that it refers exclusively to the genealogy."
2. "It does not once thus occur in the progress of the Evangelic history; only in the prefatory parts of the Gospels, here and Matthew 1:16-18: Mark 1:1; John 1:17, and once in the mouth of our Lord himself, John 17:3."
3. "That He should be son of Abraham, was too solemn a subject of prophecy to be omitted here, even though implied in the other."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "We have here, then, the title, not of this whole Gospel of Matthew, but only of the first seventeen verses."
2. "The word 'Christ'... only began to be so used by others about the very close of His earthly career."
3. "To a Jewish reader, accordingly, these behooved to be the two great starting-points of any true genealogy of the promised Messiah."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The phrase is common in Jewish writings...the genealogical table of Jesus Christ." 
2. "Jesus is called either the Messiah, or the Christ, meaning the same thing." 
3. "Though Jesus was of humble birth, yet he was descended from most illustrious ancestors."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Christ [χριστος]. Properly an adjective, not a noun, and meaning anointed (criw, to anoint). It is a translation of the Hebrew Messiah, the king and spiritual ruler from David 's race, promised under that name in the Old Testament."
2. "Hence the word 'Christ' was representative of our Lord, who united in himself the offices of king, prophet, and priest."
3. "Through Christ the dignity of sons is bestowed on believers, so that the same word is appropriate to Christians, sons of God."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is objected, on the other hand, that Mary, the mother of Christ, was Elisabeth’s cousin, though Luke has formerly stated that she was of the daughters of Aaron." 
2. "The excuse commonly offered, that the diversity arose from its being very customary among the Jews to have two names, appears to many persons not quite satisfactory." 
3. "It is true, indeed, that a catalogue, divided into three equal numbers, is more easily remembered. But it is also evident that this division is intended to point out a threefold condition of the nation, from the time when Christ was promised to Abraham, to 'the fullness of the time' when he was 'manifested in the flesh.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The book of the generation (or, birth) is literally, 'book of birth, birth-book,' i.e., pedigree, genealogy. The title of the genealogical table, Matthew 1:1-17, not of the whole Gospel, nor of the first two chapters, nor of chap. 1."
2. "Jesus Christ. This combination is the Gospel in a nutshell, a declaration that Jesus is the Christ, the promised Messiah, the great truth, which the following narrative is to establish."
3. "The Son of David. 'David the king.' From him descended One 'born King of the Jews' (Matthew 2:2)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The usual word for book is a diminutive form (βιβλιον), a little book or roll such as we have in Luke 4:17, 'The roll of the prophet Isaiah.'"
2. "Matthew proposes to show that Jesus Christ is on the human side the son of David, as the Messiah was to be, and the son of Abraham, not merely a real Jew and the heir of the promises, but the promise made to Abraham."
3. "Verse 1 is the description of the list in verses Matthew 1:2-17. The names are given in three groups, Abraham to David (Matthew 1:2-6), David to Babylon Removal (Matthew 1:6-11), Jechoniah to Jesus (Matthew 1:12-16)."

### John Gill:
1. "This is the genuine title of the book, which was put to it by the Evangelist himself."
2. "This account of Christ begins with the name of the Messiah, well known to the Jews, the son of David."
3. "The reason why Christ is first called the son of David, and then the son of Abraham, is partly because the former was a more known name of the Messiah; and partly that the transition to the genealogy of Christ might be more easy and natural."

### John Wesley:
1. "The book of the generation of Jesus Christ - That is, strictly speaking, the account of his birth and genealogy."
2. "These accounts sufficiently answer the end for which they are recited. They unquestionably prove the grand point in view, that Jesus was of the family from which the promised seed was to come."
3. "He is so called, because to these he was more peculiarly promised; and of these it was often foretold the Messiah should spring."
