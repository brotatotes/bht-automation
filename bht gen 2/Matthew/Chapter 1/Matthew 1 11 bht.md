# Matthew 1:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The difficulty in Matthew 1:11-12 lies in reconciling the name Jeconiah. One suggestion is to apply the name to both Eliakim and his son, but this contradicts the established pattern in genealogies. Another explanation proposes that the term brethren refers to his uncles, which finds support in similar usage elsewhere. Furthermore, the mention of the Babylonian captivity is a delicate way of alluding to a painful period in Jewish history. As we trace the lineage, we see how Jeconiah is connected to his ancestors, including Jehoiakim and his uncles.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The solution of the difficulty by supposing the name to apply to both Eliakim and his son, and to mean the former in Mat 1:11 and the latter in Matthew 1:12 , is unsupported by example, and contrary to the usage of the genealogy."
2. "When we notice that the á¼€Î´ÎµÎ»Ï†Î¿Î¯ of Jechonias are his uncles, and find this way of speaking sanctioned by 2 Chronicles 36:10, where Zedekiah, one of these, is called his brother, we are led to seek our solution in some recognized manner of speaking of these kings, by which Eliakim and his son were not accounted two distinct generations."
3. "This view may perhaps be imagined to derive some support from the digest: but it seems to me that the objection to it is, the present occurrence of á¼¸ÎµÏ‡Î¿Î½Î¯Î±Î½ and - Î±Ï‚ in all our copies."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Jehoiakim might well be sunk in such a catalogue, being a mere puppet in the hands of the king of Egypt."
2. "The 'brethren' of Jechonias here evidently mean his uncles."
3. "For the Jews avoided the word 'captivity' as too bitter a recollection, and our Evangelist studiously respects the national feeling."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The next king was Jehoia-kim... unworthy of mention."
2. "The removal... extended over a considerable period of time during three successive reigns."
3. "The course is downward through these royal generations."

### John Gill:
1. "These were Johanan, Zedekiah, and Shallum...to distinguish him from Jechonias in the next verse; who does not appear to have had any brethren."
2. "These were about the time they were carried away to Babylon, which is not to be connected with the word 'begat'...but with the phrase 'his brethren.'"
3. "Supposing Ï„Î¿Ï…Ï‚ understood, 'which were at', or 'about the carrying away to Babylon', or the Babylonish captivity."

### John Wesley:
1. "Josiah begat Jeconiah â€” Mediately, Jehoiakim coming between."
2. "And his brethren â€” That is, his uncles."
3. "About the time they were carried away â€” Which was a little after the birth of Jeconiah."
