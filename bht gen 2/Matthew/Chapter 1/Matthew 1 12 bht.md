# Matthew 1:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The denouncement of being childless does not imply the absence of children, but rather the absence of prospering descendants who would reign on the throne. The intention is to convey a fate of destitution and unhappiness, stripped of the blessings of life. It is possible that the individual in question, Shealtiel, did not have his own children and instead adopted his brother's son, Zerubbabel, to ensure the continuation of the line.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "When, therefore, it is denounced (Jer 32:30) that Jeconiah should be 'childless,' this word must be understood as explained by the rest of the verse, 'for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting upon the throne of David and ruling any more in Judah.'"
2. "The LXX render this word ◊¢÷≤◊®÷¥◊ô◊®÷¥◊ô, ·ºêŒ∫Œ∫ŒÆœÅœÖŒ∫œÑŒøŒΩ: but the Talmudical writers explain it according to our rendering."
3. "Either this may have been a different Zerubbabel, or Salathiel may, according to the law, have raised up seed to his brother."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Nor does this contradict Jeremiah 22:30, 'Thus saith the Lord, Write ye this man (Coniah, or Jeconiah) childless'; for what follows explains in what sense this was meant‚Äî'for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting upon the throne of David.' He was to have seed, but no reigning child."
2. "But it would appear from 1 Chronicles 3:19 that Zerubbabel was Salathiel's grandson, being the son of Pedaiah, whose name, for some reason unknown, is omitted."

### John Calvin:
1. "The fragments of the royal scepter lasted till the coming of Christ was at hand, agreeably to the prediction of Jacob."
2. "And even during that wretched and melancholy dispersion, the nation never ceased to be illuminated by some rays of the grace of God."
3. "The meaning is, that the Jews were compelled to leave their country, and to dwell as 'strangers in a land that was not theirs'."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The succeeding list cannot be verified, although we meet with the names of Salathiel (Shealtiel), Zerrubabel (Ezra 3:2; Nehemiah 12:1; Haggai 1:1) in the Old Testament."
2. "In 1 Chronicles 3:19, Zerubbabel is said to have been the son of Pedaiah, brother of Salathiel."
3. "Either this may have been a different Zerubbabel, or Salathiel may, according to the law, have raised up seed to his brother" (Alford).

### John Gill:
1. "The sentence does not imply that he should have no children, but rather that he should, as will appear upon reading the whole."
2. "The Hebrew word rendered 'childless'...denotes not only such as have no children, or are bereft of them, but such as are by any providence stripped of the blessings of life, and are left bare, destitute, and unhappy, as Jechonias and his posterity were."
3. "I greatly suspect that Shealtiel had no children of his own, since none are mentioned; and that he adopted his brother Pedaiah's son Zorobabel, and made him his heir and successor in the government of Judah."
