# Matthew 1:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The genealogy of Jesus in the New Testament incorporates names that are likely drawn from official records. Abiud, one of these names, may be the same person as Meshullam from the Old Testament. The accuracy of the Jewish genealogical registers, which were meticulously maintained, lends credibility to the recorded lineage. Matthew's account of Jesus' connection to the line of Zorobabel is in harmony with the Jewish Targum, supporting the validity of his assertion. This alignment highlights the significance of Jesus' ancestry from the line of David, signifying the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Lord A. Hervey, p. 122 ff., has made it probable that Abiud is identical with the Hodaiah of 1 Chronicles 3:24, and the Juda of Luke 3:26."
2. "The objection, that thus the first generation after Zerubbabel would be omitted, need not have much weight, after the omission of three generations in the last tesseradecade."
3. "Whether or not we may be inclined to adopt his conjectures on so intricate and uncertain a subject as the reconciling of the genealogies, too much praise cannot be given to the spirit of combined Christian reverence and enlightened critical courage in which it is treated throughout."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "None of these names are found in the Old Testament but they were doubtless taken from the public or family registers."
2. "The Jews carefully kept [registers], and their accuracy was never challenged."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The downward course reaches its lowest point in the humble carpenter of Nazareth."
2. "The promised Saviour was to be â€˜a root out of a dry groundâ€™ (Isaiah 53:2)."

### John Gill:
1. "The children of Zorobabel are said in 1 Chronicles 3:19, to be Meshullam, and Hananiah, and Shelomith their sister, but no mention is made of Abiud: he seems to be the same with Meshullam the eldest son, who might have two names."
2. "From hence to the 16th verse the genealogy is carried down to Joseph, the husband of Mary which account must be taken from the genealogical tables of the Jews, to which recourse might be had, and with which it agrees; or otherwise the Jews would have cavilled at it; but I do not find any objections made by them to it."
3. "It is very remarkable that the Jewish Targum traces the descent of the Messiah from the family of David in the line of Zorobabel, as Matthew does; and reckons the same number of generations, wanting one, from Zorobabel to the Messiah, as the Evangelist does, from Zorobabel to Jesus."
