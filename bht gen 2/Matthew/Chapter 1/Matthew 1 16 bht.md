# Matthew 1:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The genealogies in Luke and Matthew establish Jesus' legal and royal lineage. Luke emphasizes Jesus' descent from David through Mary, emphasizing his divine anointing. Matthew's genealogy traces Joseph's royal ancestry, confirming Jesus' connection to the throne of David. These genealogies fulfill prophecies, confirming Jesus as the true Messiah. Recognizing Joseph's legal fatherhood and Jesus' noble bloodline is crucial in understanding Jesus' role as the anointed Savior and rightful King.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And yet it is here studiously proclaimed that Joseph was not the natural, but only the legal father of our Lord."
2. "His birth of a virgin was known only to a few; but the acknowledged descent of his legal father from David secured that the descent of Jesus Himself from David should never be questioned."
3. "It [Christ] was applied, in its most sublime and comprehensive sense, to the promised Deliverer, inasmuch as He was to be consecrated to an office embracing all three by the immeasurable anointing of the Holy Ghost."

### John Calvin:
1. "Jesus, who is called Christ...to inform the readers that this was not a private person, but one divinely anointed to perform the office of Redeemer."
2. "What that anointing was, and to what it referred, I shall not now illustrate at great length...the kings were wont to be called œáœÅŒπœÉœÑŒø·Ω∑, anointed."
3. "But that the fearful desolation which followed might not throw the minds of the godly into despair, it pleased God to appropriate the name of Messiah, Anointed, to the Redeemer alone."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Luke gives the genealogy of Mary, Hell being her father, and the father-in-law of Joseph. This is the most probable view, since the writers of the New Testament assume that Jesus was descended from David through his mother." 
2. "Both are genealogies of Joseph. This assumes one, or perhaps two, levirate marriages in the family of Joseph...The objection to the whole theory is, that Jewish usage would insert in the genealogy not the name of the second husband (the real father), but only that of the first husband who died childless."
3. "According to another hypothesis, the royal ancestry of Joseph is given by Matthew, a descent from David through private persons is traced by Luke. This implies inaccuracy in one or the other."

### John Gill:
1. "We may learn from hence, what a low condition the family of David was in, when the true Messiah came; according to ancient prophecy, it was like a stump of a tree, or like to a tree cut down to the root." 
2. "From the whole of this genealogy it appears, that Jesus was of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Judah, and of the family of David; whereby several ancient prophecies have their accomplishment, and therefore he ought to be acknowledged as the true Messiah."
3. "And also that he was of the blood royal, and had his descent from the kings of Judah, and was heir apparent to the throne and kingdom of his father David."

### John Wesley:
1. "It was needful for all who believed this, to know, that Joseph was sprung from David. Otherwise they would not allow Jesus to be the Christ."
2. "The name Jesus respects chiefly the promise of blessing made to Abraham: the name Christ, the promise of the Messiah's kingdom, which was made to David."
3. "And if we look into ourselves, we shall find a want of Christ in all these respects. We are by nature at a distance from God, alienated from him, and incapable of a free access to him. Hence we want a mediator, an intercessor, in a word, a Christ, in his priestly office."
