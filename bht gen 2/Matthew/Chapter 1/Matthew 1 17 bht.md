# Matthew 1:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When examining the genealogies in the Bible, we reflect on the passing of time as one generation fades and another arises, similar to the falling and growth of leaves on a tree. Despite this continual change, the goodness of the Lord remains steadfast, spanning across generations and providing a common hope for both parents and children. In the midst of being forgotten by others, may we find solace in being remembered by God and the possibility of our names being inscribed in the book of life, signifying an eternal legacy.

2. "LANGE thinks that this was meant as a tacit hint that Mary was to be supplied, as the thirteenth link of the last chain, as it is impossible to conceive that the Evangelist could have made any mistake in the matter."
3. "As the Evangelist himself reckons David twiceâ€”as the last of the first fourteen and the first of the secondâ€”so, if we reckon the second fourteen to end with Josiah... and third to begin with Jeconiah, it will be found that the last division, as well as the other two, embraces fourteen names, including that of our Lord."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "A man who wished to commit to memory the names of a regiment of soldiers would naturally divide it into companies and platoons, and this would greatly facilitate his work. This was doubtless the reason in the case before us."
