# Matthew 1:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The birth of Jesus Christ was not an ordinary event, but rather something remarkable and astonishing. While Mary was betrothed to Joseph, it was made known that she was with child, a fact that ensured the credibility of both Mary and Jesus. As the Holy Spirit was the one who brought about this miraculous conception without a human father, it highlights the uniqueness of Christ's birth.
