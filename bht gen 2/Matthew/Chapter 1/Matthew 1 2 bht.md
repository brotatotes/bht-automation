# Matthew 1:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The genealogy of Christ in this passage signifies the direct lineage from Abraham through Isaac and Jacob. While Abraham had other sons, the focus is on the Messianic line through Isaac. Likewise, only Jacob is mentioned among Isaac's twins, as he was the chosen one. The genealogy then emphasizes the descent through Jacob's son, Judah, in fulfillment of the prophecy that the Messiah would emerge from the tribe of Judah. Consequently, the passage underscores God's faithfulness to His promises and the significance of the chosen lineage leading to the birth of Christ.
