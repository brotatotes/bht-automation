# Matthew 1:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Joseph received the news about Mary's pregnancy, he was deeply troubled and uncertain. He weighed the potential impact on his reputation and Mary's innocence. In the midst of his internal turmoil, an angel appeared to him in a dream, reassuring him not to fear. The angel emphasized that Joseph should take Mary as his wife without worry, as her conception was not a result of any sinful act, but rather a miraculous overshadowing of the Holy Spirit. This encounter served as a divine intervention, offering Joseph guidance and affirming Mary's integrity.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Surely Joseph needed God's help if ever man did."
