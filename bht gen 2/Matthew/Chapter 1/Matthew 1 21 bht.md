# Matthew 1:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, whose name means The Lord, Salvation, was sent to save His people. He is the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies, a type of deliverer like Joshua and Hosea. His salvation is not temporary, but everlasting and spiritual in nature. He came to save His chosen ones, both Jews and Gentiles, who were given to Him by the Father. Thus, Jesus is the ultimate Savior, bringing salvation to all the people of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He alone: best rendered, perhaps, ‘it is He that.’"
2. "In the larger sense, all who believe on Him: an explanation which the tenor of prophecy and the subsequent admission of the Gentiles, warrant."
3. "This announcement reaches further into the deliverance to be wrought by Jesus, than anything mentioned by the Evangelist subsequently. It thus bears the internal impress of a message from God, treasured up and related in its original formal terms."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "JESUS—to the awakened and anxious sinner sweetest and most fragrant of all names, expressing so melodiously and briefly His whole saving office and work!" 
2. "The 'He' is here emphatic—He it is that shall save; He personally, and by personal acts." 
3. "In the most comprehensive sense of salvation from sin."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He saves people by dying to redeem them; by giving the Holy Spirit to renew them; by His power in enabling them to overcome their spiritual enemies, in defending them from danger, in guiding them in the path of duty, in sustaining them in trials and in death."
2. "The design of Jesus was...to save them from sin; and from this we may learn...that all professing Christians should feel that there is no salvation unless it is from sin, and that they can never be admitted to a holy heaven hereafter unless they are made pure, by the blood of Jesus, here."
3. "We have no evidence that we are his people unless we are saved from the power and dominion of sin. A mere profession of being His people will not answer. Unless we give up our sins...we have no evidence that we are the children of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The meaning of the name, therefore, finds expression in the title Savior, applied to our Lord."
2. "Joshua, the son of Nun, is a type of Christ in his office of captain and deliverer of his people, in the military aspect of his saving work."
3. "He who 'knew no sin' is 'made to be sin on our behalf, that we might become the righteousness of God in him'."

### John Calvin:
1. "This office was conferred upon his Son from the fact, from the command which had been given to him by the Father, from the office with which he was invested when he came down to us from heaven."
2. "When the Son of God came to us clothed in flesh, he received from the Father a name which plainly told for what purpose he came, what was his power, and what we had a right to expect from him."
3. "Thus we obtain a view of our corruption and depravity; for if any man lived a perfectly holy life, he might do without Christ as a Redeemer. But all to a man need his grace; and, therefore, it follows that they are the slaves of sin, and are destitute of true righteousness."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus is the same as Joshua, signifying in Hebrew, 'Jehovah is helper,' or 'Help of Jehovah.'"
2. "Jesus is the Greek form of Joshua... He is another Joshua to lead the true people of God into the Promised Land."
3. "The name itself was common enough... Jehovah is Salvation as seen in Joshua for the Hebrews and in Jesus for all believers."

### John Gill:
1. "And she shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Jesus... a name of the same signification with Joshua and Hosea, and may be interpreted a 'Saviour', Acts 13:23 for the word ישוע Jesus, comes from ישע which signifies 'to save.'"
2. "The salvation here ascribed to him is to be understood, not of a temporal, but of a spiritual and everlasting salvation; such as was prophesied of, Isaiah 45:17 and which old Jacob had in his view, when he said, 'I have waited for thy salvation, O Lord', Genesis 49:18."
3. "By 'his people' whom he is said to save are meant, not all mankind, but the elect of God, whether Jews or Gentiles, who were given to him by his Father, as a peculiar people, and who are made willing in the day of his power upon them, to be saved by him in his own way."

### John Wesley:
1. "Jesus [...] signifies, The Lord, Salvation."
2. "Jesus [...] was a type of him."
3. "His people [...] Israel. And all the Israel of God."
