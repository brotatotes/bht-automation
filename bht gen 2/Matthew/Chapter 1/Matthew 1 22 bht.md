# Matthew 1:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Mary's conception by the Holy Spirit and her virginity before coming together with Joseph were all part of God's plan to fulfill the prophecy spoken by the Lord through the prophet. The prophecy reveals God's will and faithfulness, and the actual fulfillment of it shows that it was done in a literal sense, not just symbolically or metaphorically. The miraculous birth of Jesus sheds light on the Old Testament narrative and prophecies for early Christians, providing evidence of the supernatural nature of Jesus' birth rather than trying to explain it as a fictional myth.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is impossible to interpret ἵνα in any other sense than in order that. The words τοῦτο δὲ ὅ . γέγ . and the uniform usage of the N.T., in which ἵνα is never used except in this sense, forbid any other."
2. "Whatever may have been the partial fulfilment of the prophecy in the time of Ahaz, its reference to a different time, and a higher deliverance, is undeniable."
3. "The accomplishment of a promise formally made is often alleged as the cause of an action extending wider than the promise, and purposed long before its utterance."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 22. Now all this was done, that it
	might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet—
	(Isaiah 7:14). 
	saying—as follows.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The prophecy was delivered about 740 years before Christ, in the reign of Ahaz, king of Judah."
2. "The prophecy was therefore designed originally to signify to Ahaz that the land would certainly be delivered from its calamities and dangers, and that the deliverance would not be long delayed."
3. "The language is so full and rich, and the promises are so grand, that they may appropriately express all these deliverances."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In quotations from the Old Testament, the writers habitually use the preposition dia (through) to denote the instrumentality through which God works or speaks."
2. "They reserve uJpo (by) to express the primary agency of God himself."
3. "The prophecy in ver. 23 was spoken by the Lord, but was communicated to men through his prophet."

### John Calvin:
1. "We must now see how appropriately the prediction of Isaiah is applied."
2. "When the prophet reminds unbelievers of the general covenant, it is a sort of reproof, because they did not accept of a particular sign."
3. "Let pious readers now consider, when the royal family had openly rejected the sign which God had offered to them, if it was not suitable that the prophet should pass all at once to the Messiah, for the purpose of leading unbelievers to reflect, that the only cause of the deliverance was the covenant that had been made with their fathers."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "An explanation of the Evangelist, who everywhere points to the fulfilment of prophecy."
2. "The event fulfilled God’s purpose as predicted, and therefore took place."
3. "The prophecy depends on the fact as purposed in the Divine mind."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "All this has happened" stands on record as historical fact. But the Virgin Birth of Jesus is not due to this interpretation of Isaiah 7:14.
2. "It is far simpler to admit the supernatural fact than try to explain the invention of the idea as a myth to justify the deification of Jesus."
3. "The birth, life, and death of Jesus throw a flood of light on the Old Testament narrative and prophecies for the early Christians."

### John Gill:
1. "Mary's being with child of the Holy Ghost, ... whilst a pure virgin, before she and Joseph came together, ... were all brought about in this way, and with such circumstances, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the Prophet." 
2. "The prophecy shows the will, counsel, and determination of God about this matter; the accomplishment of it, the faithfulness and veracity of God in his word."
3. "The prediction declares that the thing would be, and the thing itself was done, that what was spoken might be fulfilled; not merely by way of accommodation, or in a typical and mystical, but in a strict, proper and literal sense."
