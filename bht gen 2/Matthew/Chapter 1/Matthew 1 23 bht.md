# Matthew 1:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Behold, a wonderful and extraordinary prophecy is about to be revealed. The sign lies in the fact that a virgin shall conceive or be with child, which the Evangelist Matthew justifies by interpreting the Hebrew word עלמה as a virgin. To be called means to truly and effectually be what he is called, fulfilling that title. He shall be called Immanuel, God with us, not only nominally, but in actuality and effect. All of his people shall call him Emmanuel, acknowledging his divine presence among us.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Such is the rendering of the LXX...the prophecy was then understood of the Messiah." 
2. "The change of person from καλέσεις...shew[s] both that the prophecy had a literal fulfilment at the time, and that it is here quoted in a form suited to its greater and final fulfilment." 
3. "In Isaiah, prophetic primarily of deliverance from the then impending war; but also of final and glorious deliverance by the manifestation of God in the flesh."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Behold, a virgin—It should be 'the virgin' meaning that particular virgin destined to this unparalleled distinction."
2. "they shall call his name Emmanuel, which, being interpreted, is, God with us—Not that He was to have this for a proper name (like 'Jesus'), but that He should come to be known in this character, as God manifested in the flesh."
3. "the living bond of holy and most intimate fellowship between God and men from henceforth and for ever."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Behold, a virgin shall be with child - Matthew clearly understands this as applying literally to a virgin."
2. "The word 'Immanuel' is a Hebrew word, צמנוּאל ‛immânû'êl... and literally means 'God with us.'"
3. "He had just given an account of the miraculous conception of Jesus: of his being begotten by the Holy Spirit. God was therefore his Father. He was divine as well as human. His appropriate name, therefore, was 'God with us.' And though the mere use of such a name would not prove that he had a divine nature, yet as Matthew uses it, and meant evidently to apply it, it does prove that Jesus was more than a man; that he was God as well as man."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The original of Isaiah (vii. 14) has she shall call; but Matthew generalized the singular into the plural, and quotes the prophecy in a form suited to its larger and final fulfilment: men shall call his name Immanuel, as they shall come to the practical knowledge that God will indeed dwell with men upon the earth."
2. "Immanuel (Hebrew, God is with us). To protect and save. A comment is furnished by Isaiah 8:10, 'Devise a device, but it shall come to naught; speak a word, but it shall not stand, for with us is God.'"
3. "The promise of the name is fulfilled in Jesus (compare 'Lo, I am with you always,' Matthew 28:20) by his helpful and saving presence with his people in their sorrow, their conflict with sin, and their struggle with death."

### John Calvin:
1. "But through Christ we are not only received into his favor, but are made one with him."
2. "If we are united to Christ by faith, we possess God."
3. "All the godly have an equal right to make this confession, that God has given himself to us to be enjoyed in Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Old and New Testaments are related to each other as type and antitype, prophecy and fulfillment, preparation and consummation."
2. "The New Testament writers do not, however, use the Scriptures by way of accommodation; whenever a passage is explained by them as having a second fulfillment, as in the present case, that fulfillment is in accordance with the first, only fuller, broader, more spiritual." 
3. "God with us. Applied to Christ in the highest and most glorious sense: God incarnate among us, He is still Immanuel, God with us; once He came among men and identified himself with them; now He saves men and identifies them with Himself."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They shall call his name Immanuel, God with us."
2. "This is Matthew's explanation of the meaning of Immanuel, a descriptive appellation of Jesus Christ and more than a mere motto designation."
3. "God's help, Jesus=the Help of God, is thus seen."

### John Gill:
1. "The prophecy is introduced here as in Isaiah with a "behold!" not only to raise and fix the attention, but to denote that it was something wonderful and extraordinary which was about to be related."
2. "But the sign or wonder lay in this, that a "virgin" should "conceive" or "be with child"; for the Evangelist is to be justified in rendering, עלמה by παρθενος "a virgin"." 
3. "The difference between Isaiah and Matthew is very inconsiderable, it being in the one "thou shalt call", that is, thou virgin shalt call him by this name; and in the other ‘they shall call’, that is, Joseph, Mary, and others."

### John Wesley:
1. "To be called, only means, according to the Hebrew manner of speaking, that the person spoken of shall really and effectually be what he is called, and actually fulfil that title."
2. "He shall be all these, though not so much nominally, as really, and in effect."
3. "It is observable, the words in Isaiah are, Thou shalt call; but here, all his people shall call - shall acknowledge him to be Emmanuel, God with us."
