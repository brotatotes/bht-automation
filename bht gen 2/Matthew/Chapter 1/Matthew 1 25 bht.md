# Matthew 1:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The impression given by the text is that Joseph and Mary did not have a sexual relationship until after Jesus' birth. The use of the word till suggests a limited period of time. However, this does not imply that they had relations afterward. The term first-born simply signifies that Jesus was born of a pure virgin, not whether Mary had other children. Ultimately, the main point is the virginity of Mary until the birth of Jesus, highlighting Joseph's righteousness in a challenging situation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The prim√¢ facie impression on the reader certainly is, that Œø·ΩêŒ∫ ·ºêŒ≥ŒØŒΩœâœÉŒ∫ŒµŒΩ was confined to the period of time here mentioned."
2. "The words of this verse do not require it: the idiom being justified on the contrary hypothesis."
3. "It is characteristic, and historically instructive, that the great impugner of the view given above should be Jerome, the impugner of marriage itself."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The word 'till' does not necessarily imply that they lived on a different footing afterwards."
2. "The word 'first-born' does not decide the much-disputed question, whether Mary had any children to Joseph after the birth of Christ."
3. "The law, in speaking of the first-born, regarded not whether any were born after or no, but only that none were born before."

### Albert Barnes:

### John Calvin:
1. "Let us rest satisfied with this, that no just and well-grounded inference can be drawn from these words of the Evangelist, as to what took place after the birth of Christ."
2. "Certainly, no man will ever raise a question on this subject, except from curiosity; and no man will obstinately keep up the argument, except from an extreme fondness for disputation."
3. "He is called First-born, but for no other reason than that we may know that he was born of a pure virgin, and who never had had a child."

1. "The words answering to 'her' and 'first-born' are omitted by some of the best authorities. They may, however, have been left out to support the doctrine of the perpetual virginity of Mary."
