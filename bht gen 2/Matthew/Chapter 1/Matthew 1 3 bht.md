# Matthew 1:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The introduction of the names of Thamar, Rahab, Ruth, and Bathsheba in the genealogy of Christ serves as a reminder of their significance in the history of God's people. Thamar, though her actions were not commendable, is included in the lineage of the Messiah. Likewise, Rahab, a Gentile, is given honor in being mentioned, emphasizing the salvation that reaches beyond the boundaries of ethnicity. This genealogy humbles Jewish pride and magnifies the grace of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The reason for the women (Thamar, Rahab, Ruth, and Bathsheba) being mentioned, has been variously assigned: by Wets, ut tacitæ Judæorum objectioni occurreretur : by Fritzsche, for the sake of minute accuracy."
2. "It most probably is that given by Maldonatus: ‘Prætermisit Evangelista quod ordinarium erat, quod autem singulare et dubium exposuit.’"
3. "There may be something also in that suggested by Grotius: ‘Mulieres in hoc sensu obiter paucæ nominantur, extraneo ortiaut criminibus nobiles, quarum historia ad vocationem idololatrarum et criminosorum per Christi evangelium proludit.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Four women are here introduced; two of them Gentiles by birth—Rachab and Ruth; and three of them with a blot at their names in the Old Testament—Thamar, Rachab, and Bath-sheba."
2. "This feature in the present genealogy—herein differing from that given by Luke—comes well from him who styles himself in his list of the Twelve, what none of the other lists do, 'Matthew the publican'; as if thereby to hold forth, at the very outset, the unsearchable riches of that grace which could not only fetch in 'them that are afar off,' but teach down even to 'publicans and harlots,' and raise them to 'sit with the princes of his people.'"
3. "It will be observed that Rachab is here represented as the great-grandmother of David... a thing not beyond possibility indeed, but extremely improbable, there being about four centuries between them." (145 words)

### John Calvin:
1. "The Son of God might have kept his descent unspotted and pure from every reproach or mark of infamy. But he came into the world to 'empty himself, and take upon him the form of a servant.'" 
2. "Though Tamar was not impelled by lust to seek connection with her father-in-law, yet it was in an unlawful manner that she attempted to revenge the injury which she had received."
3. "The astonishing goodness of God strove with the sin of both; so that, nevertheless, this adulterous seed came to possess the scepter."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Jews and some commentators seek to excuse her, but the stain must be admitted."
2. "The mention of this name not only proves the correctness of the genealogy, but tends to humble Jewish pride and exalt the grace of God."

### John Gill:
1. "The line of the Messiah was in Phares, and very rightly is he put in the genealogy of Christ, the Jews themselves being witnesses; who expressly say, that 'the Messiah comes from him.'"
2. "Thamar, daughter-in-law to Judah...has the honour to be named in the genealogy of Christ, who came to save Gentiles as well as Jews."
3. "Esrom begat Aram...Esrom also besides him begat Jerahmeel, Chelubai, or Caleb, and Segub, but these are not in the line."

### John Wesley:
1. Of Thamar — St. Matthew adds the names of those women also, that were remarkable in the sacred history.
