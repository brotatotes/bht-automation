# Matthew 1:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Rahab, the woman of Jericho, demonstrated heroic faith and rose above her degradation. Despite her Canaanite nationality, she became a proselyte and welcomed the spies. Her marriage with Salmon, a mature man, resulted in the birth of Boaz, who played a significant role in Ruth's story. Notably, Rahab's lineage is connected to the Messiah, emphasizing the working of God's grace beyond Israel and foreshadowing the inclusion of the Gentiles. This genealogy is a testament to the providence of God, even though it spans a considerable interval of time.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It has been imagined, on chronological grounds, that this Rachab must be a different person from Rahab of Jericho. But those very grounds completely tally with their identity."
2. "Salmon would be of mature age at or soon after that event; at which time Rahab was probably young, as her father and mother were living."
3. "The difficulty of the interval of 366 years between Rahab and David does not belong to this passage only, but equally to Ruth 4:21-22; and is by no means insuperable, especially when the extreme old age of Jesse, implied in 1 Samuel 17:12, is considered."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Undoubtedly the woman of Jericho... by heroic faith she rose above her degradation." 
2. "The book which bears her name... is a recognition of the working of God’s grace outside of Israel, and a prophecy of the calling of the Gentiles."

### John Gill:
1. "To excuse this marriage with a Canaanitish woman, they tell us, she was not of the seven nations with whom marriage was forbid; and moreover, that she became a proselyte when the spies were received by her."
2. "And from Rahab sprung the Messiah, another instance of a Gentile in the genealogy of Christ."
3. "Jesse is rightly put among the progenitors of Christ, since the Messiah was to be a rod of his stem, and the branch of his roots, and is called the root of Jesse."

### John Wesley:
1. "The providence of God was peculiarly shown..."
2. "...Salmon, Boaz, and Obed, must each of them have been near a hundred years old..."
