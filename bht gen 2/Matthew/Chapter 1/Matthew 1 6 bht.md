# Matthew 1:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Messiah's lineage is traced back to David, the king who was chosen and anointed by God. David, though despised by his brothers and initially overlooked by his father, became the king of Israel. This designation of David the king emphasizes the significance of his throne, which would ultimately be inherited by the Messiah. It is notable that Bathsheba, who had been the wife of Uriah, is mentioned implicitly as the mother of Solomon. This highlights that, despite the guilt associated with their relationship, God used them as instruments in fulfilling His divine plan.
