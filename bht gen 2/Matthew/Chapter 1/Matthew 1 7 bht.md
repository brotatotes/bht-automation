# Matthew 1:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Three kings are omitted from the genealogy—Ahaziah, Joash, and Amaziah. These omissions were necessary to fit the genealogy into three groups of fourteen generations. The reason for these omissions may be due to religious considerations, such as their connection to the house of Ahab or their weaker lineage to be considered true links in the theocratic chain. In the lineage, Solomon is the father of Rehoboam who was born to Naamah, an Ammonitess. Rehoboam, also known as Abijam or Abijah, was the father of Asa, a virtuous king, whose mother may actually refer to his paternal grandmother.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Three kings are here omitted—Ahaziah, Joash, and Amaziah (1 Chronicles 3:11; 1 Chronicles 3:12)." 
2. "Some omissions behooved to be made, to compress the whole into three fourteens (Matthew 1:17)."
3. "The reason why these, rather than other names, are omitted, must be sought in religious considerations—either in the connection of those kings with the house of Ahab (as LIGHTFOOT, EBRARD, and ALFORD view it); in their slender right to be regarded as true links in the theocratic chain (as LANGE takes it); or in some similar disqualification."

### John Gill:
1. "And Solomon begat Roboam,.... Called Rehoboam, 1 Kings 11:43 of Naamah an Ammonitess, 1 Kings 14:21."
2. "And Roboam begat Abia, sometimes called Abijam, as in 1 Kings 14:31, sometimes Abijah, 2 Chronicles 12:16 and sometimes, as here, Abia, 1 Chronicles 3:10."
3. "And Abia begat Asa, who was a good king; his mother's name is the same with the name of his father's mother; and perhaps it is not his proper mother, but his grandmother who is meant in 1 Kings 15:10."
