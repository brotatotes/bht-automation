# Matthew 1:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This passage sheds light on the lineage of a virtuous prince, skipping three names between him and his father. These omissions might serve to condense the number of generations or due to the association with a cursed lineage. Nevertheless, the key message remains unchanged: Jesus, the true Messiah, is a descendant of David. It also emphasizes the idea of successive generations, as evident in the genealogy of Hezekiah's progeny. This passage illustrates the profound significance of ancestral ties and their enduring impact in the biblical narrative.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Some think that they were erased on account of their connection, by means of Athaliah, with the accursed house of Ahab."
2. "But more probably such erasion, even if justifiable by that reason, was not made on account of it, but for convenience, in order to square the numbers of the different portions of the genealogies, as here."
3. "It once contained the Catholic Epistles: 3Jn 1:11-14 in Latin is all that now remains."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Between Joram and Uzziah, three names are intentionally omitted: Ahaziah, Joash, and Amaziah, probably to reduce the number of generations."
2. "These three were chosen, either because personally unworthy, or because descendants to the fourth generation from Jezebel, through Athaliah."

### John Gill:
1. "He also was a very good prince."
2. "He was not the immediate son of Joram; there were three kings between them, Ahaziah, Joash, and Amaziah, which are here omitted."
3. "Nor does this omission at all affect the design of the Evangelist, which is to show that Jesus, the true Messiah, is of the house of David."

### John Wesley:
1. "Jehoram begat Uzziah â€” Jehoahaz, Joash, and Amaziah coming between. So that he begat him mediately, as Christ is mediately the son of David and of Abraham."
2. "So the progeny of Hezekiah, after many generations, are called the sons that should issue from him, which he should beget, Isaiah 39:7."
