# Matthew 1:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
King Hezekiah, a devout ruler, experienced the extraordinary blessing of having fifteen years of life added to his days by God. This sign of divine favor was bestowed upon a particularly religious king. Another significant prophecy that came to pass was the birth of the Messiah, which was foretold and fulfilled during the reign of King Ahaz. Furthermore, it is mentioned that the lineage of Jotham, the father of Ozias, can be traced through 2 Kings 15:7 and 2 Kings 15:33. These passages emphasize the significance of both God's intervention in the lives of kings and the fulfillment of long-awaited prophecies.
