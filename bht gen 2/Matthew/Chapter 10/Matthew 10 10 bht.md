# Matthew 10:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples were instructed to go forth without any extra provisions or belongings. They were not to have a change of clothing or carry any money or equipment with them. Their sole focus was on spreading the Gospel freely and not being burdened with material things. They were to trust that God would provide for their needs, as the workman is worthy of his sustenance. This passage reassures us that ministers are deserving of support from the people they serve, and it emphasizes the importance of relying on God's provision rather than relying on worldly possessions.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is a gross perversion and foolish bondage to the letter, to imagine that ministers of congregations, or even missionaries among the heathen, at this day are bound by the literal sense of our Lord’s commands in this passage."
2. "But we must not therefore imagine that they are not bound by the spirit of them."
3. "This literal first mission was but a foreshadowing of the spiritual subsequent sending out of the ministry over the world, which ought therefore in spirit every where to be conformed to these rules."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Take no change of dress, no additional articles."
2. "The true reading, however, evidently is 'a staff'—meaning, that they were not to procure even that much expressly for this missionary journey, but to go with what they had."
3. "For the workman is worthy of his meat—his 'food' or 'maintenance'; a principle which, being universally recognized in secular affairs, is here authoritatively applied to the services of the Lord's workmen."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "And every apostle who cometh to you, let him be received as the Lord; but he shall not remain except for one day; if, however, there be need, then the next day; but if he remain three days, he is a false prophet."
2. "Likewise a true teacher, he also is worthy like the workman, of his support. Every first-fruit... thou shalt take and give to the prophets, for they are your high-priests.... If thou makest a baking of bread, take the first of it and give according to the commandment. In like manner, when thou openest a jar of wine or oil, take the first of it and give to the prophets; and of money and clothing, and every possession, take the first, as may seem right to thee, and give according to the commandment."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ tells them, that they have no reason to dread that they will suffer hunger; because, wherever they come, they will at least be worthy of their food."
2. "He calls them laborers, not that they resembled ordinary ministers, who labor in the Lord's vineyard, but merely because they were the heralds of a richer and more complete doctrine."
3. "They did not at that time receive the office of preaching any farther than to render the Jews attentive to the preaching of the Gospel."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They were to be free from care, not seeking any profit from their office; outwardly unburdened, inwardly carrying the greatest treasures."
2. "Without money or luggage they would be most free from care, for the workman is worthy of his meat (or ‘sustenance’)."
3. "Those who ‘freely received’ from them are expected in their turn to ‘freely give.’"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "No wallet...can mean the beggar's collecting bag."
2. "The sermon is worth the dinner, in other words."
3. "The well-known Didach or Teaching of the Twelve shows that in the second century there was still a felt need for care on the subject of receiving pay for preaching."

### John Gill:
1. "They were not allowed change of raiment; either because superfluous, or too magnificent to appear in, or too troublesome to carry."
2. "Since they were to take neither money, nor provisions with them, and were also to preach the Gospel freely, they might reasonably ask how they should be provided for, and supported: when our Lord suggests, that they should not be anxiously concerned about that, he would take care that they had a suitable supply."
3. "So that this whole context is so far from militating against a minister's maintenance by the people, that it most strongly establishes it."

### John Wesley:
1. "Neither scrip — That is, a wallet, or bag to hold provisions: Nor yet a staff - We read, Mark 6:8, Take nothing, save a staff only."
2. "He that had one might take it; they that had none, might not provide any."
3. "For the workman is worthy of his maintenance — The word includes all that is mentioned in the9th and10th verses; Matthew 10:9,10 all that they were forbidden to provide for themselves, so far as it was needful for them."
