# Matthew 10:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When sending out the disciples, Jesus instructed them to seek those who are worthy, those who are open to receiving their message.

They were to make a deliberate and intentional choice, being discerning in their selection, rather than simply going wherever they pleased. By staying at the house of the worthy and open-hearted, the disciples could fulfill their mission and bring the message of salvation to more people.
