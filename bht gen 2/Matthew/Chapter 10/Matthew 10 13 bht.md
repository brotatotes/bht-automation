# Matthew 10:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostles were instructed to offer peace to the houses they entered, showing this by giving a welcome. If the house was deserving of this peace, it would come upon them as a blessing. However, if the house did not receive the peace, it would return to the apostles themselves. This principle applies to anyone who prays or wishes well for others. God will grant the peace to those who are worthy, but it will not be given to those who are not deserving.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The peace mentioned in the customary Eastern salutation שָׁלוֹם לָךְ." 
2. "The spirit of these commands binds Christian ministers to all accustomed courtesies of manner in the countries and ages in which their mission may lie."
3. "And this is to be without any respect to the worthiness or otherwise of the inhabitants of the house."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And if the house be worthy—showing this by giving you a welcome. let your peace come upon it—This is best explained by the injunction to the Seventy, 'And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this house.'" 
2. "This was the ancient salutation of the East, and it prevails to this day. But from the lips of Christ and His messengers, it means something far higher, both in the gift and the giving of it, than in the current salutation."
3. "But if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you—If your peace finds a shut, instead of an open, door in the heart of any household, take it back to yourselves, who know how to value it; and it will taste the sweeter to you for having been offered, even though rejected."

### John Calvin:
1. "As their ingratitude makes them unworthy to enjoy the blessing of God which you have supplicated for them, break off every bond of communication."
2. "The word peace refers to the mode of salutation which generally used among the Jews."
3. "I do acknowledge that the apostles brought to men a different kind of peace, but it is too great a refinement of speculation to make this passage refer to the free reconciliation which takes place between God and men."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The worthiness of the house is dependent on the worthiness of its head."
2. "Salutations are not necessarily unmeaning forms; nor should Christians make them such."
3. "Be content with having brought a blessing on yourselves by showing such a spirit and obeying my express command."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "Hospitality is one of the noblest graces and preachers receive their share of it."
3. "The apostles are not to be burdensome as guests."

### John Gill:
1. "The peace the apostles wished for, in their form of salutation, should come, and abide on the family."
2. "The house be blessed for their sake, and as a reward of their generosity and hospitality."
3. "The prayers and good wishes of the apostles shall be void, and of none effect, with respect to that family, but should be made good to themselves."
