# Matthew 10:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When encountering rejection, the apostles were instructed to shake off the dust of their feet as a symbolic gesture. This act, commonly practiced by Jews after returning from heathen countries, was meant to prevent the holy land from being polluted by the dust of those places. Similarly, by shaking off the dust, the apostles indicated that those who rejected the Gospel were no longer considered holy, but were now categorized with heathens and idolaters. Thus, this action demonstrated a separation and disassociation from those who refused to accept the message of the apostles.
