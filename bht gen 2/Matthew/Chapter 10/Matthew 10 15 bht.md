# Matthew 10:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The rejection of the Gospel message carries severe consequences, as those who reject it will receive more severe punishment than even the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah. The privileges and knowledge bestowed upon the Jews and professing Christians make their sins and subsequent torments greater. The day of judgment, mentioned in this passage, refers to the final judgment at the end of the world. These instructions from Christ to the Apostles serve as warnings and comforts for their ministry during persecutions, emphasizing the gravity of rejecting the Gospel.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The omission of the articles does not alter the definiteness of the meaning; as in the case also of υἱὸς θεοῦ."
2. "It must be noticed that this denunciatory part, as also the command to shake off the dust, applies only to the people of Israel, who had been long prepared for the message of the Gospel by the Law and the Prophets, and recently more particularly by John the Baptist."
3. "In this sense it may still apply to the rejection of the Gospel by professing Christians: but as it was not then applicable to the Gentiles, so neither now can it be to the heathen who know not God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "More tolerable...for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that city."

2. "And we need not wonder if Christ declares that they will be treated less severely than those who refuse to hear the gospel."
3. "Again, if God punishes so severely the despisers of the word, what shall become of furious enemies who, by blasphemies and a venomous tongue, oppose the gospel, or cruelly persecute it by fire and sword?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The higher the spiritual offer rejected, the greater the sin." 
2. "Applicable then only to the Jews with their light, now only to professing Christians, not to the heathen."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

### John Gill:
1. "The sins of those that are favored with the Gospel are greater than those who only have had the light of nature, and so their torments will be greater."
2. "The inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrha, though they sinned against the light of nature, despised the advice and admonitions of Lot, and ill treated the angels, yet will be more mildly punished than the wicked Jews, who rejected Christ, and his Gospel, and despised his apostles, and ministers."
3. "The time referred to, signified by 'the day of judgment', respects not the destruction of Jerusalem, which was a very severe judgment on that people, but the general judgment, at the end of the world, which is appointed and fixed by God, though unknown to angels and men."
