# Matthew 10:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples were sent out by the Lord, knowing that they would encounter opposition and persecution. They were compared to sheep in the midst of wolves, emphasizing their meekness and vulnerability. They were to be wise like serpents, using discernment and caution to navigate the challenges they faced, while still maintaining their innocence and harmlessness like doves. Even in the midst of a hostile world, they were to rely on God's guidance and protection, trusting in His power and sending.

### Henry Alford:
1. "ἐγώ is not without meaning. It takes up again the subject of their sending, and reminds them WHO sent them." (ἐγὼ ὁ πάντα δυνάμενος. Euthymius.)
2. "This comparison is used of the people of Israel in the midst of the Gentiles, in a Rabbinical work cited by Stier, p. 359: see also Sir 13:17. Clem. Ep. ad Cor. 2 § 5, vol. i. p. 336, Migne, says: λέγει γὰρ ὁ κύριος Ἔσεσθε ὡς ἀρνία ἐν μέσῳ λύκων." 
 
3. "ἀκέραιος, ὁ μὴ κεκραμένος κακοῖς, ἀλλʼ ἁπλοῦς καὶ ἀποίκιλος." (Etym. Mag. Meyer.)

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I send you forth—The 'I' here is emphatic, holding up Himself as the Fountain of the Gospel ministry, as He is also the Great Burden of it."
2. "be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves—Wonderful combination this!"
3. "In the apostolic age of Christianity, how harmoniously were these qualities displayed! Instead of the fanatical thirst for martyrdom, to which a later age gave birth, there was a manly combination of unflinching zeal and calm discretion, before which nothing was able to stand."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "As sheep in the midst of wolves - That is, I send you, inoffensive and harmless, into a cold, unfriendly, and cruel world. Your innocence will not be a protection."
2. "Be wise as serpents ... - Serpents have always been an emblem of wisdom and cunning. Probably the thing in which Christ directed his followers to imitate the serpent was in its caution in avoiding danger."
3. "He directs them, also, to be harmless, not to provoke danger, not to do injury, and thus make their fellow-men justly enraged against them. Doves are, and always have been, a striking emblem of innocence."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "It is I that send you forth."
2. "They were to imitate the serpent's wariness, but not his wiliness."
3. "The presence of the wolves demands they ye be wary; the fact that ye are my apostles demands that ye be guileless."

### John Calvin:
1. "It was advantageous for them to have previous warning, that any uneasiness which they might then suffer might be known to be a sort of preparative for a fiercer warfare to which they had been destined."
2. "The Lord sends the ministers of his word on the condition of dwelling in the midst of wolves; that is, of having many determined enemies and of being beset on every hand by many dangers."
3. "He bids them move forward honestly wherever their calling leads them. This is pointed out by a twofold comparison, wise as serpents, and harmless as doves."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "As sheep in the midst of wolves. Contrary to the order of nature, the meek and defenceless are sent among the fierce and cruel, their natural enemies."
2. "Be, or 'become,' ye therefore wise as serpents, and simple as doves. Like serpents, cautious in avoiding danger; like doves, in simplicity of motive (rather than in harmlessness). Wisdom to avoid persecution without cowardice, simplicity to encounter it without compromise."
3. "The spirit of Christ alone can combine these apparently antagonistic qualities of serpents and doves."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The presence of wolves on every hand was a fact then and now."
2. "The combination of wariness and innocence is necessary for the protection of the sheep and the discomfiture of the wolves."
3. "For 'harmless' (ακεραιο) Moffatt and Goodspeed have 'guileless,' Weymouth 'innocent.' The word means 'unmixed' (α privative and κεραννυμ), 'unadulterated,' 'simple,' 'unalloyed.'"

### John Gill:
1. "He compares them to 'sheep', because they were meek and humble in their spirits, harmless, and inoffensive, in their lives and conversations."
2. "The serpent is a very sharp sighted, cunning creature, and uses various arts and stratagems for its own preservation, and especially of its head; and is so far to be imitated by the followers of Christ, as to make use of all proper methods to preserve themselves from the insults and rage of men."
3. "...maintain the innocence and harmlessness of the dove, being free from all wicked cunning and craftiness, without rancour, malice, and wrath; not meditating and seeking revenge, but meek and humble in their deportment, leading inoffensive lives..."

### John Wesley:
1. Luke 10:3.
