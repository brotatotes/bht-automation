# Matthew 10:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage reveals that the disciples were not only to face trials before Jewish authorities, but also before Roman governors and kings. Although the Jewish sanhedrim still had some power, it was limited to lesser matters and punishments. Therefore, the disciples were compelled to bring their cases before the governors of the Roman provinces. However, they were not to be ashamed, for they were standing firm for Christ's sake, boldly professing their faith and preaching the Gospel.
