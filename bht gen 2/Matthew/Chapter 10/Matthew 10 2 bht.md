## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The leaders of the three classes are the same, viz. Peter, Philip, and James the (son?) of Alphœus; and the traitor is always last."
2. "Peter... prominent on various occasions before the rest... appears as the organ of the Apostles... unerring discernment and appointment of our Lord Himself..."
3. "So that πρῶτος here must be understood as signifying the prominence of Peter among the Apostles, as well as his early calling."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Our Evangelist, not intending to record the appointment, but only the Mission of the Twelve, gives their names here."
2. "And as in the Acts we have a list of the Eleven who met daily in the upper room with the other disciples after their Master's ascension until the day of Pentecost, we have four catalogues in all for comparison."
3. "James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother—named after James, as the younger of the two."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They agree in saying it was done on a mountain; and, according to Luke, it was done before the sermon on the mount was delivered, perhaps on the same mountain, near Capernaum."
2. "Simon, who is called Peter - The word 'Peter' means a rock. This name was given probably in reference to the 'resoluteness and firmness' which he was to exhibit in preaching the gospel."
3. "James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother - This James was killed by Herod in a persecution, Acts 12:2."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Apostles is the official term, used here for the first time. They were merely learners (disciples, maqhtai), until Christ gave them authority."
2. "An apostle is one sent forth."
3. "The word is once used of Christ (Hebrews 3:1), and in a very general sense to denote any one sent (2 Corinthians 8:23; Philippians 2:25)."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Church of Rome displays extreme folly in drawing from this passage their doctrine of the primacy."
2. "That Simon Peter was the first among the apostles we readily allow, but what was true in reference to a few persons, cannot, on any proper grounds, be extended to the whole world."
3. "Besides, the circumstance of his being mentioned first does not imply that he possessed authority over his companions."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "On its fuller meaning see Acts 1:2 ff."
2. "Peter was therefore personally, not officially, 'the first.'"
3. "John is generally considered the type of an affectionate character, as he was the bosom friend of the Lord."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The names of the twelve apostles. This is the official name used here by Matthew for the first time."
2. "Simon heads the list in all four lists including Acts 1:13. He came to be first and foremost at the great Pentecost."
3. "The apostles disputed a number of times as to which was greatest. Judas Iscariot comes last each time save that he is absent in Acts, being already dead."

### John Gill:
1. "This is the first time these disciples are called 'apostles', they were learners before; now being instructed, they are sent forth to preach publicly, and therefore are called apostles, or messengers, persons that were sent..."
2. "[Simon] is said to be the 'first'; not that he was the head of the rest of the apostles...but because he was first called, and was the first that was to open the door of faith to the Gentiles: but chiefly he is said to be so for order's sake..."
3. "These two were called next and together, and therefore are placed in this order: the former is so called, to distinguish him from another James, the son of Alphaeus, after mentioned; and the latter is the beloved disciple; these were surnamed 'Boanerges', that is, 'sons of thunder'."

### John Wesley:
1. The first, Simon — The first who was called to a constant attendance on Christ; although Andrew had seen him before Simon. Acts 1:13.
