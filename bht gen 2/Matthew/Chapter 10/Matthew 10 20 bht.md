# Matthew 10:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As the disciples prepared for their future mission, it became clear that their words would not be dictated by their own understanding or an angel, but by the Spirit of God. They were to be instruments of the Spirit, empowered to speak the message He inspired. This reminder strengthened their faith and expectation, knowing that the Spirit of God, who stood in the role of a loving and caring Father, would be with them, guiding, supporting, and speaking through them. The disciples were not alone; they had the assurance of the Father's presence through the indwelling Spirit.
