# Matthew 10:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As believers in Christ, we should not be surprised when we encounter hatred and opposition from those who do not know God. This animosity is not a result of our personal shortcomings, but rather arises from our association with Christ. It is a universal rejection that transcends time. However, we can find solace in the assurance that those who persevere through these challenges will experience salvation. This endurance serves as a testament to the authenticity of our faith and reflects our unwavering dedication to Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Throughout this discourse and the great prophecy in ch.24, we find the first apostolic period used as a type of the whole ages of the Church."
2. "These two subjects accompany and interpenetrate one another in a manner wholly inexplicable to those who are unaccustomed to the wide import of Scripture prophecy."
3. "But as certainly do all these expressions look onwards to the great final coming of the Lord, the Ï„Î­Î»Î¿Ï‚ of all prophecy; as certainly the ÏƒÏ‰Î¸Î®ÏƒÎµÏ„Î±Î¹ here bears its full scripture meaning, of everlasting salvation."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The universality of this hatred would make it evident to them, that since it would not be owing to any temporary excitement, local virulence, or personal prejudice, on the part of their enemies, so no amount of discretion on their part, consistent with entire fidelity to the truth, would avail to stifle that enmity."
2. "but he that endureth to the end shall be savedâ€”a great saying, repeated, in connection with similar warnings, in the prophecy of the destruction of Jerusalem ( :-); and often reiterated by the apostle as a warning against 'drawing back unto perdition.'"
3. "As 'drawing back unto perdition' is merely the palpable evidence of the want of 'root' from the first in the Christian profession, so 'enduring to the end' is just the proper evidence of its reality and solidity."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Ye shall be hated of all men - That is, of all kinds of people. The human heart would be opposed to them, because it is opposed to Christ."
2. "But he that endureth to the end ... - That is, to the end of life, be it longer or shorter. He that bears all these unspeakable sufferings, and who does not shrink and apostatize, will give decisive evidence of attachment to me, and shall enter into heaven."
3. "See Revelation 3:21-22."

### John Calvin:
1. "But he who endured to the end shall be saved... they are assured that the result will be prosperous and happy."
2. "If those who fight under earthly commanders...are carried forward even to death by steadiness of purpose, shall those who are certain of victory hesitate to abide by the cause of Christ to the very last?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Christianity of Christians, not their errors or personal faults, will call forth this hatred."
2. "The world has hated most those whom it was forced to respect and admire most."
3. "Perseverance to the end, however bitter, is the evidence of genuine faith."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Ye shall be hated... It will go on through the ages."
2. "For my name's sake... 'the name' as here stands for the person."
3. "He that endureth to the end."

### John Gill:
1. "This hatred they should be exposed to would not be on account of any ill will to their persons; or because of any evil or immorality committed by them; but purely, and alone, for the name of Christ..."
2. "Such persons are happy, who patiently endure the hatred of men, and all manner of persecution, for Christ's sake; who are not moved by the afflictions they suffer..."
3. "But he that endureth to the end, shall be saved: which words suggest that the tribulations and persecutions of the disciples of Christ, through the hatred of wicked men against them, shall not last always..."

### John Wesley:
1. Of all men â€” That know not God. Matthew 24:13.
