# Matthew 10:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples were instructed not to be disheartened by the persecution they may face in one place, but to persist in spreading the Gospel by taking it to other cities. They were assured that they will not exhaust the cities of Israel before the coming of the Son of Man, who would bring destruction upon their temple and nation. This emphasizes the urgency and continuity of their mission, as well as the certainty of the fulfillment of Christ's prophecies.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This, though applicable to all time, and exemplified by our Lord Himself once and again, had special reference to the brief opportunities which Israel was to have of 'knowing the time of His visitations.'" 
2. "'Waste not your time upon hostile places, for I Myself will be after you ere your work be over'—seems almost trifling."
3. "This, in the uniform language of Scripture, is more immediately 'the coming of the Son of man,' 'the day of vengeance of our God'—but only as being such a lively anticipation of His second coming for vengeance and deliverance."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The apostles were not permitted to 'throw away' their lives. Where they could preserve them without denying their Lord, they were to do it. Yet all the commands of Christ, as well as their conduct, show that they were rather to lay down their lives than deny their Saviour."
2. "We are to preserve our lives by all proper means, but we are rather to die than save ourselves by doing anything wrong."
3. "By 'the coming of the Son of Man,' that is, of 'Christ,' is probably meant the destruction of Jerusalem, which happened about thirty years after this was spoken."

### John Calvin:
1. "Though it may not be safe for them to remain in any place, yet Christ warns them not to despair, but, on the contrary, when they have been driven from one place, to try whether their labors in some other place may be of any avail."
2. "In short, the apostles are enjoined to enter into fresh contests, and not to imagine that, when they have succeeded in one or two cases, they have fully discharged their duty."
3. "Christ promises that he will come before they have traveled through the whole of Judea: that is, by the power of his Spirit, he will shed around his reign such luster, that the apostles will be enabled to discern that glory and majesty which they had hitherto been unable to discover."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Flight in persecution, from selfish regard to personal safety and comfort, is cowardice and sin; but flight from conscientious conviction of duty to God and to the Church, is commanded by Christ, and sanctioned by the conduct of the Apostles and martyrs."
2. "Before they finished their labors in Judea, the judgment impending over Jerusalem should come, and the old economy be entirely set aside... In general, there will always be a new sphere of labor for Christ’s people when excluded from the old one; this succession of opportunities will not cease until the end comes; the missionary work of the Church shall continue till the second coming of Christ."
3. "Till the Son of man be come, refers first of all to the destruction of Jerusalem, since the last verse pointed to that event. The more remote reference, however, is not excluded."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus could overtake them."
2. "Some refer it to the Transfiguration, others to the coming of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, others to the Second Coming."
3. "The use of εως with aorist subjunctive for a future event is a good Greek idiom."

2. "Nor need they fear going on too fast, lest they should have no places to preach in."
3. "You shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, or 'finished' them, till the son of man be come."
