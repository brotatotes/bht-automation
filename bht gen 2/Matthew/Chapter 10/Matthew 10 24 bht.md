# Matthew 10:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage reminds us that disciples should not expect a better fate than their Master, Jesus Christ, who himself faced persecution and suffering. Just as a servant should not expect to be treated better than their master, disciples should not be surprised if they face hardship and mistreatment. This message of shared experiences with Christ is meant to bring comfort and encourage disciples to persevere in the face of opposition.
