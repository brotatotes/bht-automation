# Matthew 10:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A disciple should be content and grateful if they face no worse treatment than their Master. If the master of the house was called Beelzebub, how much more will the household face similar accusations? It is important to recognize that this does not speak about the degree of reproach and persecution but solely about the certainty of it.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "A name by which the prince of the devils was called by the Jews, ch. Matthew 12:24, to which accusation, probably an usual one (see ch. Mat 9:34), and that in John 8:48, our Lord probably refers."
2. "In those places they had not literally called Him Beelzebub, but He speaks of their mind and intention in those charges."
3. "They may however have literally done so on other unrecorded occasions."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord." 
2. "Three relations in which Christ stands to His people are here mentioned: He is their Teacher—they His disciples; He is their Lord—they His servants; He is the Master of the household—they its inmates." 
3. "In all these relations, He says here, He and they are so bound up together that they cannot look to fare better than He, and should think it enough if they fare no worse."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Jesus calls himself 'the Master of the house,' and the Jews apply to him the corresponding title of the Devil."
2. "The Lord of the temple was to them the chief of idolatrous worship; the representative of God, that of the worst of demons."
3. "Beelzebul was Beelzibbul. What, then, might his household expect at their hands?"

### John Calvin:
1. "Though he bestows on them the honor of calling them brethren, yet he is the first-born and head of the whole church; and, in short, he possesses supreme government and power."
2. "Nothing, therefore, can be more unreasonable than to wish to be accounted believers, and yet to murmur against God when he conforms us to the image of his Son, whom he has placed over all his family."
3. "The general meaning is, that we carry our delicacy and tenderness to excess, if we account it a hardship to endure reproaches to which our Prince willingly submitted."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Beelzebul means either, (1) 'lord of dung,' the word being changed from Beelzebub to Beelzebul to admit of this contemptuous sense; or (2) 'lord of the habitation.'"
2. "Satan is referred to, but with a special reference to the indwelling of evil spirits in man; Satan being their lord."
3. "This view agrees with the allusions to a 'house' in connection with the casting out of devils in chap. Matthew 12:25; Matthew 12:29; Matthew 12:44-45."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "An opprobrious epithet; exact form of the word and meaning of the name have given more trouble to commentators than it is all worth" (Bruce).
2. "The etymology of the word is also unknown, whether 'lord of a dwelling' with a pun on 'the master of the house' (οικοδεσποτην) or 'lord of flies' or 'lord of dung' or 'lord of idolatrous sacrifices.'" 
3. "It is evidently a term of reproach."

### John Gill:
1. "A disciple should think himself very well off, be entirely satisfied, yea, abundantly thankful, if he meets with no worse treatment than his master."
2. "If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of the household?"
3. "Since their lord and master was called the prince of them."

### John Wesley:
1. "This cannot refer to the quantity of reproach and persecution: (for in this the servant cannot be above his lord:) but only to the certainty of it."
