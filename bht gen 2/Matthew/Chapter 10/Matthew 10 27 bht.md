# Matthew 10:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Preach boldly and fearlessly, declaring what I reveal to you in private. Do not hide or obscure the message, but proclaim it openly and without reserve. Just as their teachers whispered teachings to their disciples before speaking them aloud, you are to share the truth publicly, even from the rooftops of houses, ensuring the message reaches far and wide.
