# Matthew 10:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do not fear those who can only kill the body, but fear Him who has the power to destroy both body and soul in hell. It is important to remember that God should be the object of our fear, as He alone has the ability to bring destruction upon us for eternity. Even if we face opposition and threats in this life, we can take comfort in the fact that God's providence is at work, caring for His creation and ensuring our well-being.

"These words of Christ ought therefore to be explained in this manner: 'Acknowledge that you have received immortal souls, which are subject to the disposal of God alone, and do not come into the power of men.
