# Matthew 10:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Two sparrows are sold for a small amount in the markets, emphasizing their insignificance. This illustrates the doctrine of providence, where even the most minute and worthless creatures are under God's care. Our heavenly Father, who is aware of sparrows and their worth, is also aware and cares for us, His children. Nothing is left to chance, as even the smallest details are directed by God's will.
