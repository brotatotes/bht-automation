# Matthew 10:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Lebbeus, known also as Judas and the brother of James, is one of the lesser-known disciples mentioned in the Bible. His name may not be as familiar to us, but his significance lies in his close relationship with James and his association with the writer of the Epistle of Jude. Despite his relative obscurity among the Twelve, Lebbeus plays an important role in the broader narrative of Jesus' ministry and the spread of the early Christian message.
