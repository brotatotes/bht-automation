# Matthew 10:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's knowledge and care are unparalleled, as even the hairs on our heads are known and numbered by Him. Every aspect of our lives is in His providential hands, and nothing is too insignificant for His attention. The meticulous care extends to His dear children and faithful servants, assuring us that not a hair shall be lost or go unnoticed. We can take comfort in knowing that even the smallest details are under the watchful eye of our Sovereign God.
