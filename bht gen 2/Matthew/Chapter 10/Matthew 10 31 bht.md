# Matthew 10:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Fear not, for you are of more value than many sparrows. The simplicity of these words carries great weight. In the sight of God, who is our Father, we hold immense value, higher than what we derive from mere creation. Even the humblest creatures hold value in His sight, so how much more do human beings, especially Christians and witnesses of Jesus? We can take comfort knowing that our Father safeguards us, and we should not fear men. Let us boldly proclaim the truth we have received from our Master, who also suffered at the hands of men.
