# Matthew 10:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who openly acknowledge and receive Jesus as the promised Messiah, obeying his teachings and commandments, will be confessed by him before the Father. However, those who deny Jesus before others will face the temptation to disown him. It is important to remember that the purpose of Jesus' coming was not to bring immediate universal peace, as his Gospel can create division even among families. This highlights the opposition from both spiritual and human adversaries that may arise when the power of the Gospel is proclaimed.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Lord will not confess the confessing Judas, nor deny the denying Peter; the traitor who denied Him in act is denied: the Apostle who confessed Him even to death will be confessed." 
2. "We may observe that both in the Sermon on the Mount (ch. Mat 7:21-23) and here, after mention of the Father, our Lord describes Himself as the Judge and Arbiter of eternal life and death."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "Him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven—I will not be ashamed of him."
3. "But will own him before the most august of all assemblies."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Confess me [ομολογησει εν εμοι] . A peculiar but very significant expression. Lit., 'Confess in me.' The idea is that of confessing Christ out of a state of oneness with him."
2. "The true confessor of Christ is one whose faith rests in him. Observe that this gives great force to the corresponding clause, in which Christ places himself in a similar relation with those whom he confesses."
3. "It shall be as if I spoke abiding in him. 'I in them and thou in me, that they may be perfected into one, and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them as thou hast loved me' (John 17:23)."

### John Calvin:
1. "For this purpose the disciples of Christ must be bold and courageous, that they may be always ready for martyrdom."
2. "Now confession of Christ, though it is regarded by the greater part of men as a trifling matter, is here represented to be a main part of divine worship, and a distinguished exercise of godliness."
3. "In other words, he intends that the profession of his name shall be set in opposition to false religions: and as it is a revolting matter, he enjoins the testimony which we must bear, that the faith of each person may not remain concealed in the heart, but may be openly professed before men."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Shall confess me" (ομολογησε εν εμο). An Aramaic idiom, not Hebrew, see also Luke 12:8.
2. So also here, "him will I also confess" (ομολογησω κ'αγω εν αυτω).
3. Literally this Aramaic idiom reproduced in the Greek means "confess in me," indicating a sense of unity with Christ and of Christ with the man who takes the open stand for him.

### John Gill:
1. "It is not enough to believe in him, with the heart, but confession of him must also be made with the mouth; and which lies in ascribing their whole salvation to him, giving him the glory of it; declaring their faith in him to others, and what he has done for their souls."
2. "Such a free and open confession of Christ ought to be made by all his ministers before men, and in spite of all the rage and opposition of earth and hell."
3. "He will introduce them into his Father's presence, and recommend them to him, to be honoured, blessed, and glorified by him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Whosoever shall confess me — Publicly acknowledge me for the promised Messiah. But this confession implies the receiving his whole doctrine, Mark 8:38, and obeying all his commandments." 
2. "Whosoever shall deny me before men — To which ye will be strongly tempted. For Think not that I am come - That is, think not that universal peace will be the immediate consequence of my coming. Just the contrary."
3. "Both public and private divisions will follow, wheresoever my Gospel comes with power. Ye — this is not the design, though it be the event of his coming, through the opposition of devils and men."
