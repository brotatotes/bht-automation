# Matthew 10:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To deny Christ is not simply to refuse being associated with Him, but to reject Him as one's Lord and master. It is the complete breach, where one denies being a disciple of Christ and hides or opposes the truths about His person, office, and grace. Such denial is not a mere social breach but a serious offense. Consequently, Christ will deny those who deny Him before others, disapproving and proclaiming His indignation against them, declaring them to be workers of iniquity.
