# Matthew 10:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ's ministry brings about a conquest over evil and division in families and communities. The peace that Christ brings is not of this world, but rather a triumph over Satan and the result of His work on the cross. While the Gospel separates believers from the world, this division is not the purpose of Christ's coming, but rather an inevitable outcome due to the wickedness of men. Therefore, those who follow Christ should not expect worldly ease and tranquility, but rather should be prepared for divisions and conflicts arising from their faith.

### Henry Alford:
1. "As He won His way to victory through the contradiction of sinners and strife, so must those who come after Him."
2. "The immediate reference is to the divisions in families owing to conversions to Christianity."

2. "Meanwhile there will be inevitably division in families, in communities, in states."
3. "The Cross is Christ's answer to the devil's offer of compromise in world dominion."

### John Gill:

2. "the Gospel, which is the means of dividing and separating the people of Christ from the men of the world, and from their principles and practices, and one relation from another"
