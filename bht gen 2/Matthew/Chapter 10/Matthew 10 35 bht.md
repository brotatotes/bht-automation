# Matthew 10:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Gospel brings a radical division into households, affecting the very foundation of domestic relations. Christ warns that the world will reach a state of confusion, where the bonds of kinship will be treated with indifference. It is tragic to see family members stepping between their loved ones and their faith in Christ. However, this division does not arise due to the fault of the Gospel, but rather through the natural enmity and opposition towards anything divine or spiritual. Loyalty to Christ and righteous living should never be hindered by family or social ties.
