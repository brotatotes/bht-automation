# Matthew 10:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
And a man's foes shall be they of his own household. This warns us of the potential for betrayal and opposition that may arise even from those closest to us. The reference to Micah 7:6 further emphasizes that these foes can include one's own children and servants, individuals who should typically be loyal and supportive. This somber portrayal aligns with the experiences of the prophet and the generation in which Christ lived, where conflicts and strifes were prevalent.
