# Matthew 10:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage emphasizes the need to prioritize our love for Christ above all earthly relationships. While it doesn't require us to completely disregard our family and friends, it highlights the importance of regulating our love for them in comparison to our devotion to Christ. If we allow our affections for others to overshadow our love for Christ, we are not truly worthy of Him. Instead, we must resist any love that hinders us from fully following Christ, as genuine love for Him entails obedience above all else.
