# Matthew 10:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To be a disciple of Christ means being prepared to face afflictions, reproaches, and even death itself. This figurative expression of taking up the cross signifies the willingness to endure whatever burdens and trials come our way without compromising our faith. Each disciple has their own unique cross to bear, appointed by God. Bearing the cross involves faithfully carrying out our duties as commanded in Scripture, regardless of how it may be perceived or what hardships it may bring. If we are not willing to embrace the cross, we are not worthy of being called disciples of Christ.
