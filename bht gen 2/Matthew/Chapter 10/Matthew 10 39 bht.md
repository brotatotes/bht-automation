# Matthew 10:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He that finds his life by denying me, shall ultimately lose it forever; and he that loses his life by confessing me, shall ultimately save it eternally. Just as those who confess and endure persecution for Christ's sake shall be rewarded, those who support and welcome them will also be blessed.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The first ψυχή is the life of this world, which we here all count so dear to us; the second, implied in αὐτήν, the real life of man in a blessed eternity."
2. "But besides the primary meaning of this saying as regards the laying down of life literally for Christ’s sake, we cannot fail to recognize in it a far deeper sense, in which he who loses his life shall find it."
3. "Thus we have the crucifying of the life of this world, the death to sin spoken of Romans 6:4-11, and life unto God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it." - another of those pregnant sayings which our Lord so often reiterates (Matthew 16:25; Luke 17:33; John 12:25).
2. The pith of such paradoxical maxims depends on the double sense attached to the word "life"—a lower and a higher, the natural and the spiritual, the temporal and eternal.
3. An entire sacrifice of the lower, with all its relationships and interests—or, a willingness to make it which is the same thing—is indispensable to the preservation of the higher life; and he who cannot bring himself to surrender the one for the sake of the other shall eventually lose both.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He that is anxious to save his 'temporal' life, or his comfort and security here, shall lose 'eternal' life, or shall fail of heaven."
2. "He that is willing to risk or lose his comfort and 'life' here for my sake, shall find 'life' everlasting, or shall be saved."
3. "The manner of speaking is similar to that where he said, 'Let the dead bury their dead.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Our Lord looked back in thought to each man's past, and forward to its appropriate consummation in the future."
2. "He who is truly a man ought not to care about living a certain time: he knows, as women say, that we must all die, and therefore he is not fond of life; he leaves all that with God, and considers in what way he can best spend his appointed term."
3. "Who knows if life be not death, and death life?"

### John Calvin:
1. "He affirms that persons of excessive caution and foresight, when they look upon themselves as having very well defended their life, will be disappointed and will lose it; and, on the other hand, that those who disregard their life will sustain no loss, for they will recover it."
2. "We know that there is nothing which men will not do or leave undone for the sake of life, (so powerful is that attachment to it which is natural to us all;) and, therefore, it was necessary that Christ should employ such promises and threatenings in exciting his followers to despise death."
3. "When believers surrender themselves to die, their soul, which appears to vanish in a moment, passes into a better life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Life is here used in two senses; otherwise the paradoxical statement would have no meaning at all."
2. "The meaning is: Christ must be loved more than life itself."
3. "He gave His life for us, and therefore asks us to give our lives for Him."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Shall lose it." This paradox appears in four forms according to Allen.
2. "It is one of the profound sayings of Christ that he repeated many times."
3. "The article and aorist participles here are timeless in themselves."

### John Gill:
1. "He that findeth his life shall lose it.... yet he is sure to lose the happy and eternal life of his soul and body."
2. "he that loseth his life for my sake, shall find it. That man that is willing to forego the present advantages of life, to suffer reproach and persecution, and lay down his life cheerfully for the sake of Christ and his Gospel... shall find his soul possessed of eternal life, as soon as separated from his body."
3. "and shall find his corporal life again, in the resurrection morn, to great advantage; and shall live with Christ in soul and body, in the utmost happiness, to all eternity."

### John Wesley:
1. "He that saves his life by denying me, shall lose it eternally; and he that loseth his life by confessing me, shall save it eternally." 
2. "And as you shall be thus rewarded, so in proportion shall they who entertain you for my sake."
