## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This is not a local name, but is derived from קַנִאָן (Hebr. קַנָּא ) = ζηλωτής (Luke, Gosp. and Acts). We may therefore suppose that before his conversion he belonged to the sect of the Zealots, who after the example of Phinehas ( Num 25:7-8 ) took justice into their own hands, and punished offenders against the law."
2. "Son of Simon (John 6:71 ; ( Mat 12:4 v. r.) Matthew 13:2 ; Mat 13:26 ). Probably a native of Kerioth in Juda, Joshua 15:25 , אִישׁ קְרִיּוֹת , a man of Kerioth, as ἴστοβος , i.e. אִישׁ טוֹב , a man of Tob, Joseph. Antt. vii. 6. 1."
3. "That the name ἴσκ . cannot be a surname, as Bp. Middleton supposes, the expression Ἰούδας Σίμωνος ἰσκαριώτης , used in all the above places of John, clearly proves."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Simon, called the Zealot." The word "Kananite" is just the Aramaic, or Syro-Chaldaic, term for "Zealot."
2. "Judas of Kerioth, a town of Judah." so called to distinguish him from "Judas the brother of James" (Luke 6:16).
3. "The first part contains directions for the brief and temporary mission on which they were now going forth, with respect to the places they were to go to, the works they were to do, the message they were to bear, and the manner in which they were to conduct themselves."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Simon the Canaanite - Luke calls him 'Simon Zelotes,' the zealous. It is probable that he was one of a small sect of the Jews called 'Zealots,' on account of special zeal in religion."
2. "Judas Iscariot - It is probable this name was given to him to designate his native place. Carioth was a small town in the tribe of Judah."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word has nothing to do with Canaan." 
2. "Both terms indicate his connection with the Galilaean Zealot party, a sect which stood for the recovery of Jewish freedom and the maintenance of distinctive Jewish institutions." 
3. "From the Hebrew kanna, zealous; compare the Chaldee kanan, by which this sect was denoted."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Zealots were a sect of strict Jews, who afterwards became fierce fanatics."
2. "The choice of this man remains a part of the great mystery concerning God’s sovereignty and man’s free choice."
3. "They had fair natural abilities, a teachable disposition, and the common religious education."

### John Gill:
1. "The former of these is called Simon the Canaanite, to distinguish him from Simon Peter, before mentioned...but he was one of the קנאים, 'Kanaim', or 'Zealots'; and therefore Luke styles him, 'Simon called Zelotes'."
2. "Judas, the last of the twelve, is called Iscariot...some think that he belonged to the tribe of Issachar...others, that he takes his name from the place he belonged to, and that he was called איש קריות, 'a man of Kerioth'...Others think he is so called, from the Syriac word, סכריוטא, 'secariota', which signifies a 'purse', or bag, because he carried the bag."
3. "We learn from hence, that in the purest society on earth there has been an impure person...a man may have the highest gifts and attainments, as Judas had, ministerial gifts, and power of performing miracles, and yet be a vile person." (150 words)

### John Wesley:
1. Iscariot — So called from Iscarioth, (the place of his birth,) a town of the tribe of Ephraim, near the city of Samaria.
