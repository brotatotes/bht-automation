# Matthew 10:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By receiving the disciples of Christ, one is not only providing them with housing and food, but also welcoming the message of Christ into their heart and life. The disciples are representatives of Christ Himself, and any kindness or acceptance shown to them is seen as an act done to Him personally. Furthermore, receiving the disciples is equivalent to receiving God Himself, as they carry His authority and message. Therefore, embracing the messengers of Christ is not only a gesture of hospitality, but also an opportunity to experience the presence and blessing of God in one's life.
