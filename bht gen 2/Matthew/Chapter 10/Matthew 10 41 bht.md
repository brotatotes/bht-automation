# Matthew 10:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Whoever receives a prophet or a righteous person as they are, acknowledging their divine appointment or righteousness, will be rewarded with the blessedness and everlasting reward that these states bring. This means doing good to them out of reverence for their message or out of respect for their piety. The reward received corresponds to the rank and importance of the person to whom the kindness is shown. Even the smallest acts of kindness shown to Christ's disciples, referred to as little ones, will not go unnoticed and will be rewarded.
