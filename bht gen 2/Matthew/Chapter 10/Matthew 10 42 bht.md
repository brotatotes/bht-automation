# Matthew 10:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Whoever shows kindness to even the least of these believers, receives them into their home and offers them the smallest act of help or support, will not go unnoticed. Jesus teaches that such acts of compassion, no matter how insignificant they may seem, are regarded highly in the eyes of God. In fact, even the smallest act, like offering a cup of cold water, done with the heart of a disciple, will not go unrewarded by Christ Himself. Thus, we are reminded that our actions towards the least among us are ultimately an offering to Christ Himself.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "To whom this applies is not very clear. Hardly (De Wette) to the despised and meanly-esteemed for Christ‚Äôs sake."
2. "I should rather imagine some children may have been present; for of such does our Lord generally use this term, see ch. Matthew 18:2-6."
3. "The expression may be meant of lower and less advanced converts, thus keeping up the gradation from œÄœÅŒøœÜŒÆœÑŒ∑œÇ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Beautiful epithet! Originally taken from Zechariah 13:7. The reference is to their lowliness in spirit, their littleness in the eyes of an undiscerning world, while high in Heaven's esteem."
2. "Meaning, the smallest service."
3. "There is here a descending climax - 'a prophet,' 'a righteous man,' 'a little one'; signifying that however low we come down in our services to those that are Christ's, all that is done for His sake, and that bears the stamp of love to His blessed name, shall be divinely appreciated and owned and rewarded."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "An allusion to their weakness in themselves as they went out on their mission."
2. "The smallest kindness."
3. "A solemn declaration that for such an act, he shall in no wise, lose his reward."

### John Gill:
1. "Whosoever takes notice but of 'one' of these, receives him into his house, and gives him a cup of cold water only, is regarded, a phrase used to express the least favour, or benefit whatever."
2. "Now whosoever takes notice of, and shows favour to the meanest of Christ's people, though it be but bestowing so small a benefit as a cup of cold water; yet, if it is done in the name of a disciple, or because that poor person is a disciple of Christ, verily, says Christ, I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward."
3. "It will be observed another day by Christ, who takes what is done to the least of his brethren, as done to himself."

### John Wesley:
1. One of these little ones ‚Äî The very least Christian. Mark 9:41.
