# Matthew 10:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The mission of the Apostles was to prepare the way for the Gospel, including instructions for ministers throughout time. This included the unique relationship between Jews, Gentiles, and Samaritans. The prohibition against preaching to Gentiles and Samaritans was temporary, to give priority to the Jews. The diverse background of the Samaritans, who adopted the Jewish religion with modifications, influenced this decision. The lifting of the prohibition was foretold, with the Apostles being instructed to witness in various regions. The unique mention of Judas Iscariot and the organization of the Apostles' lists further emphasizes the significance of their mission.
