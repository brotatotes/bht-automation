# Matthew 10:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The miracles performed by the disciples were not meant to be sold, but rather to confirm their divine mission and the truth of their teachings. They were instructed to freely give the power and grace they had received from God to others. These miracles displayed the power of Christ, who came to bestow blessings, heal diseases, and deliver humanity from their miseries. The purpose was to show that these acts could not be replicated by human skill alone and to demonstrate the work of God in the world.
