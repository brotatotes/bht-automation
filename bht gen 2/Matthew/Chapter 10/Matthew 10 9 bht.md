# Matthew 10:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They were instructed not to carry any additional provisions for their journey, relying solely on what they already had. They were specifically forbidden from acquiring any gold, silver, or brass, not even the smaller copper coins. Additionally, they were not to carry these provisions in their purses or girdles, as was customary for travelers. This was a deliberate lesson in trust and dependence on God, teaching them to prioritize spiritual matters over material concerns.
