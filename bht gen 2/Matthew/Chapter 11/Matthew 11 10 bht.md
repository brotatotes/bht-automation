The prophecy in Malachi 3:1 is a significant indication of the eternal and co-equal Godhead of Jesus, as it portrays a change in person from Jehovah to the Messiah. This change highlights the high honor and dignity of the Baptist, who was the forerunner of Christ. The quoted prophecy in Malachi 3:1 is also referenced by the three Evangelists, with a slight alteration, emphasizing the importance of John the Baptist as the one who prepares the way for the Messiah.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Our Lord here changes the person of the original prophecy, which is μου. And that He does so, making that which is said by Jehovah of Himself, to be addressed to the Messiah, is, if such were needed, no mean indication of His own eternal and co-equal Godhead."
2. "It is worthy of remark that all three Evangelists quote this prophecy similarly changed, although St. Mark has it in an entirely different place."
3. "The high dignity and honour which our Lord here predicates of the Baptist has a further reference: He was thus great above all others, because he was the forerunner of Christ."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "For this is he ... - The passage of Scripture here quoted is found in Malachi 3:1."
2. "The substance of it is contained also in Isaiah 40:3."
3. "Prepare thy way - That is, to prepare 'the people'; to make them ready, by proper instructions, to receive the Messiah."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "The original prophecy is: ‘Behold I send my messenger before my face,’ etc. (The latter part of the verse contains a direct reference to the Messiah.)"
3. "Here, and in Mark 1:2, Luke 7:27, it is changed into a promise of God to Christ Our Lord on His own authority (Matthew 11:9: ‘I say unto you’), applies the phrase,’ my messenger,’ to John, and the word ‘thy’ to Himself, thus appropriating a pronoun referring to God."

### John Gill:
1. "That these words belong לעולם הבא, to the world to come, or the times of the Messiah, that is, the Gospel dispensation, the Jews themselves own."
