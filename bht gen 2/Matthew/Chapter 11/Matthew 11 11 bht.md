# Matthew 11:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
John the Baptist, though heralded as the greatest among those born of women, is surpassed in privilege by the least in the kingdom of heaven. His role as the forerunner of Christ granted him preeminence, but the apostles, with their firsthand exposure to Jesus' teachings, possessed more correct apprehensions of the Gospel. The teachers who followed John were elevated to demonstrate the surpassing majesty of the Gospel. The least in the kingdom of heaven, including ministers of the Gospel, may have less faith than John, but their preaching is superior as it proclaims Christ's complete and eternal satisfaction.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He that is least in the kingdom of heaven, is greater than he." 
2. "John, the nearest to the King and the Kingdom, standing on the threshold but never having himself entered; these, ·ºêŒΩ œÑ·øá Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπŒªŒµŒØ·æ≥, subjects and citizens and indwellers of the realm, ·ΩßŒΩ œÑ·Ω∏ œÄŒøŒªŒØœÑŒµœÖŒºŒ± ·ºêŒΩ Œø·ΩêœÅŒ±ŒΩŒø·øñœÇ." 
3. "He, the friend of the Bridegroom; they, however weak and unworthy members, His Body, and His Spouse."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Among them that are born of women - This is an emphatic way of saying that there 'had never' been a greater 'man' than John." 
2. "He that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he - It could hardly be affirmed of the obscurest and most ignorant Christian that he had clearer views than Isaiah or John; but of the apostles of the Saviour, of the first preachers who were with him and who heard his instructions, it might be said that they had more correct apprehensions than any of the ancient prophets, or than John."

### John Calvin:
1. "Such too is the import of Malachi‚Äôs prediction, (Malachi 3:1), which is immediately added, that the pre-eminence of John consisted in his being the herald and forerunner of Christ."
2. "Again, the teachers who were afterwards to follow are placed above him, to show the surpassing majesty of the Gospel above the Law, and above that preaching which came between them."
3. "He that is least in the kingdom...all the ministers of the Gospel are included. Many of them undoubtedly have received a small portion of faith, and are therefore greatly inferior to John; but this does not prevent their preaching from being superior to his, because it holds out Christ as having rendered complete and eternal satisfaction by his one sacrifice, as the conqueror of death and the Lord of life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Only One could thus speak concerning the greatest ‚Äòborn of women.‚Äô"
2. "A greater. No one, patriarch or prophet, king or priest, was greater; for John was the forerunner of Christ. Relation to Christ is the true measure of greatness."
3. "Those born of the Spirit are greater than the greatest born of women. The relation to Christ is still more intimate, and that determines the relative greatness."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He surely means that John is greater (ŒºŒµŒπŒ∂œâŒΩ) than all others in character, but that the least in the kingdom of heaven surpasses him in privilege."
2. "John is the end of one age, 'until John' (Matthew 11:14), and the beginning of the new era."
3. "All those that come after John stand upon his shoulders. John is the mountain peak between the old and the new."

### John Gill:
1. "Among them that are born of women, there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist."
2. "Notwithstanding, he that is least in the kingdom of heaven, is greater than he."
3. "The comparison does not lie so much between their persons, as their several different degrees of light and doctrine."

### John Wesley:
1. "One perfect in the law, as John was, is inferior to one who is baptized into the death of Christ."
2. "Whosoever, therefore, is least in the kingdom of heaven, by Christian regeneration, is greater than any who has attained only the righteousness of the law, because the law maketh nothing perfect."
3. "The least true Christian believer has a more perfect knowledge of Jesus Christ, of his redemption and kingdom, than John the Baptist had, who died before the full manifestation of the Gospel."
