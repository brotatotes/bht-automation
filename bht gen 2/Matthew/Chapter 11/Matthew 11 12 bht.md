### John Calvin:
1. "It appears, therefore, that the Gospel, which comes forward in a manner so sudden and extraordinary, and awakens powerful emotions, must have proceeded from God."
2. "The meaning therefore is, A vast assembly of men is now collected, as if men were rushing violently forward to seize the kingdom of God; for, aroused by the voice of one man, they come together in crowds, and receive, not only with eagerness, but with vehement impetuosity, the grace which is offered to them."

2. "It was attended with the demonstration of the Spirit, and of power; as appeared by its being the means of quickening persons that were dead in trespasses and sins; enlightening the blind; causing the deaf to hear; melting and softening hearts of stone..."
3. "The violent take it by force; meaning...who were under violent apprehensions of wrath and vengeance, of their lost and undone state and condition by nature; were violently in love with Christ, and eagerly desirous of salvation by him, and communion with him; and had their affections set upon the things of another world."

### John Wesley:
1. "From the days of John... men rush into my kingdom with a violence like that of those who are taking a city by storm."
