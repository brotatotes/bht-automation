# Matthew 11:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
John's preaching marked a significant transition from the old dispensation to the new. The laws and prophecies of the Old Testament represented God through figures and shadows, but John introduced a new dispensation by proclaiming the arrival of the kingdom of heaven. His message pointed directly to the person of Christ, who fulfilled what was previously foretold in the law and the prophets. With John's ministry, the old dispensation reached its completion, and the new dispensation began, bringing about the fulfillment of God's promises.
