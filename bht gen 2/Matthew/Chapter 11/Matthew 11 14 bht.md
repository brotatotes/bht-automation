# Matthew 11:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
And if you are willing to receive it, this is Elijah who is to come. The Jews, having an incorrect notion about the prophecy, expected Elijah to rise from the dead. However, Jesus affirms that John the Baptist is the fulfillment of this prophecy, being appointed by God to come and to prepare the way for the Messiah. This truth may have been difficult for some to accept, but Jesus emphasizes that it is a certain and undeniable reality.
