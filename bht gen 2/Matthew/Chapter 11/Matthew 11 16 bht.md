# Matthew 11:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people of that particular time were obstinate and contrary, refusing to accept any teachings or messages from John the Baptist or Christ Himself. They were like children in a marketplace, calling out to their friends to play or mourn, yet being so stubborn and sour that they did neither. Instead, it was John, Christ, and their disciples who resembled innocent and simple children, not the adults who were set in their ways and resistant to the truth.

3. "The great condescension of the preaching of the Gospel is shown forth in this parable, where the man sent from God, and the eternal Word Himself, are represented as children among children, speaking the language of their sports."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He pictured a group of little children playing at make-believe marriages and funerals. First they acted a marriage procession; some of them piping as on instruments of music, while the rest were expected to leap and dance."
2. "So the disappointed children complained: 'We piped unto you and ye did not dance; we wailed, and ye did not mourn. Nothing pleases you. If you don't want to dance, why don't you mourn?'"
3. "Marketplaces [αγοραις]. From ajgeirw, to assemble...The primary conception in the Greek word has nothing to do with buying and selling. Agora is an assembly; then the place of assembly."

2. "It is like unto children sitting in the markets, and calling to their fellows: that is, the case of such persons may be fitly represented by children in a public market, calling to their companions, to pipe or mourn with them, and who are so morose and sullen as to do neither."
3. "For the men of that generation, are not the good-natured children, that called to their fellows, and were willing to join in innocent diversions and exercises; but rather John the Baptist, Christ and his disciples, who may be compared to 'children', for their harmlessness and simplicity."

### John Wesley:
1. This generation — That is, the men of this age. They are like those froward children of whom their fellows complain, that they will be pleased no way.
