# Matthew 11:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, the different characters and ministries of John and Christ are being described. John is portrayed as the one mourning, representing his serious and somber message, while Christ is depicted as the one piping, symbolizing the joyful and comforting ministry of the Gospel. The recipients of their ministries are referred to as the fellows to whom they ministered, the Scribes and Pharisees, who were indifferent and unaffected by both John and Christ's messages. This passage highlights the contrast between the serious and joyful aspects of their ministries and the indifference of those who heard them.

1. Mourn [εκοψασθε] . Lit., beat or strike (the beast), as in oriental funeral lamentations.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The children calling, represent John and Jesus, but these two earnest preachers would not be likened to idling, petulant children, and in that case the ‘mourning’ ought to precede the ‘piping.’" 
2. "Those who will not play represent the two preachers, but this is opposed to the word ‘fellows’ or ‘companions’ in Matthew 11:16, as well as to the parallel passage in Luke (Luke 7:32), where the children are spoken of as ‘calling to one another.’ All the children were petulant."
3. "The whole company of children represent the Jews, engaged in the childish pursuits of amusement and showing disagreement, discontent, and petulance. With these ‘children’ the children of wisdom are contrasted (Luke)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He has really created the modern child's world out of the indifference of the past."
2. "These metaphors in the Gospels are vivid to those with eyes to see."
3. "Even today with all the automobiles children play in the streets."

### John Gill:
1. "The different characters of John and Christ, are here set forth, by 'piping' and 'mourning'."
2. "The character and ministry of Christ and his disciples, by 'piping'; by which is meant, the clear, comfortable, and joyful ministry of the Gospel."
3. "On the other hand, by the 'fellows' to whom they piped, or ministered, in their different ministrations, are meant, the Scribes and Pharisees; who were neither affected to, nor with, either of them."
