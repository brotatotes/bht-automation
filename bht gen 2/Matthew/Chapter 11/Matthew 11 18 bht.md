# Matthew 11:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The rejection of John's preaching and his message is implied in several places of the Gospels. John came in a peculiar manner, neither eating bread nor drinking wine, but living on locusts and wild honey like Elijah. His austere life was a proof of his commitment to his prophetic role. However, some accused him of being possessed by a demon, associating his sober character with melancholy influenced by an evil spirit. The Scribes and Pharisees, though they claimed to be abstinent, did not follow John's strict lifestyle but rather dismissed his mournful message.
