# Matthew 11:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not. Jesus, reflecting on the ingratitude of those whom he had served and performed miracles among, began to reproach them. The changing tone of his words indicated a shift in his approach, revealing his disappointment with their ungenerous treatment, ingratitude, unbelief, and hardened hearts. Despite his countless acts of power and grace, the people failed to respond with repentance and faith. Jesus' intention in performing miracles was to lead them to a change of heart and to invite them to salvation.
