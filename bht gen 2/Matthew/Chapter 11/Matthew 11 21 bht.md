# Matthew 11:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Though Chorazin and Bethsaida had the privilege of witnessing Christ's miracles, they failed to repent and change their ways. These cities are examples of the lesser towns where Jesus performed mighty works, yet they are not mentioned elsewhere. The inhabitants of Tyre and Sidon, known for their wickedness, would have repented if they had experienced the same privileges. Jesus' declaration of judgment is a compassionate statement, revealing the misery these cities were bringing upon themselves. The level of their judgment is even greater than that of Tyre, Sidon, and Sodom.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Both this and Chorazin appear to be put as examples of the lesser towns in which our Lord had wrought His miracles."
2. "These wealthy cities, so often the subject of prophecy, had been chastised by God’s judgment under Nebuchadnezzar and Alexander, but still existed."
3. "The phrase 'ἐν σάκ. κ . σποδῷ μετ.' is probably an allusion to Jonah 3:6, or to general Eastern custom."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "These two cities appear to be singled out to denote the whole region in which they lay—a region favored with the Redeemer's presence, teaching, and works above every other."
2. "Their overthrow was repeatedly foretold in ancient prophecy, and once and again fulfilled by victorious enemies. Yet they were rebuilt, and at this time were in a flourishing condition."
3. "Remarkable language, showing that they had done less violence to conscience, and so, in God's sight, were less criminal than the region here spoken of."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Bethsaida means literally a 'house of hunting' or 'a house of game,' and it was probably situated on the banks of the Sea of Galilee, and supported itself by hunting or fishing."
2. "Tyre and Sidon - These were cities of Phoenicia, formerly very opulent, and distinguished for merchandise. They were situated on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea, and were in the western part of Judea. They were therefore well known to the Jews."
3. "In sackcloth and ashes - Sackcloth was a coarse cloth, like canvas, used for the dress of the poor, and for the more common articles of domestic economy. It was worn also as a sign of mourning."

### John Calvin:
1. "There was not one of them who did not look upon the inhabitants of Tyre and Sidon as abominable despisers of God."
2. "Comparing the citizens of Bethsaida, and their neighbors, with the inhabitants of Tyre and Sidon, he reasons, not of what God foresaw would be done either by the one or by the other, but of what both parties would have done, so far as could be judged from the facts."
3. "In short, the words of Christ convey nothing more than that the inhabitants of Chorazin and Bethsaida go beyond those of Tyre and Sidon in malice and incurable contempt of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The symbol of mourning and repentance (comp. Jonah 3:5-9, on the repentance of Nineveh). The costume of mourners resembled a sack with holes for the arms, and it was usual to strew ashes upon the head."
2. "The corruption of these places had been spoken of ages before by the prophets."
3. "Our Lord claims knowledge of contingent spiritual events."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

### John Gill:
1. "Though many of Christ's mighty works were done in this place, yet mention is made of it no where else, but here."
2. "Woe unto thee, Bethsaida! This was the city of Andrew and Peter, so that as bad as it was, some persons were called out of it by the grace of God, and to the high office of apostleship."
3. "If the inhabitants of Tyre and Sidon had had the advantages of Christ's ministry, and of seeing his miracles, as the inhabitants of Chorazin and Bethsaida had, it looks very likely, or one would be ready to conclude, especially from many coming out of these parts, to attend on Christ's ministry, they would have repented of their sins; at least, in an external way, signified by sackcloth and ashes, which were outward signs of repentance."

### John Wesley:
1. "Wo to thee, Chorazin — That is, miserable art thou. For these are not curses or imprecations, as has been commonly supposed; but a solemn, compassionate declaration of the misery they were bringing on themselves."
2. "Beside the general denunciation of wo to those stubborn unbelievers, the degree of their misery will be greater than even that of Tyre and Sidon, yea, of Sodom."
