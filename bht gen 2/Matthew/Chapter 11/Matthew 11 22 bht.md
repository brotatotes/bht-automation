# Matthew 11:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The punishment for rejecting the Gospel will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon than for Chorazin and Bethsaida. This is because the sins of those who have not seen the mighty works of Jesus will be more excusable. God's authoritative judgment determines the measure of human responsibility, and there will be varying degrees of torments in hell. The rejection of the Messiah and the Gospel, despite witnessing miracles and having personal convictions, will result in a more severe condemnation and an intolerable punishment.

3. "These words suppose, that the men of Tyre and Sidon will be punished for their many abominable sins, committed against the law and light of nature; but that the inhabitants of Chorazin and Bethsaida, having rejected the Messiah and the doctrines of the Gospel, against all the evidence of miracles, and convictions of their own minds; as their sins are aggravated, their condemnation will be the greater, and their punishment the more intolerable."
