# Matthew 11:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Capernaum, once exalted and highly honored for being the center of Christ's ministry and miracles, is now condemned to a fate of destruction and desolation. Its pride and privilege will be its downfall. This serves as a sobering reminder that those who receive great blessings and opportunities bear a greater responsibility to use them wisely. The city's fate serves as a warning that God's justice will prevail, and those who abuse their privileges will face severe consequences.

"This declaration of the Lord of all events, opens to us an important truth, that the destruction of Sodom was brought about, not by a necessity in the divine purposes still less by a connexion of natural causes but by the iniquity of its inhabitants, who, had they turned and repented, might have averted their doom."

2. "It deserves our earnest attention... that the more eminent any one is, he will be punished with the greater severity, if he shall basely pollute the gifts which God has bestowed upon him; and above all, an awful vengeance awaits us, if, after having received the spiritual gifts of Christ, we treat him and his Gospel with contempt."
