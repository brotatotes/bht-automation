# Matthew 11:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the future judgment, the punishment for the cities of Tyre, Sidon, and Sodom would have been more tolerable compared to the cities of Bethsaida, Chorazin, and Capernaum. The great works done in the latter cities were rejected, and thus the judgment they will face will be harsher. While the sins of Sodom were abhorrent, the punishment for those who had the opportunity of grace and rejected it will be more severe. The judgment spoken of is not just for physical cities but for the people themselves, and it will be a final and irretrievable judgment.
