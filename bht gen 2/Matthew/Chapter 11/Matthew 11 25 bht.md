# Matthew 11:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we see the speaker expressing gratitude and acknowledging the justice and mercy of God's actions. The hidden truths of the Gospel are revealed to those with childlike faith and are often obscured from the wise and prudent of the world. It is a demonstration of God's sovereignty and His choice to bestow His grace upon those He has called. The speaker recognizes that the power to bring about conversion lies not in their own abilities, but in the mysterious workings of the Spirit.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Yes; but there is a brighter side to the picture; even in those who have rejected the message of eternal life, it is the pride of their own hearts only which has blinded them, and the glory of the truth does but the more appear in their inability to receive it."
2. "I assent to thee." But this is not strong enough. The idea of "full" or "cordial" concurrence is conveyed by the preposition. The thing expressed is adoring acquiescence, holy satisfaction with that law of the divine procedure about to be mentioned.
3. "Because it is not for the offending and revolted to speak or to speculate, but to listen to Him from whom we have broken loose, that we may learn whether there be any recovery for us at all and if there be, on what principles—of what nature—to what ends."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "I thank... I confess. I recognize the justice and wisdom of thy doings." 
2. "Understanding; Wyc., wary. From the verb sunihmi, to bring together, and denoting that peculiarity of mind which brings the simple features of an object into a whole." 
3. "Wise [σοφων] and understanding are often joined, as here. The general distinction is between productive and reflective wisdom, but the distinction is not always recognized by the writer."

### John Calvin:
1. "Let it be observed, also, that the discourse is addressed to the Father, and consequently is marked by greater energy than if he had spoken to his disciples. It was on their behalf, no doubt, and for their sake, that he gave thanks to the Father, that they might not be displeased with the low and mean aspect of his Church."
2. "In no other way can the mercy of God be so fully known as it ought to be, than by making such a choice, from which it is evident, that whatever men bring from themselves is nothing; and therefore human wisdom is justly thrown down, that it may not obscure the praise of divine grace."
3. "The meaning therefore is, that no man can obtain faith by his own acuteness, but only by the secret illumination of the Spirit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I thank thee, ‘I fully confess, thankfully acknowledge the justice of thy doings.’"
2. "Those most learned and sagacious in all earthly things often cannot understand the simplest truths of Christianity."
3. "Those despised by the world, because often ignorant of what it values, or considered ‘babes,’ because they believe like little children what their Heavenly Father reveals to them."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is usual to call this golden utterance a prayer, but it is at once prayer, praise, and self-communing in a devout spirit" (Bruce).
2. "The only satisfying explanation lies in the fact that Jesus did have this strain of teaching that is preserved in John's Gospel."
3. "The word 'thank' (ομολογουμα) is better rendered 'praise' (Moffatt)."

### John Gill:
1. "He is abundantly thankful, and admires the distinguishing grace of God in the calling of a few in those places."
2. "This he mentions to show the sovereignty of his Father, in the conversion of men; and that it was not for want of power in him, that there were no more wrought upon under the ministry of John, himself, and his disciples."
3. "The persons from whom these things were hid, are 'the wise and prudent'; in things worldly, natural, and civil...yet the things of the Gospel are hidden from them."

### John Wesley:
1. "I thank thee - That is, I acknowledge and joyfully adore the justice and mercy of thy dispensations"  
2. "Because thou hast hid - That is, because thou hast suffered these things to be hid from men, who are in other respects wise and prudent, while thou hast discovered them to those of the weakest understanding, to them who are only wise to Godward."
