# Matthew 11:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's pleasure and will should be regarded as the highest reason and justice, even when difficult to comprehend. Recognizing that some are chosen and others reprobated by God may be unpleasant, but directing our fury against Christ is not the answer. Instead, let us praise Him for His wisdom, prudence, and goodness. His good pleasure is better than any reason or argument we can devise, and it is not based on natural sagacity, worthiness, or foresight. It is solely the result of God's good will.
