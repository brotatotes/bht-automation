# Matthew 11:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our Lord affirms that all things have been entrusted to Him by the Father, emphasizing His authority and the divine plan of salvation. The profound mystery of the nature and purpose of Christ is beyond human comprehension; only God comprehends the depths of His being. The fullness of God's love and grace can only be truly understood by the Son and those to whom He reveals the Father. Through the Son, God's will is made known and the source of salvation is unveiled, inviting us to enter into a deeper understanding of His infinite majesty and redeeming work.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This very truth had been part of the testimony borne to Jesus by the Baptist and its repetition here, in a discourse of which the character and office of the Baptist is the suggestive groundwork, is a coincidence not surely without meaning."
2. "None but the Almighty Father has full entire possession of the mystery of the Person and Office of the Son: it is a depth hidden from all being but His, Whose Purposes are evolved in and by it."
3. "Nor does any fully apprehend, in the depths of his being, the love and grace of the Father, except the Son, and he to whom the Son, by the Eternal Spirit, proceeding from the Father and the Son, will reveal Him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "They are 'delivered over,' or 'committed,' to Me of My Father; meaning the whole administration of the kingdom of grace."
2. "What a saying is this, that 'the Father and the Son are mutually and exclusively known to each other!' A higher claim to equality with the Father cannot be conceived."
3. "This testimony to the sovereignty of that gracious 'will,' on which alone men's salvation depends, is designed but to reveal the source and enhance the glory of it when once impartedâ€”not to paralyze or shut the soul up in despair."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It means that Christ has control over all things for the good of his church; that the government of the universe is committed to him 'as Mediator,' that he may redeem his people and guide them to glory." 
2. "Such is the nature of the Son of God, such the mystery of the union between the divine and human nature, such his exalted character as 'divine,' that no mortal can fully comprehend Jesus. None but God fully knows him."
3. "No man or angel clearly and fully comprehends the character of the infinite God; none but the Son - the Lord Jesus - and he to whom he makes him known, have any just apprehensions of his being and perfections."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Son was sent forth by the Father, and clothed with authority."
2. "The compound indicating full knowledge."

### John Calvin:
1. "Life is exhibited to us in Christ himself, and that no man will partake of it who does not enter by the gate of faith."
2. "If we wish to know what is the character of Christ, we must abide by the testimony of the Father, who alone can truly and certainly inform us what authority he hath bestowed upon him."
3. "We must understand him to mean, not that the Father knoweth for himself, but that He knoweth for us to reveal him to us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "All things were by the Father brought into connection with, and subordination to the economy instituted by Christ."
2. "This great mystery of Christâ€™s power over all things rests upon the greatest of mysteries, the person of Christ, the Son, as related to the Father, a mystery thoroughly known only to the two parties, the Father and the Son."
3. "The Son is the Revealer of this mystery, and about it all revelation centres, not only written revelation, but the revelation made to our hearts."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "All things have been delivered unto me of my Father... It is the timeless aorist like ÎµÎ´Î¿Î¸Î· in Matthew 28:18 and 'points back to a moment in eternity, and implies the pre-existence of the Messiah'." 
2. "The Messianic consciousness of Christ is here as clear as a bell. It is a moment of high fellowship."
3. "The Son retains the power and the will to reveal the Father to men."

### John Gill:
1. "All things are delivered unto me of my Father,.... This is to be understood of Christ, as mediator... all power in heaven, and in earth, are given unto him; and all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hid with him"
2. "no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; the transcendent glories and perfections of his nature, as the Son of God; nor the whole of his work and office, as mediator"
3. "Neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son... and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him; both himself, and his Father, and the grace and glory of each"

### John Wesley:
1. "All things are delivered to me." Our Lord, here addressing himself to his disciples, shows why men, wise in other things, do not know this: namely, because none can know it by natural reason: none but those to whom he revealeth it.
