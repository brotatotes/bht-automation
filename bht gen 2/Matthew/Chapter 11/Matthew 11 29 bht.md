# Matthew 11:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Embrace the teachings of Jesus and submit to his authority, for he is the source of rest and happiness. As followers of Christ, we are called to imitate his meekness, humility, and lowliness, both in our actions and beliefs. When we learn from Jesus and adopt these virtues, we will experience true rest for our souls. Those who do not find rest may lack meekness and lowliness, as it is not the yoke of Christ that causes discontent, but a failure to embrace it with a humble heart.

2. "The word for the Christian virtue of humility [ταπεινοφροσυνη], was not used before the Christian era, and is distinctly an outgrowth of the Gospel. This virtue is based upon a correct estimate of our actual littleness, and is linked with a sense of sinfulness."
3. "The rest of Christ is twofold - given and found. It is given in pardon and reconciliation. It is found under the yoke and the burden; in the development of Christian experience, as more and more the 'strain passes over' from self to Christ."

2. "Humility was not a virtue among the ancients. It was ranked with servility. Jesus has made a virtue of this vice."
3. "Jesus promises that we shall find the yoke kindly and the burden lightened by his help."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ exhorts such persons who come to him for rest and happiness, to profess their faith in him, to embrace the doctrines of the Gospel, to submit to his ordinances, and to walk according to those laws, commands, and orders, which he, as king of saints, has made, and requires obedience to."

2. "For I am meek and lowly in heart — Meek toward all men, lowly toward God: and ye shall find rest."
