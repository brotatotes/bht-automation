# Matthew 11:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people were expecting the coming of the Messiah, the Redeemer who would bring salvation and perfect happiness. John himself, who had been preaching about the coming Messiah, seemed to have a temporary moment of doubt and depression. His zealous nature prompted him to seek a public declaration from Jesus, but it was clear that there was room for imperfection and doubt even among the saints. John longed for reassurance, wondering if Jesus was truly the Messiah, especially since he was still imprisoned. Nevertheless, Jesus was indeed the One who was to come, the long-awaited Messiah.
