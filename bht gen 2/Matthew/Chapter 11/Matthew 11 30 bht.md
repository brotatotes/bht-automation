# Matthew 11:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Taking on the yoke of Christ involves a conflict with evil and can be seen as a burden, but it is a light yoke that brings inner rest and peace. This yoke is not easy in the sense of being effortless, but rather it is wholesome and serviceable. Through faith in Christ, we can find rest for our souls, peace of conscience, and the power to obey. The yoke of Christ is in contrast to the burdensome law of Moses, offering ease, liberty, and honor.
