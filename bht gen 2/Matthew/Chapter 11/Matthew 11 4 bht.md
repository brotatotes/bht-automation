# Matthew 11:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The messengers were instructed to go and report to John the Baptist about the things they heard and saw. Through these signs and miracles, Jesus wanted John to recognize and interpret the evidence of his Messiahship. The preaching of the gospel and the healing of various diseases and afflictions were powerful demonstrations of the fulfillment of prophecies and the abundant grace of God in Christ. These acts showed that Jesus came not only for the rich and powerful, but also for the poor and afflicted, exemplifying his compassionate and inclusive mission.
