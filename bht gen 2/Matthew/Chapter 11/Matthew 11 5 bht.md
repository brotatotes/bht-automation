# Matthew 11:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The miracles described in these passages represent the compassionate power of Jesus. The blind are granted sight, the deaf can hear, and the dead are raised. These physical miracles are symbolic of the spiritual blessings that Jesus brings through His grace. Above all else, the preaching of the Gospel to the poor is the greatest act of mercy. It fulfills prophecy and demonstrates the transformative nature of Christ's message. The Gospel brings hope and salvation to those who are marginalized and overlooked in society, offering them the opportunity to receive the greatest miracle of all - spiritual deliverance.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "These miracles might be referred to by our Lord under the words ŒΩŒµŒ∫. ·ºêŒ≥.; for it is to be observed that He bade them tell John not only what things they saw, but what things they had heard, as in Luke."
2. "It must not be forgotten that the words here used by our Lord have an inner and spiritual sense, as betokening the blessings and miracles of divine grace on the souls of men, of which His outward and visible miracles were symbolical."
3. "Stier remarks the coupling of these miracles together, and observes that with ŒΩŒµŒ∫. ·ºêŒ≥. is united œÄœÑœâœáŒø·Ω∂ Œµ·ΩêŒ±Œ≥Œ≥ŒµŒªŒØŒ∂ŒøŒΩœÑŒ±Œπ, as being a thing hitherto unheard of and strange, and an especial fulfilment of Isaiah 61:1."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. The lame walk. Tynd., The halt go.

### John Calvin:
1. "By the poor are undoubtedly meant those whose condition is wretched and despicable, and who are held in no estimation."
2. "However mean any person may be, his poverty is so far from being a ground of despair, that it ought rather to animate him with courage to seek Christ."
3. "Let us remember that none are accounted poor but those who are really such, or, in other words, who lie low and overwhelmed by a conviction of their poverty."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The blind receive their sight, or ‚Äòsee again.‚Äô The word means this when applied to the blind. In other cases, ‚Äòto look up.‚Äô"
 
2. "The dead are raised up. The raising of the daughter of Jairus probably took place afterwards, but the miracle in Nain certainly preceded."
3. "The poor have the gospel preached to them. The ‚Äòpoor‚Äô in spirit are included. This is the climax. Spiritual deliverance was the greatest miracle. The answer (comp. Isaiah 35:5; Isaiah 61:1) means: ‚ÄòI do great things in physical healing, but my greatest work is the spiritual healing I bring: do not then expect some wonderful temporal victory, but be content with the thought that I as Messiah am doing my appropriate and most glorious work.‚Äô The reference to the Old Testament prophecy would give John both testimony and instruction. Even our Lord answers doubt out of the Scriptures."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "And the dead are raised up (Œ∫Œ± ŒΩŒµŒ∫œÅŒø ŒµŒ≥ŒµŒπœÅŒøŒΩœÑŒ±). Like that of the son of the widow of Nain."
2. "Did he raise the dead also on this occasion? 'Tell John your story over again and remind him of these prophetic texts, Isaiah 35:5; Isaiah 61:1' (Bruce)."
3. "The items were convincing enough and clearer than mere eschatological symbolism. 'The poor' in particular have the gospel, a climax."

### John Gill:
1. "The blind receive their sight...sight was restored to the blind before them then; and no doubt they were informed of the two blind men, that had their eyes opened..."
2. "the deaf hear...the man, into whose ears Christ put his fingers and said, Ephphatha, be opened"
3. "the poor have the Gospel preached them;...Christ called, qualified, and sent them forth to preach the Gospel...they 'received' it, readily and willingly, joyfully and gladly, with faith and love..."

### John Wesley:
1. The poor have the Gospel preached to them ‚Äî The greatest mercy of all. Isaiah 29:18; 35:5.
