Happy is the person who does not stumble or take offense at Jesus, despite the various doubts and criticisms surrounding him.

Instead, we should hold fast to our faith in Christ, even in times of confusion, and find peace and joy in him. Those who receive Jesus, believe in him, and remain steadfast in their profession of faith will find true happiness and eternal reward.
