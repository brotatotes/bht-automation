# Matthew 11:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This passage portrays the scene of the desert pilgrimage, with its unappealing features symbolizing that the journey was not about trivialities. The emphasis is on the great Forerunner and his sacred role, gradually elevating his preaching of repentance in the minds of the people. It is clarified that John the Baptist, in his rugged appearance and stern character, was not a flatterer or motivated by selfish desires. Jesus defends John from suspicion and highlights his uprightness in reproving King Herod. The passage also questions whether the people were expecting someone effeminate and accustomed to the indulgences of court life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The first sets before them the scene of their desert pilgrimage the banks of Jordan with its reeds... but no such trifles were the object of the journey: this suggestion is rejected without an answer."
2. "The second reminds them that it was a man but not one in soft clothing, for such are not found in deserts."
3. "The third brings before them the real object of their pilgrimage in his holy office, and even amplifies that office itself. So that the great Forerunner is made to rise gradually and sublimely into his personality, and thus his preaching of repentance is revived in their minds."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Christ asks them whether they were attracted by anything like that."
2. "He meant to say that John was a man of a different stamp - coarse in his exterior, hardy in his character, firm in his virtue, suited to endure trials and privations."

### John Calvin:
1. "This passage simply means, that there was nothing in the wilderness to attract the people from every quarter; that everything there was rude and unpolished, and fitted only to inspire disgust."
2. "Such elegance of dress as delights the eyes is rather to be looked for in the courts of kings."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "[John] was not a flatterer nor had he drawn back from his testimony to Jesus to escape from prison or from any selfish motive."

### John Gill:
1. "John's raiment was of camel's hair, undressed, and he had a leathern girdle about his loins; and as for his diet, it was locusts and wild honey: no, behold they that wear soft clothing..."
2. "He was no light, inconstant, flattering person, as generally courtiers are; had he, he would not have been in a prison."
3. "It was for his uprightness and faithfulness, in reproving Herod the king, that he was in such a place and condition."

### John Wesley:
1. "A man clothed in soft, delicate raiment - An effeminate courtier, accustomed to fawning and flattery?"
