# Matthew 11:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
John the Baptist was more than just a prophet. He had all the qualities of a true prophet - moral conviction, integrity, and a fearless zeal for truth and righteousness. In fact, he was not only a prophet, but also the forerunner of the Messiah. When people went out to see John, they witnessed someone greater and more excellent than any prophet who came before him. His role as the harbinger of Christ and the administrator of baptism to him gave him a unique and elevated position, surpassing that of any other prophet.
