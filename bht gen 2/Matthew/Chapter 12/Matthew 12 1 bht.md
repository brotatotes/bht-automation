# Matthew 12:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Jesus and his disciples walked through the cornfields on a Sabbath day, it is likely that they were heading to a place of worship. The disciples, being hungry and having not yet eaten, plucked ears of either barley or wheat, rubbing them in their hands to separate the grain from the husk or beard, and ate them. Plucking and eating the corn might seem unusual, but it was permissible according to the Mosaic law. The actions of Jesus and his disciples were motivated by necessity and should not be viewed as a violation of the Sabbath.
