# Matthew 12:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Pharisees were watching closely, hoping to catch Jesus breaking the Sabbath by healing a man with a withered hand. Jesus, aware of their thoughts, asked the man to step forward in the midst. It was clear that the Pharisees' intention in questioning Jesus was to accuse Him, either of being unable to heal or lacking compassion if He answered negatively, or of violating the Sabbath if He answered positively. However, Jesus used this opportunity to demonstrate His divine power, His authority over the Sabbath, and to silence His enemies, the Pharisees.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In both these accounts, they (the Scribes and Pharisees, Luke) were watching our Lord to see whether He would heal on the Sabbath: and He (knowing their thoughts, Luke) ordered the man to stand forth in the midst, and asked them the question here given."
2. "By Luke, it was the right hand; by Mark, our Lord looked round on them μετ ʼ ὀργῆς, συνλυπούμενος ἐπὶ τῇ πωρώσει τῆς καρδίας αὐτῶν: and the Herodians were joined with the Pharisees in their counsel against Him."
3. "ξηράν = ἐξηραμμένην Mark, of which the use had been lost and the vital powers withered."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The eij can hardly be rendered into English. It gives an indeterminate, hesitating character to the question."


### John Calvin:
1. "They ought to have considered whether it was a work of God, or of man, to restore a withered hand by a mere touch, or by a single word."
2. "When God appointed the Sabbath, he did not lay down a law for himself, or impose upon himself any restraint from performing operations on the Sabbath, when he saw it to be proper, in the same manner as on other days."
3. "It was excessive folly, therefore, to call this in question, and thus to prescribe rules for God himself, and to restrain the freedom of his operations."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A man having a withered hand. It was not only paralyzed, but dried up."
2. "There is no evidence that the man was aware that the Pharisees wished to make use of him to accuse Jesus."
3. "This question was put that they might accuse him, might find in His teaching and then in the act of mercy they expected would follow, the basis for a formal charge before the local tribunal."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The use of ε in direct questions is really elliptical and seems an imitation of the Hebrew."
2. "It is not translated in English."

### John Gill:
1. "It being remarkable that such a case should offer so opportunely, of showing his divine power in healing such a disorder; and of his authority, as the Son of man, over the sabbath; and of putting to silence his enemies, the Pharisees."
2. "Hence it is very clear with what view the Pharisees asked Christ this question; and that it was, as the evangelist says, that they might accuse him: either of cruelty and weakness, should he answer in the negative, that either he was not able to heal the poor man before him, or wanted compassion; or should he answer in the affirmative, as they expected, and act upon it, then they might have wherewith to charge him before the sanhedrim as a violator of the sabbath, and of their canons concerning it."
