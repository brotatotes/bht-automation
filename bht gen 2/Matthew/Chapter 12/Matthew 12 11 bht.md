# Matthew 12:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through their actions, the people showed that they valued their animals more than the well-being of their fellow human beings. However, Christ highlights this discrepancy by appealing to a common practice among them: rescuing a sheep that falls into a pit on the Sabbath day. He indicates that just as a man would not hesitate to save his own sheep, it is even more righteous to help a person in need. Although later regulations limited the extent of assistance allowed, initially, the rules did permit acts of compassion towards animals.
