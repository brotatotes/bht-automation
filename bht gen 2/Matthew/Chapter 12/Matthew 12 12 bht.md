# Matthew 12:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
More care and mercy should be shown to humans than animals. It is lawful to do good on the Sabbath, such as feeding and helping a beast. If it is permissible to rescue a person from a life-threatening situation on the Sabbath, then surely it is acceptable to heal a man with a withered hand through a simple word.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast" and would instinctively rescue it from death or suffering on the sabbath day; how much more his nobler fellow man!
2. "Not to do good, when it is in the power of our hand to do it, is to do evil; not to save life, when we can, is to kill."
3. "This is one of the very few passages in the Gospel history which reveal our Lord's feelings. How holy this anger was appears from the 'grief' which mingled with it at 'the hardness of their hearts.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "How much, then, is a man better than a sheep?"
2. "Our Lord recognizes the superiority of man, as well as the superior claims of humanity."
3. "Hypocrites care more for ceremonies than for their cattle, and more for their cattle than for suffering humanity."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "How much then is a man (ποσω ουν διαφερε ανθρωπος). Another of Christ's pregnant questions that goes to the roots of things, an a fortiori argument."
2. "By how much does a human being differ from a sheep? That is the question which Christian civilization has not even yet adequately answered" (Bruce).
3. "The poor pettifogging Pharisees are left in the pit."

### John Gill:

2. "if it is lawful to give food to a beast, and make use of means for its relief, and for the lifting it up out of a ditch, when fallen into it on the sabbath day, 'wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days', to men"
3. "if it was lawful to dig a man out of the snow, and do these several things for him on the sabbath day, why not cure a man of a withered hand, and especially when done by a word speaking, and without any labour?"

### John Wesley:
1. It is lawful to do good on the Sabbath day — To save a beast, much more a man.
