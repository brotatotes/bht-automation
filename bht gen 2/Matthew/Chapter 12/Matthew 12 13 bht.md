# Matthew 12:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Being filled with sadness and disappointment at the Pharisees' lack of compassion and their spiritual blindness, Jesus, who possessed unlimited power, commanded the man with the withered hand to stretch it forth. This miraculous act not only demonstrated the helplessness of humanity to perform good deeds on their own, but also signified the transformative power of divine grace that empowers individuals to accomplish things beyond their own capabilities.
