# Matthew 12:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Pharisees, driven by their obstinate rage and hostility towards Jesus, took counsel with the Herodians to conspire against him. This marked a crucial moment in their relentless pursuit to put Jesus to death and destroy him. Their deep-seated hatred was fueled by their inability to provide reasonable arguments to counter Jesus' teachings and the undeniable miracles he performed. It exposed their scared consciences, hard hearts, and hypocrisy in opposing the very Lord of the Sabbath.
