Jesus gave a command to those he healed, instructing them not to make him known to others, similar to when he commanded evil spirits. This prohibition may have been intended to prevent conflicts between his followers and the Pharisees. The charge was serious, given with strong warnings should they disobey. Despite the efforts of wicked men, God often turns their rebellious plans in the opposite direction, ultimately revealing his glory in unexpected ways.
