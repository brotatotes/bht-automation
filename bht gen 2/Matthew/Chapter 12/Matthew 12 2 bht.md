# Matthew 12:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Pharisees, always on the lookout for reasons to oppose Jesus, criticized the disciples for plucking grain on the Sabbath, deeming it a violation of their Sabbath regulations. According to their interpretation, this act was considered a servile work and therefore sinful. They even equated it with reaping and saw it as breaking God's law. Additionally, the Pharisees found fault in the disciples eating before morning prayers, deeming it inappropriate for the Sabbath. Their excessive concern with external rules and observances prevented them from understanding the true purpose of the Sabbath.

3. "It may be what might make this offence of the disciples the more heinous was, that they plucked these ears, and ate them, and so broke their fast before morning prayer; for a man might not eat any thing on a sabbath day until morning prayers were ended in the synagogue."
