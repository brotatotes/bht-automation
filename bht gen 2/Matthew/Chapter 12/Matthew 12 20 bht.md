# Matthew 12:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we are reminded of the gentle and compassionate nature of Christ towards sinners. He does not come to crush the contrite heart or extinguish the smallest hint of repentance. Instead, he tenderly lifts up the meek and strengthens the weak. His victories may be achieved quietly, but they are complete. He comforts those who mourn and encourages those who are fearful. This portrayal of Jesus as the Servant of Jehovah showcases his loving and merciful character, providing assurance that he will bind up the brokenhearted, heal their wounds, and bring them comfort and peace.

2. "Until He shall have brought out the conflict, the cause, the judgment, unto victory, caused it, i.e., to issue in victory: ·ºêŒ∫Œ≤Œ¨Œª·øÉ, exire jusserit, see reff."
3. "Such shall be his behaviour and such his gracious tenderness, during the day of grace: while the conflict is yet going on, the judgment not yet decided."

3. "to comfort all that mourn, to say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not."
