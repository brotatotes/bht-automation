# Matthew 12:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Trust and hope in Jesus Christ and His Gospel are closely intertwined. The name of Christ represents His teachings, His doctrine, which serves as the foundation of our faith. Just as the Gentiles from Tyre and Sidon became the first fruits of the great Gentile harvest, those who encounter the Gospel message find hope and trust in Jesus. The Gentile world has experienced this fulfillment, with multitudes being brought to believe in Christ as their Savior and Redeemer.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Part of His present audience were Gentiles—from Tyre and Sidon—first-fruits of the great Gentile harvest contemplated in the prophecy."
2. "The precise time of this section is uncertain. Judging from the statements with which Mark introduces it, we should conclude that it was when our Lord's popularity was approaching its zenith... But, on the other hand, the advanced state of the charges brought against our Lord, and the plainness of His warnings and denunciations in reply, seem to favor the later period."
3. "And the multitude... cometh together again... so that they could not so much as eat bread. And when His friends... heard of it, they went out to lay hold on Him; for they said, He is beside Himself."

### John Calvin:

2. "This began to have its accomplishment in the Idumeans, Tyrians, and Sidonians, now attending on the ministry of Christ; and has had a greater accomplishment since: the Gospel having been preached in the Gentile world, both upon the main land, and in the isles afar off; whereby multitudes have been brought to hope, and believe in Christ, as their Saviour and Redeemer."

### John Wesley:
