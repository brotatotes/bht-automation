### John Calvin:

2. "We need not wonder that so much liberty should be allowed to Satan in injuring the bodily senses, when God justly permits him to corrupt or pervert all the faculties of the soul."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Then. Indefinite, here meaning ‘afterwards.’"
2. "Such an one could not come alone."
