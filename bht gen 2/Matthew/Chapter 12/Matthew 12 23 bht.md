# Matthew 12:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people marveled at the miracles performed by Jesus and questioned if he could be the promised Son of David, the long-awaited Messiah. The astonishing works of Jesus left no doubt in the minds of the common people that he truly was the anointed one, moving them to admirably ask, Is not this the son of David? Their conviction and faith were evident through their recognition of Jesus as the true Messiah, based on the miraculous signs he showed them.
