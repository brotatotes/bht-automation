# Matthew 12:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Pharisees, unable to deny the reality of Jesus' miracles, stoop to ascribing His works to devilish influences in order to undermine His authority. Their desperate attempt to explain away His miraculous power as mere magic and diabolical alliance reveals their fear of His growing popularity and the threat He poses to their own authority. In their scornful words, they not only diminish the glory of Jesus' miracles, but also seek to discredit Him and turn the people against Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "A rigid monotheistic religion like the Jewish, left but one way of escape from the authority of miracles, which once were acknowledged to be indeed such, and not mere collusions and sleights of hand."
2. "There remained nothing to say but that which we find in the N.T. the adversaries of our Lord continually did say, namely, that these works were works of hell."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This had been a hostile party of the ecclesiastics, who had come all the way from Jerusalem to collect materials for a charge against Him."
2. "Two things are here implied—first, that the bitterest enemies of our Lord were unable to deny the reality of His miracles; and next, that they believed in an organized infernal kingdom of evil, under one chief."
3. "Stung by the unsophisticated testimony of 'all the people,' they had no way of holding out against His claims but by the desperate shift of ascribing His miracles to Satan."

### John Calvin:
1. "The scribes cannot withhold the acknowledgment of a fact so open and manifest, and yet they maliciously carp at what Christ did by Divine power."
2. "Not only do they obscure the praise of the miracle, but endeavor to turn it into a reproach, as if it were performed by magical enchantment."
3. "The opinion expressed by the scribes, that there is a prince among wicked spirits, did not arise from a mistake of the common people, or from supposition, but from a conviction entertained among the godly, that the reprobate have a head, in the same manner as Christ is the Head of the Church."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Pharisees admit the miracles, but explain them in another way as the work of Satan."
2. "'This,' in the question of the people, was an expression of surprise; the word is here taken up and turned against Jesus."
3. "The sense: lord of the habitation, referring to rule over the possessed, agrees well with the phrase here added: 'the prince of demons.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Pharisees feel that the excited condition of the crowds and the manifest disposition to believe that Jesus is the Messiah (the Son of David) demand strenuous action on their part."
2. "They cannot deny the fact of the miracles for the blind and dumb men both saw and spoke."
3. "So in desperation they suggest that Jesus works by the power of Beelzebub the prince of the demons."

### John Gill:
1. "They could not deny the miracle, or that it was one; but to deprive him of the glory of it, and even reproach him for it, and to bring him into contempt with the people, they not only speak of him in a scornful manner... but ascribe the miracle he wrought to familiarity with the devil, to diabolical influence and skill in magic art."
2. "They pretended he was in confederacy with Satan, and was carrying on his interest: and therefore, that he might gain credit and reputation, the prince of devils suffered the inferior ones to remove at his word."
3. "Concerning Beelzebub... it being a prevailing notion among the Jews, that there is one devil who is the head of all the rest, and who is by them sometimes called Asmodeus."

### John Wesley:
1. Mark 3:22.
