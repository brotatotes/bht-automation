## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There is at first sight a difficulty in the argument which our Saviour draws from the oneness of the kingdom of Satan: viz. that it seems the very idea of this kingdom, that it should be this anarchy; blind rage and hate not only against God, but each part of it warring against every other part."
2. "Just as a nation or kingdom may embrace within itself infinite parties, divisions, discords, jealousies, and heart-burnings: yet, if it is to subsist as a nation at all, it must not, as regards other nations, have lost its sense of unity; when it does so, of necessity it falls to pieces and perishes."
3. "That our Lord here in the most solemn manner re-asserts and confirms the truths respecting the kingdom of evil which the Jews also held."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation."
2. "Every city or house divided against itself shall not stand."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ reproved them with the greater severity, because he was a witness and judge of their inward malice." 
2. "But Christ attacked Satan in open combat, threw him down, and left him nothing remaining. He did not lay him low in one respect, that he might give him greater stability in another, but stripped him completely of all his armor." 
3. "Christ therefore reasons justly, that there is no community of interest between him and Satan, because that father of cunning keeps one object in view â€” the preservation of his kingdom."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He perceived not only that they opposed, but their very thoughts."
2. "This organized kingdom of darkness, because it is only evil, is racked with discords and hatred, but against the kingdom of God it is a unit."
3. "The point of the argument here is: not that discords are fatal, which is not always the case, but that an organization which acts against itself, its own distinctive aims, must destroy itself."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "By parables, by a series of conditions (first class), by sarcasm, by rhetorical question, by merciless logic, he lays bare their hollow insincerity and the futility of their arguments."
2. "Christ is engaged in deathless conflict with Satan the strong man."
3. ""Goods" (ÏƒÎºÎµÏ…Î·) means house-gear, house furniture, or equipment as in Luke 17:36 and Acts 27:17, the tackling of the ship."

### John Gill:
1. "He knew their vile malicious intentions and designs, with what view they expressed themselves in this manner, on purpose to reproach him, and set the people against him."
2. "A government, in which there is a disagreement between the chiefs of it, and the body of the people, or where one part is opposed to the other, or in which a civil and intestine war is begun and prosecuted, cannot continue in any comfortable situation, and flourishing state, but must come to nothing."
3. "If citizens fall out with their magistrates, or one with another, and turn out, and disfranchise each other; and if the heads of families, and the respective branches thereof, quarrel with, and divide from one another, a dissolution of the whole must ensue; and the same may be said of the kingdom and government of Satan."

### John Wesley:
1. Jesus knowing their thoughts â€” It seems they had as yet only said it in their hearts.
