# Matthew 12:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is evident that if Satan were truly casting out his own demons, it would contradict his own interests and undermine his kingdom. The idea of Satan being divided against himself is absurd, as the unity and concord among the devils under one head is what fortifies their strength. Therefore, it is implausible and unreasonable to suggest that Jesus would be in league with Satan, considering the nature of Satan's kingdom and his opposition to the kingdom of God.
