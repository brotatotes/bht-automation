# Matthew 12:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Some of the religious leaders had disciples who claimed to cast out demons, just as Jesus did. So, Jesus asked them, how can Satan cast out Satan? If these disciples do it in the name of God, then surely Jesus, who is greater, can do it without the help of Satan. Jesus pointed out their inconsistency and warned them that their own disciples would be their judges, convicting them of being unjust and unfair. Ultimately, Jesus made it clear that the arrival of the kingdom of God had caught them by surprise and that their accusation against him was baseless.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is highly necessary to institute this enquiry as to the reality of their exorcisms: for it would leave an unworthy impression on the reader, and one very open to the cavils of unbelief, were we to sanction the idea that our Lord would have solemnly compared with his own miracles, and drawn inferences from, a system of imposture, which on that supposition, these Pharisees must have known to be such."
2. "The difficulty has arisen mainly from forgetting that miracles, as such, are no test of truth, but have been permitted to, and prophesied of, false religions and teachers."
3. "Jerome, Chrysostom, and Hilary, understand υἱοὶ ὑμῶν to mean the Apostles: ὅρα κἀνταῦθα τὴν ἐπιείκειαν · οὐ γὰρ εἶπεν Οἱ μαθηταί μου, οὐδὲ Οἱ ἀπόστολοι, ἀλλʼ Οἱ υἱοὶ ὑμῶν …"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children..." meaning here the "disciples" or pupils of the Pharisees, who were so termed after the familiar language of the Old Testament in speaking of the sons of the prophets (1 Kings 20:35; 2 Kings 2:3, c.).
2. "Our Lord here seems to admit that such works were wrought by them in which case the Pharisees stood self-condemned, as expressed in Luke (2 Kings 2:3- :), 'Therefore shall they be your judges.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "He charges them with passing an unjust and malicious decision, because in the same case they did not decide in a similar manner, but as they were affected towards the persons."
2. "This inequality shows, that their prevailing motive was not a regard to what is just and right, but blind love or hatred."
3. "You attribute to Beelzebub the miracles which I have performed, and you praise the same things in your own children. You have at home what is sufficient to condemn you."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If casting out devils is an evidence of a league with Satan, then this holds good against your scholars who profess to do it also."
2. "Therefore they shall be your judges. They shall convict you of partiality."
3. "The existence of ‘demoniacs’ in those days is proof that supernatural power, of itself, is no test of truth."

### John Gill:
1. "If they in his name cast out devils, why could he not do it himself, without the help of Satan?"
2. "Christ asks them, by whom they cast out devils? Whether by the Spirit of God, or by Beelzebub?"
3. "Who will rise up against you, and condemn you one day, for this unequal judgment you now pass."

### John Wesley:
1. "By whom do your children...cast them out - It seems, some of them really did this; although the sons of Sceva could not."
2. "Ask them, if Satan will cast out Satan: let even them be judges in this matter."
3. "And they shall convict you of obstinacy and partiality, who impute that in me to Beelzebub, which in them you impute to God. Beside, how can I rob him of his subjects, till I have conquered him? The kingdom of God is come upon you - Unawares; before you expected: so the word implies."
