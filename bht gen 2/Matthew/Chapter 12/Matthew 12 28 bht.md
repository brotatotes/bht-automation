# Matthew 12:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The miracles performed by Jesus, particularly the casting out of devils, were clear proofs of the coming of the kingdom of God. Through these miraculous acts, Jesus demonstrated the power of the Spirit of God and the unity of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. It was evident that Satan would not assist in actions that opposed his own kingdom and were beneficial to the cause and glory of Christ. These miracles served as a powerful testimony to the arrival of the long-awaited kingdom of God, even if it took the people by surprise.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "has come upon you: not in the more proper sense of Ï†Î¸Î¬Î½Ï‰, â€˜is already upon you,â€™ i.e. â€˜before you looked for it,â€™ as Stier and Wesley."
2. "It does not seem to occur in this latter sense in the N.T."
3. "But Fritzscheâ€™s dictum, ad Rom. 2:356, 'Alexandrinis scriptoribus Ï†Î¸Î¬Î½ÎµÎ¹Î½ nihil nisi venire, pervenire, pertinere valet,' certainly is not right; for we have it indisputably in the sense of to anticipate, prevent, 1 Thessalonians 4:15."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God...the living Personal Agent was made use of by the Lord Jesus in every exercise of that power."
2. "If this expulsion of Satan is, and can be, by no other than the Spirit of God, then is his Destroyer already in the midst of you, and that kingdom which is destined to supplant his is already rising on its ruins."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The verb is used in the simple sense to arrive at (2 Corinthians 10:14; Philippians 3:16), and sometimes to anticipate (1 Thessalonians 4:15). Here with a suggestion of the latter sense, which is also conveyed by the Rev., 'come upon.'"
2. "It has come upon you before you expected it."

### John Calvin:
1. "As God works, and exerts his power, by his Spirit, it is with propriety that the word Finger is applied to him."
2. "He does not confine himself to a single miracle, but takes occasion from it to discourse on the object of his coming, reminds them that they ought not merely to look at one remarkable fact, but at a far more important truth."
3. "Thus we see that Christ complains of their ingratitude, in madly rejecting from the midst of them the inestimable grace of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "By the Spirit of God, i.e., in union with the Spirit of God. The contrast with â€˜Beelzebubâ€™ points to a â€˜Person,â€™ not an influence."
2. "Then the kingdom of God is come upon you. 'The kingdom you profess to be waiting for, has come upon you suddenly, before you expected it, in spite of your opposition to me.'"


### John Gill:
1. "It could not be reasonably thought, that Satan would assist in what was so very opposite to his kingdom and interest, and was so serviceable to the cause and glory of Christ."
2. "All the three persons had an hand in the miracles of the Messiah; they were done by Christ, in his Father's name, and by the power of the Spirit of God."
3. "The performing of miracles, particularly the casting out of devils, whereby the kingdom of Satan was so much weakened, was a clear proof of the coming of the kingdom of God."
