# Matthew 12:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ, being stronger than Satan, entered into his house and bound him before spoiling his goods. Through His power, Christ conquered the enemy and triumphed over him, setting free those who were held captive. This victory was necessary in order for Christ to rescue humanity from the dominion of the evil one. By binding Satan, Christ gained authority and control over him, dismantling his reign and establishing His own kingdom. Through this act, Christ demonstrated His superiority and power, showing that only through Him can we be delivered from the forces of darkness.

2. "There is no man who does not loudly boast that he desires the kingdom of God; and yet we do not permit Christ to fight boldly, as the occasion requires, in order to rescue us from the power of our tyrant; just as if a sick man were to entreat the aid of a physician, and then to refuse every remedy."
3. "Let us also learn that, as we are all subject to the tyranny of Satan, there is no other way in which he commences his reign within us, than when he rescues us, by the powerful and victorious arm of Christ, from that wretched and accursed bondage."

2. "Just as if a man should enter into another man's house, who is strong and robust, with a design to spoil his goods, who would never make use of the man himself to do it, and can never be thought to effect it unless he has a power superior to his and uses it."
3. "Christ is stronger than [the devil], and attacked him, and dispossessed him of the bodies of men; and restraining him from doing them any hurt, enters into the souls of men, dethrones him, and leads him captive."
