# Matthew 12:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The example of David's actions when he was hungry demonstrates that necessity can justify going against the law. This principle holds true even in the case of the disciples, who were accused of breaking the Sabbath. The commendation of David's actions by the Holy Spirit and the fact that others were with him and partook in eating the showbread confirm that his actions were not in violation of godliness. The conduct of David, which was used as the first defense by Christ, emphasizes the significance of reading and understanding the Scriptures for those who teach and judge others.
