# Matthew 12:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Whoever is not assisting Christ in establishing the kingdom of God is, in some measure, opposing him. The opposition between the kingdom of Christ and the kingdom of Satan is absolute, and neutrality is often the worst form of hostility. Christ draws a clear line between himself and his enemies, and there is a perpetual war between the seed of the serpent and the seed of the woman. Those who are not gathering souls to God are deemed scatterers of them.
