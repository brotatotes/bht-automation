# Matthew 12:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
All sins, whether ordinary or aggravated, can find forgiveness with God. There is no sin that cannot be pardoned. This assurance is not to be limited but rather explained by the fact that those who blaspheme against the Spiritâ€”by maliciously attributing the works of the Holy Spirit to the devilâ€”are guilty of an atrocious crime. However, forgiveness is available for all except those who oppose, contradict, and deny the works of the Spirit to gratify their own lusts.
