# Matthew 12:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Although some may unknowingly speak negatively of Jesus due to ignorance or misconceptions, their words can be forgiven upon genuine repentance. However, there is a distinct sin against the Holy Spirit that will not be forgiven, both in the present life and in the afterlife. This sin is so grave that it is proverbially believed to be impossible to obtain pardon. Those who commit this sin will not escape the punishment of it, enduring the divine judgment in both the present age and the age to come.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Its unpardonableness cannot arise from anything in the nature of sin itself; for that would be a naked contradiction to the emphatic declaration...that all manner of sin is pardonable."
2. "This would be to slander Him with eyes open, or to do it 'presumptuously.' To blaspheme Christ in the former condition—when even the apostles stumbled at many things—left them still open to conviction on fuller light: but to blaspheme Him in the latter condition would be to hate the light the clearer it became, and resolutely to shut it out which, of course, precludes salvation."
3. "The Pharisees had not as yet done this; but in charging Jesus with being in league with hell they were displaying beforehand a malignant determination to shut their eyes to all evidence, and so, bordering upon, and in spirit committing, the unpardonable sin."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. The Holy Spirit [του πνευματος του αγιου] . The Spirit - the holy. These words define more clearly the blasphemy against the Spirit, ver. 31.

### John Calvin:
1. "There is no reason to expect that those who shall have blasphemed against the Spirit will obtain pardon in this life, or will be acquitted in the last judgment."
2. "To the dead, therefore, there remains no forgiveness, except as regards punishment."
3. "Let them now go and light their fire of purgatory with these cold materials, if ice can kindle a flame."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Even this great sin can be pardoned."
2. "The meaning is: shall NEVER be forgiven."
3. "The inference from this view is, that all sin must either be repented of and forgiven, or culminate (here and hereafter) in the unpardoned and unpardonable state."

### John Gill:
1. "Now many might, through ignorance of him, thinking him to be a mere man, and taking up with common fame, speak evil of him, deny him to be the Messiah, reproach him for the meanness of his parentage and education, and for the freedom of his conversation with publicans and sinners."
2. "The distinction here used, does not refer to a common one among the Jews, of the Jewish state and the times of the Messiah; but to the present state of life, and that which will be after, or upon death."
3. "The sin against the Holy Ghost never has forgiveness; it is not pardoned now, and consequently there will be no declaration of the pardon of it hereafter."

### John Wesley:
1. "Whosoever speaketh against the Son of man - In any other respects: It shall be forgiven him - Upon his true repentance."
2. "But whosoever speaketh thus against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven, neither in this world nor in the world to come - This was a proverbial expression among the Jews, for a thing that would never be done."
3. "It here means farther, He shall not escape the punishment of it, either in this world, or in the world to come. The judgment of God shall overtake him, both here and hereafter."
