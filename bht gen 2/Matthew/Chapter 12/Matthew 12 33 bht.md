# Matthew 12:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The tree is known by its fruit, which is a reflection of its true nature. Hypocrisy and insincerity undermine righteousness, while a genuine and upright disposition is what Christ expects. By examining the fruit, one can accurately discern the essence of a person or thing. Furthermore, good works are the evidence of a tree's goodness, validating the authenticity of Jesus' teachings and mission.
