# Matthew 12:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A person's heart is like a hidden treasure, revealing its contents through one's words and actions. For a good person, the treasure of their heart is filled with God's abundant grace, a collection of various precious qualities. Conversely, an evil person's heart is corrupted and filled with all kinds of wickedness and sinful desires. Both good and evil treasures within the heart have consequences that individuals will be held accountable for in the future.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "A good man, out of the good treasure of the heart, bringeth forth good things."
2. "An evil man, out of the evil treasure, bringeth forth evil things."
3. "If I promote the one, I cannot belong to the other; but they that set themselves in wilful opposition to the kingdom of light openly proclaim to what other kingdom they belong."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The good or evil things come forth out of the treasure of the heart."
2. "Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh."
3. "The issues of the heart are thrown out, as if under pressure of the abundance within."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The good treasure." The words: ‘of the heart,’ though not in the text, suggest the correct explanation. The contents of our hearts are known to God alone and partially to ourselves, but our unrestrained utterances show what is laid up there.

### John Gill:
1. "A good man, out of the good treasure of the heart.... the good treasure the heart... is the superabundant grace of God, a collection of various graces that is more precious than gold, silver, and precious stones."
2. "An evil man, out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.... the evil treasure is the corruption of his nature, the desperate wickedness of his heart, and those swarms of lusts and all manner of sin that dwell there."
3. "All which men will be accountable for another day."
