# Matthew 12:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our words may seem idle, but they will be taken into account in the day of judgment, as they reveal the true state of our hearts. Even expressions that may not directly harm God or man, but are unprofitable and without use, must be accounted for. This includes not only blasphemous and profane words, but every speech that does not contribute to the glory of God. Thus, we should be mindful of our words, for they are a reflection of our character and will be judged accordingly.
