# Matthew 12:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On the day of judgment, both our words and actions will be taken into account as evidence to determine whether we were true believers. If we have spoken for Christ, confessing our hope of justification solely through His righteousness, we will be declared justified. However, if we have spoken against Christ and His righteousness, rejecting any dependence on it, we will be condemned by our own ungodly words. Our words, just like our actions, will be used to either acquit or condemn us in the final judgment.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The λόγος being the περίσσευμα τῆς καρδίας is a specimen of what is within."
2. "The λόγος is the outward utterance of the man."
3. "The λόγος will form a subject of strict enquiry in the great day, being a considerable and weighty part of our works."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "By thy words thou shalt be justified ... - That is, 'words' are the indication of the true principles of the heart; by 'words' the heart shall be known, as the tree is by its fruit."
2. "If they are true, proper, chaste, instructive, pious, they will prove that the heart is right."
3. "If false, envious, malignant, and impious, they will prove that the heart is wrong, and will therefore be among the causes of condemnation."

### John Calvin:
1. "A wicked speech, being the indication of concealed malice, is enough to condemn a man."
2. "A man is justified by his words, not because his speech is the ground of his justification, but because pure speech absolves us in such a manner, that we are not condemned as wicked persons by our tongue."
3. "The contrast between the two words points out the meaning of the word justify. The Papists reckon it absurd in us to say, that a man is justified by faith, because they explain the word justified to mean, that he becomes, and is, actually righteous; while we understand it to mean, that he is accounted righteous, and is acquitted before the tribunal of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For by thy words thou shalt be justified, declared righteous, acquitted, not made righteous."
2. "The index of character will be the words, not hypocritical ones, although even these speedily reveal their true character, but those coming from the heart."
3. "This general principle, far exceeding 'the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees,' concludes this discourse."

### John Gill:
1. "Our Lord's meaning is, that not only works and actions, but words of all sorts, will come into account in the day of judgment, and will be evidences for, or against a man, to acquit or condemn him."
2. "Thus for instance, a man that has spoken for Christ, and has freely confessed that all his hope of justification before God, and acceptance with him, is solely upon the account of the righteousness of Christ imputed; such a man will be declared a justified man according to the tenor of his own words."
3. "On the other hand, a man that has spoken hard speeches against Christ, and his righteousness; declaring he has no dependence on it, expects no justification by it; he will be convinced of these ungodly sayings, and out of his own mouth will be condemned."

### John Wesley:
1. "Your words as well as actions shall he produced in evidence for or against you, to prove whether you was a true believer or not."
2. "And according to that evidence you will either be acquitted or condemned in the great day."
