# Matthew 12:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Pharisees and some Jews doubted the divine origin of Jesus' miracles and demanded a sign from heaven as conclusive proof. They wanted something immediate and decisive to demonstrate that His miracles were not from this earth but from above. This demand was not only impudent and insulting but also hypocritical, as they were unwilling to acknowledge Him as a prophet unless He performed specific signs reminiscent of those on Mount Sinai. This attitude reveals the common expectation among the Jews of Jesus' time that the Messiah would perform signs and wonders.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In consequence of our Lord declaring that his miracles were wrought by the Holy Ghost, they wish to see some decisive proof of this by a sign, not from Himself, but from Heaven."
2. "The account in ch. Mat 16:1-4 manifestly relates to a different occurrence."
3. "Cf. John 6:30-31; John 12:28."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "we would see a sign from thee"—a sign from heaven; something of an immediate and decisive nature, to show, not that His miracles were real—that they seemed willing to concede—but that they were from above, not from beneath.
2. "These were not the same class with those who charged Him with being in league with Satan"—as we see from Luke 11:15; Luke 11:16; but as the spirit of both was similar, the tone of severe rebuke is continued.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They intimated that the miracles of healing were not sufficient evidence; might be attributed to magic or diabolical art 'A sign from heaven' they would regard as conclusive proof."
2. "They either denied that His miracles were 'signs,' or that coming from Him, they could be signs 'from heaven.' Pharisaism admires marvels of power more than miracles of mercy."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The demand was impudent, hypocritical, insulting."

### John Gill:
1. "they would not own him to be a prophet, unless he would give such signs"
2. "they seem to require some such things to be done, as were on Mount Sinai"
3. "this is to be learned from here, that the Jews, in Christ's time, expected signs and wonders to be wrought by the Messiah"

### John Wesley:
1. We would see a sign — Else we will not believe this. Matthew 16:1; Luke 11:16,29.
