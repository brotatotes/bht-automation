# Matthew 12:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Confronting an evil and adulterous generation, the passage addresses those who have strayed from their commitment to God, resembling an unfaithful spouse. Their seeking of signs from heaven is a reflection of their disbelief. Instead of granting their request, the sign given to them is symbolized in the prophet Jonah, a figure who prefigures the death and resurrection of Christ. This passage reminds us of the dangers of spiritual unfaithfulness and the necessity of repentance and genuine devotion to God, exemplified by the sign of Jonah.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The expression σημεῖον οὐ δοθ . αὐτῇ does not, as De Wette maintains, exclude our Lord’s miracles from being σημεῖα: but is the direct answer to their request in the sense in which we know they used σημεῖον, ‘a sign, not wrought by Him, and so able to be suspected of magic art, but one from Heaven.’"
2. "The sign of Jonas is the most remarkable foreshadowing in the O.T. of the resurrection of our Lord."
3. "For Jonah himself calls the belly of the sea monster בֶּטֶן שְׁאוֹל (Jon 2:2), ‘the belly of Hades,’ = καρδίᾳ τῆς γῆς here."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so have ye dealt treacherously with Me, O house of Israel, saith the Lord."
2. "In the eye of Jesus this class were but the spokesmen of their generation, the exponents of the reigning spirit of unbelief."
3. "And there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Adulterous [μοιχαλις] . A very strong and graphic expression, founded upon the familiary Hebrew representation of the relation of God 's people to him under the figure of marriage."
2. "Hence idolatry and intercourse with Gentiles were described as adultery; and so here, of moral unfaithfulness to God."
3. "Compare James 4:4; Revelation 2:20 sqq."

### John Calvin:
1. "He calls them adulterous, that is, spurious or illegitimate, because they were degenerated from the holy fathers."
2. "They had already been convicted by various miracles, and Christ does not abstain from exerting his power among them, for the purpose of rendering them inexcusable."
3. "You despise the Son of God, who has come down to you from heaven: but I am yet to die, and to rise from the grave, and to speak to you after my resurrection, as Jonah came from the bottom of the sea to Nineveh."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "An evil and adulterous generation. These Pharisees represent the great part of the Jewish people, who looked for a temporal Deliverer, showing signs from heaven."
2. "Their craving after a sign was a token of the same spirit of apostacy which made them join with heathen idolaters in crucifying Jesus."
3. "The sign of Jonah the prophet. One great sign would be given, typified in the history of Jonah, the death and resurrection of Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "An evil and adulterous generation (γενεα πονηρα κα μοιχαλις)."
2. "They had broken the marriage tie which bound them to Jehovah."
3. "What is 'the sign of Jonah?'"

### John Gill:
1. "an evil and adulterous generation; not only in a spiritual sense, being degenerated from the faith, religion, and piety of their ancestors; but literally, which appeared not only in their polygamy, and frequent divorces on trivial occasions, but by criminal conversation with other women."
2. "Their meaning is, that the chief magistrates should be Sadducees, and those that pretended to religion and holiness would be adulterers, which was now the case."
3. "Not that no miracles should afterwards be wrought amongst them; for, after this, many wondrous works were done by Christ; but no such signs should be given they desired, not one from heaven; but one particularly should be given them, out of the earth, and should be, not for their conviction, but condemnation; and would seem very much like that which was done to the prophet Jonas, or Jonah."

### John Wesley:
1. "An adulterous generation — Whose heart wanders from God, though they profess him to be their husband."
2. "Such adulterers are all those who love the world, and all who seek the friendship of it."
3. "The sign of Jonah — Who was herein a type of Christ."
