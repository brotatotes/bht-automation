# Matthew 12:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When someone entered the house of God, specifically the tabernacle, they had the opportunity to consume the showbread, which was a bread placed on the golden table in the holy place. This showbread represented the twelve tribes of Israel and was intended for the priests to eat. The fact that even David, who was known as a man after God's own heart, and his companions were allowed to eat the showbread when faced with distress and hunger illustrates the principle that works of necessity, such as satisfying hunger, have always been allowed on the Sabbath.
