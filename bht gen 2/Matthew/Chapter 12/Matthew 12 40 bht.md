# Matthew 12:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The phrase three days and three nights in this passage does not need to be taken literally as a strict 72-hour period. Instead, it signifies a customary way of expressing time for the eastern nations. They would consider any part of a day as the whole day. The Hebrew language lacked a specific word for a day, so they would use night and day or day and night to represent it. Thus, when the text mentions something occurring after three days and three nights, it simply means it happened after three days or on the third day.
