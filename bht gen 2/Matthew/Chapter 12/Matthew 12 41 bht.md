# Matthew 12:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The men of Nineveh will rise in judgment, serving as witnesses to condemn the Jews by their example of repentance at the preaching of Jonah, a mere man. Jesus, greater than the temple, Jonah, and Solomon, declares that despite his words and actions, the Jews will persist in disbelief, leading to his crucifixion. However, he will rise again, serving as a sign that confuses and challenges them. The Ninevites' repentance, though they were ungodly heathens, stands as a testament to the Jews' rejection of the Son of God Himself and the missed opportunity for their own salvation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In this verse there is no reference to the sign of Jonas spoken of above, but to a different matter, another way in which he should be a sign to this generation."
2. "The preaching of Jonas to the Ninevites was a sign after his resurrection: so shall the preaching of the Son of Man by His Spirit in His Apostles be after His resurrection."
3. "Stier."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Ninevites, though heathens, repented at a man's preaching while they, God's covenant-people, repented not at the preaching of the Son of Godâ€”whose supreme dignity is rather implied here than expressed."


### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "Ungodly men who never had heard a word of the true God, repented at the voice of an unknown and foreign person who came to them; while this country, which is the sanctuary of heavenly doctrine, hears not the Son of God, and the promised Redeemer."
2. "If they had beheld Christ with pure eyes, they must have acknowledged, not only that he was a teacher sent from heaven, but that he was the Messiah, and the promised Author of Salvation."
3. "Whether the men of Nineveh were truly and perfectly turned to God I judge it unnecessary to inquire. It is enough for the present purpose that they were so deeply affected by the teaching of Jonah, as to have their minds directed to repentance."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The men of Nineveh shall rise, i.e., as witnesses, by their example."
2. "In the judgment, not 'in judgment.'"

### John Gill:
1. "The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment,.... Alluding either to the custom and practice of witnesses, who rise up from their seats, and stand, when they give in their testimonies in a court of judicature."
2. "â€¦shall condemn them; not as judges of them, but by their example and practices, which will be brought above board, and observed as an aggravation of the guilt and condemnation of the Jews."
3. "â€¦the Ninevites will condemn the Jews because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; a mere man, a single prophet, a stranger to these men, who only preached, and wrought no miracle among them."
