# Matthew 12:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The queen of the south, also known as the queen of Sheba, traveled from the farthest reaches of the earth to hear Solomon's wisdom. Her journey from a distant land demonstrates her desire for knowledge and her recognition of Solomon's greatness. This shows that there was one who was greater than Solomon in their midst, who was rejected by the Jews despite their proximity to Him.

1. "Josephus, Antt. viii. 6. 5, calls her τὴν τῆς Αἰγύπτου καὶ τῆς Αἰθιοπίας τότε βασιλεύουσαν γυναῖκα, i.e. of Meroe (whose queens were usually called Candace. Plin. Hist. vi. 29)." 
2. "Abyssinian tradition agrees with this account, calls her Maqueda, and supposes her to have embraced the Jewish religion in Jerusalem." 
3. "The Arabians on the other hand also claim her, calling her Balkis (Koran, c. xxvii., cited by Winer), which latter view is probably nearer the truth, Sheba being a tract in Arabia Felix, near the shores of the Red Sea, near the present Aden (see Plin. vi. 23), abounding in spice and gold and precious stones."
