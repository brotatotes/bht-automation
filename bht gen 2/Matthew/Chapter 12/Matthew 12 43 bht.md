# Matthew 12:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the unclean spirit is driven out, it doesn't leave willingly but is compelled by a stronger force. It wanders through desolate places, seeking rest but finding none, for it carries its own torment with it. This parable not only applies to the Jewish people and their history but also to the Christian Church and individuals. It serves as a reminder that we should be vigilant against the evil one, who seeks to disturb, tempt, and discourage us in every way possible.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This important parable...sets forth...an evil spirit driven out from a man, wandering in his misery and restlessness through desert places...and at last determining on a return to his former victim...ends miserably."
2. "The direct application of the parable is to the Jewish people...The old demon of idolatry brought down on the Jews the Babylonish captivity...The re-possession by the one, and accession of seven other spirits more malicious than the first, hardly needs explanation."
3. "Strikingly parallel with this runs the history of the Christian Church...The first evil spirit has been cast out. But by the growth of hypocrisy, secularity, and rationalism, the house has become empty, swept, and garnished: swept and garnished by the decencies of civilization and discoveries of secular knowledge, but empty of living and earnest faith."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it —in other words, the humblest real saint of God."
2. "How utterly alien is this sentiment from the teaching of the Church of Rome, which would doubtless excommunicate any one of its members that dared to talk in such a strain!"
3. "His Mother and Brethren Seek to Speak with Him and the Answer."

### John Calvin:
1. "He speaks of scribes and hypocrites of a similar character, who, despising the grace of God, enter into a conspiracy with the devil. Against such persons he pronounces that punishment which their ingratitude deserves."
2. "This had been openly declared by Christ in the miracle which he had lately performed. As it is the peculiar office of Christ to banish wicked spirits, that they may no longer reign over men, the devil is justly said to go out of those men to whom Christ exhibits himself as a Redeemer."
3. "Let us, therefore, learn that, as soon as Christ calls us, a sharper and fiercer contest is prepared for us...Satan views with deeper hatred, and attacks with greater fierceness and rage, those who have been rescued from his snares."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The figure in Matthew 12:43-45 refers primarily to the Jewish people, but is applicable also in the history of Christianity and to individuals."
2. "The return into the man is against the view that the abode of the wicked is meant; but a state of greater dissatisfaction and unrest is plainly indicated."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'the unclean' spirit, is meant Satan, the old serpent, the devil; who by the Jews, is wont to be called as here, 'the unclean spirit'"
2. "His 'going out of a man', is not to be understood of his being dispossessed of the bodies of men; nor of the ejection of him, and his going by force, through the power of divine grace, out of the souls of men; but either of his leaving the Jews for a while, in some sort, whilst Christ and the Gospel continued among them"
3. "His view in walking in these places, or among such persons, is rest; not the rest of the saints, he seeks their disturbance, but his own rest; which is to do all the mischief he can, by stirring up corruption, tempting to sin, and discouraging the exercise of grace"

### John Wesley:
1. "When the unclean spirit goeth out - Not willingly, but being compelled by one that is stronger than he." 
2. "He walketh — Wanders up and down; through dry places - Barren, dreary, desolate; or places not yet watered with the Gospel." 
3. "Seeking rest, and findeth none - How can he, while he carries with him his own hell?"
