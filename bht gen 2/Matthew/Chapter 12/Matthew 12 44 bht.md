# Matthew 12:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those described in this passage are individuals who have rejected the Spirit of God, making themselves vulnerable to the influence of the devil. The imagery of a house being swept and embellished represents a state of apparent cleanliness and order that is attractive to the unclean spirit. Sadly, in their pursuit of an outward reformation, they have neglected the vital elements of true faith, love, and spiritual transformation. As a result, they become an easy target for the devil, who finds a suitable dwelling place in their lives.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "Christ is unquestionably describing those who, being destitute of the Spirit of God, are prepared for receiving the devil."
2. "The metaphor of a house swept and embellished is taken from men who find pleasure in the cleanness and neatness of their apartments; for to Satan no sight is beautiful but deformity itself, and no smell is sweet but filth and nastiness."
3. "Satan never finds a more appropriate habitation within us than when, having parted with Christ, we receive Satan as a guest."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "My house, i.e., the demoniac."
2. "Not in a state of moral purity, but empty of a good tenant; swept of all that would be forbidding to an evil spirit; and garnished, set in order, and adorned, but in a way inviting to the unclean spirit."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The demon is ironically represented as implying that he left his victim voluntarily, as a man leaves his house to go for a walk."
2. "'Worse than the first' is a proverb."

### John Gill:
1. "He has a property in them, a claim upon them; and though he says, from whence I came out, yet he never really and properly quitted it, only seemingly, and in appearance."
2. "It was empty of God, of the true knowledge of him, of the fear of him, and love to him; of Christ, of faith in him, affection for him, and hope on him; of the Spirit of God, and of his graces, and of spiritual, internal religion, and powerful godliness."
3. "Not with the Spirit of grace convincing of sin, righteousness, and judgment; but with the besom of an outward reformation."

### John Wesley:
1. "He findeth it empty - of God, of Christ, of his Spirit: Swept - from love, lowliness, meekness, and all the fruits of the Spirit."
2. "And garnished - With levity and security: so that there is nothing to keep him out, and much to invite him in."
