# Matthew 12:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When we turn away from Christ's grace, we subject ourselves to the cruelty of Satan, leading to a state worse than before. The intensity of Satan's attacks should not intimidate us because the invincible power of the Holy Spirit protects the sons of God. It is a warning that there are degrees of wickedness among the devil and apostates in all generations. Let us strive to keep Christ reigning within us, blocking the entrances of the adversary.
