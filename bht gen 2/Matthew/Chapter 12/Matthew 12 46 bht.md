# Matthew 12:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus' own family, including His brothers and possibly His cousins, came to see Him and were concerned for His well-being. Some speculated that He might be out of His mind due to the demands and challenges He faced. However, their intentions in seeking Him were not solely self-serving or seeking recognition, but rather a genuine desire to connect with Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He came for all men, and though He was born of a woman, He who is the second Adam, taking our entire humanity on Him, is not on that account more nearly united to her, than to all those who are united to Him by the Spirit." 
2. "All these characteristics of the mother of our Lord are deeply interesting, both in themselves, and as building up, when put together, the most decisive testimony against the fearful superstition which has assigned to her the place of a goddess in the Romish mythology."
3. "Great and inconceivable as the honour of that meek and holy woman was, we find her repeatedly the object of rebuke from her divine Son, and hear Him here declaring, that the honour is one which the humblest believer in Him has in common with her."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In His zeal and ardor, He seemed indifferent both to food and repose."
2. "They went to lay hold of Him as one 'beside Himself.'"
3. "The multitude sat about Him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A sufficient motive should be looked for. It was probably affectionate solicitude for His safety (see on Mark 3:21), in consequence of the open rupture with the Pharisees; also for His health, since He had not time to eat."
2. "They probably did not doubt Him, but mistook their duty, and adopted a worldly policy, which though natural and prompted by genuine affection deserved the rebuke here implied."
3. "In any case the faith of Mary His mother must have grown stronger before the crucifixion."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The charge of the Pharisees that Jesus was in league with Satan was not believed by the disciples of Jesus, but some of his friends did think that he was beside himself because of the excitement and strain."
2. "It was natural for Mary to want to take him home for rest and refreshment."
3. "So the mother and brothers are pictured standing outside the house (or the crowd). They send a messenger to Jesus."

### John Gill:
1. "But who are 'his brethren', is not so easy to say: some are of opinion, that Joseph had children by Mary, who are here meant; but it is more generally believed, that these were either the sons of Joseph by a former wife, whose name is said to be Escha; or rather, Mary's sister's sons, the wife of Cleophas, the cousin-germans of Christ, it being usual with the Jews to call such kindred brethren; and so they might be James, Joses, Simon, and Judas." (49 words)
2. "Desiring to speak with him; not with a pure view to interrupt him in his work, or to divert him from it, lest he should overspend himself; nor from a principle of ambition and vain glory, to show that they were related to him, and that he was at their beck and command." (40 words)

### John Wesley:
1. "His brethren - His kinsmen."
2. "They were the sons of Mary, the wife of Cleopas, or Alpheus, his mother's sister."
3. "Came now seeking to take him, as one beside himself."
