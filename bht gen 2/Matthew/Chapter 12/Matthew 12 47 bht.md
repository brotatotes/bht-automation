# Matthew 12:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is unclear whether the message brought to Jesus by His mother and brethren was intended to interrupt Him or test His loyalty to His natural family. However, it is probable that their intention was to disrupt Him since it is mentioned that Jesus considered this interruption unseasonable and potentially dissipating the impression on the audience. The existence of variant readings where the message is simply stated as a desire to see Jesus suggests that this incident may have been inserted into Matthew's Gospel from Mark or Luke.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Absorbed in the awful warnings He was pouring forth, He felt this to be an unseasonable interruption, fitted to dissipate the impression made upon the large audience—such an interruption as duty to the nearest relatives did not require Him to give way to."
2. "But instead of a direct rebuke, He seizes on the incident to convey a sublime lesson, expressed in a style of inimitable condescension."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We need not suppose that this unnamed person wished to interrupt the discourse."
2. "We need not suppose that this unnamed person... would call attention to the humble relatives to prove that Jesus was not the Messiah."


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Aleph, B, L, Old Syriac, omit this verse as do Westcott and Hort."
2. "It is genuine in Mark 3:32; Luke 8:20."
3. "It was probably copied into Matthew from Mark or Luke."

### John Gill:
1. "Whether this message was carried at the request of the mother and brethren of Christ, and delivered in a simple manner, and with an honest intention; or whether it was officiously done, and with a design to interrupt him, and to try him, whether he would prefer his natural relations, and their society and conversation, to the spiritual work in which he was engaged, in doing good to the souls of men, is not certain."
2. "The latter seems probable, from the following words, and conduct of Christ."
3. "Some copies read, 'desiring to see thee'."
