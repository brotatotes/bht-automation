# Matthew 12:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our Lord teaches a valuable lesson by downplaying the importance of our earthly family connections. Instead, he elevates the significance of our spiritual bond with him and other believers. This passage reminds us to view Christ through the lens of faith and recognizes that those who have been transformed by the Spirit and wholly dedicate themselves to God are united with Christ in the closest relationship. It is essential to understand that Jesus was not disregarding his natural family but highlighting the surpassing significance of his spiritual family and the obedience to the will of his heavenly Father.

### John Calvin:
1. "By disparaging the relationship of flesh and blood, our Lord teaches a very useful doctrine; for he admits all his disciples and all believers to the same honorable rank, as if they were his nearest relatives."
2. "He tells us also, that there is no tie of relationship more sacred than spiritual relationship, because we ought not to think of him according to the flesh, but according to the power of his Spirit which he has received from the Father to renew men."
3. "To sum up the whole, this passage, first, teaches us to behold Christ with the eyes of faith; and, secondly, it informs us that every one who is regenerated by the Spirit, and gives himself up entirely to God for true justification, is thus admitted to the closest union with Christ, and becomes one with him."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "He was more than man, or was not justified in thus speaking."

### John Gill:

2. "...he might have an opportunity of pointing out who were his relations in a spiritual sense."

### John Wesley:
1. "Our Lord's knowing why they came, sufficiently justifies his seeming disregard of them." 
2. "See the highest severity, and the highest goodness! Severity to his natural, goodness to his spiritual relations!"
