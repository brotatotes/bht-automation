# Matthew 12:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The priests in the temple are exempt from the Sabbath laws and are blameless in their actions, as they perform their regular duties such as cleansing and preparing sacrifices. Even the temple, which is considered sacred, allows for work on the Sabbath. And if the Sabbath can be set aside for the temple, then it surely can be set aside for someone greater, like Jesus.
