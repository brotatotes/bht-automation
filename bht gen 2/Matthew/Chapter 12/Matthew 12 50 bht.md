# Matthew 12:50 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are not granted the precious position of being part of the eternal family of God simply by professing their faith, but by demonstrating a faith that is obedient to God's will as revealed in the Gospel. Those who listen to the word of God, understand it, believe it, and obediently live out the faith are the ones who truly have a close relationship with Christ. This relationship is even more intimate than earthly family bonds, as it transcends the limitations of this world and brings believers into communion with Christ himself.
