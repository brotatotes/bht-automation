# Matthew 12:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this place, there is something greater than the temple, referring to Christ Himself, the Lord and Proprietor of the temple. Just as the service of the temple excused the priests from blame on the Sabbath, the presence of Jesus, who is greater than the temple, justifies His disciples in their actions. The act of the disciples rubbing and eating the ears of corn was done to satisfy their hunger and enable them to fulfill their ministerial function, which was of greater importance than the service of the priests in the temple.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "A greater thing than the temple is here."
2. "If the priests in the temple and for the temple’s sake, for its service and ritual, profane the Sabbath, as ye account profanation, and are blameless, how much more these disciples who have grown hungry in their appointed following of Him who is greater than the temple, the true Temple of God on earth, the Son of Man!"
3. "It seems to me, as above, to bear a more general and sublime sense than the masculine."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the temple—or rather, according to the reading which is best supported, 'something greater.'"
2. "The ordinary rules for the observance of the sabbath give way before the requirements of the temple; but there are rights here before which the temple itself must give way."
3. "Thus indirectly, but not the less decidedly, does our Lord put in His own claims to consideration in this question—claims to be presently put in even more nakedly."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "One greater [μειζων] . The correct reading makes the adjective neuter, so that the right rendering is something greater."
2. "The reference is, of course, to Christ himself."
3. "The indefiniteness of the neuter gives a more solemn and impressive sense."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "That which is greater, not some one greater; the comparison with the temple occasions this form, although the reference is undoubtedly to Christ Himself."
2. "Argument: If the priests in the temple are authorized to profane the Sabbath (according to your view of what that means) in the performance of necessary duties, how much more can One who is the real temple of God on earth authorize His followers to do so; or, if the former are blameless, so are these who have grown hungry in following Him who is greater than the temple."
3. "This ‘meek and lowly’ Teacher asserts this on His own authority. Works of necessity become a duty on the Sabbath only when so declared by Christ, or as we follow Christ."

1. "In this place is one greater than the temple; meaning himself, who was the Lord and Proprietor of the temple, and in his human nature the antitype of it."
2. "Christ's argument is that if the temple, and the service of it, excused the priests from blame, in doing things in it on the sabbath day, which otherwise might not be done; then much more might his presence, who was greater than the temple, excuse his disciples from blame in this action of rubbing and eating the ears of corn."
3. "Which was done to satisfy hunger and to render them more capable of performing their ministerial function, and which was of more importance than the service of the priests."
