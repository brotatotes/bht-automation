# Matthew 12:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our understanding of God's commands goes beyond external actions. Jesus emphasizes the primacy of love and mercy over ritual sacrifices. The Pharisees failed to recognize the importance of compassion, condemning innocent individuals for minor infractions. Their lack of understanding and absence of basic human empathy prevented them from grasping the essence of God's teachings. True worship involves acts of kindness and compassion, not just adherence to religious ceremonies.
