# Matthew 12:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The statement that the Son of man is Lord even of the Sabbath points to the high importance of this institution. It signifies that Christ has the authority to determine how the Sabbath should be observed. This authority is evident in his act of changing the Sabbath from the seventh day to the first day of the week. Thus, the Son of man's relationship with the Sabbath underscores his divine power and authority in guiding its observance.
