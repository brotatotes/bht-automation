## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This change of place is believed by Greswell to have been a journey back to Galilee after the Passover."
2. "It is true that no such change is implied in Mark and Luke; but the words here point to a journey undertaken."
3. "So that certainly it is not implied here (as Meyer, a [120] ., suppose) that the incident took place on the same day as the previous one."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He had now, no doubt, arrived in Galilee; but this, it would appear, did not occur at Capernaum, for after it was over, He 'withdrew Himself,' it is said 'to the sea' (Mark 3:7), whereas Capernaum was at the sea." 
2. "And, behold, there was a man which had his hand witheredâ€”disabled by paralysis (as in Mark 3:7- :). It was his right hand, as Luke (Mark 3:7- :) graphically notes."
3. "They were now come to the length of dogging His steps, to collect materials for a charge of impiety against Him. It is probable that it was to their thoughts rather than their words that Jesus addressed Himself in what follows."

### John Calvin:
1. "We see also, that it is usual with hypocrites to pursue what is nothing more than a shadow of the righteousness of the Law, and as the common saying is, to stickle more about the form than about the substance."
2. "First, then, let us learn from this passage to keep our minds pure, and free from every wicked disposition, when we are about to form a decision on any question; for if hatred, or pride, or anything of that description, reign within us, we will not only do injury to men, but will insult God himself, and turn light into darkness."
3. "We learn also, that we ought to beware lest, by attaching undue importance to ceremonial observances, we allow other things to be neglected, which are of far higher value in the sight of God, and which Christ in another passage calls the more important matters of the Law."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The miracle which follows, took place on another Sabbath, probably the next one."
2. "The synagogue of His opponents, probably in some important town in Galilee."
3. "He taught there, as seems to have been His habit."

### John Gill:
1. "He might indeed directly go into one of their synagogues the same day, where he and his disciples seem to have been going, and stay in the city the week following."
2. "[Jesus was] not being afraid of the Pharisees, who sought an advantage against him; nor deterred by them from doing good to men."
3. "[Jesus was] willing to take another opportunity of exposing their ignorance and malice."

### John Wesley:
1. Mark 3:1; Luke 6:6.
