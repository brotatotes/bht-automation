# Matthew 13:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On that busy day, Jesus went out of the house and sat by the seaside. He may have left the house to spend time with his mother and brethren, or to find some rest and refreshment by the sea. Perhaps the house was too crowded to accommodate the large number of people who wanted to hear him speak. As Jesus sat by the sea, it was a picturesque scene with crowds of people stretching up and down the shore. This was the sea of Galilee, also known as the sea of Tiberias.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "On that day (εν τη ημερα εκεινη) [...] It is called 'the Busy Day,' not because it was the only one, but simply that so much is told of this day that it serves as a specimen of many others filled to the full with stress and strain." 
2. "Sat by the seaside (εκαθητο παρα την θαλασσαν). The accusative case need give no difficulty. Jesus came out of the stuffy house and took his seat (εκαθητο, imperfect) along the shore with the crowds stretched up and down, a picturesque scene."

### John Gill:
1. "The reason of his going out of the house was, either to converse with his mother and brethren, as they desired; or to withdraw himself from company, and take some refreshment by the sea side; or because it would not hold the people, and therefore he quitted it for a more convenient place."
2. "And sat by the sea side; either as weary, and for his refreshment, or in order to preach to the people."
3. "This was the sea of Galilee, sometimes called the sea of Tiberias."
