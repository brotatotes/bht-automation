# Matthew 13:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples, perplexed by the parable's meaning and its purpose in being taught to the people, approached Jesus for clarification. This method of teaching through parables was not new to them, but it was not easily comprehended, especially by those without an explanation. The disciples themselves did not fully grasp the parable, prompting them to seek understanding not only for the benefit of the multitude, but also for themselves.
