# Matthew 13:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The mysteries of the kingdom of heaven are divine revelations that were partially understood in the past but fully proclaimed under the Gospel. They are bestowed upon humble and diligent hearers, while being concealed from closed minds. Parables serve the dual purpose of revealing and concealing these mysteries, presenting them in an attractive light to those who appreciate spiritual truths. Knowing and understanding these Gospel truths is a gift of God's grace, not acquired through human effort. The disciples were privileged to receive this knowledge, while others remained in darkness.
