# Matthew 13:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who have a genuine faith and continually grow in their relationship with God will receive even more spiritual blessings and knowledge. They will be rewarded for their faithful stewardship and their understanding of the truths of the Gospel will deepen. However, those who do not value or utilize the grace given to them will experience a decline in their spiritual understanding. This principle applies not only to knowledge but also to the overall work of God in their lives. It is a fundamental aspect of God's dealings with humanity and will become evident in the day of judgment.

### Henry Alford:
1. "By it, he who hath, he who not only hears with the ear, but understands with the heart, has more given to him; and it is for this main purpose undoubtedly that the Lord spoke parables: to be to His Church revelations of the truth and mysteries of His Kingdom."
2. "But His present purpose in speaking them, as further explained below, was the quality possessed by them, and declared in the latter part of this verse, of hiding their meaning from the hard-hearted and sensual."
3. "No practical comment on the latter part of this saying can be more striking, than that which is furnished to our day by the study of the German rationalistic Commentators; while at the same time we may rejoice to see the approximate fulfilment of the former in such commentaries as those of Olshausen, Neander, Stier, and Trench."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For whosoever hath...to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance...He will be rewarded by an increase of what he so much prizes." 
2. "but whosoever hath not...from him shall be taken away even that he hath...this is a principle of immense importance."
3. "This is a principle of immense importance, and...appears to have been uttered by our Lord on more than one occasion, and in different connections."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ pursues the subject which I have just mentioned; for he reminds his disciples how kindly God acts towards them, that they may more highly prize his grace, and may acknowledge themselves to be under deeper obligations to his kindness."
2. "He does not forsake the work of his own hand, Those whom he has once begun to form are continually polished more and more, till they are at length brought to the highest perfection."
3. "On the other hand, Christ declares that the reprobate are continually proceeding from bad to worse, till, at length exhausted, they waste away in their own poverty."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A rule of God’s dealings with men, holding good even in the lower forms of creation; here to be applied to knowledge of spiritual things."
2. "This twofold result is not arbitrary, but a necessary development, akin to what we perceive in every form of growth."
3. "To the disciples, with a desire for spiritual knowledge, an interpretation was given, and their knowledge grew through the outward and inward revelation; the people, without this desire, did not hear the interpretation, consequently they had less and less spiritual apprehension of the truth they possessed as Jews, since they got further away from Christ who alone fulfilled and explained that truth."

### John Gill:
1. "Whoever has the true grace of God implanted in him, has a saving knowledge of Christ, and a spiritual acquaintance with the doctrines of the Gospel, shall have more grace given him; he shall grow in the knowledge of Christ, and the Spirit of truth shall lead him into all truth."
2. "All grace shall be made to abound towards him; he shall be filled with all the fulness of God, and shall arrive at the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ; and his light shall shine more and more unto the perfect day."
3. "For everything besides true grace is a mere show, and has no solidity in it; as natural parts, human learning, and a form of knowledge and of truth in the law, the national church state of the Jews, with all the outward privileges appertaining thereunto, all which may be here meant."

### John Wesley:
1. "Whosoever hath — That is, improves what he hath, uses the grace given according to the design of the giver; to him shall be given - More and more, in proportion to that improvement."
2. "But whosoever hath not — Improves it not, from him shall be taken even what he hath - Here is the grand rule of God's dealing with the children of men: a rule fixed as the pillars of heaven."
3. "This is the key to all his providential dispensations; as will appear to men and angels in that day."
