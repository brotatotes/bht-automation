# Matthew 13:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They had the means to see, hear, and understand, but they chose not to utilize them. The paradox lies in the fact that it was the will of the Father to reveal divine mysteries to some, while withholding them from others. Despite physically seeing Jesus and witnessing his miracles, they failed to perceive or acknowledge the evidence that revealed he was the true Messiah. Jesus intentionally spoke in parables to highlight their true condition – individuals capable of seeing and hearing, yet unwilling or unable to grasp the message being conveyed to them.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In the deeper view of the purpose of the parable, both of these run into one."
2. "Taking the saying of Mat 13:12 for our guide we have ὅστις οὐκ ἔχει = ὅτι βλέπ . οὐ βλέπουσιν , and καὶ ὃ ἔχει ἀρθ . ἀπ ʼ αὐτοῦ = ἵνα βλ . μὴ βλέπωσιν."
3. "The difficulties raised on these variations, and on the prophecy quoted in Matthew 13:14-15, have arisen entirely from not keeping this in view."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "They 'saw,' for the light shone on them as never light shone before; but they 'saw not,' for they closed their eyes."
2. "They 'heard,' for He taught them who 'spake as never man spake'; but they 'heard not,' for they took nothing in, apprehending not the soul-penetrating, life-giving words addressed to them."
3. "The explanation of this lies in the statement of the foregoing verse—that, by a fixed law of the divine administration, the duty men voluntarily refuse to do, and in point of fact do not do, they at length become morally incapable of doing."

### John Calvin:
1. "He says that he speaks to the multitude in an obscure manner, because they are not partakers of the true light."
2. "He does not ascribe the blame of this to themselves, but takes occasion to commend more highly the grace bestowed on the Apostles."
3. "It is not the only design of a parable to state, in an obscure manner, what God is not pleased to reveal clearly."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Because seeing they see not, etc. Here the reason is based on the character of the persons concerned"
2. "The paradoxical form points to merely external perception without consequent mental or moral results."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Matthew presents 'a striking paradox, 'though they see, they do not (really) see.'" 
2. "The idiom here in Matthew gives no trouble save in comparison with Mark and Luke which will be discussed in due turn." 
3. "The form συνιουσιν is an omega verb form (συνιω) rather than the μ verb (συνιημ) as is common in the Koine."

### John Gill:
1. "Because it was the will and pleasure of his Father to give the knowledge of divine mysteries to some, and not to others."
2. "They saw Christ with their bodily eyes, but not with an eye of faith; they saw the miracles he did, but did not discern, at least did not acknowledge the evidence of them, proving him to be the true Messiah."
3. "He spoke to them in this abstruse and parabolical way, that they might be what they really were, seers and not seers, hearers and not hearers, at least not understanding ones."

### John Wesley:
