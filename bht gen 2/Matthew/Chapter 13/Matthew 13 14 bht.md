# Matthew 13:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus refers to the fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy, emphasizing that despite the availability and accessibility of God's Word, many fail to truly understand and grasp its meaning. This is due to the deliberate blindness of the people, who hear but do not comprehend, see but do not perceive. The prophecy speaks to the hardening of hearts, the spiritual dullness, and the resistance to the transformative power of God's truth. The citation of Isaiah's words in this manner is justified, as it accurately portrays the stubbornness and unwillingness of the people to receive the revelation of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And in them is fulfilled... the prophecy of Esaias, which saith— (Isaiah 6:9; Isaiah 6:10 —here quoted according to the Septuagint)." 
2. "By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand, &c.—They were thus judicially sealed up under the darkness and obduracy which they deliberately preferred to the light and healing which Jesus brought nigh to them."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Is fulfilled [αναπληρουται] . Rather of something in progress : is being fulfilled or in process of fulfilment.

### John Calvin:
1. "He confirms his statement by a prediction of Isaiah, that it is far from being a new thing, if many persons derive no advantage from the word of God, which was formerly appointed to the ancient people, for the purpose of inducing greater blindness."
2. "Such, too is the object which Christ has in view, when he ascribes it to the secret purpose of God, that the truth of the Gospel is not revealed indiscriminately to all, but is exhibited at a distance under obscure forms, so as to have no other effect than to overspread the minds of the people with grosser darkness."
3. "All who have been given over to a reprobate mind do voluntarily, and from inward malice, blind and harden themselves."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In them, lit., ‘to them,’ in the sense, ‘in their care’"
2. "It fulfilled. A stronger word than that commonly used; a complete fulfilment, which may or may not have been preceded by a partial one."
3. "By hearing, etc. The sense of the original prophecy is given, but not its form. In Isaiah is a command; here a strong prediction, indicating that judgment is a result of what is done by man as well as what is done to man."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Here Jesus points out the fulfilment and not with Matthew's usual formula."
2. "It means to fill up like a cup, to fill another's place, to fill up what is lacking."
3. "Here it means that the prophecy of Isaiah is fully satisfied in the conduct of the Pharisees and Jesus himself points it out."

### John Gill:
1. "The sense of the prophecy is, with respect to the times of the Messiah, that the Jews, whilst hearing the sermons preached by him, whether with, or without parables, should hear his voice, and the sound of it, but not understand his words internally, spiritually, and experimentally."
2. "Whilst they saw, with the eyes of their bodies, the miracles he wrought, they should see the facts done, which could not be denied and gainsayed by them, but should not take in the clear evidence, full proof, and certain demonstration given thereby, of his Messiahship."
3. "The words in Isaiah may be so understood, which is sufficient to vindicate the citation of them, by the evangelist, in this form of them."

### John Wesley:
1. "Hearing ye will hear, but in nowise understand — That is, Ye will surely hear. All possible means will be given you: yet they will profit you nothing; because your heart is sensual, stupid, and insensible."
2. "Your spiritual senses are shut up; yea, you have closed your eyes against the light; as being unwilling to understand the things of God, and afraid, not desirous that he should heal you."
3. "Isaiah 6:9; John 12:40; Acts 28:26."
