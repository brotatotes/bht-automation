# Matthew 13:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples were truly blessed, as they had the privilege of seeing and knowing things that even the most honorable and righteous individuals in the Old Testament longed for. They were able to have a clear understanding of the mysteries of grace and have a personal encounter with Christ himself. While those before them had glimpses and distant views of Christ through prophecies and sacrifices, the disciples were able to witness his teachings, miracles, and fully comprehend the power and spiritual significance of his message. This knowledge and experience were granted to them as an act of grace.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Not only were the disciples blessed above the blinded just spoken of, but favored above the most honored and the best that lived under the old economy, who had but glimpses of the things of the new kingdom, just sufficient to kindle in them desires not to be fulfilled to any in their day."
2. "The subject of both these parables—which teach the same truth, with a slight diversity of aspect—is: THE MIXED CHARACTER OF THE KINGDOM IN ITS PRESENT STATE, AND THE FINAL ABSOLUTE SEPARATION OF THE TWO CLASSES."
3. "The Tares and the Wheat (Matthew 13:24-30; Matthew 13:36-43)."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They were permitted to see and know what had been denied even to inspired and good men who longed for such knowledge."
2. "Righteous men, not merely according to the law, but who longed for something higher, with the anticipative faith here implied."
3. "The privilege of the disciples exceeded not only the privilege but even the desire of these good men of former times. Hence all was of grace."

### John Gill:
1. "To see Christ in the flesh, and have a clearer insight into the knowledge of the mysteries of grace, were things very desirable to men of the highest class in church and state, and of the best characters."
2. "These indeed had a sight of Christ, but a very distant one; they saw him afar off in the promises and prophecies of him; and not very clearly, but through dark types and cloudy sacrifices."
3. "The disciples saw him in person, heard him preach, took in the evidence of his miracles, and felt the power of his doctrines, and spiritually and savingly understood them."
