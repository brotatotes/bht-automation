# Matthew 13:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When someone hears the word of the kingdom but fails to give it proper thought, unfruitfulness is the result. The wicked one takes advantage of this lack of consideration, whether by distracting thoughts or through his own agents. Those who introduce unrelated subjects during the time when people should be reflecting on what they have heard fall into this category as well.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The similitude in this parable is alluded to in 1 Peter 1:23; James 1:21."
2. "The sower is first the Son of Man (Mat 13:37), then His ministers and servants (1Co 3:6) to the end."
3. "The parable itself is here most satisfactory as to the manner in which the Evil One proceeds. By fowls of the air passing thoughts and desires, which seem insignificant and even innocent does Satan do his work, and rob the heart of the precious seed."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "While any one is hearing, the evil one is coming and snatching away, just as the birds do not wait for the sower to be out of the way, but are at work while he is sowing." 
2. "He which received seed [ο σπαρεις] . Lit., and much better, Rev., He that was sown; identifying the seed of the figure with the man signified."

### John Calvin:
1. "He mentions, in the first place, the barren and uncultivated, who do not receive the seed within, because there is no preparation in their hearts."
2. "Such persons he compares to a stiff and dry soil, like what we find on a public road, which is trodden down, and becomes hard, like a pavement."
3. "The Gospel is always a fruitful seed as to its power, but not as to its produce."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The spoken word is made most prominent, as this was almost the only means used in the Apostolic age, to which this parable primarily refers."
2. "Active, personal apprehension is involved."
3. "Almost during the act of hearing. This is done through ‘birds,’ passing thoughts and desires; the purpose being ‘lest they should believe and be saved.’"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "While everyone is listening and not comprehending, the evil one comes and snatches away."
2. "The devil is busy with his job of snatching or seizing like a bandit or rogue the word of the kingdom before it has time even to sprout."
3. "The seed sown in his heart and 'the man sown by the wayside' are identified. The seed in the heart is not of itself responsible, but the man who lets the devil snatch it away."

### John Gill:
1. "By the 'seed' in the parable is meant the Gospel, called the 'word of the kingdom'... it treats of the king Messiah, of his person, office, and grace; and of his kingdom."
2. "He is one that is careless and inattentive, negligent and forgetful; has some slight notions of things as he hears, but these pass away as they come."
3. "This evil spirit, as soon as ever he observes one hearing the word, especially that has not been used to attend, comes immediately, and, as he is hearing, catcheth away that which is sown in his heart... the word is entirely lost to him, and he does not so much as remember the least thing he has been hearing."

### John Wesley:
1. "When any one heareth the word, and considereth it not — The first and most general cause of unfruitfulness."
2. "The wicked one cometh — Either inwardly; filling the mind with thoughts of other things; or by his agent."
3. "Such are all they that introduce other subjects, when men should be considering what they have heard."
