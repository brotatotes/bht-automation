# Matthew 13:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As he went into the vessel, great multitudes were gathered unto him from all walks of life, desiring to see and hear him better. Some came for one reason, and others came for another, each with their own unique needs and intentions. The vessel served as a means for Jesus to reach out to the people, as it provided a platform for him to speak to them, making his message accessible to all who stood on the shore, eager to learn and be enlightened.
