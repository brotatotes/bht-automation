# Matthew 13:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parable reminds us to examine ourselves thoroughly, lest our initial fervor in receiving the word of God quickly dissipates like a short-lived flame. It is commendable to receive the word with joy and without delay, but true firmness in faith is necessary to prevent it from withering at its early stage. If the word does not deeply penetrate the heart and take root, perseverance may be hindered. The hearer on stony ground may initially receive and believe the word with joy, but their faith lacks depth and firmness, akin to a plant growing on shallow soil.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "Let every one then examine himself thoroughly, that the alacrity which gives out a bright flame may not quickly go out, as the saying is, like a fire of tow."
2. "Great commendation is due, no doubt, to that promptitude, which receives the word of God with joy, and without delay, as soon as it is published; but let us learn, that nothing has been done, till faith acquires true firmness, that it may not wither in the first blade."
3. "If the word does not fully penetrate the whole heart, and strike its roots deep, faith will want the supply of moisture that is necessary for perseverance."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The effect is immediate and apparently good; but beneath the surface easily stirred, is a soil harder than the trodden path."
2. "Great joy without deep spiritual conviction or conflict."

### John Gill:
1. "Such a hearer, who is like to the stony ground on which the seed fell, is one that is not an accidental hearer of the word, as the former, but a settled constant hearer of it."
2. "He is one that not only constantly attends upon it, but he receives it; he gives an assent to it, he believes in it historically, makes a profession of his faith in it, and holds it for a while, being under some convictions of the truth of it."
3. "Having some speculative notions of it, and light in his understanding and judgment in it, he has some flashes of natural affection for it, and delivers some outward expressions of pleasure and delight in it, like Herod, and the hearers of John the Baptist; but has no heart work, and so is like to the rock in stony ground."

### John Wesley:
1. "The seed sown on stony places... sprang up soon, because it did not sink deep."
2. "He receiveth it with joy - Perhaps with transport, with ecstacy: struck with the beauty of truth, and drawn by the preventing grace of God."
