# Matthew 13:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This man's faith is not deep-rooted; it lacks the transformation and change that comes from a true encounter with God. Without a profound conviction of the truth and the work of grace, good intentions fade away easily. This individual is easily swayed by the challenges and difficulties of the Christian journey, finding excuses and justifications to abandon the narrow and difficult path.

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "Tribulation is perhaps as accurate a rendering as is possible, being derived from tribulum, the threshing - roller of the Romans."

### John Calvin:
1. "Such persons, according to Matthew and Mark, are temporary, not only because, having professed, for a time, that they are the disciples of Christ, they afterwards fall away through temptation, but because they imagine that they have true faith."
2. "At the same time we ought to learn, that they are not truly regenerated by the incorruptible seed, which never fadeth...in whom the truth of God, once fixed, never passes away, but retains its vigor to the end."
3. "Still, those persons who take delight in the word of God, and cherish some reverence for it, do in some manner believe; for they are widely different from unbelievers, who give no credit to God when he speaks, or who reject his word."

1. "The word is not rooted in him, nor has he the root of the matter, or the truth of grace in him."

3. "These try men's principles and professions, and whether the truth of grace is in them or not; and where it is not in any person, by and by he is offended; at the cross; he shrinks back from it, does not care to take it up, and follow Christ."
