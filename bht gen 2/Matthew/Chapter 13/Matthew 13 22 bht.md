# Matthew 13:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Many individuals start their spiritual journey with a love for the Word and a transformed heart, but as they progress, the cares of the world and the pursuit of wealth often lead them astray. These thorns of materialism and anxiety overwhelm their hearts, choking out the Word and hindering spiritual growth. The deceitfulness of riches promises satisfaction but fails to deliver, leading individuals away from the path of faith. These thorns, like weeds overtaking a field, consume the mind, divert attention from the Word's nourishment, and dampen any concern for its fruitfulness, resulting in an unfruitful and unfulfilled life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There is a divided will, a half-service which ever ends in the prevalence of evil over good."
2. "Less awful is the state of those who understand not the word and lose it immediately, than that of those who feel it, receive it with joy, and in time of trial fall away."
3. "Less awful again this last, than that of those who understand, feel, and practise, but are fruitless and impure."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ compares to thorns the pleasures of this life, or wicked desires, and covetousness, and the other anxieties of the flesh."
2. "As corn, which otherwise might have been productive, no sooner rises into the stalk than it is choked by thorns and other matters injurious to its growth; so the sinful affections of the flesh prevail over the hearts of men, and overcome faith, and thus destroy the force of the heavenly doctrine, before it has reached maturity."
3. "The deceitfulness of riches. Christ employs this phrase to denote covetousness. He expressly says, that riches are imposing or deceitful, in order that men may be more desirous to guard against falling into their snares."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The third class hold out longer, but are unfruitful, from a divided heart, in which evil triumphs; the thorns being hardier than the wheat."
2. "The care of the world, not pure worldliness, which belongs to the first class, but anxieties about worldly things distracting persons of serious mind."
3. "The deceitfulness of riches. Whether in the pursuit or possession of wealth. A false expectation or a false confidence in regard to wealth will choke the word."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Lust for money and care go together and between them spoil many an earnest religious nature."
2. "The thorns flourish and the character sickens and dies, choked to death for lack of spiritual food, air, sunshine."

### John Gill:
1. "One that not only shows a love to the word, but who seems to have his heart broken under it, and by it, his conscience tender, and his life outwardly reformed."
2. "Riches often delude, and lead persons out of the right way, out of God's way; cause them to err from the faith; they do not give the satisfaction they promise, and often do not continue, as is expected."
3. "These [thorns], all, and each of them, choke the word: by overspreading all the powers and faculties of the soul, as thorns do a field; by overtopping the seed of the word, and by hiding it from the influences of the sun of righteousness, and rain of grace; and by attracting everything in the heart to themselves; and by bearing and pressing down all thought, concern, and care for the use, fruitfulness, and increase of the word."

### John Wesley:
1. "He that received the seed among the thorns... hath root in himself, is deeply convinced, and in a great measure inwardly changed."
2. "Even in him, together with the good seed, the thorns spring up... till they gradually choke it, destroy all its life and power, and it becometh unfruitful."
3. "The deceitfulness of riches... they smile, and betray: kiss, and smite into hell. They put out the eyes, harden the heart, steal away all the life of God."
