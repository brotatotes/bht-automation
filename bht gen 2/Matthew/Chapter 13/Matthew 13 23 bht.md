# Matthew 13:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The different degrees of fruitfulness among believers can be seen in the varying proportions of the harvest they yield. While some may bear a hundredfold, others may bear sixty or thirty. This diversity in fruitfulness does not diminish the value or significance of each individual's contribution. It simply reflects the unique ways in which God's grace and the power of His Word work in the lives of different believers. The important thing is that each person is faithfully producing fruit according to the measure of faith and devotion they have received.
