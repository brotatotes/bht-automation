# Matthew 13:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
While men were sleeping, which is the opportune time for such malicious acts, the enemy deliberately sowed 'darnel' among the wheat. Darnel, or 'the tares,' is a deceptive weed that resembles wheat but is harmful in its effects. This act of malice is not uncommon, as it can render the church and its members susceptible to sin, a loss of Christ's presence, and spiritual poverty. The tares, representing the children of the wicked one, are unfruitful and detrimental, with a fate reserved for destruction.
