# Matthew 13:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When faith begins to sprout, it is crucial for believers to not only express it verbally but also demonstrate it through actions and adherence to Gospel teachings. True faith initially manifests in sincere sorrow for sin, reverence for God, humility, self-denial, and fervent love for Christ. However, it is important to note that the presence of false believers and their harmful doctrines may not be readily apparent. With time, their unfruitful lives and detrimental principles become discernible, causing harm to the church. Therefore, believers must remain vigilant and discerning in order to safeguard the purity of their faith communities.
