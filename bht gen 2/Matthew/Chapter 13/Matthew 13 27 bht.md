# Matthew 13:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ's faithful servants and people were taken aback by the discovery of false brethren within the Church. They had revered and obeyed their Master, Jesus, genuinely and wholeheartedly. They believed that only good could come from Christ and were unaware of how these deceitful individuals had infiltrated their midst. However, it is important to remember that evil does not originate from Christ; it is merely permitted rather than predestined. Just as darkness only emerges when the sun is absent, these false brethren appeared when genuine believers were not vigilant.
