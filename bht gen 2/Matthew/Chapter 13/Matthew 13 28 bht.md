# Matthew 13:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
An enemy has done this, which is a clear response to the age-old inquiry about the source of evil. It refers not to a human enemy, but to the devil, who is an implacable foe of humanity. Darnel, metaphorically representing those who have the appearance of godliness but lack its essence, can be found within the Church. However, indiscriminate efforts to remove these individuals by fallible humans may inadvertently uproot the genuine believers along with them.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "An enemy hath done this—Kind words these from a good Husbandman, honorably clearing His faithful servants of the wrong done to his field."
2. "The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?—Compare with this the question of James and John (Luke 9:54), 'Lord, wilt Thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume' those Samaritans? In this kind of zeal there is usually a large mixture of carnal heat."

### John Gill:
1. "An enemy has done this... meaning, not that the enemy was a man; for he was the devil, but it is an Hebraism... and signifies a certain enemy, and one indeed that is an implacable enemy to man."
2. "The servants... express the concern of the ministers of Christ for the true members of the church, lest they should receive any damage by the ill examples, and pernicious principles of evil men among them."
3. "They show great regard to the glory of God, and interest of religion, and their readiness to execute any orders Christ should give them."

### John Wesley:
1. "An enemy hath done this — A plain answer to the great question concerning the origin of evil."
2. "Darnel, in the Church, is properly outside Christians, such as have the form of godliness, without the power."
3. "Whereas should fallible men attempt to gather up the darnel, they would often root up the wheat with them."
