# Matthew 13:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
There is a difficulty in distinguishing the wheat from the weeds, as their roots are intertwined in the field. The impatience to purify the Church has sometimes resulted in uprooting the wheat with the weeds. Not everyone suspected of being false should be removed from the church as there is a risk involved. The parable teaches that a completely pure and perfect church cannot be expected in the present state. Therefore, believers should patiently endure until the appointed time when Christ will separate the tares from the wheat.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### John Gill:
1. "Not everyone suspected to be a tare, or a nominal professor, is to be removed from the communion of the church, because there is often danger in so doing."
2. "The scope of the parable, and the design of our Lord in it, are chiefly to be attended to; which are to show, that a pure and perfect church cannot be expected in the present state of things."
3. "Saints should not be immoderately uneasy, but patiently bear such exercises, until Christ's time is come to relieve them, when the tares and chaff shall be separated from the wheat."
