# Matthew 13:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parables of Jesus were not merely stories, but vivid word pictures that conveyed profound spiritual and moral truths. By using parables, Jesus engaged the imagination and attention of his listeners, making the teachings more memorable and impactful. Through these parables, Jesus revealed hidden truths to those who were humble and serious, while veiling them from the proud and careless. The parable of the sower, for example, depicted the nature of God's word, the work of ministers, and the varying outcomes of preaching. These parables served as powerful reminders of the importance of skillful teaching, patient waiting, and the transformative potential of God's truth.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "These parables are SEVEN in number and it is not a little remarkable that while this is the sacred number, the first FOUR of them were spoken to the mixed multitude, while the remaining THREE were spoken to the Twelve in private‚Äîthese divisions, four and three, being themselves notable in the symbolical arithmetic of Scripture."
2. "Another thing remarkable in the structure of these parables is, that while the first of the Seven‚Äîthat of the Sower‚Äîis of the nature of an Introduction to the whole, the remaining Six consist of three pairs‚Äîthe Second and Seventh, the Third and Fourth, and the Fifth and Sixth, corresponding to each other; each pair setting forth the same general truths, but with a certain diversity of aspect."
3. "First Parable: THE SOWER. This parable may be entitled, THE EFFECT OF THE WORD DEPENDENT ON THE STATE OF THE HEART."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "The unspiritual do not link these facts of the natural life with those of the supernatural, which are not discerned by them."
3. "The parable differs from the allegory in that there is in the latter 'an interpenetration of the thing signified and the thing signifying; the qualities and properties of the first being attributed to the last,' and the two being this blended instead of being kept distinct and parallel."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Behold, calling attention to what follows, not to some object in sight, which would have distracted attention from the parable."

### John Gill:
1. "This way of speaking by parables was much in use among the eastern nations, and particularly the Jews... what served to raise the attention of the hearer, and to fix what was delivered the more firmly in their minds."
2. "The design of [the parable of the sower] is to set forth the nature of the word of God, the work and business of the ministers of it, the different success of the preaching of it, and the fruitfulness of it."
3. "By 'sowing', is meant preaching; which, as sowing, requires knowledge and skill, and an open and liberal hand; keeping back nothing that is profitable, a declaring the same doctrine in one place as another; and designs a constant ministration of it, notwithstanding all discouragements, and a patient waiting for success."

### John Wesley:
1. "This way of speaking, extremely common in the eastern countries, drew and fixed the attention of many, and occasioned the truths delivered to sink the deeper into humble and serious hearers."
2. "By an awful mixture of justice and mercy, [the parables] hid [the truths] from the proud and careless."
3. "In this our Lord answers a very obvious and a very important question. The same sower, Christ, and the same preachers sent by him, always sow the same seed: why has it not always the same effect?"
