# Matthew 13:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the visible Church, both true believers and hypocrites coexist until the end of the world. The growth of the wheat, symbolizing true believers, is nurtured by the dews of divine grace, the influence of the Holy Spirit, and the word and ordinances. They grow in exercise of grace and spiritual knowledge. At the time of harvest, the angels will gather the tares, representing formal professors, hypocrites, and heretics, to be removed from the Kingdom. This parable illustrates the growth of the kingdom from its humble beginnings to its ultimate universality, when the Church will be pure and without blemish.

2. "The wheat, or true believers, 'grow' in the exercise of grace... and in spiritual knowledge of the will of God... which growth is owing to the dews of divine grace, to the sun of righteousness shining upon them, to the gracious influences of the blessed Spirit, and to the word and ordinances as means."
3. "And in the time of harvest, I will say to the reapers, the angels, gather ye together first the tares; that is, formal professors, hypocrites, and heretics; whom he will have removed out of his kingdom, his church, his field, in the world... when the churches will be pure, and without spot, or wrinkle."
