# Matthew 13:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The mustard seed, a symbol of smallness, represents the initial stages of divine grace and the Gospel ministry. Even the least amount of faith can lead to great outcomes. As the mustard tree grows from a tiny seed, it illustrates the rapid expansion of the Christian doctrine and the abundance of God's grace. The branches of the tree provide shelter and rest, attracting both external adherents and believers. This parable highlights the small beginnings of God's work, emphasizing the potential for immense growth and the influence of the Gospel in the world and in individual lives.
