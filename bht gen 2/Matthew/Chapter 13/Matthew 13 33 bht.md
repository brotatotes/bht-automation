# Matthew 13:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parable of the leaven illustrates the spread of the Gospel and its transformative power in the world. Just as leaven permeates the dough until it is completely leavened, the Gospel reaches the depths of the human soul, enlightening the understanding, transforming affections, and inspiring zeal for God. It unites believers in one body, with a shared faith and experience, making them like one another. As the three measures of meal represent the quantity usually baked at once, the parable suggests that the Gospel will eventually leaven the whole world and grace every believer.

2. "In the transforming power of the ‘new leaven’ on the whole being of individuals. 'In fact the Parable does nothing less than set forth to us the mystery of regeneration...'"

3. "The measure mentioned here probably contained about a peck and a half."

3. "The Gospel, where it takes place, warms the affections, causes the heart to burn within, inspires with zeal for God, and Christ, and the Gospel; it swells and fills churches with such as shall be saved, and assimilates the several persons it operates in, makes them like one another, one bread, one body, having like precious faith, knowledge, and experience, though in a different degree."
