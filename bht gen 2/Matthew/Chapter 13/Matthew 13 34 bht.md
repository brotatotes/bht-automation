# Matthew 13:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In that specific situation, Jesus exclusively used parables to address the multitude, refraining from any direct discourse or explanations. This choice to employ parables served the purpose of keeping the attention of the listeners aroused, as Jesus was aware that they were not yet fully prepared to receive instruction in a straightforward manner. By utilizing this method of teaching, Jesus ensured that the audience remained engaged until a more suitable time for comprehensive understanding.
