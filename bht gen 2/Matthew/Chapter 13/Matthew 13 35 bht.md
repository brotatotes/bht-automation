# Matthew 13:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The psalm being referred to contains a collection of historical events that serve as a pattern for us, teaching us important lessons. The events mentioned in the psalm were not fully understood until the Gospel was revealed by Christ. Inspired by God, the psalmist used parables and obscure sayings to convey profound truths that were hidden from the beginning of time. These hidden truths have been brought to light through the life and teachings of Jesus Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "in order that &c., not ‘so that thus,’ or ‘and in this way’ (?) as Webst. and Wilk., here, or any where else."
2. "When we find De Wette, &c. maintaining that the Psalm contains no parable, and that consequently these words can only be cited out of their context, we must remember that such a view is wholly inconsistent with any deep insight into the meaning of the Scripture record."
3. "for the whole Psalm consists of a recounting of events which St. Paul assures us τύποι ἡμῶν ἐγενήθησαν … τυπικῶς συνέβαινον ἐκείνοις, ἐγράφη δὲ πρὸς νουθεσίαν ἡμῶν."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying— ( :-, nearly as in the Septuagint). I will open my mouth in parables..." 
2. "Though the Psalm seems to contain only a summary of Israelitish history, the Psalmist himself calls it "a parable," and "dark sayings from of old"—as containing, underneath the history, truths for all time..."
3. "not fully brought to light till the Gospel day."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The verb, in which the sound corresponds to the sense, means originally to belch, to disgorge."
2. "There seems to lie in the word a sense of full, impassioned utterance, as of a prophet."
3. "Things long kept secret, and that were hidden indeed in the depths of the divine mind from before the foundation of the world, were involved in these dealings."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Prophet, when he is about to speak of God’s covenant, by which he adopted the seed of Abraham, of the benefits which he continued to bestow upon his people, and of the whole government of the Church, introduces his subject in lofty terms, I will open my mouth in parables, that is, 'I will not speak of trifling matters, but will handle with becoming gravity subjects of the highest importance.'"
2. "Hence, too, we infer, that there was no inconsistency in the various objects which Christ had in view, when he spoke to the people in a dark manner. Though he intended to conceal from the reprobate what he was saying, yet he labored to make them feel, even in the midst of their amazement, that there was something heavenly and divine in his language."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "That, i.e., ‘in order that’."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

### John Gill:
