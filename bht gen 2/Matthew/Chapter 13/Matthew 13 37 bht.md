# Matthew 13:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through His response to their request, Christ displays His willingness to share spiritual knowledge with His disciples, revealing His humility and affection towards them. In using the phrase the son of man, He refers to Himself, the Son of David, who sowed good seed in His field, representing His role as the one who spreads the Gospel for the conversion of sinners. This could also apply to His apostles and ministers who help bring about the growth of souls through preaching the Word.
