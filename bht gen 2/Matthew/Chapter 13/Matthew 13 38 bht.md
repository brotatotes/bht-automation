# Matthew 13:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parable highlights various counter-workings of Evil against God's grace. It emphasizes the universal sowing of good seed by the Gospel, symbolizing the future incarnation of the Lord. The presence of both good seed and tares within the world signifies the coexistence of believers and the children of wickedness. Ultimately, the separation between the two will occur at the end of the age.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The parable has, like the former ones, its various references to various counter-workings of the Evil One against the grace of God."
2. "As applying principally to the Œ≤Œ±œÉ . œÑ . Œø·ΩêœÅ . which lay in the future and began with the Lord‚Äôs incarnation, the parable sets forth to us the universal sowing of GOOD SEED by the Gospel."
3. "But in their state among the tares, waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The tares are the children of the wicked one‚ÄîAs this sowing could only be 'while men slept,' no blame seems intended, and certainly none is charged upon 'the servants'."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The field is the world. 'His field' (Matthew 13:24), hence some would limit this to the Church. But in that case the parable would not differ from the last of the series."
2. "The phrase can only mean the Church, as the Church is seeking to occupy the whole world. The gospel is good seed to be scattered everywhere; the intertwining of the roots suggests that the tares are in the Church also, as indeed Matthew 13:41 plainly implies."
3. "The sons of the kingdom the sons of the evil one. The reference is to persons, who represent and embody the two opposing influences and developments."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The field is the world... It is extremely important to understand that both the good seed and the darnel (tares) are sown in the world, not in the Kingdom, not in the church."
2. "The separation comes at the consummation of the age, the harvest time."
3. "They all grow together in the field (the world)."

### John Gill:
1. "The field is the world,.... That which is represented by 'the field'... is not only the land of Judea, where Christ preached in person, but the whole world..."
2. "The good seed are the children of the kingdom: they which are designed by the good seed... have both a meetness for it, and a right unto it, being the children of God by adoption..."
3. "The tares are the children of the wicked one: the persons intended by 'the tares'... manifestly show that they are of their father the devil; they resemble and imitate him, and do his works..."

### John Wesley:
1. The good seed are the children of the kingdom ‚Äî That is, the children of God, the righteous.
