# Matthew 13:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Along the path through the field, careless and inattentive listeners find themselves at risk of losing the seed of God's word, for birds that represent the devil are waiting to snatch it away. Even for those who manage to keep the word from being devoured, there are still dangers. Some receive it on stony ground and quickly fall away, while others allow thorns to grow and choke out any fruitfulness. Thus, it is crucial for all hearers of the word to pay close attention, guard against spiritual dangers, and cultivate a receptive heart that bears the fruit of righteousness.
