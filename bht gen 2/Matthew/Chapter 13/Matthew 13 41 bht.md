# Matthew 13:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, as the Son of Man, will send out his angels to gather all those who cause offense, whether through their wicked principles or infamous practices. These offenders hinder and grieve the children of God, obstructing the growth and fruitfulness of the good seed sown by Christ. They may profess religion, but their actions reveal them to be workers of iniquity, consistently doing evil. The angels will separate them from the righteous and remove all obstacles that impede the flourishing of God's kingdom.
