# Matthew 13:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The depiction of the furnace of fire in this passage is not meant to be taken literally, but rather as a metaphor for the indescribable punishment that awaits the wicked. This punishment is characterized by intense suffering, torment, and despair, as expressed through wailing and gnashing of teeth. It represents the wrath of God and serves to emphasize the remorse of conscience, inexpressible pain, and punishment that the wicked will endure. The use of such vivid language conveys the magnitude of their punishment and serves as a warning against the consequences of unrepentant sin.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "the furnace of fire": there shall be wailing and gnashing of teethâ€”What terrific strength of languageâ€”the "casting" or "flinging" expressive of indignation, abhorrence, contempt
2. the "wailing" signifying the anguish this causes; while the "gnashing of teeth" is a graphic way of expressing the despair in which its remedilessness issues

### John Calvin:
1. "This is a metaphorical expression; for, as the infinite glory which is laid up for the sons of God so far exceeds all our senses, that we cannot find words to express it, so the punishment which awaits the reprobate is incomprehensible."
2. "From ignorance of this, the Sophists have tortured themselves, to no purpose, by fruitless disputes."
3. "If we put a question to those who are so delighted with matters of curiosity, how it comes about that, while Christ is asleep, and unacquainted with the affair, the devil sows tares among the good seed, they will have nothing to reply."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "As the tares were burned, this may be figurative, but it undoubtedly refers to intolerable suffering, resulting not simply from the circumstances of the evildoers in a future state but from their character."
2. "There shall be the weeping. Comp. chap. Matthew 8:12. These awful words must mean something positive and punitive."

### John Gill:
1. "Not a material, but a metaphorical one; denoting the wrath of God, which shall fall upon wicked men, and abide upon them to all eternity."
2. "...expressing the vehemency and intenseness of divine wrath, which will be intolerable..."
3. "...declaring the remorse of conscience, the tortures of mind, the sense of inexpressible pain, and punishment, the wicked shall feel; also their furious rage and black despair."
