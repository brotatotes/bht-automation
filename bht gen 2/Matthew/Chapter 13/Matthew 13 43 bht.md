# Matthew 13:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The righteous shall shine forth like the sun, their light no longer obscured but bursting forth with the radiance of Christ's righteousness, possessing perfect holiness and eternal glory. This glorious state, belonging to those who have been adopted as children of God, is referred to as the kingdom of the Father, assuring the saints of their certain participation in it. It is described as a beauty and brilliance beyond compare, likened to the sun, moon, stars, planets, lightnings, and lilies. Daniel 12:3 is also referenced to highlight the same concept of shining forth in glory.
