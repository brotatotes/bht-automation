# Matthew 13:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The kingdom of heaven is like a hidden treasure, a valuable treasure that is often overlooked or concealed. Just as a man unexpectedly finds a treasure buried in a field, so too can we stumble upon the treasure of true faith and hope within the Church. The gospel, the truth of eternal life, is a treasure more precious than any worldly wealth. Like an elusive treasure, it must be diligently sought after and treasured with utmost devotion. The Gospel reveals the incomparable riches of God's grace and the eternal kingdom that awaits those who embrace it.

### Henry Alford:
1. "In this parable, a man, labouring perchance for another, or by accident in passing, finds a treasure which has been hidden in a field; from joy at having found it he goes, and selling all he has, buys the field, thus (by the Jewish law) becoming the possessor also of the treasure."
2. "Such hiding of treasure is common even now, and was much more common in the East."
3. "This sets before us the case of a man who unexpectedly, without earnest seeking, finds, in some part of the outward Church, the treasure of true faith and hope and communion with God; and having found this, for joy of it he becomes possessor... of the field at all hazards, to secure the treasure which is in it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
