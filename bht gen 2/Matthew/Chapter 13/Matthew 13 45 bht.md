# Matthew 13:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parable in Matthew 13:45 describes the kingdom of heaven as a merchant seeking goodly pearls. This merchant is a representation of Christ, who seeks and purchases his elect out of great love, valuing them highly. Those who diligently search for wisdom and knowledge through the Scriptures and the preaching of the Gospel will find the truths about Christ that are priceless. It is through the Gospel that a gathering of all kinds of people occurs, separating them through Christian discipline and exhortation, both in this world and the world to come.
