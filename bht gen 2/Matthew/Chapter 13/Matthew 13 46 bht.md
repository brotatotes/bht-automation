# Matthew 13:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The one pearl of great price is not stumbled upon by chance, but diligently sought after by someone whose sole purpose is to find and possess such treasures. Just as we cannot purchase the heavenly life with any earthly price, the act of 'buying' in this parable represents our willingness to give up the desires of the flesh. It is the surrendering of all worldly desires and considering everything else as loss in comparison to gaining Christ. The pursuit of this one pearl leads us to true religion and the discovery of the ultimate treasure.
