# Matthew 13:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parable of the net speaks of the separation of the holy and unholy in the Church, with the aim of selecting the former for the master's use. The Church itself is depicted as a net, gathering people from all backgrounds. This earthly net only provides a glimpse of the heavenly reality. The preaching of the Gospel is compared to a net, unveiling the mysteries of God's grace to the world. Through the Gospel net, souls from every kind and all nations are gathered into the Church. The separation, however, will occur at a later time.
