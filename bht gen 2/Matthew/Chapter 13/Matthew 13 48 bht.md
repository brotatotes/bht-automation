# Matthew 13:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
At the appointed time, the separation will occur to complete God's plan. The caution against hasty separation reminds us of the work still to be done by the Church. Just as fishermen do not sort their catch until they draw in their nets, the judgment will not happen until all have been called. Those without God's grace and righteousness will be rejected and cast into the lake of fire. The destiny of all will be revealed when the preaching ends and the Gospel completes its purpose.
