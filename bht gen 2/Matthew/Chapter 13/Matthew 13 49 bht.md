# Matthew 13:49 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Gospel draws multitudes into the visible Church, but some are Christians in name only, causing harm. This parable emphasizes the future separation of good and bad, contrasting the previous parable's focus on their present mixture. Just as a fisherman separates the good fish from the bad, the angels will come forth from heaven to separate the wicked from the just. The end result will be eternal life for one group and everlasting punishment for the other, with their separation being permanent.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "While the former parable gives chief prominence to the present mixture of good and bad, in the latter, the prominence is given to the future separation of the two classes."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Sever the wicked from among the just."
2. "The parable of the tares emphasized the existence with evil side by side with good; this, the separation and destruction of the evil."
3. "The final separating process accounts for the command: 'Let both grow together till the harvest; here it is the main point."

### John Gill:
