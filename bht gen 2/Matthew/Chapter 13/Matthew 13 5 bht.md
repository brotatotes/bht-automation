# Matthew 13:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Though some people may have a superficial understanding of the word of God and even show some signs of faith, their hearts remain hard and unchanged. Their convictions of sin are shallow, their affection for the word is fleeting, and their godliness is merely external. These individuals may seem receptive to the word on the surface, but their hearts are stubborn like an adamant stone. Only the powerful and effective work of God's grace can break such stony hearts, transforming them into hearts of flesh that are truly repentant, believing, and submissive to Christ.

### Henry Alford:
1. "τὰ πετρώδη (= τὴν πέτραν Luke), stony places where the native rock is but slightly covered with earth..."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Stony places. Not ground covered with loose stones, but a hard, rocky surface, covered with a thin layer of soil.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Upon the rocky places. Not full of stones, but thin soil over rocks." 
2. "Forthwith they sprung up, because, etc. The greater heat of the shallow soil would cause a rapid growth upwards."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The rocky places (τα πετρωδη). In that limestone country ledges of rock often jut out with thin layers of soil upon the layers of rock." 
2. "Straightway they sprang up (ευθεως εξανετειλεν). 'Shot up at once' (Moffatt)."
3. "Double compound (εξ, out of the ground, ανα, up). Ingressive aorist of εξανατελλω."

### John Gill:
1. "This is expressive of such persons who have slight convictions of sin, and awakenings of the natural conscience; some little, light, and speculative notions of the word, in the understanding and judgment; some flashes of natural affection for it, and outward expressions of delight and pleasure in it; some show of grace, and a form of godliness, but no real heart work."
2. "Though they did not refuse to hearken to the word externally, did not put away the shoulder, or stop their ears, yet their hearts were still like an adamant stone."
3. "Nothing but the mighty power of God, and his efficacious grace, can break the rocky heart in pieces; or give an heart of flesh, a sensible, soft, and flexible one, with which a man truly repents of sin, believes in Christ, and becomes subject to him."
