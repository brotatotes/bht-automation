# Matthew 13:52 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus teaches that every scribe who is instructed in the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings forth treasures, consisting of both new and old things. As disciples of the kingdom, we are called to share the old truths of God's word in new forms and illustrations. We must not selfishly conceal the knowledge we have received, but rather use it to instruct and communicate with others. This includes sharing both the familiar teachings and the unknown revelations, equipped with a zeal for the fullness of God's wisdom.
