# Matthew 13:53 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After Jesus finished teaching these parables, he departed from Capernaum and returned to his own country, Nazareth. However, his reception there was no different than before - the people of Nazareth still rejected him. This second rejection shows that even after some time had passed, there had been no change in the attitudes of the people towards Jesus.
