# Matthew 13:54 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people were astonished by Jesus' wisdom and miracles, unable to fathom how someone from their own town, with limited education and a humble background, could possess such divine knowledge. It seemed strange to them that he was able to teach new and unheard of doctrines, perform extraordinary miracles, and have such profound wisdom. However, their lack of understanding and misconceptions stemmed from their failure to place the emphasis on the right words and properly comprehend the meaning of certain texts. In order to aid in understanding, important words are emphasized in capital letters.
