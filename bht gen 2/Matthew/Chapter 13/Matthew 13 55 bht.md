# Matthew 13:55 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The identification of Jesus as the carpenter's son suggests that He was involved in a trade, possibly working with wood or other materials. His brethren, who were actually His kinsmen, were the sons of Mary, who was the sister of the Virgin Mary and the wife of Cleophas or Alpheus. One of these brethren is mentioned by name as James, who is also referred to as the Lord's brother by Paul. These details shed light on Jesus' human background and the close connections He had within His own family.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is an enquiry of much interest and some difficulty, who these [the brothers of Jesus] were. After long examination of the evidence on the subject, I believe that the truth will best be attained by disencumbering the mind in the first place of all Ã  priori considerations, and traditions (which last are very inconsistent and uncertain), and fixing the attention on the simple testimony of Scripture itself."
2. "The silence of the Scripture narrative leaves it free for Christians to believe these to have been real (younger) brethren and sisters of our Lord, without incurring any imputation of unsoundness of belief as to His miraculous conception."
3. "The account of the miraculous conception is not mythical, in which case all would have been arranged to suit the views of virginity from which it had arisen, but strictly historical, found as it is with no such arrangements or limitations."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "These particulars of our Lord's human history constitute the most valuable testimony, first, to His true and real humanity."
2. "They prove that during all His first thirty years His townsmen had discovered nothing about Him different from other men."
3. "Secondly, to the divine character of His missionâ€”for these Nazarenes proclaim both the unparalleled character of His teaching and the reality and glory of His miracles, as transcending human ability."

### John Calvin:
1. "It was, we are aware, by the wonderful purpose of God, that Christ remained in private life till he was thirty years of age."
2. "They see God working in Christ, and intentionally turn away their eyes from this sight, to behold Joseph, and Mary, and all his relatives; thus interposing a veil to shut out the clearest light."
3. "The word brothers, we have formerly mentioned, is employed, agreeably to the Hebrew idiom, to denote any relatives whatever."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word rendered 'carpenter' is sometimes applied to artisans in general, but it means strictly a worker in wood."
2. "The question, though not contemptuous, implies: He is one of us, no better than we are, etc."
3. "They knew His family, and mention the name of His mother and brothers, speaking also of His sisters, who possibly still resided in Nazareth."

### John Gill:
1. "The generally received notion of the ancient Christians is, that he was a carpenter, and that Jesus was brought up to the same business, which lay in making ploughs and yokes."
2. "Plain Mary, without any other title, or civil respect; a poor spinstress, that got her bread by her hand labour: the Jews say she was a plaiter of women's hair, and treat her with the utmost scorn."
3. "The Jews ought not to have made these remarks, since many of their great doctors were of mean parentage; as R. Zachariah was a butcher's son, and R. Jochanan a blacksmith's son."

### John Wesley:
1. "The carpenter's son - The Greek word means one that works either in wood, iron, or stone."
2. "His brethren - Our kinsmen. They were the sons of Mary, sister to the virgin, and wife of Cleophas or Alpheus."
3. "James - Styled by St. Paul also, the Lord's brother, Galatians 1:19."
