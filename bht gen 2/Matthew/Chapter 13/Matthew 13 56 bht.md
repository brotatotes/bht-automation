# Matthew 13:56 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The identity of the brethren and sisters referred to in the passage remains unclear. One view suggests that they were Mary and Salome, who were possibly Joseph's daughters from a previous marriage. However, another opinion suggests that these individuals were well-known residents of the same town as Jesus. Despite these speculations, there is no concrete evidence to definitively answer this question, leaving it surrounded by uncertainty and subject to debate.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "An exceedingly difficult question here arisesâ€”What were these 'brethren' and 'sisters' to Jesus?"
2. "For the second opinion there is no ground but a vague tradition, arising probably from the wish for some such explanation."
3. "Thus dubiously we prefer to leave this vexed question, encompassed as it is with difficulties."

### John Gill:
1. "Whose names, according to Epiphanius, were Mary and Salome; whom he supposes were the daughters of Joseph, by a former wife."
2. "Lived in the same town with them, were well known by them, and familiar with them."
3. "For since he had not them from any of their schools, and nurseries of learning, from their learned doctors and wise men; and could not have received them from his parents, and near relations, they could not devise from whence he should have them."
