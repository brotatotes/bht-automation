# Matthew 13:58 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He did not perform many miracles there, not because he lacked the ability, but because the people did not believe in him. This shows that God requires faith in order for his miraculous works to take place. When there is little true belief and prayer is cold and formal, the people remain spiritually dead and are not blessed. The lack of faith in Jesus hinders the manifestation of his power and demonstrates the need for belief in order to receive his blessings.
