# Matthew 13:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The thorns represent hearers who appeared contrite and reformed outwardly, but were internally filled with sinful lusts. They symbolize those whose hearts were like the cursed earth, rejecting God's word and nearing His wrathful judgement. These thorny cares and lusts choke the word, rendering ordinances and opportunities futile. Just as thorns suffocate and kill plants, the presence of sinful desires suffocates and kills the spiritual life within individuals.
