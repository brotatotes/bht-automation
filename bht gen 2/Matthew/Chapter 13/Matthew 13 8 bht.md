# Matthew 13:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parable of the sower mentions a type of ground referred to as good ground. This signifies individuals who possess soft and receptive hearts, unlike the stony or thorny ground. These honest-hearted hearers are likened to well-cultivated soil that is not trampled or tarnished. They are described as people who have been transformed by the grace and Spirit of God. Like fertile ground that produces a bountiful harvest, these individuals can bear abundant fruits of grace, each in their own unique level of fruitfulness. (89 words)
