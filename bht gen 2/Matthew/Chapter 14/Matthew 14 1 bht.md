# Matthew 14:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Herod Antipas, ruler of a fourth part of his father's dominion, had not heard of Jesus until after the death of John the Baptist. This may have been due to Herod's absence or preoccupation with other matters. However, the fame of Jesus' preaching and miracles spread widely, reaching even the court of Herod.
