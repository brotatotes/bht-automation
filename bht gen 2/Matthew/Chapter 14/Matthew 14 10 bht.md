# Matthew 14:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The executioner, an officer involved in beheadings, carried out the act of beheading John the Baptist. It is remarkable how divine providence allowed the life of such a righteous man to end in the hands of someone associated with such infamy. Yet, we must trust in God's justice and know that He will reward His faithful servants in the hereafter for any suffering endured in this present life.
