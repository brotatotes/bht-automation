# Matthew 14:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After the death of John the Baptist, Herodias took cruel delight in the triumph of her implacable hatred towards him for reproving her and Herod Antipas for their forbidden marriage. With a macabre satisfaction, she had John's head presented on a platter to the little girl, who then carried it to her mother. This act mirrored the vindictive nature of Herodias, similar to the story of Fulvia piercing Cicero's head with a needle. However, this moment of triumph was short-lived, as divine judgement would soon come upon Herod and Herodias for their sinful actions.
