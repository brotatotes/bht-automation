# Matthew 14:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In response to the death of John the Baptist, Jesus withdrew to a desert place on foot, in contrast to the multitude who traveled by land. This retreat served multiple purposes: to provide a safe haven away from Herod's suspicions, to give Jesus an opportunity to teach and train his disciples away from distractions, and to offer solace to his weary disciples who had just returned from their mission. Additionally, this withdrawal demonstrated the disciples' deep affection and dedication to Jesus, as they eagerly followed him even in his moments of seclusion.
