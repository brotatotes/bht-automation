# Matthew 14:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As the day was coming to a close, around 3 p.m., the disciples grew concerned about the remote location and lack of food for the crowds. They suggested sending them away to nearby villages to buy provisions. However, Jesus assured them that there was no need for the people to leave. He wanted the disciples to provide for the crowd themselves. By delaying the miracle until this moment, Jesus allowed the disciples to witness His power and faithfulness firsthand. He wanted to show that those who rely on Him will be nourished, even in seemingly impossible situations.
