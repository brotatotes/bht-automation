# Matthew 14:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When faced with the daunting task of feeding a large crowd, it seemed impossible for the disciples to fulfill Jesus' command to provide food. However, they obeyed through Christ's power and were able to find enough provisions to meet the people's need. The disciples, caught off guard by Jesus' astounding command, were reminded that no situation appeared desperate or unmanageable to Him. Despite their limited resources, Jesus challenged them to trust in His ability to provide and insisted that they give what they had to offer.

2. "Those who wish to have Christ for their provider, must first learn not to long for refined luxuries, but to be satisfied with barley-bread."
3. "Forming so high an estimate of the sum of money that would be required to purchase bread barely sufficient for procuring a morsel to the people, they are entitled to no small praise for their obedience, when they implicitly comply with the command of Christ, and leave the result to his disposal."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Obedience seemed impossible, but they did obey through Christ’s power providing the means for them."
2. "Duty is measured by Christ’s command, not by our resources."
