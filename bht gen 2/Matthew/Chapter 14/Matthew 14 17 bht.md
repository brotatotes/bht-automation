# Matthew 14:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples, though initially doubtful and perplexed, did their best to obey Jesus by seeking food for the multitude. Just as we often do, they quickly came up with reasons for their inability to fulfill the task at hand. Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, even questioned the practicality of the meager provision of five loaves and two fishes, asking what they could possibly be among such a large gathering. They failed to consider the power of Christ, who was more than capable of multiplying and making this seemingly ordinary food sufficient for the entire crowd.
