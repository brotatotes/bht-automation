# Matthew 14:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Matthew 14:18, Jesus tells His disciples to bring Him the five loaves and two fishes, symbolizing their meager provisions. This request highlights the disciples' doubt and Jesus' unwavering courage. It also reminds us that when we place our limited resources into Christ's hands, they become valuable and sufficient. Jesus uses their mention of the loaves and fishes as a reason for action, prompting us to bring what we have and trust Him for an increase, not only benefiting others but also receiving an overabundance in return.
