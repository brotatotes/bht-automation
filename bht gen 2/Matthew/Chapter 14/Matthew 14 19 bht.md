# Matthew 14:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As the multitude gathered on the grassy slope, Jesus commanded them to sit down before him, a directive they would not have obeyed on their own. He then blessed the five loaves and two fishes, breaking the loaves and dividing the fishes to be distributed among the people. It is remarkable to witness that all the people received their sustenance directly from Christ, who provided for and nourished them. This miracle serves as a powerful reminder of Jesus' authority and his ability to meet the physical needs of his followers.
