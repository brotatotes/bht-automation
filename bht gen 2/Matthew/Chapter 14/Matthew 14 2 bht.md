# Matthew 14:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Herod, who had previously denied the resurrection of the dead as a Sadducee, was now confronted with the undeniable reality of John the Baptist's return from the dead. His guilty conscience drove him to acknowledge that John had been raised, a truth that even the denial of Sadduceeism could not withstand.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is he, that...in the terrors of a guilty conscience, doubtless gave utterance to these words himself."
2. "There is no allusion here to metempsychosis, but to the veritable bodily resurrection, and supposed greater power acquired by having passed through death."
3. "This is an incidental confirmation of John 10:41, where we read that John wrought no miracle while living."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The murdered prophet haunted his guilty breast like a specter and seemed to him alive again and clothed with unearthly powers in the person of Jesus."
2. "This is John the Baptist: he is risen from the dead."
3. "For the exposition of this portion, see on :-."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Herod feared John. His conscience smote him for his crimes."
2. "He knew him to be a distinguished prophet; and he concluded that no other one was capable of working such miracles but he who had been so eminent a servant of God in his life, and who, he supposed, had again risen from the dead and entered the dominions of his murderer."
3. "The alarm in his court, it seems, was general. Herod’s conscience told him that this was John."

### John Calvin:
1. "It was a superstition deeply rooted, as we have formerly mentioned, in the minds of men, that the dead return to life in a different person."
2. "The Jews, with their usual grossness of interpretation, had applied this to Elijah the Tishbite, (1 Kings 17:1,) as if he were to appear again and discharge the office of a prophet."
3. "The Redeemer is at hand, who had been so clearly pointed out by the preaching of John, and who himself testifies respecting his office. They are compelled to acknowledge that some divine power belongs to him, and yet they fall into their own fancies, and change him into the persons of other men."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This is John the Baptist. Comp. Luke 9:7-9. This does not imply a belief in the transmigration of souls, nor prove that Herod was a Sadducee (although some infer this from Mark 8:15); it is the perplexed and terrified utterance of a guilty conscience." 
2. "Therefore, etc. John had wrought no miracle (chap. Matthew 10:41), but Herod supposed that the rising from the dead had resulted in higher powers."
3. "Powers, or 'mighty works' as in chap. Matthew 13:54; Matthew 13:58. Herod’s desire to see our Lord was at best a patronizing condescension to the gospel."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "His servants...the courtiers, not the menials of the palace."
2. "A guilty conscience quickened his fears. Possibly he could see again the head of John on a charger."
3. "There were many conjectures about Jesus as a result of this tour of Galilee and Herod Antipas feared this one."

### John Gill:
1. "This is John the Baptist: some copies add, 'whom I have beheaded'...the guilt of which action rose in his mind, lay heavy on him, and filled him with horror and a thousand fears."
2. "He is risen from the dead...was extorted from him by his guilty conscience; who now fears, what before he did not believe; and what he fears, he affirms; concluding that John was raised from the dead, to give proof of his innocence, and to revenge his death on him."
3. "These miracles which were wrought by him, were convincing proofs of the truth of his resurrection, and of what he was able to do to him, and what he might righteously expect from him."

### John Wesley:
1. He is risen from the dead — Herod was a Sadducee: and the Sadducees denied the resurrection of the dead. But Sadduceeism staggers when conscience awakes.
