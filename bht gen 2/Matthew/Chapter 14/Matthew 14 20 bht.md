# Matthew 14:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The feeding of the multitude showcased the abundance of Jesus, as the fragments that remained after everyone had eaten were over twelve times the original quantity. This served as a lasting proof of the miracle. The pieces distributed were not scraps, but portions broken by Jesus and preserved in the twelve baskets. This demonstrated carefulness and economy, ensuring that nothing went to waste. The multitude and disciples were fully satisfied, both physically and in experiencing God's abundant grace.

### Henry Alford:
1. "The cophinus was the usual accompaniment of the Jew: see Juv Sat. iii.14 â€˜JudÃ¦is, quorum cophinus fÅ“numque supellex;â€™ and Sat. vi. 542."
2. "Reland, whom SchÃ¶ttgen (in loc.) follows, supposes that the basket was to carry their own meats on a journey, for fear of pollution by eating those of the Gentiles, and the hay to sleep on for the same reason."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word for basket used in relating the feeding of the four thousand (Matthew 14:37) is spuriv, a large provision - basket or hamper, of the kind used for letting Paul down over the wall at Damascus (Acts 9:25)."
2. "In Matthew 16:9, Matthew 16:10, Christ, in alluding to the two miracles, observes the distinctive term in each narrative; using kofinouv in the case of the five thousand, and spuridav in the other."
3. "Burgon (" Letters from Rome ") gives a drawing of a wicker basket used by the masons in the cathedral at Sorrento, and called coffano. He adds, 'Who can doubt that the basket of the gospel narrative was of the shape here represented, and that the denomination of this basket exclusively has lingered in a Greek colony, where the Jews (who once carried the cophinus as a personal equipment) formerly lived in great numbers?'"

### John Calvin:
1. "The fragments that remained after satisfying so vast a multitude of men were more than twelve times larger in quantity than what was at first put into their hands, and this contributed not a little to the splendor of the miracle."
2. "Christ intended that, after the miracle had been wrought, a striking proof of it should still remain, which, after being refreshed by food, they might contemplate at leisure."
3. "Christ intended to declare that, as all things have been delivered into his hands by the Father, so the food which we eat proceeds from his grace."

2. "Not the scraps upon the ground, but the pieces broken by Jesus and still in the 'twelve baskets' and not eaten."
3. "Each of the twelve had a basketful left over. One hopes that the boy who had the five loaves and two fishes to start with got one of the basketsful, if not all of them."

### John Gill:
1. "They were satisfied, they had a full meal, they had enough, and to spare."
2. "There was fulness, and more left than was first had; which was gathered up, either for the use of the poor, or reserved for after service; teaching us liberality to the needy, and frugality, not to waste that which is left."
3. "It may be inquired, where they could have so many baskets in the wilderness? It is not likely, that everyone of the apostles had a basket with him; it is indeed not improbable, but that they might be furnished with them from some in the company, who might bring provisions with them, either for their own use, or to sell."
