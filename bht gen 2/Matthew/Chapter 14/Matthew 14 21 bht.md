# Matthew 14:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A seemingly impossible task was set before Jesus - to feed a multitude of people with only five loaves and two fishes. This miracle was extraordinary, as the number of men alone accounted for five thousand. However, Matthew adds that this number does not include women and children who were also present. It is possible that the crowd was even larger, as the Jews did not usually count their women, who could have been a significant number. It is worth noting that among this vast audience, there were those who came out of mere curiosity or with ulterior motives.
