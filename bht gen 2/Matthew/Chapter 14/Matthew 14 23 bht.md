# Matthew 14:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In order to pray sincerely and demonstrate his humanity, Jesus secluded himself in a mountain to communicate his thoughts and affection to the Father. By finding solitude away from distractions, he prioritized his prayer life and sought the Father's sympathy and support during this crucial time. Despite the expectations of the Jews, Jesus disregarded societal norms and preferred to pray in serene and secluded locations, regardless of their height or grandeur. He valued the opportunity to pour out his soul and intercede for others in places that offered privacy and intimacy with God.
