# Matthew 14:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
According to Jewish tradition, the evening mentioned in this context likely refers to the time after sunset. This is significant because it indicates that the miraculous event occurred during the night, after darkness had fallen. By performing this miracle in the evening, Jesus demonstrated his divine power to provide for his followers in any circumstance, even in the darkness of night.
