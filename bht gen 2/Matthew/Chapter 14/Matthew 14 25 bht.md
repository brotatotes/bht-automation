# Matthew 14:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the early morning hours, Jesus walked on the water, defying the laws of nature and revealing Himself as the true God. Between three and six in the morning, during the fourth watch of the night, Jesus appeared to His disciples on the sea, demonstrating His authority over creation. It is clear that Jesus physically walked on the water, not just along the shore. In the midst of the storm, Peter, recognizing Jesus, stepped out of the boat in firm belief. His boldness came from his unwavering faith in the Lord.
