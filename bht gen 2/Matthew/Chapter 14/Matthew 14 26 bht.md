# Matthew 14:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples were troubled and afraid when they saw a man walking on the waters, mistaking him for a spirit or apparition. The fear of such supernatural beings arises from their uncommonness, superior power, and enmity towards humankind. It is a common belief that spirits often appear to the living, fostering a sense of fear and vulnerability. Furthermore, sailors often view such sights as omens of impending danger, drawing from their superstitious beliefs. Therefore, the disciples' reaction was not unfounded but rooted in the unfamiliar and mysterious nature of the situation.
