# Matthew 14:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus appears to his disciples amidst the storm, reassuring them with his presence and urging them to courage. He is the Deliverer they have been waiting for, and they should not be afraid. Sometimes, we may not recognize Christ's nearness and may be filled with fear and dread. But when we have a clear understanding of who Christ is and the grace he extends, our fears vanish, our faith grows, and we are ready to follow and obey his commands.
