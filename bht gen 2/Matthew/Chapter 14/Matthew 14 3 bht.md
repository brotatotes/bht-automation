# Matthew 14:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this account, it is revealed that Herod had taken his brother Philip's wife, Herodias, while Philip was still alive. This situation highlights the immoral nature of their relationship and the disregard for the sanctity of marriage. Their actions were scandalous and went against the established societal norms. The fact that Philip was alive makes this transgression even more egregious, as Herod and Herodias openly defied the laws governing marriage and engaged in a forbidden union.
