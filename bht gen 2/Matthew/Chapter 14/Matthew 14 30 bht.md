# Matthew 14:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter, a fisherman and a good swimmer, was afraid when he saw the wind boisterous. His faith, although imperfect, enabled him to call out to Jesus for help. However, his natural courage and strength were withdrawn as grace began to act. Peter's faith was strong enough to recognize that only Jesus could save him from sinking in the treacherous waves, even though he had been used to the sea and was skilled in swimming.
