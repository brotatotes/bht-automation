# Matthew 14:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him, showing that Peter's situation required immediate assistance, and Christ readily gave it. He reached out his hand at once and caught him while he was sinking, lifting him up and setting him on his feet upon the water. Jesus does not condemn Peter as an unbeliever or one without faith, for he had some faith, albeit small.
