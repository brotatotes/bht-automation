# Matthew 14:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people who had been fed by Jesus sought Him in the city but could not find Him there. It is implied that they found Him somewhere else, having seen and heard Him before. This suggests that Jesus had passed through other places on His way to Capernaum, as mentioned in Mark's account. Despite not finding Jesus where they expected Him, the people remained determined in their search, showing their faith and affectionate regard for their fellow countrymen. Their actions serve as an example for us to diligently seek Jesus, recognizing Him when we encounter Him in our lives.
