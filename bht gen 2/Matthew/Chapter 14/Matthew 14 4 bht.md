# Matthew 14:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
John the Baptist fearlessly reproved Herod Antipas and Herodias for their unlawful marriage. Their union was condemned for three reasons: Herodias was still married to Philip, Herod's brother; Herod's former wife fled upon hearing of the intended marriage; and their relationship violated the laws of consanguinity. John's boldness showcased his zeal for holiness, courageously speaking out against sin. His uncompromising words reflected his unwavering commitment to upholding God's law, even at the cost of his own freedom and ultimately his life. He fearlessly proclaimed the truth, unwilling to soften his message to appease the wicked ruler.

3. "Herod Antipater was a very wicked and pernicious man, many of the wise men of Israel he slew with the sword; and he took to wife, his brother Philip's wife, whilst he was living; and because John the high priest reproved him for this, he slew him with the sword, with many of the wise men of Israel."
