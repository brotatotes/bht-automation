# Matthew 14:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Herod, initially reluctant to put John to death, was restrained from doing so by both political and religious considerations. The fear of an uprising among the people and the high esteem in which John was held as a righteous and virtuous man by the Jews prevented Herod from succumbing to his passion and carrying out the cruel act. The people viewed John as a true prophet and treated him with great respect and honor, recognizing the wisdom and moral guidance he offered.
