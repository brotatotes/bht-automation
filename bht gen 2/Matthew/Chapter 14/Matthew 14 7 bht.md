# Matthew 14:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Herod, captivated by Salome's dance, promised her whatever she desired and then confirmed his pledge with an oath, going so far as to offer her to the half of his kingdom. This extravagant language was a customary way for rulers to demonstrate their generosity. Yet, this promise, made for the sake of a dance, was imprudent and impulsive. Theophylact wonders if Herod would have followed through had Salome asked for his own head. Yet, his oath, sworn on his own head, provided an opportunity for Salome to cleverly demand the head of John the Baptist, albeit unjustly.

### Philip Schaff:

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Promised with an oath" (μετα ορκου ωμολογησεν): Literally, "confessed with an oath."
2. "For this verb in the sense of promise, see Acts 7:17."
3. "Note middle voice of αιτησητα (ask for herself). Cf. Esther 5:3; Esther 7:2."

### John Gill:
1. "He first promised her, to give her whatsoever she would ask; and then repeating it, he confirmed it with an oath; adding, as Mark says, that he would give it her, even 'to the half of his kingdom': a way of speaking used by princes, when they give full power to persons to ask what they will of them; and to express their great munificence and liberality."
2. "A very foolish promise, and a rash oath these, which were made upon such a consideration, as only a fine dance."
3. "If she, as Theophylact observes, had asked for his head, would he have given it her? And if he swore by his head, which was a common form of swearing with the Jews, she very appropriately, though unjustly, as Dr. Lightfoot observes, answers to him; 'as you have swore by your head, give me John Baptist's head.'"
