# Matthew 14:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Salome's request for John the Baptist's head, brought to her in a dish, was influenced by her mother's guidance. Herodias wanted to ensure John's death and revel in his demise. Salome demanded immediate action to prevent King Herod from reconsidering. The choice of a dish to present the head was a cruel and demeaning gesture, reflecting the twisted nature of both mother and daughter.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The correct rendering slightly relieves Salome of the charge of wanton cruelty, and throws it wholly upon Herodias."
2. "She demanded it on the spot, before Herod should have had time to reflect and relent; the more so, as she knew his respect for John."
3. "The Revisers cannot be defended in their retention of this thoroughly obsolete word. A charge is originally a burden; and a charger something loaded. Hence, a dish."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Being let on by her mother. Instigated rather than instructed."
2. "The motherâ€™s purpose had already been formed, and her answer shows great vindictiveness and determination."
3. "This seems to have been added by Salome herself, â€˜as a hideous jest, implying an intention to devour itâ€™."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It should require a good deal of 'educating' to bring a young girl to make such a grim request."
2. "On the spot. Here and now."
3. "Dish, plate, platter. Why the obsolete 'charger'?"

### John Gill:
1. "She desires his head, and this to be brought to her in a large dish, that her mother might be sure of his death; and have an opportunity of insulting that mouth and tongue, that had spoke against her incestuous marriage."
2. "And she desires to have it given 'here', in that very place, at that very time, where, and while the company was together, who were witnesses of the king's promise and oath; and this she did, lest when the festival was over, and he was out of his cups, he should repent of his folly and rashness."
3. "The mother and daughter seem to be much alike, both for lasciviousness, revenge, and cruelty."

### John Wesley:
1. "Being before instructed by her mother â€” Both as to the matter and manner of her petition"
2. "Fearing if he had time to consider, he would not do it"
3. "John the Baptist's head in a charger - A large dish or bowl."
