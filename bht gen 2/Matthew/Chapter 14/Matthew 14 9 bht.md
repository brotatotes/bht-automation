# Matthew 14:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Out of fear of a potential uprising and to avoid breaking his oath, Herod reluctantly decided to exile Herodias' husband. However, his grief and disturbance over the situation did not absolve him from the wickedness of complying with the demand to execute John the Baptist. Despite being troubled about the decision being taken out of his hands, Herod's wavering opinion and the influence of his courtiers ultimately led to the tragic outcome. Sadly, Herod's tender conscience only served to justify his sinful act, choosing to commit murder rather than be guilty of perjury.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "[Herod] was opposed by the emissaries of Agrippa, and was exiled to Lugdunum."
2. "Herod was grieved because he heard John gladly, and from policy did not wish to put him to death on so slight a cause."
3. "His estimate of John was wavering and undecided, and he was annoyed at the decision being taken out of his hands by a demand, compliance with which would be irrevocable."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word is plural, and the Rev. rightly renders for the sake of his oaths."
2. "It is implied that Herod in his mad excitement had confirmed his promise with repeated oaths."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Grieved’ rather than ‘sorry.’ Disturbed rather than penitent. The emotion was in keeping with his character and feelings toward John but was of no avail; compliance with the murderous request was the more criminal because he was ‘grieved."
2. "The oath was foolish, and was sinfully kept. Better break our word than God’s Word. Herod was scrupulous on this point, and yet an adulterer and murderer."
3. "His courtiers were probably hostile to John. In any case the fear of men, so powerful for evil, influenced him."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Herod, however, shrank from so dastardly a deed as this public display of brutality and bloodthirstiness."
2. "Men who do wrong always have some flimsy excuses for their sins."
3. "A man here orders a judicial murder of the most revolting type 'for the sake of his oath.'"

### John Gill:
1. "As also on account of the people, who were so much affected to John, lest they should make an insurrection, and rebel against him..."
2. "That he might not be guilty of perjury, [Herod] chose rather to commit murder..."
3. "Or it may be, they, either to curry favour with Herodias, or out of ill will they might bear to John; or in great respect to the damsel, who had so well pleased them with her dancing; instead of dissuading him from it, pressed him much to perform his promise..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Knowing that John was a good man."
2. "So he murdered an innocent man from mere tenderness of conscience."
