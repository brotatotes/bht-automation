# Matthew 15:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Scribes and Pharisees, known for being enemies of Jesus, traveled to Galilee to investigate the reports they had heard about him. Specifically, the group from Jerusalem consisted of highly knowledgeable and religiously experienced individuals who held great influence. It is likely that they either acted on behalf of or with the authority of the sanhedrim, the Jewish council. Their purpose was to engage with Jesus, observe his words and actions, and possibly exert their power by correcting, directing, and advising him.
