# Matthew 15:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ calls the people to come closer to Him, recognizing that they were more open and teachable than the hypocritical Pharisees. He reflects on the inability of the learned scholars to truly understand Him, and seeks to capture the attention of the multitude. Merely hearing with the outward ear is not enough; true understanding comes from truly listening and comprehending.
