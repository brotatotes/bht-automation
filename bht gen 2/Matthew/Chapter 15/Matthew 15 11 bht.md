# Matthew 15:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
No types of food or drink, when consumed in moderation, make a person impure or detestable in God's eyes. It is sin, originating in the heart, expressed by the mouth, or carried out through actions, that defiles a person and makes them loathsome to God. Even the words we speak have a defiling influence, polluting both ourselves and those who hear them.
