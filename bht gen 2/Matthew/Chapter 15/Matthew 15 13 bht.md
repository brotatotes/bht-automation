# Matthew 15:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Every plant, every teaching, every doctrine that is not of divine planting, that does not come from God Himself, will eventually be uprooted and destroyed. The teaching of the Pharisees, though claimed to be authoritative, was entirely of human origin and thus it would not endure. It is important for us to discern and reject any doctrine that is not from God, trusting in the promise that such teachings will ultimately be rooted out. We must be rooted in Christ, firmly established in His truth, in order to withstand the influence of false and corrupt teachings.

### Henry Alford:
1. "The plant is the teaching of the Pharisees, altogether of human, and not of divine planting."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up—They are offended, are they? Heed it not: their corrupt teaching is already doomed."
2. "The garden of the Lord upon earth, too long cumbered with their presence, shall yet be purged of them and their accursed system."

### John Calvin:
1. "There is no reason to wonder if the doctrine of salvation shall prove deadly to the reprobate, because they are always carried headlong to the destruction to which they are doomed."
2. "To those who willingly perish the Gospel thus becomes, as Paul assures us, the savor of death unto death, for, though it is offered to all for salvation, it does not yield this fruit in any but the elect."
3. "Christ rises higher, and asserts that no man will remain steadfast, unless his salvation be secured by the election of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Pharisees claimed Divine authority for their teaching; our Lord declares by implication that it was wholly human and as such should be rooted up, taken away and destroyed, to make room for a plant of His planting, the purer doctrine of the kingdom."
2. "It was a declaration of a purpose to oppose the Pharisees. To us it is a promise, with a terrible side indeed, but bidding us take courage when we see false and corrupt religion flourishing; it ‘shall be rooted up.'"

### John Gill:
1. "Whatever doctrine is not delivered by God...must be opposed and rejected; and sooner or later will be utterly rooted up, and destroyed."
2. "There are some plants, which are planted by Christ's Father, which is in heaven...they are themselves planted in the courts of the Lord, in a Gospel church state; and being watered with the dews of grace, appear to be choice plants, plants of renown, pleasant ones, very fruitful, and which shall never perish, or be rooted, and plucked up."
3. "These get into churches, and are outwardly and ministerially planted there; but being never rooted in Christ, nor partake of his grace, in time they wither, and die away; or persecution arising because of the Word, or truth being dispensed in so clear and glaring a light, that they cannot bear it; they are offended with it, and so are detected, discovered, and rooted up."

### John Wesley:
1. Every plant — That is, every doctrine.
