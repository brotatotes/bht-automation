# Matthew 15:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Don't bother with them, leave them be. Pay no mind to their anger or the offense they take. They are blind leaders guiding the blind. Those who follow their misleading teachings are just as blind and will inevitably fall into the pit of ignorance and destruction along with their leaders.
