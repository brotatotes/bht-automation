# Matthew 15:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Then Peter, as often acting as the spokesman for the disciples, asked Jesus to explain the parable. The disciples were perplexed by Jesus' statement that it is not what goes into a person's mouth that defiles them, but what comes out. Although the statement was straightforward, it seemed unclear to them and even contradicted the religious traditions and laws they were familiar with. They referred to it as a parable, seeking further enlightenment from Jesus.
