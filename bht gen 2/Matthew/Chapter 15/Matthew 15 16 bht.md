# Matthew 15:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples, despite all their time with Jesus and their exposure to his teachings, were reproved for their lack of understanding. Jesus expressed his disappointment and incredulity, as if wondering why they, his own chosen followers, remained without spiritual insight. Their ignorance was especially striking given the extensive instruction they had received, both in private and in public. It is disheartening to think that even those closest to Jesus could still be dull and ignorant in their understanding.
