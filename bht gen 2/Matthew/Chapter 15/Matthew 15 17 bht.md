# Matthew 15:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is crucial to understand that what enters our bodies through the mouth does not affect our spiritual state. This challenges materialistic thinking in our society. We must use our intellect for insight, not pride, and avoid intellectual laziness. Moral pollution cannot be acquired through food, regardless of its cleanliness. What remains in our bodies after digestion is pure and nourishing. We must not lack understanding but seek wisdom and discernment.
