# Matthew 15:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The words we speak are a direct expression of the state of our hearts. They reveal the true nature of our character and reflect the thoughts and intentions that reside within us. Just as a corrupted fountain produces unclean water, an impure heart gives birth to destructive and corrupt words. In contrast, a heart that is pure and aligned with God's will produces words that bring life and build others up. Therefore, we must strive to guard our hearts and consciously choose to speak words that reflect the righteousness and love of God.
