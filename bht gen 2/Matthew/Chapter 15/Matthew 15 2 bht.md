# Matthew 15:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Although handwashing before meals is not required by the Old Testament, the Jews placed more importance on this act of cleanliness, even considering it a mark of righteousness. The rabbis went so far as to view the failure to wash hands before eating as a mortal sin, equal to the most heinous crimes. To enforce adherence to this tradition, they even resorted to frightening people with tales of an evil spirit that would harm those who did not wash their hands before eating.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Jews attached more importance to the traditionary exposition than to the Scripture text itself."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Washing before meals was along regarded as a commandment; washing after meals only as a duty."
2. "The water was poured on both hands, which must be free of anything covering them, such as gravel, mortar, etc. The hands were lifted up so as to make the water run to the wrist, in order to insure that the whole hand was washed, and that the water polluted by the hand did not again run down the fingers."
3. "In the 'first affusion,' which was all that originally was required when the hands were not levitically 'defiled,' the water had to run down to the wrist. If the water remained short of the wrist, the hands were not clean."

### John Calvin:
1. "Some are manifestly wicked, for they inculcate acts of worship which are wicked and diametrically opposed to the word of God."
2. "But as he permits believers to have outward ceremonies, by means of which they may perform the exercises of godliness, so he does not suffer them to mix up those ceremonies with his own word, as if religion consisted in them."
3. "They were not destitute of plausibility, as Paul tells us that the inventions of men have an appearance of wisdom, but if they had rested in the Law of God alone, that modesty would have been more agreeable to Him than solicitude about small matters."

3. "Our Lord opposes, not the custom, but the principle they assumed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "Thus a real issue is raised between Jesus and the rabbis. It was far more than a point of etiquette or of hygienics. The rabbis held it to be a mortal sin."
