# Matthew 15:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The importance of this teaching lies in understanding that defilement goes beyond external actions. These things not only contaminate us physically but also taint our very being, bringing guilt upon us. However, it is essential to recognize that the act of eating without washing one's hands does not transgress any divine law and should not cause distress. These defiling elements are inherently evil, and only through the redemptive power of Jesus' sacrifice can we be cleansed from their pollution and guilt.
