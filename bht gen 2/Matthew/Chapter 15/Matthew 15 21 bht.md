# Matthew 15:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Mark 7:24, Jesus departs quietly, possibly to avoid confrontation with religious leaders. This act alludes to the future inclusion of Gentiles in his kingdom. The encounter with the Canaanite woman showcases her extraordinary faith and represents the longing of the Gentile world. While Jesus went near Tyre and Sidon, he did not enter the cities directly, but approached the border regions. This signifies his intention to extend his grace and message beyond his immediate surroundings.
