# Matthew 15:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By not answering the woman, Jesus tests her faith and perseverance, wanting to see if she would give up or continue to persist in her request. This silent response served as a trial for her, a means of putting her faith to the test and revealing its strength and steadfastness.
