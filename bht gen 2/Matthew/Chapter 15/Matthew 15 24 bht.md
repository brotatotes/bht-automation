# Matthew 15:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He first focused on the lost sheep of the house of Israel, as they were the primary recipients of his ministry. However, this does not mean that his mission was solely limited to them. Jesus later extended his ministry to the Gentiles as well, fulfilling his purpose to reconcile all people to God. The distinction made here emphasizes the gradual unfolding of God's plan and the progression of salvation history.
