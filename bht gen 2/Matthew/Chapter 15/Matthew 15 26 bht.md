# Matthew 15:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage sheds light on the distinction between the Jews and the Gentiles. The term children refers to the Jews, who were recipients of God's blessings and privileges. The bread symbolizes the specific favors and miracles that were bestowed upon them. Meanwhile, the dogs alludes to the Gentiles, whom the Jews looked down upon because of their idolatry and impurity. Through this encounter, Jesus tests the woman's faith and also warns of the impending judgment that would befall the Jews for rejecting the priceless blessings offered to them.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "No further contempt is indicated by the diminutive."
2. "The word is commonly used of tame dogs, as diminutives frequently express familiarity."
3. "So in Xen. Cyr. viii. 4. 20, εἰ δὲ μεγάλην γαμεῖς, ἤν ποτε βούλῃ αὐτὴν ὀρθὴν φιλῆσαι, προσάλλεσθαί σε δεήσει ὡς τὰ κυνάρια."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Children's [των τεκνων]. Bengel observes that while Christ spoke severely to the Jews, he spoke honorably of them to those without. Compare John 4:22."
2. "Dogs [κυναριοις]. Diminutive: little dogs. In ver. 27, Wyc. renders the little whelps, and Tynd., in both verses, whelps. The picture is of a family meal, with the pet house-dogs running round the table."
3. "Their masters. The children are the masters of the little dogs. Compare Mark 7:28, 'the children's crumbs.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "To make the meaning plain to us, it must be understood that the appellation of the children’s bread is here given, not to the gifts of God of whatever description, but only to those which were bestowed in a peculiar manner on Abraham and his posterity."
2. "By using the word throw, Christ intimates that what is taken from the Church of God and given to heathens is not well bestowed."
3. "His chief design was, to make trial of the woman’s faith; but he also pointed out the dreadful vengeance that would overtake the Jews, who rejected an inestimable benefit which was freely offered to them, and which they refused to those who sought it with warmth and earnestness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It calls forth the woman’s faith, and convinces the disciples that it is ‘proper’ to bless this heathen woman."
2. "All present understood this as referring to the blessings provided for the Jews."
3. "A reference to the large savage dogs so common in the East, would be very contemptuous; household dogs are meant; a sense the woman skilfully used."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'the children', are meant the Jews, to whom the adoption belonged; who, as a nation and people, were the children of God in a large sense; being distinguished by many blessings and favours, which others had not." 
2. "By 'the bread,' which belonged to them, is meant the external ministry of the word, and the miracles of Christ wrought among them: and particularly such outward favours which related to the good of the bodies of men, by healing their diseases, and dispossessing them of devils."
3. "By 'the dogs' are designed the Gentiles, so called by the Jews in a way of contempt, because of their ignorance, idolatry, and impurity."
