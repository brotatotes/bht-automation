# Matthew 15:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The woman's humble response acknowledges and embraces her identity as a Gentile dog, using it to her advantage in her plea. She understands that while the Jews may have a privileged position as God's chosen people, this doesn't exclude Gentiles from receiving His blessings. Just like the little dogs who eat the crumbs that fall from the table, she asks for a portion of God's mercy and goodness. Her quick thinking and unwavering faith reveal her profound understanding of Christ's inclusive love and compassion, even in the face of societal barriers.

3. "She was, as it were, under the edge of the table close on the confines of Israel‚Äôs feast."

### John Calvin:
1. "The woman‚Äôs reply showed that she was not hurried along by a blind or thoughtless impulse to offer a flat contradiction to what Christ had said."
2. "As God preferred the Jews to other nations, she does not dispute with them the honor of adoption, and declares, that she has no objection whatever that Christ should satisfy them according to the order which God had prescribed."
3. "And at no time, certainly, did God shut up his grace among the Jews in such a manner as not to bestow a small taste of them on the Gentiles."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Yea, Lord. She accepts the Lord‚Äôs word and makes an argument of it."
2. "For even, not ‚Äòyet,‚Äô the dogs. Not as one of the children; but as a humble dependent, she asks only what falls to such: the crumbs."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "She took no offence at the implication of being a Gentile dog."
2. "The little dogs eat of the crumbs (œàŒπœáŒπœâŒΩ, little morsels, diminutive again) that fall from the table of their masters (Œ∫œÖœÅŒπœâŒΩ), the children."

### John Gill:
1. "She wisely lays hold upon and improves in a very beautiful manner, in her own favour, what seemed to be so much against her."
2. "She suggests that though the Gentiles were but dogs, and she one of them; yet their common Lord and Master had a propriety in them, and they in him; and were to be maintained and fed, and ought to live, though not in such fulness of favours and blessings, as the Jews, the children of God."
3. "Nor would this be any more detrimental to them, than it is to the children, for the dogs, under the table, to eat of the crumbs that fall."
