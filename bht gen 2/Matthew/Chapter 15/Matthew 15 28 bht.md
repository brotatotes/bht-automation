## BHT:
This woman's faith was truly remarkable as she continued to plead her case with Jesus despite discouragement. Her faith allowed her to recognize the power and authority of Christ, even as a Gentile. Through her persistent faith, she was able to obtain the healing of her daughter. This story serves as a reminder that faith has the power to move mountains and that God is always ready to answer our prayers when we approach Him with faith and humility.
