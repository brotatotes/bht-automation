# Matthew 15:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Jesus sat near the sea of Galilee, a large lake known as the sea among the Jews, He awaited the multitude to gather around Him for instruction and healing. This sea, also referred to as the sea of Tiberias, stretched a hundred furlongs long and forty furlongs wide. Its proximity to the coastal region of Galilee made it a central gathering place for people seeking the teachings and miracles of Jesus.
