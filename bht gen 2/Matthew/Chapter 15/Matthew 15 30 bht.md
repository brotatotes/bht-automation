# Matthew 15:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people brought to Jesus a great variety of afflicted individuals - some who were maimed in their hands, others who were blind or mute. These individuals flocked to Jesus, carrying or leading those who were unable to walk. The crowd did not speak to Jesus or ask for his help directly, but simply presented the sufferers to him, confident in his willingness to show favor to them. In response, Jesus immediately healed them, demonstrating his compassion and power to bring restoration to those in need.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "κυλλοί are persons maimed in the hands... The meaning need not be that a wanting member was supplied to these persons; but that a debility, such as that arising from paralysis or wound, was healed."
2. "ἔῤῥιψαν, not in neglect, but from haste and rivalry."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Cast them down [ερριψαν] . Very graphic. Lit., flung them down; not carelessly, but in haste, because so many were coming on the same errand.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The crowds came having with them, i.e., bringing with them, a great variety of afflicted ones."
2. "The first mention of this class, i.e. , those wounded or diseased in hand or foot; our word ‘maimed’ implies a loss of the member."
3. "This may refer to the rudeness of these mountaineers, or to their haste, or to their confidence; probably the three explanations are to be combined."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A very strong word, flung them down, 'not carelessly, but in haste, because so many were coming on the same errand'".
2. "It was a great day for 'they glorified the God of Israel.'"

### John Gill:
1. "These flocked to him, having with them, in their hands, or arms, or upon their backs, or shoulders, leading some, and carrying others, in some form or another, those that were lame; either in their legs, or arms: blind; in one eye, or both, and that either from their birth, or since: dumb."
2. "The word signifies both deaf and dumb: these often meet in the same person: and if a man is born deaf, he is always dumb."
3. "Nor do they say a word to him, or desire him to relieve these miserable objects; thinking it was enough to present them to him, and not doubting at all, but he would show favor to them: and he healed them; immediately."
