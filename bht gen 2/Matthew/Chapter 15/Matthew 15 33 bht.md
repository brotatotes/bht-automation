# Matthew 15:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples' forgetfulness of the previous feeding of the five thousand may appear strange, but our own lack of faith should make us less surprised. The magnitude of the crowd being led, described as a very great multitude, necessitated abundant provision to satisfy their hunger, especially considering their prolonged period without food. Moreover, being in a barren wilderness, there was no possibility of acquiring enough loaves to feed such a vast company, even if they had the means to purchase them.

### John Gill:
1. "The question is big with objections, and is put with some vehemency and astonishment: the people to be led were a multitude, a great multitude, a very great multitude..."
2. "...these too had had but little, or no food, for a great while; and therefore would require the more to fill and satisfy them..."
3. "...it was a wilderness where they were, and where no provisions were to be had; and if they could have been got for money, they had not stock enough to purchase such a large number of loaves, as were necessary to feed so great a company with."
