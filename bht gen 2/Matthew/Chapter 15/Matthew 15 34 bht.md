# Matthew 15:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples, seemingly unaware and forgetful of the previous miracle, are gently questioned about the number of loaves they have. Instead of rebuking them, Jesus patiently tests their faith, using their scant provision as an opportunity to demonstrate the abundance of God's power even with such measly resources. The small number of fishes is intentionally highlighted, emphasizing how inadequate it may appear for the large crowd.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. Little fishes [ιχθυδια] . Diminutive. The disciples make their provision seem as small as possible. In ver. 36 the diminutive is not used.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "How many loaves have ye?"
2. "The loaves were seven in this case, five in the other, the number of little fishes is not specified."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  A few small fishes  (ολιγα ιχθυδια, diminutive again). 

### John Gill:
1. "In a very mild and gentle manner, taking no notice of their stupidity, nor upbraiding them with their forgetfulness of the late miracle..."
2. "...willing to exercise their patience, and try their faith..."
3. "...as so small a provision, that it was as nothing for such multitudes."
