# Matthew 15:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, Jesus demonstrates his authority by commanding the multitude to sit down on the ground, despite the lack of grass in the summer season. He does not consult with his disciples or show any concern for the small amount of food available. Instead, Jesus is fully aware of his own power to multiply the provisions and chooses to feed the multitude before dismissing them. By instructing the crowd to sit in an orderly manner, Jesus enables them to be seen and served effectively.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "On the ground [επι την γην] . Compare Mark 8:6. On the occasion of feeding the five thousand, the multitude sat down on the grass [επι τους χορτους] , Matthew 14:19. It was then the month of flowers. Compare Mark 6:39, the green grass, and John 6:10, much grass."
2. "On the present occasion, several weeks later, the grass would be burnt up, so that they would sit on the ground."
3. "Gave thanks. According to the Jewish ordinance, the head of the house was to speak the blessing only if he himself shared in the meal; yet if they who sat down to it were not merely guests, but his children or his household, then he might speak it, even if he himself did not partake."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The correct reading joins this verse closely with Matthew 15:36."
