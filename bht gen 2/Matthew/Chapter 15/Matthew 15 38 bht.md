# Matthew 15:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Here we witness a miraculous event different from the previous one, as evident by the four thousand men being fed alongside the seven loaves and few fishes. It is worth noting that this number does not include women and children who were also present and likely increased the total count. While the magnitude of this miracle may seem lesser based on the numbers and fragments, its distinctiveness sets it apart and holds its own significance.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "Four thousand, instead of â€˜five thousand.â€™ In this case the material miracle seems not to have been so great, as respects the number fed and the fragments remaining."

### John Gill:
1. "This number of men, as well as of the baskets of fragments, clearly shows this to be a distinct miracle from the former of this kind..." 
2. "There the number of men were five thousand, here four thousand; there the quantity of food was five loaves and two fishes, here seven loaves and a few fishes."
3. "Besides women and children; who were not taken into the account, though they ate as well as the men, and whose number might be very large."
