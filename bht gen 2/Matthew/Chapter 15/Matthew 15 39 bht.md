# Matthew 15:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, after sending away the people and expressing gratitude for the blessings they had received, arrived at the coastal region of Magdala (Magadan), a place known for its association with renowned Rabbins such as R. Joden and R. Isaac. Although Magdala is not much known, it is believed to be located on the western side of the Sea of Galilee, in the region of Galilee. This region is distinct from Dalmanutha, which some suggest might be the same place as Magdala. However, it is important to note that the name Magdalene could also be derived from another location near Jerusalem.
