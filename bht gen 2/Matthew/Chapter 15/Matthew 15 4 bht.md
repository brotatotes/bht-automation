# Matthew 15:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Honour thy father and mother is a commandment that carries a moral obligation from God Himself, delivered through Moses. It encompasses not only showing respect, but also providing any necessary help and support to parents. The penalty for cursing father or mother, as stated in Exodus 21:17, is severe, both in this life and in the hereafter. The Pharisees held fast to the tradition of the fathers, acknowledging the duty of children to their parents.
