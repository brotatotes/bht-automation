# Matthew 15:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, Jesus condemns the practice of using the term Corban to avoid the duty of caring for one's parents. By declaring their possessions as gifts to God, individuals were able to evade their responsibility to provide for their parents. However, Jesus exposes this tradition as a way of neglecting familial obligations, contradicting the commandment to honor and support one's parents. He emphasizes that these deceptive practices render the commandment ineffective and highlights the importance of genuine care and respect for family relationships.
