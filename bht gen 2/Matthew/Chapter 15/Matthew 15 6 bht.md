# Matthew 15:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The given insights emphasize the significance of honoring parents and upholding God's commandments. The Pharisees are reproached for rejecting the authority of God's word through their traditions, culminating in the nullification of their moral obligations. This serves as a timely reminder to prioritize familial responsibilities and faithfully follow God's commands, rather than becoming entangled in legalistic technicalities and human-made doctrines.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free —that is, It is true, father—mother—that by giving to thee this, which I now present, thou mightest be profited by me; but I have gifted it to pious uses, and therefore, at whatever cost to thee, I am not now at liberty to alienate any portion of it."
2. "And," it is added in Mark (Mark 7:12), "ye suffer him no more to do aught for his father or his mother." To dedicate property to God is indeed lawful and laudable, but not at the expense of filial duty.
3. "Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect—cancelled or nullified it "by your tradition.""

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Have made of none effect [ηκυρωσατε] . Rev., made void; aj, not, kurov, authority. Ye have deprived it of its authority.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Pharisees directly deny the validity of the fifth commandment."
2. "What God says is of itself a command, never to be rejected."
3. "Modern Pharisaism does the same. Church tradition leads to dogmas which deny God’s direct commands."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Ye have made void the word of God." It was a stinging indictment that laid bare the hollow pretense of their quibbles about handwashing.
2. "Κυρος means force or authority, ακυρος is without authority, null and void."
3. "The moral force of God's law is annulled by their hairsplitting technicalities and immoral conduct."

### John Gill:
1. See note on Mt 15:5
