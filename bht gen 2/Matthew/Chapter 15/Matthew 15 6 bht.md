# Matthew 15:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Pharisees have dishonored the word of God and neglected their responsibility to honor their father and mother. By their traditions, they have rendered the commandment null and void. Their quibbling about irrelevant matters, such as handwashing, only further exposes their hypocrisy. The authority of God's law is diminished when it is subjected to their petty interpretations and unethical actions. It is a stark reminder that God's commands are not to be rejected or undermined by human tradition.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free —that is, It is true, father—mother—that by giving to thee this, which I now present, thou mightest be profited by me; but I have gifted it to pious uses, and therefore, at whatever cost to thee, I am not now at liberty to alienate any portion of it." 
2. "And," it is added in Mark (Mark 7:12), "ye suffer him no more to do aught for his father or his mother." To dedicate property to God is indeed lawful and laudable, but not at the expense of filial duty. 
3. "Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect—cancelled or nullified it 'by your tradition.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Have made of none effect [ηκυρωσατε] . Rev., made void; aj, not, kurov, authority. Ye have deprived it of its authority.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Pharisees directly deny the validity of the fifth commandment."
2. "The words 'or his mother' are also to be omitted."
3. "What God says is of itself a command, never to be rejected."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Ye have made void the word of God. It was a stinging indictment that laid bare the hollow pretence of their quibbles about handwashing."
2. "The moral force of God's law is annulled by their hairsplitting technicalities and immoral conduct."

### John Gill:
1. See note on Mt 15:5
