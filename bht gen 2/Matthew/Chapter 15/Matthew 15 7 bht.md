# Matthew 15:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The hypocrisy of the Pharisees is aptly described by the prophet Isaiah, who foretold that they would rely on outward ceremonies and neglect true holiness. Their worship was superficial, centered on external display rather than a sincere and upright heart. By valuing human traditions over God's commandments, they revealed their true nature as hypocrites. Just as Isaiah's prophecy was directed at the people of his time, it also applies to the Pharisees of Jesus' time and beyond.

1. "The first is, that they relied on outward ceremonies alone, and set no value on true holiness, which consists in sincere uprightness of heart."
2. "Although Isaiah (Isaiah 29:13) did not prophesy for futurity alone, but had regard to the men of his own age, yet Christ says that this prediction relates to the Pharisees and scribes, because they resemble those ancient hypocrites with whom the prophet had to contend."
3. "The substance of what our Lord states on this subject is, that, since the worship of God is spiritual, and as nothing pleases him that is not accompanied by the inward sincerity of the heart, they who make holiness to consist in outward display are hypocrites."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Ye hypocrites. This word had not quite so strong a sense then as now. It includes those self-deceived."

### John Gill:
1. "After our Lord had given so full a proof of their making void the commandments of God by their traditions, he might very justly, as he does, call them hypocrites."
2. "They sought the praise and applause of men, and not the honour which comes from God; and that their religion lay in mere rituals and externals, and those of men's devising, and not in the spiritual worship and service of God."
3. "Well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, in Isaiah 29:13 which prophecy, though it was directed to, and suited with many in that generation in which the prophet lived, yet had a further view to the Jews in after times."

### John Wesley:
1. "Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying — That is, the description which Isaiah gave of your fathers, is exactly applicable to you."
