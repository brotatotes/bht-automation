# Matthew 15:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Their worship was in vain, for they substituted the doctrines and teachings of men in place of God's commandments. This kind of outward, formal worship was fruitless and empty. They were teaching the people to follow the traditions of men instead of the true doctrines delivered by God himself. They feared the men who taught them more than they feared God. How heinous it is to give equal or more importance to the commandments of men than to the commandments of God!
