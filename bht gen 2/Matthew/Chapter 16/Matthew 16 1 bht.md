# Matthew 16:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Pharisees and Sadducees, despite their mutual dislike, came together to challenge Jesus. The Pharisees accused the Sadducees of blaspheming, while the Sadducees accused the Pharisees of dishonoring God. Both parties sought to trap Jesus and demanded a sign from heaven, even though Jesus had already performed numerous miracles. They were not genuinely seeking to learn or be taught; their intentions were to discredit Jesus. They wanted a spectacular heavenly sign as proof of his divine authority. However, Jesus knew their true motives and did not entertain their demands for signs that would only serve to appease their skepticism.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "What can be more natural than that the adversaries of our Lord should have met His miracles again and again with this demand of a sign from heaven?"
2. "For in the Jewish superstition it was held that dæmons and false gods could give signs on earth, but only the true God signs from heaven."
3. "And thus we find that immediately after the first miraculous feeding the same demand was made, John 6:30, and answered by the declaration of our Lord that He was the true bread from heaven."

### John Calvin:
1. "Though the nature of the dispute is not expressed, yet I think it probable that they debated about the calling of Christ, why he ventured to make any innovation, and why he made such lofty pretensions, as if by his coming he had fully restored the kingdom of God."
2. "Signs, by which Christ made himself familiarly known, are despised by them; and how much less will they derive advantage from a distant and obscure sign?"
3. "In like manner, though ungodly men quarrel among themselves, their internal broils never prevent them from conspiring against God, and entering into a compact for joining their hands in persecuting the truth."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Opposed to each other, these two parties united against our Lord; opposition to the truth overbears other antagonisms."
2. "But He never responded to doubt and disbelief; only to faith."
3. "Their request implied that the many mighty works He had already wrought were not of heavenly origin."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Pharisees and Sadducees, the first time that we have this combination of the two parties who disliked each other exceedingly."
2. "Their motive was bad - they sought 'a sign from heaven.'"
3. "The Jewish apocalypses did speak of spectacular displays of power by the Son of Man (the Messiah)."

### John Gill:
1. "I complain of you Pharisees, because ye write the name of a ruler with the name of Moses, in a divorce; say the Pharisees, we complain of you Galilean Sadducees, that you write the name of a ruler with the name of God, in the same leaf." 
2. "And tempting, desired him that he would show them a sign from heaven: they came with no sincere view to be taught by him, or learn anything from him; but if they could, to ensnare him, and get an opportunity of exposing him to the people."
3. "Some very unusual and uncommon sight in the heavens, was what these men asked of Christ in proof of his mission from God."
