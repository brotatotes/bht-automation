# Matthew 16:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples should have understood that eating did not defile a person, and therefore, they should not have been surprised by Jesus' statement about not eating bread with the Pharisees and Sadducees. The miracles that Jesus performed should have made it clear that he was not referring to literal bread. Instead, Jesus spoke figuratively and mystically, indicating a higher sense and meaning. Mark's narrative stops at this point, leaving room for reflection on the profound message behind Jesus' words.

3. "Mark stops at this point in the narrative."

### John Gill:
1. "How is it that ye do not understand,.... That you should be so senseless and void of thought, after such instances..."
2. "...one would think you could not but know, that I spake it not to you concerning bread, taken in a literal sense..."
3. "...but must be thought to speak figuratively and mystically, and to have a higher sense and meaning..."

### John Wesley:
