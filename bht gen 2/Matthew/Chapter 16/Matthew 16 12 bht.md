# Matthew 16:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ uses the metaphor of leaven to symbolize the corrupt teachings of the Pharisees and Sadducees, contrasting them with the pure word of God. These religious leaders relied on their own human traditions and interpretations, while neglecting the true essence of God's message. By exposing their hypocrisy and false doctrines, Jesus highlights the danger of mingling human inventions with divine truth. His intent is to discredit these teachings and emphasize the importance of adhering to the unadulterated word of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "The word leaven is very evidently used by Christ as contrasted with the pure and uncorrupted word of God." 
2. "The naked truth of God, and the inventions which men contrive out of their own brain, are unquestionably the two things that are contrasted."
3. "All who mingle their own inventions with the word of God, or who advance anything that does not belong to it, must be rejected."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The leaven of the Pharisees is 'hypocrisy.' But the Sadducees, the 'liberal Jews' of that age, went to the other extreme."
2. "Without Him strict morality ('Pharisees') and free inquiry ('Sadducees') inevitably become hypocritical."
3. "The emphasis here laid on false 'teaching' is suggestive. Principles, tendencies, 'teachings,' are most permeating, and if evil, most dangerous."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They saw the point after this elaborate rebuke and explanation that by 'leaven' Jesus meant 'teaching'."


### John Gill:
1. "Christ forbad them buying bread that was made with leaven according to their directions: and since their rules in everything prevailed much in all places, they were concerned what bread they must, or could buy"
2. "It was very common with the Jews to call the corruption and vitiosity of nature by the name of 'leaven in the lump': hence our Lord calls their doctrine so, because it proceeded from thence, and was agreeable thereunto"
3. "He uses the phrase on purpose to expose it, and bring it into neglect and contempt"
