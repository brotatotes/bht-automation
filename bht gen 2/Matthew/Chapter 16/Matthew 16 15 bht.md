# Matthew 16:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is not enough to simply believe in Jesus, we must also confess and declare our faith in Him. This is especially expected of those who have been exposed to the teachings of the Gospel for a long time. They should have a firm understanding of who Jesus is and confidently declare their beliefs about Him. There should be no doubt or hesitation in their minds, but rather a readiness to openly proclaim what they know and believe about Jesus.
