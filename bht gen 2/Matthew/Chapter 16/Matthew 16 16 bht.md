## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The confession is not made in the terms of the other answer: it is not ‚Äòwe say‚Äô or ‚ÄòI say,‚Äô but Thou art. It is the expression of an inward conviction wrought by God‚Äôs Spirit."
2. "The excellence of this confession is, that it brings out both the human and the divine nature of the Lord: ·ΩÅ œáœÅŒπœÉœÑœåœÇ is the Messiah, the Son of David, the anointed King."
3. "That Peter, when he uttered the words, understood by them in detail all that we now understand, is not of course here asserted: but that they were his testimony to the true Humanity and true Divinity of the Lord, in that sense of deep truth and reliance, out of which springs the Christian life of the Church."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God!"
2. "He does not say, 'Scribes and Pharisees, rulers and people, are all perplexed; and shall we, unlettered fishermen, presume to decide?'"
3. "But feeling the light of his Master's glory shining in his soul, he breaks forth‚Äînot in a tame, prosaic acknowledgment, 'I believe that Thou art,' c.‚Äîbut in the language of adoration‚Äîsuch as one uses in worship, 'THOU ART THE CHRIST, THE SON OF THE LIVING GOD!'"
4. "He first owns Him the promised Messiah then he rises higher, echoing the voice from heaven‚Äî'This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased'; and in the important addition‚Äî'Son of the LIVING GOD'‚Äîhe recognizes the essential and eternal life of God as in this His Son‚Äîthough doubtless without that distinct perception afterwards vouchsafed."

### John Calvin:
1. "The confession is short, but it embraces all that is contained in our salvation."
2. "The designation Christ, or Anointed, includes both an everlasting Kingdom and an everlasting Priesthood."
3. "Thou art the Son of the living God; for... he believed him to come from God, not like other men, but by the inhabitation of the true and living Godhead in his flesh."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Peter‚Äôs reply is a decided, solemn, profound confession, that Jesus Christ is the Son of the living God."
2. "The doctrine of Christ‚Äôs Person is not the result of human speculation, but a truth revealed by the Father of our Lord respecting His only Begotten Son."
3. "As at the beginning of His ministry our Lord received an attestation from man (John the Baptist) preceding the attestation of His Son-ship from heaven, so at this turning-point a confession from man precedes the renewed attestation from heaven on the mount of Transfiguration."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God" - It was a noble confession, but not a new claim by Jesus.
2. Peter plainly calls Jesus the Anointed One, the Messiah, the Son of the God the living one (note the four Greek articles).
3. This great confession of Peter means that he and the other disciples believe in Jesus as the Messiah and are still true to him in spite of the defection of the Galilean populace.

### John Gill:
1. "Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God: a short, but a very full confession of faith."
2. "This confession, as it is uniform, and all of a piece, and consistent with itself, and is what all the disciples of Christ agreed in, so it greatly exceeds the most that can be made of the different sentiments of the people put together."
3. "They thought him to be a dead man brought to life; but here he is called the Son of the living God, as having the same life in him the Father has."

### John Wesley:
1. Peter ‚Äî Who was generally the most forward to speak.
