# Matthew 16:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is important to understand that in this context, flesh and blood refers to one's own reason or any natural power. This means that the knowledge and understanding of spiritual truths, such as the revelation of Christ's identity, cannot be achieved through human wisdom alone. It requires divine revelation and insight. We are reminded that the gospel and its truths cannot be comprehended by relying solely on human reasoning or intellect. Instead, they are to be received and believed through faith in the revealer, trusting in the wisdom and knowledge of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "μακάριος, as in ch. Matthew 5:4, &c., is a solemn expression of blessing, an inclusion of him to whom it is addressed in the kingdom of heaven, not a mere word of praise."
2. "The reason of [the blessing] is, the fact that the Father had revealed the Son to him."
3. "The whole declaration of St. Paul in that chapter forms a remarkable parallel to the character and promise given to St. Peter in our text, as establishing Paul’s claim to be another such πέτρα or στύλος as Peter and the other great Apostles, because the Son had been revealed in him not of man nor by men, but by God Himself."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "since he alone seems to have had clear enough apprehensions to put that conviction in proper and suitable words, and courage enough to speak them out."
2. "This name, denoting his humble fleshly extraction, seems to have been purposely here mentioned, to contrast the more vividly with the spiritual elevation to which divine illumination had raised him."
3. "but my Father which is in heaven—In speaking of God, Jesus, it is to be observed, never calls Him, 'our Father,' but either 'your Father'... or, as here, 'My Father,' to signify some peculiar action or aspect of Him as 'the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Blessed [μακαριος] . See on ch. Matthew 5:3.

### John Calvin:
1. "This was not spoken in a peculiar manner to Peter alone, but our Lord’s purpose was, to show in what the only happiness of the whole world consists."
2. "Whoever has obtained Christ wants nothing that is necessary to perfect happiness, since we have no right to desire anything better than the eternal glory of God."
3. "Hence we infer, that the minds of men are destitute of that sagacity which is necessary for perceiving the mysteries of heavenly wisdom which are hidden in Christ; and even that all the senses of men are deficient in this respect, till God opens our eyes to perceive his glory in Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Blessed art thou. An answering confession of Peter as an object of the Divine favor, a subject of Divine grace."
2. "The real knowledge of Jesus as the Messiah, the Son of the living God, is and must be a matter of Divine revelation."
3. "For the trials of faith before them during the remainder of our Lord’s earthly life the disciples needed a knowledge of His Person far above the carnal notions of the Messiah; the reply of Peter shows that they had it, and our Lord tells whence it came."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus accepts the confession as true. Thereby Jesus on this solemn occasion solemnly claims to be the Messiah, the Son of the living God, his deity in other words."
2. "The disciples express positive conviction in the Messiahship or Christhood of Jesus as opposed to the divided opinions of the populace."
3. "The Father had helped Peter get this spiritual insight into the Master's Person and Work."

### John Gill:
1. "Bar Jona signifies 'the son of a dove,' and Bar Joanna signifies 'the son of one that is gracious.' Our Lord, by this appellation, puts Peter in mind of his birth and parentage, but does not pronounce him blessed on that account."
2. "He was a blessed man, not by his first, but by his second birth; his blessedness in general was not of nature, but of grace."
3. "Neither the Gospel, nor any part of it, is a human device or discovery; it is not after man, nor according to the carnal reason of man; it is above the most exalted and refined reason of men... The Gospel is a revelation, it consists of revealed truths; and which are to be received and believed upon the testimony and credit of the revealer, without entering into carnal reasonings, and disputes about them."

### John Wesley:
1. Flesh and blood — That is, thy own reason, or any natural power whatsoever.
