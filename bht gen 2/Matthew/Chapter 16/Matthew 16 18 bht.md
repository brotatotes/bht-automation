# Matthew 16:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The promise given to Peter signifies his significance in the establishment of the Church. The confession of faith he made serves as the foundation on which the Church is built. The assurance is that the Church will not be overcome by opposing powers, guaranteeing its perpetual existence. The concept of Hades represents the condition after death, which is determined by the individual's moral character. This verse emphasizes the steadfastness of the Church and the unchanging truth on which it is founded.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The name Œ†Œ≠œÑœÅŒøœÇ (not now first given, but prophetically bestowed by our Lord on His first interview with Simon, Joh 1:43) or ŒöŒ∑œÜ·æ∂œÇ, signifying a rock, the termination being only altered to suit the masculine appellation, denotes the personal position of this Apostle in the building of the Church of Christ."
2. "That this is the simple and only interpretation of the words of our Lord the whole usage of the New Testament shows: in which not doctrines nor confessions, but men, are uniformly the pillars and stones of the spiritual building."
3. "The meaning of the promise is, that over the Church so built upon him who was by the strength of that confession the Rock, no adverse power should ever prevail to extinguish it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "That thou art Peter‚ÄîAt his first calling, this new name was announced to him as an honor afterwards to be conferred on him. Now he gets it, with an explanation of what it was meant to convey."
2. "I will build my Church‚Äînot on the man Simon Bar-jona; but on him as the heavenly-taught confessor of a faith. 'My Church,' says our Lord, calling the Church HIS OWN; a magnificent expression regarding Himself, nowhere else occurring in the Gospels."
3. "and the gates of hell...the gates of Death: in other words, 'It shall never perish.' Some explain it of 'the assaults of the powers of darkness'; but though that expresses a glorious truth, probably the former is the sense here."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The obvious reference of the word is to Peter. The emphatic this naturally refers to the nearest antecedent; and besides, the metaphor is thus weakened, since Christ appears here, not as the foundation, but as the architect: 'On this rock will I build.'"
2. "Nevertheless sunagwgh is applied to a Christian assembly... Both in Hebrew and in New Testament usage ejkklhsia implies more than a collective or national unity; rather a community based on a special religious idea and established in a special way."
3. "Hades is a broad and general conception, with an idea of locality bound up with it. It is the condition following death, which is blessed or the contrary, according to the moral character of the dead, and is therefore divided into different realms, represented by Paradise or Abraham 's bosom, and Gehenna."

### John Calvin:
1. "By these words Christ declares how highly he is delighted with the confession of Peter, since he bestows upon it so large a reward."
2. "Thou art Peter. By these words our Lord assures him that it was not without a good reason that he had formerly given him this name, because, as a living stone (1 Peter 2:5) in the temple of God, he retains his stedfastness."
3. "Against all the power of Satan the firmness of the Church will prove to be invincible, because the truth of God, on which the faith of the Church rests, will ever remain unshaken."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The phrase refers to Peter, but as a confessor, as in Christ, representing the other Apostles. This explains both the resemblance and the difference of the words: 'Petros' and 'petra;' it is on the whole preferable."
2. "The ultra Protestant view: Peter‚Äôs confession alone is referred to. Only partially correct."
3. "Christ means His own Person. So Augustine (in later years) and many excellent commentators. This view claims that petros means a stone and petra a rock, so that Peter is a living stone from Christ the true rock, and whosoever would become a living stone, a ‚Äòpetros,‚Äô must make this true confession of Christ, the Rock, on whom as God and man the Church will be built."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The emphasis is not on 'Thou art Peter' over against 'Thou art the Christ,' but on ŒöŒ±Œ≥œâ: 'The Father hath revealed to thee one truth, and I also tell you another" (McNeile).
2. "What did Jesus mean by this word-play?" I will build my church (ŒøŒπŒ∫ŒøŒ¥ŒøŒºŒ∑œÉœâ ŒºŒøœÖ œÑŒ∑ŒΩ ŒµŒ∫Œ∫ŒªŒ∑œÉŒπŒ±ŒΩ). It is the figure of a building and he uses the word ŒµŒ∫Œ∫ŒªŒ∑œÉŒπŒ±ŒΩ which occurs in the New Testament usually of a local organization, but sometimes in a more general sense."
3. "What is the rock on which Christ will build his vast temple? Not on Peter alone or mainly or primarily. Peter by his confession was furnished with the illustration for the rock on which His church will rest. It is the same kind of faith that Peter has just confessed. The perpetuity of this church general is guaranteed."

### John Gill:
1. "The materials of this building are such, as are by nature no better, or more fit for it, than others: these stones originally lie in the same quarry with others; they are singled out, and separated from the rest, according to the sovereign will of God, by powerful and efficacious grace..."
2. "Christ is a rock that is higher than they, where they find safety in times of distress, and the shadow of which is refreshing to them..."
3. "Our Lord may allude to these notions of the Jews, and his sense be, that all the infernal principalities and powers, with all their united cunning and strength, will never be able to extirpate his Gospel, to destroy his interest, to demolish his church in general, or ruin anyone particular soul that is built upon him." (144 words)

### John Wesley:
1. "On this rock ‚Äî Alluding to his name, which signifies a rock, namely, the faith which thou hast now professed; I will build my Church"
2. "And it is certain, that as he is spoken of in Scripture, as the only foundation of the Church, so this is that which the apostles and evangelists laid in their preaching."
3. "The gates of hell ‚Äî As gates and walls were the strength of cities, and as courts of judicature were held in their gates, this phrase properly signifies the power and policy of Satan and his instruments."
