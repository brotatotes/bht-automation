# Matthew 16:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The power of the keys of the kingdom of heaven was granted not only to Peter, but to all the apostles. Peter, however, was the first to exercise this authority after the resurrection of Christ, being the one who opened the kingdom of heaven through his preaching to both Jews and Gentiles. The binding and loosing mentioned refer to the acts of discipline performed by Peter and the apostles, which were confirmed by God in heaven. Through this authority, they had the ability to declare what was forbidden or lawful according to the guidance of the Holy Spirit.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Another personal promise to Peter, remarkably fulfilled in his being the first to admit both Jews and Gentiles into the Church; thus using the power of the keys to open the door of salvation." 
2. "Of the binding, the case of Ananias and Sapphira may serve as an eminent example: of the loosing, the '·ΩÉ ·ºîœáœâ, œÑŒø·ø¶œÑœå œÉŒøŒπ Œ¥ŒØŒ¥œâŒºŒπ,' to the lame man at the Beautiful gate of the Temple." 
3. "But strictly considered, the binding and loosing belong to the power of legislation in the Church committed to the Apostles, in accordance with the Jewish way of using the words ◊ê◊°◊® and ◊î◊™◊ô◊® for prohibuit and licitum fecit."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Whatever this means, it was soon expressly extended to all the apostles, so that the claim of supreme authority in the Church, made for Peter by the Church of Rome, and then arrogated to themselves by the popes as the legitimate successors of St. Peter, is baseless and impudent."
2. "As first in confessing Christ, Peter got this commission before the rest; and with these 'keys,' on the day of Pentecost, he first 'opened the door of faith' to the Jews, and then, in the person of Cornelius, he was honored to do the same to the Gentiles."
3. "One thing is clear, that not in all the New Testament is there the vestige of any authority either claimed or exercised by Peter, or conceded to him, above the rest of the apostles‚Äîa thing conclusive against the Romish claims in behalf of that apostle."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Even as he had been the first to utter the confession of the church, so was he also privileged to be the first to open its hitherto closed gates to the Gentiles...first hear the words of the Gospel."

### John Calvin:
1. "We know that there is no other way in which the gate of life is opened to us than by the word of God; and hence it follows that the key is placed, as it were, in the hands of the ministers of the word."
2. "Both are exceedingly necessary; for the inestimable treasure of life is exhibited to us in earthen vessels, (2 Corinthians 4:7,) and had not the authority of the doctrine been established in this manner, the faith of it would have been, almost every moment, ready to give way."
3. "It is the highest honor conferred on the Gospel, that it is declared to be the embassy of mutual reconciliation between God and men."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Power to open and shut Peter first admitted Jews (on the day of Pentecost) and Gentiles (Cornelius) to the Church; and first excluded (Ananias and Sapphira; Simon Magus)." 
2. "This promise in its full sense does not extend beyond the Apostles...for the keys are not the keys of the Church but ‚Äòof the kingdom of heaven.‚Äô"
3. "For such binding and loosing on earth they may implore, but cannot assert, heavenly direction and sanction."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The same power here given to Peter belongs to every disciple of Jesus in all the ages."
2. "To 'bind' (Œ¥Œ∑œÉŒ∑ŒπœÇ) in rabbinical language is to forbid, to 'loose' (ŒªœÖœÉŒ∑ŒπœÇ) is to permit."
3. "Every preacher uses the keys of the kingdom when he proclaims the terms of salvation in Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "By the kingdom of heaven is meant the Gospel, which comes from heaven, declares the king Messiah to be come, speaks of things concerning his kingdom, displays the riches of his grace, and gives an account of the kingdom of heaven." 
2. "Keys are the ensigns of treasurers, and of stewards, and such the ministers of the Gospel are; they have the rich treasure of the word under their care, put into their earthen vessels to open and lay before others."
3. "The sense of the words is this, that Peter, and so the rest of the apostles, should be empowered with authority from him, and so directed by his Holy Spirit, that whatever they bound, that is, declared to be forbidden, and unlawful, should be so: and that whatever they loosed, that is, declared to be lawful, and free of use, should be so."

### John Wesley:
1. "I will give thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven ‚Äî Indeed not to him alone, (for they were equally given to all the apostles at the same time, John 20:21,22,23;) but to him were first given the keys both of doctrine and discipline."
2. "He first, after our Lord's resurrection, exercised the apostleship, Acts 1:15. And he first by preaching opened the kingdom of heaven, both to the Jews, Acts 2:14 etc., and to the Gentiles, Acts 10:34 etc."
3. "Under the term of binding and loosing are contained all those acts of discipline which Peter and his brethren performed as apostles: and undoubtedly what they thus performed on earth, God confirmed in heaven. Matthew 18:18."
