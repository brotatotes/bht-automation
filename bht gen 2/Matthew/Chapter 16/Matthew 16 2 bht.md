# Matthew 16:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Having performed numerous miracles to validate his status as the Messiah and being aware of their expectations, Jesus chooses to respond to their request for a sign from heaven with a simple reference to common weather signs. Just as people observe the sky at sunset and make predictions about the weather based on its appearance, Jesus draws their attention to the significance of these signs. He emphasizes that they have the ability to discern the signs of the times, just as they discern the signs of fair weather from the sky's appearance.

2. "The comparison which he employs is beautiful and highly appropriate; for, though the aspect of the sky is changeable, so that sometimes a storm unexpectedly arises, and sometimes fair weather springs up when it was not expected, yet the instructions of nature are sufficient to enable men to predict from signs whether the day will be fair or cloudy."
3. "Christ therefore asks why they do not recognize the kingdom of God, when it is made known by signs not less manifest; for this proved clearly that they were excessively occupied with earthly and transitory advantages, and cared little about any thing that related to the heavenly and spiritual life, and were blinded not so much by mistake as by voluntary malice."
