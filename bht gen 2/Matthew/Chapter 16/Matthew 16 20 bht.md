# Matthew 16:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus chose not to openly declare His Messiahship to the world, as doing so would provoke His enemies and potentially stir up jealousy among the Romans. Instead, He left His disciples to infer His true identity from His teachings and miracles. By keeping His Messiahship somewhat concealed, Jesus prevented immediate political turmoil and allowed time for His disciples to witness His resurrection, providing a powerful testimony to the truth of His claims.
