# Matthew 16:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
From that time, Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must suffer many things. How strange that the very ones who should have embraced him were not the first ones to believe in him! The world, the flesh, and the devil urge us to prioritize preserving ourselves, but we must remember that Christ's words call us to deny ourselves and follow him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Certainly enough was known of such a prophecy to make the Jews set a watch over the grave, which of itself answers the objection."
2. "Meyer in loc. reasons about the state of the disciples after the crucifixion just as if they had not suffered any remarkable overthrow of their hopes and reliances, and maintains that they must have remembered this precise prophecy if it had been given by the Lord."
3. "It is in the highest degree improbable that the precision should have been given to this prophecy after the event, as Meyer supposes: both from the character of the Gospel History in general (see Prolegomena), and because of the carefulness and precision in the words added by Mark."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "From that time forth began Jesus to show unto his disciples... how that he must go unto Jerusalem and suffer many things... and be killed, and be raised again the third day." 
2. "[Jesus] spake that saying openly—'explicitly,' or 'without disguise.'"


### Marvin Vincent:
1. "From that time began [απο τοτε ηρξατο]. He had not shown it to them before."
2. "Must [δει]. It was necessary in fulfillment of the divine purpose."
3. "Suffer. This first announcement mentions this passion and death generally."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The confession prepared them for the revelation. We infer that He spoke often and familiarly on this topic, to prepare them for their own trials, and to impress upon them the truth they deemed so strange."
2. "The necessity of His sufferings was revealed: not in all its bearings, since after His resurrection He must still ask: ‘Ought not Christ to have suffered,’ etc."
3. "Despite this plain announcement, they were full of doubt and despondency after His death."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They must know it now to be ready then."
2. "The great confession of Peter made this seem an appropriate time."
3. "Jesus added his resurrection 'on the third day', not 'on the fourth day', please observe."

### John Gill:
1. "He began to teach them more expressly, and to point out to them more clearly, and plainly, his sufferings and death."
2. "This also furnishes out some reasons why Jesus would not have his disciples, for the present, declare him to be the Messiah, that his death might not, by any means, be prevented."
3. "The word 'must', not only belongs to his going to Jerusalem, but to his sufferings, death, and resurrection; all which must be because of the immutable decree of God, the council, and covenant of grace, and peace, the prophecies of the Old Testament, and the redemption and salvation of God's elect; these required them, and made them absolutely necessary."

### John Wesley:
1. "From that time Jesus began to tell his disciples, that he must suffer many things...that Christ must through sufferings and death enter into his glory." 
2. "Would not one have expected, that these should have been the very first to receive him? But not many wise, not many noble were called." 
3. "Favour thyself — The advice of the world, the flesh, and the devil, to every one of our Lord's followers."
