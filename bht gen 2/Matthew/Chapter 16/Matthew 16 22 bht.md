# Matthew 16:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter's sudden change is striking. From making a noble confession and receiving a high blessing, he shows his weak and carnal side. Jesus responds with a combination of affection and indignation, taking Peter aside to privately and firmly raise his concerns. Though Peter's intentions may have seemed pious, Jesus reproves him with strong language, highlighting his pride and opposition to God's purpose. It is a reminder that even those who confess their faith can still exhibit moments of weakness and misunderstanding.
