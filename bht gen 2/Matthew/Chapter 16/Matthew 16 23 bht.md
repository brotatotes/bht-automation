# Matthew 16:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Thou art a stumbling stone to Christ, trying to hinder the redemption of mankind and giving deadly advice from the pit of hell. Whosoever says, 'Favour thyself,' in an attempt to divert Christ from His purpose is acting the part of the devil. To follow Christ means to renounce oneself, denying our own will and substituting it with the will of God as our guiding principle of action.
