# Matthew 16:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To be true disciples of Christ, we must deny ourselves and take up our cross. This means giving up our natural inclinations and worldly desires, willingly bearing the crosses that come our way. These crosses, whether big or small, provide opportunities to embrace God's will instead of our own. In doing so, we grow in faith and become better followers of Christ. It is important to remember that God is in control of all events, nothing is too insignificant for His notice. He allows us to face these challenges for our spiritual growth and transformation.
