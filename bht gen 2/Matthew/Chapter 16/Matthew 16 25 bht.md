# Matthew 16:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Whoever is unwilling to renounce himself, even in the highest instance of life itself, at the expense of his conscience, will be lost eternally. It is hopeless to expect that one can renounce oneself in the smallest instances if they cannot do so in the greater instances. However, whoever is willing to lose their life and renounce all earthly attachments for the sake of Christ and his Gospel will find a life that is truly fulfilling, both in this world and in the heavenly realm.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For whosoever will save his life shall lose it, and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it" - A suffering and dying Messiah liketh you ill; but what if His servants shall meet the same fate? They may not; but who follows Me must be prepared for the worst.

### John Calvin:
1. "For he that would save his life shall lose it... they who willingly suffer death for the sake of Christ do actually obtain life."

3. "The threatening, which is contrasted with the promise, has also a powerful tendency to shake off carnal sloth, when he reminds men who are desirous of the present life, that the only advantage which they reap is, to lose life."
