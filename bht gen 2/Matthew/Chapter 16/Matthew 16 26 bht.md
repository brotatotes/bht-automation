# Matthew 16:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
How terrible it would be for someone to gain everything the world has to offer in exchange for losing their own immortal soul. The value of a soul is priceless, for it requires the blood and life of Christ to redeem it. Once a soul is lost and condemned, there is no way to ever bring it back. It is a sobering reminder that we should not let ourselves be consumed by the pursuits of this world, but instead focus on the eternal worth of our souls.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There is apparently a reference to Psalms 48:1-14 (LXX) in this verse. Compare especially the latter part with Mat 16:8 of that Psalm."
2. "In the latter part of the verse, ἄνθρωπος and αὐτοῦ refer to the same person: ἀντάλλαγμα = ἐξίλασμα , τὴν τιμὴν τῆς λυτρώσεως τῆς ψ . αὐτοῦ Psalms 48:7-8."
3. "What shall a man give to purchase back his life? ψυχή, not soul, but life, in the higher sense."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "How awful is the stake as here set forth! If a man makes the present world—in its various forms of riches, honors, pleasures, and such like—the object of supreme pursuit, be it that he gains the world; yet along with it he forfeits his own soul."
2. "In language the weightiest, because the simplest, does our Lord shut up His hearers, and all who shall read these words to the end of the world, to the priceless value to every man of his own soul."
3. "To be lost to shame is to be nearly past hope. But when Christ and 'His words' are unpopular, the same instinctive desire to stand well with others begets that temptation to be ashamed of Him which only the expulsive power of a higher affection can effectually counteract."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Lord looks back to the details of each life as the factors of the final sum of gain or loss."
2. "The verb in the active voice means to cause loss or damage. Often in the classics, of fining or mulcting in a sum of money."
3. "Soul [ψυχην] . Rev., life, with soul in margin."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ reminds them that the soul of man was not created merely to enjoy the world for a few days, but to obtain at length its immortality in heaven."
2. "What carelessness and what brutal stupidity is this, that men are so strongly attached to the world, and so much occupied with its affairs, as not to consider why they were born, and that God gave them an immortal soul."
3. "That the world may not fascinate us by its allurements, let us remember the surpassing worth of our soul; for if this be seriously considered, it will easily dispel the vain imaginations of earthly happiness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is plainly implied that gaining the world in a selfish manner involves the loss of true life, that such a gain is really only an apparent gain of the world, while the loss is real, irreparable, irretrievable."
2. "The usual inferences, based on the sense 'soul,' are true enough, but not suggested here."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The soul has no market price, though the devil thinks so."
2. "A man must give, surrender, his life, and nothing less to God; no ανταλλαγμα is possible."
3. "There is no exchange for a faithful friend."

### John Gill:
1. "Of what advantage will it be to such a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?"
