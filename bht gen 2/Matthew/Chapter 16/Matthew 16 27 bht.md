# Matthew 16:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father, with his angels, ready to execute His pleasure. This will be a time of revelation and reward, as each person will be judged according to their works. It is a reminder for believers to live with the anticipation of the blessed redemption, to confess their faith boldly, and to strive for righteousness. The reward of works is not the cause of salvation, but rather an encouragement for believers to do what is right, knowing that their labor will not be in vain.
