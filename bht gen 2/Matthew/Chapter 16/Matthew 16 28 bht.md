# Matthew 16:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Some of those present will witness the coming of the Messiah in his kingdom, with great power and glory. This does not refer to the transfiguration or the destruction of Jerusalem, but rather to the establishment of Christ's mediatorial kingdom through the growth of his Church and the downfall of the Jewish temple, city, and polity. This declaration emphasizes the certainty of Jesus' final victory and the fulfillment of his kingdom on earth.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This declaration refers, in its full meaning, certainly not to the transfiguration which follows, for that could in no sense (except that of being a foretaste) be named ‘the Son of Man coming in His Kingdom.’"
2. "The expression, τινὲς … οὐ μὴ γ . θ ., indicates a distant event, but to the destruction of Jerusalem, and the full manifestation of the Kingdom of Christ by the annihilation of the Jewish polity; which event, in this aspect as well as in all its terrible attendant details, was a type and earnest of the final coming of Christ."
3. "The fact is, there is a reference back in this discourse to that in ch. 10, and the coming here spoken of is the same as that in Mat 16:23 there."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "some of those standing here... shall not taste of death, fill they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom"
2. "the firm establishment and victorious progress, in the lifetime of some then present, of that new kingdom of Christ"
3. "destined to work the greatest of all changes on this earth, and be the grand pledge of His final coming in glory"

### John Calvin:
1. "If it seem too long to wait for the day of my coming, I will provide against this in good time; for before you come to die, you will see with your eyes that kingdom of God, of which I bid you entertain a confident hope."
2. "By the coming of the kingdom of God we are to understand the manifestation of heavenly glory, which Christ began to make at his resurrection, and which he afterwards made more fully by sending the Holy Spirit, and by the performance of miracles."
3. "By those beginnings he gave his people a taste of the newness of the heavenly life, when they perceived, by certain and undoubted proofs, that he was sitting at the right hand of the Father."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Death is represented under the figure of a bitter cup."
2. "The establishment of the new dispensation, which was the coming of the kingdom of God with power."
3. "The destruction of Jerusalem, which ended the old dispensation."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Does Jesus refer to the Transfiguration, the Resurrection of Jesus, the great Day of Pentecost, the Destruction of Jerusalem, the Second Coming and Judgment? We do not know, only that Jesus was certain of his final victory which would be typified and symbolized in various ways."
2. "The apocalyptic eschatological symbolism employed by Jesus here does not dominate his teaching. He used it at times to picture the triumph of the kingdom, not to set forth the full teaching about it."
3. "The kingdom of God was already in the hearts of men. There would be climaxes and consummations."

### John Gill:
1. "Verily I say unto you...declaring it to be a certain truth, which may firmly be believed."
