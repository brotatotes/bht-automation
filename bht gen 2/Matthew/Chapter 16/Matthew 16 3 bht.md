# Matthew 16:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The signs of the times are like the changing weather - we can observe and discern what is to come based on the visible signs before us. Just as we can predict the weather by looking at the sky, we should also be able to recognize the signs of the Messiah's coming and the fulfillment of prophecy. However, many are blind to these signs, so it is important for us to diligently seek understanding and discernment in recognizing the times we are living in. By doing so, we can fully embrace the truth and journey towards our eternal salvation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Si circa occidentem rubescunt nubes, serenitatem futuræ diei spondent; concavus oriens pluvias prædicit; idem ventos cum ante exorientem eum nubes rubescunt: quod si et nigræ rubentibus intervenerint (πυῤῥάζει στυγνάζων) et pluvias." Plin. Hist. Nat. xviii. 35.
2. "πρόσωπον, because στυγνός and στυγνάζω are properly used of sadness and obscurity in the visage of man."
3. "τῶν καιρῶν, of times, generally. The Jews had been, and were, most blind to the signs of the times, at all the great crises of their history; and also particularly to the times in which they were then living. The sceptre had departed from Judah, the lawgiver no longer came forth from between his feet, the prophetic weeks of Daniel were just at their end; yet they discerned none of these things."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Lowering [στυγναζων]. The verb means to have a gloomy look."
2. "Cranmer, the sky is glooming red."
3. "A. V., he was sad. Rev., his countenance fell."

### John Calvin:
1. "The same reproof applies nearly to the whole world; for men direct their ingenuity, and apply their senses, to immediate advantage; and therefore there is scarcely any man who is not sufficiently well qualified in this respect, or at least who is not tolerably acquainted with the means of gaining his object."
2. "Is it not because every man gives himself up to willing indifference, and extinguishes the light which is offered to him?"
3. "They go farther, and believe that it is a mark of prudence purposely to avoid all inquiry into the truth; as if it were not an instance of shameful sloth that, while they are so eagerly solicitous about the objects of the flesh and of the earth, they neglect the eternal salvation of their souls, and at the same time contrive vain excuses for gross and stupid ignorance."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The red at even of the Old Testament betokened fair weather at hand. Similarly, the red sky at the commencement of the New Testament, indicated the storm about to descend upon Israel. But they were incapable of understanding either one or other of these signs." (Lange’s Comm.)
2. "The signs of the times, i.e., the fulfilment of prophecy; the miracles performed before them, showing that the Messiah had come. The Jews, with the promise of the Messiah, ought to have been as quick in discerning the signs of His coming, as those of the weather." (Lange’s Comm.)
3. "Proverbially so keen to discern the signs of the times as affecting trade, etc., they have always shown lack of spiritual discernment. But all men are naturally slow in discovering the spiritual significance of passing events." (Lange’s Comm.)

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Lowring (στυγναζων). A sky covered with clouds. Used also of a gloomy countenance... Nowhere else in the New Testament."
2. "The signs of the times (τα σημεια των καιρων). How little the Pharisees and Sadducees understood the situation."
3. "It is not always easy to discern (διακρινειν, discriminate) the signs of our own time."

### John Gill:
1. "When you rise in the morning, and take a survey of the heavens, it is a very usual thing with you to say, it is like to be windy or rainy weather today." 
2. "Ye can discern the face of the sky; very distinctly, and make some very probable guesses, if not certain conclusions, what will follow, good weather or bad."
3. "If they had not been blind, they might easily have discerned, that the signs of the time of the Messiah's coming were upon them, and that Jesus was the Messiah."

### John Wesley:
1. The signs of the times — The signs which evidently show, that this is the time of the Messiah.
