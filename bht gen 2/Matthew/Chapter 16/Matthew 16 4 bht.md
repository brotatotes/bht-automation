# Matthew 16:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus strongly condemned the wicked and adulterous generation that constantly demanded signs from Him, revealing their continued desire to test and tempt God. Not only were their requests for signs problematic, but their deliberate provocations against God were also deeply troubling. Jesus, in frustration, warned them that after His resurrection, He would be a prophet like Jonah, serving as a sign that the voice of His Gospel would resound powerfully. Yet, despite these warnings, the unbelieving crowd remained stubborn and hardened, causing Jesus deep sorrow in His spirit.
