# Matthew 16:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the disciples crossed the lake, they forgot to bring bread on their land journey, which was unusual for them as they usually bought food in advance. This forgetfulness may have been due to their focus on Jesus' conversation with the Pharisees and Sadducees or the suddenness of Jesus' departure. Nonetheless, they had only one loaf in the boat, having either used up or given away the fragments from the previous miracle. It is important for us to remain vigilant in our obedience to God's word, as it is easy to be swayed by false teachings and distractions.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This crossing of the lake was not the voyage to Magadan mentioned in ch. Matthew 15:39."
2. "After they had come to the other side, they forgot to take bread; viz. on their land journey further."
3. "This is also to be understood in Mark (Mar 8:14), who states their having only one loaf in the ship, not to show that they had forgotten to take bread before starting, but as a reason why they should have provided some on landing."

### John Calvin:
1. "When we are surrounded by wicked inventions, spurious doctrines, and other plagues of the same sort, nothing is more easy than to depart from the true and simple purity of the word of God."
2. "Hypocrisy will denote here something different from a pretended and false appearance of wisdom. It will denote the very source and occasion of empty display, which, though it holds out an imposing aspect to the eyes of men, is of no estimation in the sight of God."
3. "Sooner shall water mix with fire than any man shall succeed in reconciling the inventions of the Pope with the Gospel."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is improbable that this conversation took place during the voyage."
2. "The original suggests that the neglect occurred after they landed."
3. "They had but one loaf in the boat and started on a land journey to Cesarea Philippi, through a region comparatively desolate, without making provision for it."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Came (ελθοντες). Probably= 'went' as in Luke 15:20 (ιρε, not ςενιρε)."
2. "So in Mark 8:13 απηλθεν."
3. "Forgot (επελαθοντο). Perhaps in the hurry to leave Galilee, probably in the same boat by which they came across from Decapolis."

### John Gill:
1. "Having but one loaf, as Mark says, in the ship; the seven baskets of fragments being either expended, or given away to the poor." 
2. "It seems, it was usual with the disciples to buy food at places most proper, and carry with them; since Christ often went into deserts and mountainous places, where provisions could not be had."
3. "This their forgetfulness to act according to their wonted method, might arise either from their being intent upon Christ's conversation with the Pharisees, and Sadducees, or from the suddenness of Christ's departure."

### John Wesley:
1. Mark 8:14.
