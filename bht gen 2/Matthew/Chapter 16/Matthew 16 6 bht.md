# Matthew 16:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees. The leaven here is not literal bread, but a figurative representation of a permeating spiritual influence, specifically the doctrine of the Pharisees. Just as leaven spreads and diffuses throughout the dough, their false teachings have the power to infiltrate the minds of believers and corrupt their faith. It is essential to be watchful and on guard against this hypocrisy, which may be disguised in persuasive arguments or external show of religiosity. The disciples are warned to be cautious and not allow themselves to be infected with these misleading teachings.

### John Wesley:
