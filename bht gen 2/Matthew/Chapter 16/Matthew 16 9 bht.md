# Matthew 16:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do you still not understand? Have you forgotten the miracles of feeding thousands with just a few loaves and fishes? Jesus questions their lack of faith and perception, reminding them of his previous displays of power and provision. Despite witnessing these miracles, they continue to doubt and reason in a worldly manner, failing to fully grasp the depth of Jesus' teachings and supernatural abilities.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. Matthew 16:9.  Do ye not yet perceive.  Mark (Mark 8:17-18) is more full. Besides want of faith, they had shown great want of perception.
	

### John Gill:
1. "Do ye not understand,.... Meaning either the sense of the advice he had now given; or rather his almighty power displayed in the two miracles of feeding five thousand at one time, and four thousand at another, with a very small quantity of provision."
2. "Have you forgot what was so lately done, namely, the feeding five thousand men, besides women and children, with five loaves and two fishes, when ye took up, after all were filled and satisfied, no less than twelve baskets of fragments?"
3. "Have I fed so many with so small a quantity of food? and am I not able to feed twelve of you, though you have but one loaf? Why all these anxious thoughts and carnal reasonings?"
