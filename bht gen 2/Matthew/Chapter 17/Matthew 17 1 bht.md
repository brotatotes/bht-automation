## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The time of the transfiguration was probably night, for the following reasons... All the circumstances connected with the glorification and accompanying appearances would thus be more prominently seen." 
2. "The Apostles were asleep, and are described, Luke 9:32, as ‘having kept awake through it.’" 
3. "They did not descend till the next day (Luk 9:37), which would be almost inexplicable had the event happened by day, but a matter of course if by night."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He designed to prepare them in an eminent degree for the work of the gospel ministry by the previous manifestations of his glory, and of his patience in suffering."
2. "Our Saviour prayed much. When he did it he chose to be alone. For this purpose he often ascended mountains or went into the deserts. There is something in the solitude and deep and awful stillness of a lofty mountain favorable to devotion."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Taketh [παραλαμβανει] . Rev. gives the force of the preposition para, taketh with him."
2. "Apart [κατ ιδιαν] . Not said of the mountain, as isolated, but of the disciples; so that they might be alone with him."
3. "Compare Mark 9:2, apart by themselves (kat ijdian monouv : lit., apart alone)."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ intended to show that he was not dragged unwillingly to death, but that he came forward of his own accord, to offer to the Father the sacrifice of obedience."
2. "It would manifestly have been quite as easy for Christ to protect his body from death as to clothe it with heavenly glory."
3. "We are also taught that, so long as Christ remained in the world, bearing the form of a servant, and so long as his majesty was concealed under the weakness of the flesh, nothing had been taken from him, for it was of his own accord that he emptied himself."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "His companions in Gethsemane (chap. Matthew 26:35; Mark 14:37), Peter the leader, James the first to suffer martyrdom, and John the beloved disciple who lingered longest on earth."
2. "The transfiguration probably took place in the night."
3. "The transfiguration itself could be seen to better advantage at night than in daylight. On Mount Hermon snow would be visible, adding a natural splendor to the scene."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "These three disciples form an inner group who have shown more understanding of Jesus." 
2. "Apart (κατ' ιδιαν) means 'by themselves' (alone, μονους, Mark has it) up (αναφερε) into a high mountain, probably Mount Hermon again, though we do not really know." 
3. "'The Mount of Transfiguration does not concern geography' (Holtzmann)."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ did not bear the offence in mind, but freely forgave him, and still loved him."
2. "Such a number was taken, as being proper and sufficient to bear witness of the truth of the following account of Christ's transfiguration."
3. "Now the eternal Son of God is shown, in the confession of Peter, and in the illustrious demonstration of the Messiah."
