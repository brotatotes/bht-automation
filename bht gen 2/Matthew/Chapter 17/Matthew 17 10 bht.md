# Matthew 17:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples were puzzled by the assertion made by the scribes that Elijah must come before the Messiah. They questioned why the scribes held onto this belief if no one was to know of his coming. Instead, they pondered whether it would be more fitting to spread the news that Elijah had indeed come and that they had personally witnessed him, serving as witnesses to Jesus as the Messiah.

2. "The disciples having just now seen Elias, are put in mind of this tenet of the Scribes, and of their use of it; and inquire of Christ, not so much about the truth of it, and the reason of their imbibing it, as why they were suffered to make use of it, to his disadvantage."
3. "Were they allowed to divulge this vision, and bear their testimony to this truth, that Elias had appeared, and they had seen him, it might be a means of stopping the mouths of these Scribes; and of convicting men of the truth of the Messiahship of Jesus, upon their own principles, and of confirming them that believed it."

2. "If no man is to know of his coming?"
