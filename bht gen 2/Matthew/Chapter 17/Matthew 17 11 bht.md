# Matthew 17:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The coming of Elijah, as predicted in Malachi, is not about a physical reappearance but rather the restoration and renewal of all things. This work goes beyond what the Jews assigned to Elijah and involves the purifying and restoring of all that has been defiled. Therefore, Elijah's coming is not confined to a specific person, such as John the Baptist, but rather a fulfillment of prophecy that paved the way for the coming of Christ. This restoration and renewal would regulate and prepare all things for the coming of the Messiah.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. "An abstract statement expressing the fact that Elijah's coming precedes in time the coming of the Messiah."
2. "Elijah had already come in the person of John the Baptist."

### John Calvin:
1. "As John the Baptist was to resemble Elijah by restoring the fallen condition of the Church, the prophet Malachi had even given to him the name of Elijah; and this had been rashly interpreted by the scribes, as if Elijah the Tishbite were to return a second time to the world."
2. "Christ now declares that every thing which Malachi uttered was true, but that his prediction had been misunderstood and distorted from its true meaning."
3. "And that no one might be distressed by a proceeding so strange, our Lord mentions that the Scripture contained predictions of both events, that the Redeemer of the world, and Elijah his forerunner, would be rejected by false and wicked teachers."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Elijah indeed cometh. Our Lord confirms the view, that Elijah should come."
2. "Shall restore or â€˜establish anew,â€™ all things. Comp. Malachi 4:6. The actual work of restoration was however the work of the Messiah, for which Elijah should prepare the way."

### John Gill:
1. "The truest sense of the phrase is to be learned out of Malachi 4:6. 'He shall restore, he shall turn all things, the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers'; and as this is explained in Luke 1:17 'he shall turn the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, and make ready a people prepared for the Lord': which is other, and better sort of work, than what the Jews assign to their Elias."
2. "They often speak of his purifying of things, or pronouncing things pure, that were defiled; and among others, that he will purify bastards, and restore them to the congregation of the Lord."
3. "Though Maimonides denies, that when he comes he will pronounce defiled that which is pure, or pronounce pure, that which is defiled."

### John Wesley:
1. Regulate all things â€” In order to the coming of Christ.
