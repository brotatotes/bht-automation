# Matthew 17:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The prophecy of Malachi was fulfilled in John the Baptist, who came in the power and spirit of Elijah as a forerunner to the Messiah. Although John denied being the actual Elijah, Jesus affirmed that he was the one prophesied by Malachi. The people initially recognized John as the forerunner of the Messiah, but later rejected his teachings. They failed to understand that just as John suffered and was martyred, so would the Son of Man, Jesus.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "The prophecy of Malachi had been fulfilled in John the Baptist, so far as the first coming of the Messiah was concerned."
2. "They recognized neither John the forerunner of the Messiah, nor the Messiah himself."
3. "Like persecution followed like unbelief."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Elijah is come already. Thus Jesus identifies John the Baptist with the promise in Malachi, though not the real Elijah in person which John denied."
2. "They knew him not. Just as they do not know Jesus now."
3. "They killed John as they will Jesus the Son of Man."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ refers not to the late appearance of Elias on the mount, but to the coming of a certain person some time ago; who came in the power and spirit of Elias, and was the forerunner and harbinger of him, the Messiah."
2. "They knew him under the name of John the Baptist, and seemed pleased with his ministry for a while, but afterwards rejected his doctrine and baptism."
3. "Christ takes this opportunity to confirm what he had said in the preceding chapter, concerning his sufferings and death; and his meaning is, that as sure as John the Baptist had suffered indignities, and death itself, so sure should the son of man suffer like things."

### John Wesley:
1. "Elijah is come already — And yet when the Jews asked John, Art thou Elijah? He said, I am not, John 1:21. His meaning was, I am not Elijah the Tishbite, come again into the world."
2. "But he was the person of whom Malachi prophesied under that name."
