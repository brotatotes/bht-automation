# Matthew 17:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In referencing John the Baptist, Jesus goes beyond the fulfillment of the prophecy in Malachi, suggesting a deeper meaning. This implies the possibility of another appearance of Elijah prior to Christ's second coming, carrying out a similar preparatory work. The role of John, who came in the spirit and power of Elijah, should not be seen as an obstacle in recognizing Jesus as the Messiah. Instead, it confirms the truth of his Messiahship, reinforcing the concept that in every significant spiritual movement, there will be someone who precedes in the spirit and power of Elijah.
