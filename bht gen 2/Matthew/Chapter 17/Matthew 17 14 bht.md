# Matthew 17:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The scribes approached him in a cunning manner, posing numerous questions about his birth, family, appearance, instructions, all aimed at discrediting him as the Messiah. Their intention was to insinuate that he could not possibly be the Christ, as he did not fit the expected mold. Faithful in their belief, the people were not easily swayed by such deceptive insinuations. The scribes, keenly aware of their own guilt and malicious intentions, remained silent, their lack of response serving as an acknowledgement of their base purposes.
