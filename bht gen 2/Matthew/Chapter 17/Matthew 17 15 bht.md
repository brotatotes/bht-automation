# Matthew 17:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The father's plea for mercy reveals his deep love for his only son, who suffers greatly from epilepsy. The term 'lunatic' accurately describes his condition, as epilepsy was believed to be influenced by the phases of the moon. The son's affliction is severe, causing him to fall into dangerous situations without being able to protect himself. It is likely that the evil spirit takes advantage of the physical vulnerability associated with epilepsy.
