# Matthew 17:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples' struggle with a malignant disease reveals both their weakness and the severity of the illness. Some argue that this contradicts the power Jesus had given them, but this accusation lacks reason. The disciples' inability to cast out the spirit is not due to a lack of power, as Jesus had given them the capability before. Instead, their failure is attributed to a mixture of their own unbelief and the disbelief of others involved.
