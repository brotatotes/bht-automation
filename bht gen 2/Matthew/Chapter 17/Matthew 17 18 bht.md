# Matthew 17:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After the child's severe epileptic fit, he lay weak and seemingly lifeless. Jesus not only reproved the affliction but also commanded the unclean spirit responsible for it to leave the child. By the power of Christ's command, the unclean spirit could not resist but was forced to obey, resulting in a complete cure. This miraculous healing left the onlookers astonished, although it is possible that some remained skeptical, as the Jews commonly associated diseases with demonic influences.
