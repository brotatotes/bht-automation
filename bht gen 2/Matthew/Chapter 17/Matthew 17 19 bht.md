# Matthew 17:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples, feeling disheartened, approached Jesus in a house to inquire about why they were unable to cast out a demon. They were worried that they had lost the power that Jesus had given them. Instead of recognizing their own unbelief as the reason for their inability, they focused on external factors and overlooked the need for faith in their own lives. Jesus reminded them that faith was essential for performing miracles and that nothing was impossible with faith.
