# Matthew 17:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
While praying, Christ underwent a transfiguration, revealing His divine nature through a change in appearance. This transformation, depicted in His radiant face and effulgent garments, conveyed a taste of His boundless glory to His disciples. The splendor they witnessed, resembling the brightness of light and snow, symbolized the transcendence of His true essence. Luminous and dazzling, this vision unveiled a glimpse of the indwelling deity, encompassing both His external radiance and inner majesty. Though not a complete revelation of His heavenly glory, the transfiguration emphasized the supernatural element and demonstrated the incomprehensible nature of Christ's divine being.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "by being lighted with radiance both from without and from within."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'transfigure' means to change the appearance or form."
2. "The Scriptures should be taken just as they are, without any attempt to affix a meaning to them which the sacred writers did not intend."
3. "All this splendor and glory was a change in appearance only."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "There was a fact and a power in that vision which mere radiance and the appearance of the patriarchs could not wholly convey: a revelation of Deity breaking out in that glorified face and form."

### John Calvin:
1. "His transfiguration did not altogether enable his disciples to see Christ, as he now is in heaven, but gave them a taste of his boundless glory, such as they were able to comprehend."
2. "Thus in ancient times God appeared to the holy fathers, not as He was in Himself, but so far as they could endure the rays of His infinite brightness."
3. "There is no necessity for entering here into ingenious inquiries as to the whiteness of his garments, or the brightness of his countenance; for this was not a complete exhibition of the heavenly glory of Christ, but, under symbols which were adapted to the capacity of the flesh, he enabled them to taste in part what could not be fully comprehended."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The change in His appearance took place while He was praying."
2. "His face did shine as the snow, and his garments became white as the light."
3. "No explanation is possible that denies the supernatural element."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The idea is change of form. It really presents the essence of a thing as separate from the fashion, the outward accident."
2. "The deeper force of ŒºŒµœÑŒ±ŒºŒøœÅœÜŒøœÖœÉŒ∏Œ± is seen in 2 Corinthians 3:18 (with reference to the shining on Moses' face), Romans 12:2."
