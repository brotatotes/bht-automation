# Matthew 17:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples' faith is criticized for being small, but the point is not the size of their faith, but its authenticity. Genuine faith, even if it is as small as a mustard seed, has the power to achieve great things. The mention of moving mountains should not be taken literally, but symbolizes the ability of faith to overcome any challenge. It is not about performing miracles, but about the transformation that faith brings to our hearts and lives. The focus should be on cultivating a living and vibrant faith, rather than seeking extraordinary powers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "If you have the smallest or feeblest faith that is genuine, you can do all things."
2. "If you have increasing, expanding, enlarged faith, growing and strengthening from small beginnings, you can perform the most difficult undertaking."
3. "There is a principle of vitality in the grain of seed stretching forward to great results, which illustrates the nature of faith. Your faith should be like that."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Unbelief [Î±Ï€Î¹ÏƒÏ„Î¹Î±Î½] . But the better reading is ojligopistian, littleness of faith. Hence Rev., Because of your little faith.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The attempt showed some faith, the failure 'little faith.'"
2. "Small, yet living and capable of rapid increase, while their faith had decreased."
3. "This promise of power to remove the most formidable obstacles is misunderstood, only when power over material things is deemed greater than spiritual power."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Little faith (Î¿Î»Î¹Î³Î¿Ï€Î¹ÏƒÏ„Î¹Î±Î½). A good translation. It was less than 'a grain of mustard seed' (ÎºÎ¿ÎºÎºÎ¿Î½ ÏƒÎ¹Î½Î±Ï€ÎµÏ‰Ï‚). See Matthew 13:31 for this phrase. They had no miracle faith."
2. "Bruce holds 'this mountain' to be the Mount of Transfiguration to which Jesus pointed. Probably so. But it is a parable."
3. "Our trouble is always with 'this mountain' which confronts our path. Note the form Î¼ÎµÏ„Î±Î²Î± (Î¼ÎµÏ„Î± and Î²Î·Î¸)."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ says, not because of the unbelief of the parent of the child, and those that were with him, though that also was a reason; but because of their unbelief, being willing to convince them of their unbelief, as he had done the father of the child, who had confessed it, and desired it might be removed from him."
2. "But lest they should think they had lost their power of doing miracles, Christ adds; for verily I say unto you, if ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed...such an effect as he after mentions would follow."
3. "So that it does not follow, because the apostles did not do it in a literal sense, therefore they could not...since it was meant that they should, and besides, have done, things equally as great as this, and which is the sense of the words."

### John Wesley:
1. "Because of your unbelief â€” Because in this particular they had not faith."
2. "If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed â€” That is, the least measure of it."
3. "Now, though I have all this faith so as to remove mountains, yet if I have not the faith which worketh by love, I am nothing."
