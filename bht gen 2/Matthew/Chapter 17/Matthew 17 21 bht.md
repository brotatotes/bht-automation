# Matthew 17:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When faced with powerful and persistent evil, prayer becomes a vital remedy, and fasting serves as a supportive aid. It is evident that the notion of fasting being the exclusive means of expelling demons is illogical, as our Lord used it simply to intensify the urgency of prayer. This passage emphasizes that when confronted with deeply entrenched evil, the battle is arduous and requires our utmost determination. It also implies that the disciples' failure to cast out the demon was not solely due to their lack of faith, but also their neglect of prayer for divine assistance.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "Where they have had long possession where they produce such painful, fixed, and alarming effects, they can be expelled only in connection with prayer and fasting."
2. "That is, in order to work miracles of this kind to cast out devils in cases so obstinate and dreadful as this, faith of the highest kind is necessary."
3. "That faith is produced and kept vigorous only by much prayer, and by such abstinence from food as fits the mind for the highest exercises of religion, and leaves it free to hold communion with God."

### John Calvin:
1. "For the weakness of faith he prescribes prayer as a remedy, to which he adds fasting by way of an auxiliary."
2. "Hence it is very evident how absurdly the Papists represent fasting to be the specific method of driving away devils, since our Lord refers to it for no other reason than to stimulate the earnestness of prayer."
3. "When he says that this kind of devils cannot be cast out in any other way than by prayer and fasting, he means that, when Satan has taken deep root in any one, and has been confirmed by long possession, or when he rages with unbridled fury, the victory is difficult and painful, and therefore the contest must be maintained with all our might."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The two oldest manuscripts, the best of the later ones (cursives), some very ancient versions, omit this verse, and there are other reasons for doubting its genuineness."
2. "If retained: 'Howbeit' should be changed to 'but'."
3. "See notes on Mark 9:29, where the passage is to be retained."

### John Gill:
1. "And having had long possession, was not easily ejected."
2. "So they pertinently set forth the dispossession of devils, who do not go out voluntarily, but by force; and this sort could not be ejected, but by fasting and prayer."
3. "It seems that Christ not only suggests, that faith was greatly wanting in his disciples; for which reason they could not cast out the devil, and heal the lunatic; but they had been wanting in prayer to God, to assist them in the exercise of their miraculous gifts."

### John Wesley:
1. "What a testimony is here of the efficacy of fasting, when added to fervent prayer!"
2. "Some kinds of devils the apostles had cast out before this, without fasting."
