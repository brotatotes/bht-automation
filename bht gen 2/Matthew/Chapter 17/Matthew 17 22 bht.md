# Matthew 17:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples' expectations of a prosperous kingdom were shattered when Jesus revealed that he would be betrayed into the hands of men. Their sorrow would be deepened by the repetition of this heavy news. Although Jesus made clear statements, their understanding was clouded by their preconceived notions. Yet, their attachment to Christ, though mixed with confusion and hesitation, prevented them from leaving his side. Jesus wanted them to comprehend the gravity of the situation and the trials that awaited him.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
