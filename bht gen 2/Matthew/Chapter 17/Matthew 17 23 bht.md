The disciples were filled with great sorrow, understanding in that moment the true meaning behind Jesus' words about his death and resurrection.

They struggled to grasp the significance of his words, still holding onto their misguided beliefs about his greatness. It is a reminder that even in present times, many still struggle to comprehend the profound significance of Christ's death and resurrection.
