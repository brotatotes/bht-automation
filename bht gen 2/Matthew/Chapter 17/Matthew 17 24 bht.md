# Matthew 17:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The temple tax was an annual tribute that every male Israelite, including proselytes, was expected to pay to support the temple service. The money-changers played a role in exchanging the current currency into the temple coin at a discounted rate. Jesus, by willingly paying the tax, demonstrated his submission and humility, even though he had authority over all things. It was customary for Jesus to pay this tax, but it was not compulsory, as the payment seemed to be voluntary rather than mandatory.
