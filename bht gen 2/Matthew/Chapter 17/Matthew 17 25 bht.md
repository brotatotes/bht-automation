# Matthew 17:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, anticipating Peter's question about paying taxes, already knew what Peter was going to ask. In response, Jesus asks Peter to consider the practice of earthly kings who collect customs and tribute. He prompts Peter to reflect on whether kings collect taxes from their own children or from strangers who are not part of their own family. This exchange highlights the sense of obligation and responsibility that exists even among earthly monarchs, further emphasizing the significance of Jesus' actions and teachings.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He saith, yes—that is, 'To be sure He does'; as if eager to remove even the suspicion of the contrary."
2. "And when he was come into the house—Peter's. Jesus prevented him—anticipated him; according to the old sense of the word 'prevent.'"
3. "Saying, What thinkest thou, Simon?—using his family name for familiarity. Of whom do the kings of the earth take custom—meaning custom on goods exported or imported. Or tribute—meaning the poll-tax, payable to the Romans by everyone whose name was in the census. This, therefore, it will be observed, was strictly a civil tax. Of their own children, or of strangers—This cannot mean 'foreigners,' from whom sovereigns certainly do not raise taxes, but those who are not of their own family, that is, their subjects."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Prevent, in its older sense, to anticipate, get before, was a correct translation."
2. "The meaning is that Jesus did not wait for Peter to tell him of the demand of the collectors. He anticipated him in speaking about it."
3. "Strangers [αλλοτριων] . Not foreigners, but others than those of their own families; their subjects. In other words, Does a king tax his own children or his subjects?"

### John Calvin:
1. "Peter’s reply contains a modest excuse (580)... from which we infer that Christ had formerly been accustomed to pay."
2. "He simply affirms that he pays tribute, solely because he voluntarily refrains from exercising his right and power. Hence it is inferred that this takes nothing from his reign."
3. "Nothing else was intended by Christ than to claim for himself the honor of a King's Son, so as to have at least a home privileged and exempted from the common law."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Jesus spake first to him, anticipated his statement by superhuman knowledge of what had occurred."
2. "Toll or tribute. Duties or taxes. From their sons, or from strangers, i.e., those not of their household."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The old idiomatic use of φθανω with the participle survives in this example of προφθανω in Matthew 17:25, meaning to anticipate, to get before one in doing a thing."
2. "The 'prevent' of the Authorized Version was the original idea of praevenire, to go before, to anticipate."
3. "By this parable Jesus as the Son of God claims exemption from the temple tax as the temple of his Father just as royal families do not pay taxes, but get tribute from the foreigners or aliens, subjects in reality."

### John Gill:
1. "He saith, yes,.... Without any hesitation, knowing it had been his master's practice; and therefore as he had done it, did not doubt but he would again."
2. "Jesus prevented him; saying what he intended to say, on that head; for he being the omniscient God, though not present, knew what question had been put to Peter, and what answer he had returned; and therefore, before Peter could lay the case before him, he puts this question to him."
3. "Saying, what thinkest thou, Simon? How does it appear to thee, to thy reason and understanding? in what light dost thou consider this matter? what is thy judgment of it? Of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of strangers, or others?"

### John Wesley:
1. "Jesus prevented him — Just when St. Peter was going to ask him for it."
2. "Of their own sons, or of strangers? — That is, such as are not of their own family."
