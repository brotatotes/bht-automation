# Matthew 17:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, in response to Peter's question about paying the temple tax, states that the sons, referring to himself and his disciples, are exempt from such taxation. He clarifies that the tax is collected from strangers or foreigners, not the sons of the King. As the Son of God and the Lord of the temple, Jesus affirms that he is exempt from paying the temple tax, for it is his own house and he has no obligation to pay it to his Father.
