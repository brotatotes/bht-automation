# Matthew 17:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our Lord's words convey the message that despite having the right to exemption, He chooses to pay the required amount to avoid offending those who wrongly claim it. This miraculous act not only demonstrates His foreknowledge but also reveals His omniscience and omnipotence. It showcases His knowledge that the fish He directs to Peter's hook contains the exact amount required. Thus, through this event, we witness His profound knowledge and power at work, as He uses a fish to provide for Peter's and His own financial needs.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Our Lord’s words amount to this: 'that, notwithstanding this immunity, we (graciously including the Apostle in the earthly payment, and omitting the distinction between them, which was not now to be told to any), that we may not offend them, will pay what is required and shall find it furnished by God’s special providence for us.'"
2. "Of course the miracle is to be understood in its literal historic sense."
3. "The stater = four drachmæ, the exact payment required."


### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Notwithstanding, lest we should
	offend—stumble. 
	them—all ignorant as
	they are of My relation to the Lord of the Temple, and should
	misconstrue a claim to exemption into indifference to His honor who
	dwells in it."
2. "go thou to the sea—Capernaum,
	it will be remembered, lay on the Sea of Galilee."
	
3. "that take, and give unto them
	for me and thee—literally, 'instead of Me and thee';
	perhaps because the payment was a redemption of the person
	paid for (Exodus 30:12) —in which
	view Jesus certainly was 'free.' If the house was Peter's,
	this will account for payment being provided on this occasion, not
	for all the Twelve, but only for him and His Lord. Observe, our Lord
	does not say 'for us,' but 'for Me and thee';
	thus distinguishing the Exempted One and His non-exempted disciple."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The only mention in the New Testament of fishing with a hook."
2. "Christ names a definite sum, the stater, which is a literal transcription of the Greek word, and represents two didrachmas, or a shekel." 
3. "Hence Rev., a shekel."

### John Calvin:
1. "...that he did so in order to prove by a miracle, that he had a more extensive dominion than all earthly kings, since he had even fishes for his tributaries."
2. "And we do not read that this was done more than once, because one proof was enough for his whole life."
3. "A stater was of the same value as a shekel, namely, four drachms or two didrachma."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The time was not ripe for asserting this freedom; our Lord was still 'under the law' for us."
2. "Our Lord here exhibits miraculous power, in drawing by the force of His will this fish to that place at that time, as well as foreknowledge of the event."
3. "The fisherman must resume his old occupation to discharge the debt he had so readily acknowledged. Our Lord's position, not his poverty, called for this provision."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He does not wish to create the impression that he and the disciples despise the temple and its worship."
2. "Here we have a miracle of foreknowledge. Such instances have happened."
3. "It is not stated that Peter actually caught such a fish though that is the natural implication."

### John Gill:
1. "Though Christ could have maintained his right of exemption from payment...yet he chose to forego it...when the honour and interest of religion lie at stake."
2. "This was a wonderful instance of the omniscience of Christ, who knew there was in such a fish, such a piece of money, as exactly answered the present exigence."
3. "It declares his great poverty as man, that he had not a shekel to pay on such an occasion, without working a miracle; and his great condescension to do it, rather than give offence by non-payment."

### John Wesley:
1. "Yet that, we may not offend them — Even those unjust, unreasonable men, who claim what they have no manner of right to: do not contest it with them, bat rather yield to their demand, than violate peace or love."
2. "Any thing which is not expressly forbidden in the word of God."
3. "How illustrious a degree of knowledge and power did our Lord here discover! Knowledge, penetrating into this animal, though beneath the waters; and power, in directing this very fish to Peter's hook, though he himself was at a distance!"
