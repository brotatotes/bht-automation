# Matthew 17:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When we read the phrase Hear ye him, it serves as a reminder that Jesus is not just a prophet or a servant like Moses or Elijah, but rather the beloved Son of God. He holds a unique and superior position, as God's own son. This commandment to listen to Jesus highlights his authority and the importance of heeding his teachings. It also emphasizes that Jesus surpasses all others, both in his mediatorial role as both prophet and king. As we encounter this phrase, we are reminded that Jesus is the ultimate authority and source of truth. (Deuteronomy 18:17)

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

2. "A bright cloud could render them invisible as readily as a dark one."

2. "This regards, not so much the well pleasedness of God with the person of Christ, which is expressed in the former clause; but signifies that he was in him, as Mediator, well pleased with all his people."
