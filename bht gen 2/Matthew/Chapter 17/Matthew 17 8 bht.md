# Matthew 17:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the disciples lifted up their eyes, they saw Moses and Elijah, representing the law and the prophets. However, Jesus, through His touch and words of comfort, reassured them that He was the fulfillment and completion of the law and the prophets. He is not to be confused with Moses, Elijah, or any other figure; Jesus is the only Mediator, Savior, Redeemer, Prophet, Priest, and King. This distinction is made clear by the voice from heaven, which declared that it was exclusively concerning Christ and not Moses or Elijah.
