# Matthew 17:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus instructs his disciples not to share the vision they witnessed with anyone until he has risen from the dead. This was to ensure that the disciples, especially Peter, James, and John, who experienced the vision, would have a deep understanding of his mission and authority. By keeping the vision a secret for a time, Jesus protected his disciples from potential disbelief or disappointment from others. Once the resurrection occurred, the disciples would be equipped with a powerful testimony that would confirm the reality and significance of the vision.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Tell the vision to no man - This vision was designed particularly to confirm them in the truth that he was the Messiah."
2. "The sole design of this transfiguration was to convince them that he was the Christ; that he was greater than the greatest of the prophets; that he was the Son of God."
3. "The Pharisees believed that the dead would rise, and there is no doubt that the disciples believed it; but their views were not clear, and, in particular, they did not understand what he meant by his rising from the dead."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:

2. "...it fully evident that, even during the time that he emptied himself, he continued to retain his divinity entire..."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "As they were coming down. This would require some time."
2. "Tell the vision to no one. 'Vision does not imply that the occurrence was a kind of dream, or like the visions seen by the prophets."
3. "Until the Son of man be risen from the dead. It was too soon to tell of it; even the three understood very little (Mark 9:10). This injunction would also serve to impress the occurrence on their minds; discussion of it during the intervening period of persecution would occasion doubts or carnal expectations. Besides it involved new light concerning the state of the dead, which could not be received until the resurrection of Christ. The necessity for concealment then ceased."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

### John Gill:
1. "These Christ strictly ordered Peter, James, and John, to speak of to no man whatever; no, not their fellow disciples; who either would be apt to disbelieve them, on account of the greatness of them, as Thomas did the resurrection of Christ afterwards; or lest they should be troubled and displeased, that they were not admitted to the same sight."
2. "until the son of man be risen again from the dead; meaning himself and his resurrection, when such proof would be given of his mission, authority, and glory, which would make this account more easy to be believed."
3. "for they were not yet reconciled to the Messiah's dying, which was contrary to their expectation of a temporal kingdom; and therefore could not tell what to make of his rising again, whether this had not some secret, mystical meaning."

### John Wesley:
1. "Tell the vision to no man... till the Son of man be risen again - Till the resurrection should make it credible, and confirm their testimony about it."
2. "Not to the rest of the disciples, lest they should be grieved and discouraged because they were not admitted to the sight..."
3. "Nor to any other persons, lest it should enrage some the more, and his approaching sufferings shall make others disbelieve it..."
