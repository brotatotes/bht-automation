# Matthew 18:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples' dispute about who should be the greatest arose from previous discussions and the sense of leadership Peter had received from Jesus. Jesus, knowing their thoughts, confronted them about their ambitions and the desire for positions in the political kingdom they were expecting. Their silence in response to Jesus' question demonstrates the moral power of His person and the need to beware of ambition. Instead, Jesus teaches that true greatness comes from bearing the cross until the proper time for receiving the crown in the kingdom of heaven.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In Mark we learn that this discourse arose out of a dispute among the disciples who should be the greatest."
2. "The dispute had taken place before, on the way to Capernaum. It had probably been caused by the mention of the Kingdom of God as at hand in ch. Matthew 16:19, Matthew 16:28, and the preference given by the Lord to the Three."
3. "In Mark it is our Lord who asks them what they were disputing about, and they are silent."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Who then? Who, as things stand."
2. "Since one of our number has been doubly honored... who then is greatest?"

### John Calvin:
1. "When Christ makes inquiry about a secret conversation, and forces the disciples to acknowledge what they would willingly have kept back, this teaches us that we ought to beware of all ambition, however carefully it may be concealed."
2. "If we wish that our manner of life should receive the approbation of the Lord, we must learn to bear patiently the burden of the cross that has been laid on us, till the proper time arrive for obtaining the crown."
3. "Since we are commanded by the Lord to walk on the earth, those who make the condition of departed saints in heaven the subject of eager debate will be found, in so doing, to retard their own progress towards heaven."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Nor did they answer His question; His knowledge of their thoughts probably shamed them. An indication of the moral power of His Person."
2. "'Then' hints at a previous discussion."
3. "Priority, not primacy. This gives room for a more general discussion."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The wonderful words of Jesus to Peter on Mount Hermon (Matthew 16:17-19) had evidently made Peter feel a fresh sense of leadership on the basis of which he had dared even to rebuke Jesus for speaking of his death (Matthew 16:22)."
2. "Plainly the primacy of Peter was not yet admitted by the others."
3. "But it is a sad discovery to find the disciples chiefly concerned about their own places (offices) in the political kingdom which they were expecting."

### John Gill:
1. "The occasion of this could not be the respect shown to Peter, in paying the half shekel for him for this conversation was begun in the way, and before this was done, or, at least, before they knew it."
2. "Rather it might be occasioned by his promise of giving the keys of the kingdom of heaven to him; or by his taking him, and James, and John, so lately to the mountain with him, where he was transfigured before them; though it seems best to ascribe it to the mention Christ had made of his resurrection from the dead."
3. "And, by the kingdom of heaven, they meant, not the kingdom of glory in another world, but the kingdom of the Messiah in this; and which they looked upon to be a temporal one, though they call it the kingdom of heaven."
