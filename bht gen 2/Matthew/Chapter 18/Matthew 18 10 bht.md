# Matthew 18:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Beware of despising the least among believers, whether they be children or those who have become like children in their faith. The angels, who hold high honor before God, are entrusted with the care of these humble souls. Therefore, we should not disregard or look down upon even the seemingly insignificant members of the body of Christ. Let us remember the special attention and favor they receive from heavenly beings and treat them with respect and care, for they are under the watchful guidance of the highest and noblest beings in heaven.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The warning against contempt of these little ones must not be taken as only implying â€˜maxima debetur puero reverentiaâ€™ (Juv [147] xiv. 47), nor indeed as relating exclusively, or even principally, to children."
2. "The little children in the outward status of the Church are in fact the only disciples who are sure to be that in reality, which their Baptism has put upon them, and so exactly answer to the wider meaning here conveyed by the term."
3. "Those angels whose honour is high before God are entrusted with the charge of the humble and meek, the children in age and the children in grace."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Among men, those who nurse and rear the royal children, however humble in themselves, are allowed free entrance with their charge, and a degree of familiarity which even the highest state ministers dare not assume."
2. "Probably our Lord means that, in virtue of their charge over His disciples, the angels have errands to the throne, a welcome there, and a dear familiarity in dealing with 'His Father which is in heaven,' which on their own matters they could not assume."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That is, one who has become like a little child, or a Christian."

3. "So, says our Saviour, we should not despise the obscurest Christian, for he is ministered to by the highest and noblest of beings by beings who are always enjoying the favor and friendship of God."

### John Calvin:
1. "No man who has a proper care for his brethren will ever allow himself, on light grounds, to give them offense."
2. "God embraces with wonderful love the little ones."
3. "We ought therefore to beware of despising their salvation, which even angels have been commissioned to advance."

2. "This seems indeed to have been a notion that prevailed among the Jews, not only that there were angels which presided over particular nations, but who also had the care of particular persons."
3. "And our Lord's argument is, that if such excellent creatures as the angels in heaven, who are continually favoured with being in the presence of Christ's heavenly father, honoured with so high a station, as always to stand before him, as ministers of his; if these are the guardians of these little ones, if they are committed to their care, and they have the oversight of them, then they ought not to be despised."
