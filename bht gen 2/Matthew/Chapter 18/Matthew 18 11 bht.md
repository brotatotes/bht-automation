# Matthew 18:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Son of Man has come to save those who were lost, a significant message that is repeated throughout the scriptures. This serves as a reminder of the purpose of Christ's mission on earth - to seek and save those who were in a state of spiritual separation from God. It is a powerful statement of God's love and grace, as He tirelessly pursues and redeems those who are lost. As believers, we are called to heed this message, avoiding actions or attitudes that could hinder or turn away those whom God desires to save.
