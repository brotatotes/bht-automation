# Matthew 18:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The will of the Father is that none of these little ones should perish. This passage emphasizes the importance of valuing and protecting those who are considered insignificant or vulnerable. Whether we interpret the phrase as your Father or my Father, the message remains the same: it is against God's will to despise or cause harm to these little ones. This parable shows us that salvation is not based on our innocence but on the work of the Son of Man, who came to save and protect all of God's children.

3. "Nor shall anyone of them finally and totally fall away and perish, through the power of their own corruptions, the temptations of Satan, the reproaches and persecutions of men, the frowns or flatteries of the world, or through the errors and heresies of false teachers, or any other way."

### John Wesley:
1. So it is not the will of your Father — Neither doth my Father despise the least of them. Observe the gradation. The angels, the Son, the Father.
