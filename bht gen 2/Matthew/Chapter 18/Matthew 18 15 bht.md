# Matthew 18:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When a brother offends us, it is our responsibility to address the issue with love and caution. We should approach the person privately, showing them their fault and giving them a chance to make amends. If this approach doesn't resolve the matter, we can involve a few witnesses to provide support and help. If all attempts fail, we may have to treat the offender as an unbeliever, but always with the hope of restoring them. Through these steps, we can maintain the unity and love within the body of Christ and fulfill our duty as followers of Jesus.
