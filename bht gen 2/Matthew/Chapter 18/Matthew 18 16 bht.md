# Matthew 18:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When faced with an offense, the initial step is to address it privately, seeking to heal the wound and keep the matter discreet. If the offender remains unyielding, the involvement of two or three witnesses becomes necessary, allowing for potential resolution while avoiding the need for public exposure. This process aligns with God's approach, reproving individuals privately before escalating the matter among a wider circle of friends. In cases where all other attempts fail, a public reproof may be employed to shame the offender and encourage repentance. This multifaceted approach seeks restoration and reconciliation through love and wisdom.
