# Matthew 18:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When dealing with a fellow believer's wrongdoing, Jesus instructs us to first speak privately to the individual. If this doesn't resolve the issue, we are to involve one or two more people. And if that still doesn't bring about change, the entire church is to be informed. In such cases, the one who persists in sin should be seen as an outsider, like a Gentile or a notorious sinner, with whom the Jews refused all religious and civil interaction. This highlights the seriousness with which the church must address ungodly behavior.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ, by what follows, certainly not ‘the Jewish synagogue’ (for how could Mat 18:18-20 be said in any sense of it?), but the congregation of Christians."
2. "ἔστω σοὶ κ . τ . λ.] ‘let him no longer be accounted as a brother, but as one of those without,’ as the Jews accounted Gentiles and Publicans."
3. "Yet even then not with hatred, see 1 Corinthians 5:11, and compare 2 Corinthians 2:6-7, and 2 Thessalonians 3:14-15."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Tell it to the church...the representatives of the church, or these who act for the church."
2. "The first business in disciplining an offending brother."
3. "Cease to have religious contact with him, or to acknowledge him as a Christian brother."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The admonition and entreaty of the Church is to be used as a means of regaining the brother."
2. "A man of high spirituality would be won by the first step, a lukewarm Christian by the second or third; when all fail, it is not distinctly commanded that the Church should pronounce him no Christian."
3. "His character has proved itself so far unchristian that the person injured cannot have fellowship with him."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Refuse to hear... hearing without heeding, hearing aside" 
2. "The problem here is whether Jesus has in mind an actual body of believers already in existence or is speaking prophetically of the local churches that would be organized later" 
3. "There are some who think that the Twelve Apostles constituted a local εκκλησια, a sort of moving church of preachers"

### John Gill:
1. "The reproof should be first private, and if it did not succeed, to be made before one or two more; and if that did not do, the whole body was to be acquainted with it."
2. "After he has come under the cognizance, reproof, and censure of the church, he is to look upon him as the Jews did one that disregarded both private reproof by a man's self, and that which was in the presence of one or two more, 'a worthless friend', or neighbour; as a Gentile, with whom the Jews had neither religious nor civil conversation; and a 'publican', or as Munster's Hebrew Gospel reads it, 'a notorious sinner', as a publican was accounted."
3. "Hence such are often joined together, and with whom the Jews might not eat, nor keep any friendly and familiar acquaintance." (36 words)
