# Matthew 18:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Verily I say unto you, that whatsoever ye shall bind or loose on earth, whether it be in terms of excommunication or absolution, shall be binding in heaven. This power that Christ gives is not unique to Peter or the apostles alone, but extends to the entire church. It is important to note that this authority refers to actions and decisions regarding matters of discipline and behavior within the church, rather than directly pertaining to forgiveness or salvation of individuals. Therefore, the collective prayers and intercession of the church have great power and influence in the heavenly realm.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
