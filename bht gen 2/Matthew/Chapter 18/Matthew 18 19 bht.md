# Matthew 18:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When two believers have complete unity and agreement in their prayers, the power of God is unleashed. This harmony goes beyond a mere concord of voices; it reflects a genuine fellowship and accord. Their requests, aligned with God's will, are granted by the Father in heaven. There is no limit to what He can do when two or more agree in prayer. This should serve as a strong motivation for believers to engage in the powerful practice of united prayer, regardless of how few are involved.
