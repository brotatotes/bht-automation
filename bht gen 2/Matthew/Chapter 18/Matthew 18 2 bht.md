# Matthew 18:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The placement of the child in the midst of the disciples and the subsequent act of taking the child in His arms illustrate the profound lesson that our Lord sought to teach His followers. The child's ready submission and trustfulness serve as a poignant example for the disciples, highlighting the importance of humility and the absence of rivalry or pursuit of rank. This act serves as a reminder that true greatness is not achieved by seeking to rise above others, but rather through a humble disposition and a willingness to embrace the innocence and simplicity represented by the child.

### Philip Schaff:

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "Set him" (εστησεν). Transitive first aorist active indicative, not intransitive second aorist, εστη.
