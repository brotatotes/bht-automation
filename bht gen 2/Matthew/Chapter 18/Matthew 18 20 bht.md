# Matthew 18:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When believers gather together, even in small numbers, to worship and seek the Lord's guidance, he promises to be present among them. This presence of Christ is not determined by the size of the gathering, but by the genuine worship and devotion to him. Through his Spirit, he actively guides and empowers their prayers, counsels, and petitions. It is a reminder of the significance of sincere worship and unity in the name of Jesus, as it is in these moments that believers experience the tangible presence and power of Christ.
