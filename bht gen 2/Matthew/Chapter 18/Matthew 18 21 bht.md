# Matthew 18:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter wanted clarification on the frequency of forgiving a brother who has sinned, knowing that forgiveness was a duty when accompanied by repentance and acknowledgment. He possibly expected a generous answer of forgiving up to seven times. Interestingly, Jewish scholars had set a limit of three times for forgiveness, believing they should not forgive on the fourth offense.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In the recent dispute, Peter had probably been an object of special envy, and his forwardness in continually answering for all the rest would likely be cast up to him—and if so, probably by Judas—notwithstanding his Master's commendations."
2. "And as such insinuations were perhaps made once and again, he wished to know how often and how long he was to stand it."
3. "This being the sacred and complete number, perhaps his meaning was, Is there to be a limit at which the needful forbearance will be full?"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The mention of the duty... led Peter to ask how often this was to be done."
2. "To forgive is to treat as though the offence was not committed - to declare that we will not harbor malice or treat unkindly, but that the matter shall be buried and forgotten."

### John Calvin:
1. "He asks, therefore, if it be proper frequently to forgive offenders; for, since the number seven is taken for a large number, the force of the adverb, (ἑπτάκις) seven times, is the same as if he had said, 'How long, Lord, dost thou wish that offenders be received into favor?'" 
2. "But Christ is so far from yielding to this objection, that he expressly declares that there ought to be no limit to forgiving; for he did not intend to lay down a fixed number, but rather to enjoin us never to become wearied."
3. "But as soon as the offender gives probable evidence of conversion, Christ desires that he shall be admitted to reconciliation, lest, on being repulsed, he lose courage and fall back."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The question was a moral fruit of the previous discourse."
2. "The Rabbins said, three times; Peter increased the number to the sacred one of seven."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Peter thought that he was generous as the Jewish rule was three times (Amos 1:6)."
2. "The man who asks such a question does not really know what forgiveness means" (Plummer).

### John Gill:
1. "He instances in a brother, because it was such an one Christ had been speaking of; he makes no doubt of its being his duty to forgive him upon his repentance, and acknowledgment, but wanted to be reformed, how often this was to be done." 
2. "Which was, as he might think, a large number; and especially, since it was double the number of times, that the Jewish doctors set for forgiveness."
3. "For thus they say, 'A man that commits a sin, the "first" time they pardon him; the "second" time they pardon him; the "third" time they pardon him: the "fourth" time they do not pardon.'"
