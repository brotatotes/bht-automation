# Matthew 18:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The phrase until seventy times seven signifies the need for unlimited forgiveness. It is not about fixing a specific number, but about being ready to forgive as often as there is a need. This means that forgiveness should be extended whenever someone repents and acknowledges their faults. It emphasizes that there is no set time or limit for the act of forgiveness, but rather it should be a continuous practice in one's life.
