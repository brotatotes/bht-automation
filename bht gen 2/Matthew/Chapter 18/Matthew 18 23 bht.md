# Matthew 18:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The kingdom of heaven, which refers to the church or the way in which God interacts with His people, can be compared to a human king. This parable is a lesson on the importance of forgiveness, as those who refuse to forgive others subject themselves to a harsh and unforgiving law. We must remember that compared to God, we are insignificant, and when we consider the immense debt we owe to Him, we should be quick to extend forgiveness to others. It is unjust for someone burdened by their own sins to withhold forgiveness from fellow human beings.
