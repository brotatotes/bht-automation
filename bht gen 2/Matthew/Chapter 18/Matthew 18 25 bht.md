# Matthew 18:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Every sinner is insolvent, without anything to offer as compensation for their debts. They lack righteousness and works that can save them. Without the blood, righteousness, and satisfaction of Christ, debtors are liable to be cast into the prison of hell until every last penny of their debt is paid. We should be immensely grateful to Jesus for becoming a surety for us, paying off our debts, and obtaining every blessing of grace we need. The power of creditors over insolvent debtors in ancient times is similar to the severity shown in this parable.
