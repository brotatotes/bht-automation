# Matthew 18:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The servant, overwhelmed by fear and guilt, prostrated himself before his lord, unable to stand or meet his gaze. In his deep distress, he made extravagant promises, hoping to appease the wrath and ruin that haunted him. However, these promises revealed his ignorance of the gravity of his sin and the impossibility of reconciling with an infinite being through finite efforts.
