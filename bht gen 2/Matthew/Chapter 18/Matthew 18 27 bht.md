# Matthew 18:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The master, in a display of compassion and mercy, forgave the servant's loan. This act of forgiveness by the master reflects the nature of God's forgiveness towards us. When God forgives our sins, He forgives us completely, not bound by time or limits. Such forgiveness is a result of God's grace, freely given through the sacrifice of His Son, Jesus Christ, who took our place and satisfied the debt of our sins.
