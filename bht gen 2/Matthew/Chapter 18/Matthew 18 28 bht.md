# Matthew 18:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The servant, having received forgiveness and freedom from his master, immediately left the presence of the Lord. However, he then demanded full payment from a fellow servant, showing the severity and rigidity that some religious people display towards their fellow Christians. Yet, the offenses committed against us by others are minuscule in comparison to the sins we have committed against God. This parable emphasizes the importance of showing mercy and forgiveness to others, just as God has shown to us.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The fellow-servant is probably not in the same station as himself, but none the less a fellow-servant."
2. "The insignificance of the sum is to shew us how trifling any offence against one another is in comparison to the vastness of our sin against God."
3. "οὐ τὸ σχῆμα τῆς ἱκετηρίας ἀνέμνησεν αὐτὸν τῆς τοῦ δεσπότου φιλανθρωπίας."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Mark the difference here. The first case is that of master and servant; in this case, both are on a footing of equality."
2. "If Jewish money is intended, this debt was to the other less than one to a million."
3. "Mark the mercilessness even of the tone."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A hundred pence [εκατον δηναρια] . Less than a millionth part of his own debt."
2. "Creditors often dragged their debtors before the judge, as the Roman law allowed them to do, holding them by the throat."
3. "What thou owest [ει τι οφειλεις] . Lit., If thou owest anything. Not that the creditor is uncertain about the fact of the debt, though some uncertainty about the exact amount may be implied."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The transgressions of our fellowmen against us are trifling in comparison to our sin against God."
2. "An unforgiving spirit is quick to apply the harshest legal measures."
3. "Only when near Him are we like Him."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A hundred pence (εκατον δηναρια). A denarius was worth about eight and a half pence. The hundred denarii here were equal to some 'fifty shillings,' 'about 4 pounds,' 'twenty pounds,' 'twenty dollars,' '100 shillings.' These are various efforts to represent in modern language the small amount of this debt compared with the big one."
2. "Took him by the throat (επνιγεν). 'Held him by the throat.' It is imperfect, probably inchoative, 'began to choke or throttle him.' The Roman law allowed this indignity. Vincent quotes Livy (iv. 53) who tells how the necks were twisted (collum torsisset) and how Cicero (Pro Cluentio, xxi.) says: 'Lead him to the judgment seat with twisted neck (collo obtorto).'"
3. "'What thou owest (ε τ οφειλεις). Literally, 'if thou owest anything,' however little. He did not even know how much it was, only that he owed him something. 'The 'if' is simply the expression of a pitiless logic' (Meyer)."

### John Gill:
1. "But the same servant went out,.... From his Lord's palace and presence, immediately, directly, after he had got his pardon and liberty."
2. "For so sins committed against men, against fellow creatures, or fellow Christians; are but small, when compared with those which are committed against God."
3. "This man insisted on payment of the whole debt which expresses the rigour and severity used by some professors of religion to their fellow Christians; who, having offended them, in ever so small a matter, will not put up with the affront, nor forgive the injury, without having the most ample satisfaction, and avenging themselves upon them to the uttermost."
