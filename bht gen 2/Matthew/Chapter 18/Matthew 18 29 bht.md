# Matthew 18:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The servant who had been forgiven a great debt from his master now finds himself in a similar situation when his fellow servant pleads with him. The same words that had elicited compassion from the master are now used by the servant, falling down at his feet in humility and begging for patience. This highlights the irony that while we are quick to make promises to God, we often struggle to fulfill them. We should remember the mercy we have received and extend it to others, recognizing our own need for forgiveness.
