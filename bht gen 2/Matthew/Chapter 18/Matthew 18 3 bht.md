# Matthew 18:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To enter the Kingdom of Heaven, one must humbly turn away from selfish ambitions, as illustrated by the need to become like little children. The concept of conversion is emphasized, implying a complete change in perspective and a departure from the pursuit of worldly status. This turning is essential for entering the kingdom, let alone attaining any position within it. These words serve as a prophecy of the future, urging individuals to focus not on their own greatness, but on the question of whether they have truly entered the kingdom through a humbling transformation.

### Henry Alford:
1. "œÉœÑœÅŒ±œÜ·øÜœÑŒµ = ŒºŒµœÑŒ±ŒΩŒø·øÜœÑŒµ: it also conveys the idea of turning back from the course previously begun, viz. that of ambitious rivalry."
