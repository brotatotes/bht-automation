# Matthew 18:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The servant, filled with a sense of injustice and resentment, exacted harsh and unjust punishment upon his debtor. He took him before the authorities, making sure that he would be imprisoned until he could completely pay off the debt. This act reveals not only the servant's cruelty and ignorance but also highlights the dangers of bitter controversy and unforgiving acts of discipline. In doing so, it jeopardizes the relationship and potentially causes the loss of an otherwise valuable member of the community.
