## BHT:
The actions of the individuals mentioned in this passage show that anger is not the appropriate response to sin, but rather sorrow. They were deeply grieved and troubled by the cruelty and unhappiness they witnessed, displaying a tenderhearted and forgiving spirit. This serves as a reminder that, as believers, our duty is to forgive our brethren and pray against oppression and tyranny. Though we may not have the power to directly oppose such measures, we can go to the Lord in prayer and share our concerns, knowing that He hears the cries of His people.
