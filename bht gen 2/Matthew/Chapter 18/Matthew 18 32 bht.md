# Matthew 18:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parable of the wicked servant highlights the unreasonable and heartless behavior of the servant towards his fellow servant. Despite owing a great debt and being shown mercy, the wicked servant showed no compassion and failed to have gratitude towards his master. The forgiveness extended to him was a complete release of his debt, yet he failed to extend the same compassion to others. The recent favor shown to him serves to emphasize the wickedness of his actions, making his punishment more justifiable.
