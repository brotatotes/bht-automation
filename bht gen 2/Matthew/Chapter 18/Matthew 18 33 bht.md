# Matthew 18:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The duty of forgiveness is one that should be obvious, yet it is often performed imperfectly. Was it not necessary for us to extend the same measure of mercy that we have received? The king in this parable demonstrates this expectation by fitting the cap of the wicked slave onto the poor debtor. After receiving such great mercy, the least we can do is follow the example set before us and show mercy to others. This act of pity and compassion not only sets an example, but also places an obligation on us to act accordingly.
