# Matthew 18:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The punishment for this debtor is severe, more than just imprisonment. The tormentors represent the severity of the treatment he thought necessary. It is important to note that the punishment is not for a specific sin that was previously forgiven, but for the overall state of enmity to God. The motive presented in this parable is fully understood when we consider the great act of Atonement accomplished by the Lord. It is a reminder that without forgiving others, we cannot expect to receive forgiveness from God, who freely and fully forgives us.

### John Gill:
1. "It is certain, that sin, once pardoned by God, he never punishes for it; for pardon with him is of all sin; he forgives all trespasses, though ever so many, and remits the whole debt, be it ever so large; which act of his grace will never be revoked."
2. "By this act, sin is covered out of sight; it is blotted out, and entirely done away, and that for ever."
3. "The scope of the parable is to enforce mutual forgiveness among men, from having received full and free pardon at the hands of God; and that without the former, there is little reason to expect the latter."

### John Wesley:
1. "Imprisonment is a much severer punishment in the eastern countries than in ours."
2. "State criminals, especially when condemned to it, are not only confined to a very mean and scanty allowance, but are frequently loaded with clogs or heavy yokes, so that they can neither lie nor sit at ease: and by frequent scourgings and sometimes rackings are brought to an untimely end."
3. "How observable is this whole account; as well as the great inference our Lord draws from it: 1. The debtor was freely and fully forgiven; 2. He wilfully and grievously offended; 3. His pardon was retracted, the whole debt required, and the offender delivered to the tormentors for ever."
