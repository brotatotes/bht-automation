# Matthew 18:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is the solemn declaration of Jesus Himself that those who refuse to forgive others will not receive forgiveness from God. This parable serves as a powerful reminder that God will act in a similar manner towards those who are cruel and unforgiving. It is not enough to simply make a profession of faith; true forgiveness must come from the heart, fully and freely. This passage emphasizes the importance of letting go of past wrongs and extending genuine forgiveness to others, as it is God's will for us to forgive one another.
