# Matthew 18:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Whoever humbly puts others before themselves and does not think highly of themselves shall act with modesty and humility. They will lower themselves to the level of the least esteemed, engaging in open and familiar communication without distinction, imitating the example of this little child. They will consider themselves the foremost of sinners, the least among saints, and unworthy of their calling, yet be blessed with abundant grace and extraordinary gifts.
