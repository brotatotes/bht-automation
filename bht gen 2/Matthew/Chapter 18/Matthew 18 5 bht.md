# Matthew 18:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are called to imitate the humility and modesty of children, not only in age but in spirit, for in the heavenly kingdom, children are highly esteemed. When Jesus speaks of receiving his disciples in his name, he is referring to accepting them with love and respect, not just in a physical sense, but in embracing their ministry and the message of the Gospel they preach. By doing so, we are not only receiving them but receiving Christ himself, as if we were personally receiving him and all the blessings and favors that come with it.
