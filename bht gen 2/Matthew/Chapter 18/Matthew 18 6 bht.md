# Matthew 18:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When believers are rejected and their ministry is despised, they may be seen as offended and persecuted. Jesus warns that the punishment for causing such offense is severe, stating that it is better to have a millstone hung around one's neck and be drowned in the sea than to harm and mistreat the disciples of Christ. This punishment symbolizes the grave consequences that await those who mistreat His followers. It is far better to bear any temporal punishment than to expose oneself to eternal destruction by causing offense and harm to the followers of Jesus.
