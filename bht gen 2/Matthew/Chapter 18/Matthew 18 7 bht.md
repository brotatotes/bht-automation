# Matthew 18:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Offences, or stumbling-blocks, refer to temptations to sin, contempt cast upon Christ's doctrines, or anything that turns someone away from God. These stumbling-blocks are inevitable considering the malice of Satan, the world's enmity, and God's allowance. However, this does not excuse the sin of those who set such traps, as they bring unspeakable misery upon the world. Even if the most beloved things become stumbling-blocks, we must remove them for the sake of righteousness. The world will face woe through these offences, and it is crucial that we remain vigilant against them.
