# Matthew 18:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To avoid falling into eternal damnation, it is crucial to refrain from giving offense to Christ's disciples or causing them to stumble. This includes abstaining from unchaste looks, desires, and lusts, as these actions gratify the flesh and carry the same weight of condemnation as any other form of offense. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to be mindful of our actions and their impact on others, as disregarding this can result in severe consequences.
