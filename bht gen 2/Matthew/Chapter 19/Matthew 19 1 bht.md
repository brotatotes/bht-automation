# Matthew 19:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus had completed his teachings on humility, forgiveness, and reproving offenders, and was now departing from Galilee, not to return until after his resurrection. As he journeyed, he entered the borders of Judea beyond the Jordan, steadily approaching Jerusalem, where he had foretold his disciples that he must go, suffer, and die. This marked a significant and solemn period in his ministry, as he made preparations to attend the last Passover.
