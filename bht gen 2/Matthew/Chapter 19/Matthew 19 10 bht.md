# Matthew 19:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples held low views of marriage, believing it would lead to sin and misery. They even suggested it would be better not to marry at all, given the challenges. However, Christ's teachings on marriage were far higher, emphasizing the inviolable bond between spouses. Divorce was only permitted in cases of adultery. While it may seem expedient to avoid marriage to prevent unhappiness, it is important to approach God's gifts with reverence. We should not let personal preferences overshadow the sacredness of marriage, even if it means enduring difficulties for the sake of the divine institution.
