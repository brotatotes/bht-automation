# Matthew 19:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Being unmarried may be preferable in certain situations, but not everyone is capable of receiving this saying or has the gift of continence. It is a special gift from God that allows individuals to renounce marriage for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. While celibacy may be suitable for those who can withstand their natural inclinations and devote themselves fully to God without distraction, it is important to remember that marriage is a divine calling. Jesus' teaching on celibacy challenges us to aspire to a higher spiritual ideal, but it is a gift that is not universally given.
