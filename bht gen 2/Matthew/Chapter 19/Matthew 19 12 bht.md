# Matthew 19:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
There are individuals who have chosen to abstain from marriage for the sake of dedicating themselves wholly to God's work, and they are to be commended for their devotion. This is not to say that marriage is condemned or despised, but rather those who are capable of embracing celibacy should do so joyfully. This command from Jesus is not a suggestion, but a gracious call to those who are able to accept it wholeheartedly.
