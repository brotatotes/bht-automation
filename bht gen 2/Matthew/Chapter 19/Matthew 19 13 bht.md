# Matthew 19:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is evident that the children brought to Jesus were not limited to those from believers' families, and it was a common practice for parents to seek blessings and prayers from religious and pious individuals. The disciples' rebuke of those who brought the children suggests that they believed this act was beneath the dignity of Jesus. However, Jesus was eager to pray for them and lay His hands on them as a form of seeking a blessing for these young ones.
