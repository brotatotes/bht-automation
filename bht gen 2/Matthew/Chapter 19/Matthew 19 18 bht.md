# Matthew 19:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ's enumeration of the commandments focuses on moral precepts, disregarding ceremonial laws and traditions. By highlighting commandments that involve duties towards others, he challenges the young man's self-righteousness. This choice of commandments serves to emphasize the importance of not only fulfilling our obligations to one another but also those that concern our relationship with God. Eternal life cannot be obtained through the mere performance of these actions, as our worship of God often falls short.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "De Wette observes well, that our Lord gives this enumeration of the commandments to bring out the self-righteous spirit of the young man..."
2. "He only mentions those of the second table, having in Matthew 19:17, in His declaration respecting ἀγαθός, included those of the first."
3. "Mark has the addition of μὴ ἀποστερήσῃς, representing probably the tenth commandment."

### John Calvin:
1. "Let us know, therefore, that Christ selected those commandments in which is contained a proof of true righteousness; but by a synecdoche he takes a part for the whole."
2. "But, intoxicated with foolish confidence, he fearlessly boasts that he has discharged his duty properly from his childhood."
3. "I confess that we are nowhere commanded in the law to sell all; but as the design of the law is, to bring men to self-denial, and as it expressly condemns covetousness, we see that Christ had no other object in view than to correct the false conviction of the young man."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Which? That is, of what kind."
2. "Thou shalt not kill, etc. Those commandments involving duties toward our fellow men are cited, so as to meet the young man on his own ground."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ takes no notice of the ceremonial law, nor of the traditions of the elders, only moral precepts."
2. "He chose to instance in these [commandments], partly to show, that if men are under obligation to regard these, much more such as concern God more immediately."
3. "If men are deficient in their duty to one another, they are much more so in their worship of God; and consequently, eternal life is never to be got and enjoyed by the performance of these things."
