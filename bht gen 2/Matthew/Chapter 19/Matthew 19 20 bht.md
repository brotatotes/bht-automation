# Matthew 19:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This young man, though externally moral, self-righteous, and rich, was still seeking something that he felt he lacked. He earnestly believed that by keeping all of God's commandments, he would attain peace of conscience. However, he failed to understand the qualitative nature of goodness and the spirituality of the law. His question to Jesus revealed a combination of proud complacency and despair. Despite his noble and open demeanor, he still had much to learn and comprehend.

### John Gill:
1. "For though he was so very rich and in such an exalted station in life, as to be a ruler, it seems he was but a young man; and to be so early serious and religious, amidst so much riches and grandeur, though it was but externally, was both remarkable and commendable."
2. "As soon as he was capable of learning, his parents taught him these precepts; and ever since he had the use of his reason, and understood the letter, and outward meaning of them, he had been careful to observe them."
3. "In what am I deficient hitherto? in what have I come short of doing these things? what remains at last to be performed? what other precepts are to be obeyed? if there are any other commands, I am ready to observe them, which may be thought necessary to obtain eternal life."

### John Wesley:
1. "The young man saith, All these have I kept from my childhood — So he imagined; and perhaps he had, as to the letter; but not as to the spirit, which our Lord immediately shows."
