# Matthew 19:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus' interaction with the young man underscores the need for a proper motive in our obedience to God. The young man's love for his possessions hindered his ability to fully obey and follow Jesus. The Gospel is presented in a legal form to address the young man's conscience, highlighting that true treasure in heaven is not obtained solely through voluntary poverty. The call to sell all may not be applicable to everyone, as each person's hindrance to obedience can differ. Ultimately, the young man's unwillingness to pay the high price demonstrated his rejection of salvation.
