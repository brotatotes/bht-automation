# Matthew 19:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The man in the story went away feeling not godly sorrow, but the sorrow of the world, as he believed that Jesus had asked too much of him. He was ashamed and disappointed in himself for not being able to live up to the perfect standard he had believed he had achieved, leading him to despair of obtaining eternal life. Instead of letting go of his desire for worldly pleasures, he chose to turn away from Christ and abandon his pursuit of eternal happiness.
