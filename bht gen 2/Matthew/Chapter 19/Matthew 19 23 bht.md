# Matthew 19:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Entering into the kingdom of heaven is no easy task, especially for the rich. It is not the riches themselves that hinder their access, but rather their unwavering trust and confidence in material wealth. This deep reliance on riches becomes a stumbling block, a barrier that makes it arduous for them to enter into the Gospel dispensation and receive its truths. Rich men are prone to place their trust in wealth, as the young man in the story did, disregarding the warning from the apostle to avoid such reliance.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "Christ warns them, not only how dangerous and how deadly a plague avarice is, but also how great an obstacle is presented by riches."
2. "It is true indeed, that riches do not, in their own nature, hinder us from following God; but, in consequence of the depravity of the human mind, it is scarcely possible for those who have a great abundance to avoid being intoxicated by them."
3. "The comparison of the camel, which is soon after added, is intended to amplify the difficulty; for it means that the rich are so swelled with pride and presumption, that they cannot endure to be reduced to the straits through which God makes his people to pass."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A rich man shall enter hardly, i.e., 'with difficulty,' into the kingdom of heaven."
2. "Such trust is the natural result of possession, or of even the strong desire to possess."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  It is hard  (δυσκολως). With difficulty. Adverb from δυσκολος, hard to find food, fastidious, faultfinding, then difficult. 

### John Gill:
1. "A rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven: either into the Gospel dispensation, and receive the truths, and submit to the ordinances of it, or into the kingdom of glory hereafter."
2. "Nor is it riches themselves that make the entrance so difficult, and clog the way, either into grace or glory, but putting trust and confidence in them."
3. "Rich men in common are very apt to [put trust in riches], as this young man did, against which the apostle cautions."
