# Matthew 19:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The expression of a camel going through the eye of a needle signifies something rare, unusual, difficult, or even impossible. This proverb was used to denote difficulties or impossibilities, emphasizing the gravity of the situation. It highlights the greatest human impossibility, magnifying divine grace that can accomplish even that. The intention is to underscore the urgent need for the rich man to recognize his inability and rely on divine intervention to enter the strait gate for salvation. It serves as a powerful warning, urging the rich man to tremble and grasp the impossibility within his own strength.

2. "We have a case in ch. Matthew 23:24, of a camel being put for anything very large."
3. "The object here was to set forth the greatest human impossibility, and to magnify divine grace, which could accomplish even that."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "See on Mark 10:25; Luke 18:25. Compare the Jewish proverb, that a man did not even in his dreams see an elephant pass through the eye of a needle."
2. "The reason why the camel was substituted for the elephant was because the proverb was from the Babylonian Talmud, and in Babylon the elephant was common, while in Palestine it was unknown."
3. "The Koran has the same figure : 'The impious shall find the gates of heaven shut; nor shall he enter there till a camel shall pass through the eye of a needle.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Easier for a camel, etc. A strong declaration of impossibility... This has been weakened in two ways... The literal sense is not too strong, as both the context and abundant facts show."
2. "The camel was more familiar to the hearers of the Saviour than the elephant, and on account of the hump on its back, it was especially adapted to symbolize earthly wealth as a heavy load and serious impediment to entrance through the narrow gate of the kingdom of heaven."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus, of course, means by this comparison, whether an eastern proverb or not, to express the impossible." 
2. "The efforts to explain it away are jejune like a ship's cable, Œ∫Œ±ŒºŒπŒªŒøŒΩ or œÅŒ±œÜŒπœÇ as a narrow gorge or gate of entrance for camels which recognized stooping, etc. All these are hopeless, for Jesus pointedly calls the thing 'impossible' (verse Matthew 19:26)." 
3. "The Jews in the Babylonian Talmud did have a proverb that a man even in his dreams did not see an elephant pass through the eye of a needle (Vincent)."
