# Matthew 19:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples were astonished, recognizing that if even the rich struggle to enter the kingdom of God, then what hope is there for anyone? They had expected the Kingdom to be filled with the wealthy and powerful, but Jesus shattered their expectations, revealing that it is the poor, the lowly, and the outcasts who are more likely to find salvation. This challenges our own assumptions and reminds us that true faith and humility are not hindered by material possessions.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "τίς, not τίς πλούσιος, which would have been a far shallower and narrower enquiry, but a general question what man?" 
2. "Besides the usual reason given for this question, 'since all are striving to be rich,' we must remember that the disciples yet looked for a temporal Kingdom, and therefore would naturally be dismayed at hearing that it was so difficult for any rich man to enter it."

### John Calvin:
1. "The disciples are astonished, because it ought to awaken in us no little anxiety, that riches obstruct the entrance into the kingdom of God."
2. "Wherever we turn our eyes, a thousand obstacles will present themselves."
3. "Thus it will be of service to us to tremble at the threatenings of God: whenever he denounces anything that is gloomy or dreadful, provided that our minds are not discouraged, but rather aroused."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Since all may have some possessions, and naturally love to have more."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Were astonished  (εξεπλησσοντο). Imperfect descriptive of their blank amazement. They were literally "struck out." 

### John Gill:
1. "They were surprised at his first words; but when he confirmed them by the proverb of a camel's passing through the eye of a needle, they were, as Mark says, 'astonished out of measure'."
2. "They did not imagine there was any difficulty of rich men coming into the kingdom of the Messiah, which they took to be a worldly one, and would be filled with rich men."
3. "Their amazement increased, saying, as in Mark, 'among themselves', privately to one another, who then can be saved? meaning, not with a spiritual and everlasting salvation, but a temporal one."

### John Wesley:
1. "His disciples were amazed, saying, Who then can be saved? — If rich men, with all their advantages, cannot?"
2. "Who? A poor man; a peasant; a beggar: ten thousand of them, sooner than one that is rich."
