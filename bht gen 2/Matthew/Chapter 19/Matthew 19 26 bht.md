# Matthew 19:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, fully aware of their amazement and concern, looked upon his disciples with a compassionate and understanding gaze. In that moment, his very look spoke volumes about the gravity of the situation. For, he was not simply alluding to riches being a hindrance to salvation, but rather emphasizing the impossibility of it. Yet, in this statement, Jesus was not discouraging his disciples, but compelling them to recognize the need for God's intervention and grace. Only through the mighty power of God can a rich man find salvation, as it surpasses human capability and calls for divine intervention.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Probably to give force to and impress what was about to be said, especially as it was a saying reaching into the spiritual doctrines of the Gospel, which they could not yet apprehend."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ does not entirely free the minds of his disciples from all anxiety; for it is proper that they should perceive how difficult it is to ascend to heaven."
2. "Such is the reason why Christ does not extenuate the danger — though he perceives the terror which it excited in his disciples — but rather increases it; for though formerly he said only that it was difficult, he now affirms it to be impossible."
3. "By this reply of Christ is also refuted that widely embraced principle — which the Papists have borrowed from Jerome — 'Whoever shall say that it is impossible to keep the law, let him be accursed.' For Christ plainly declares, that it is not possible for men to keep the way of salvation, except so far as the grace of God assists them."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "O what a speaking look was there!"
3. "With men this is impossible - It is observable, he does not retract what he had said: no, nor soften it in the least degree, but rather strengthens it, by representing the salvation of a rich man as the utmost effort of Omnipotence."
