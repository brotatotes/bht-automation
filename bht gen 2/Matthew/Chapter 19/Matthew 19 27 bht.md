# Matthew 19:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples, acknowledging the sacrifices they made for Christ's sake, ask what their reward will be. Comparing themselves to the rich man, they left all they had to follow Jesus. Though their possessions may not have been as substantial as the young man's, they embraced Christ's teachings, devoted themselves to imitating him, and endured hardships. With humility, they inquire about the reward they will receive for their dedication.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The disciples, or rather Peter speaking for them, recur to the ἕξεις θησ . ἐν οὐρ . said to the young man, and enquire what their reward shall be, who have done all that was required of them."
2. "He does not ask respecting salvation, but some pre-eminent reward, as is manifest by the answer."
3. "The ‘all’ which the Apostles had left, was not in every case contemptible. The sons of Zebedee had hired servants (Mar 1:20), and Levi (Matthew?) could make a great feast in his house. But whatever it was, it was their all."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. We. Emphatic, in contrast with the young ruler.

### John Calvin:
1. "Peter tacitly compares himself and the other disciples to the rich man, whom the world had turned aside from Christ."
2. "But what were those all things? for, being mean and very poor men, they scarcely had a home to leave, and therefore this boasting might appear to be ridiculous."
3. "But though on that ground they might be excused, they err in this respect, that they demand a triumph to be given them before they have finished their warfare."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "The answer indicates a little self-righteous boasting in the question; the parable would oppose any remnant of a mercenary spirit lurking in it."
3. "Preeminence was probably anticipated by Peter, and is promised in the next verse."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  What then shall we have?  (τ αρα εστα ημιν?) A pathetic question of hopeless lack of comprehension. 

### John Gill:
1. "Though their worldly substance was not so large as the young man's, they had not such estates to sell, nor that to give to the poor, he had; yet all that they had they left for Christ's sake."
2. "They became the disciples and followers of Christ, embraced his doctrines, submitted to his commands, imitated him in the exercise of grace, and discharge of duty, denying themselves, and suffering many hardships on his account."
3. "Wherefore it is asked, what shall we have therefore? What reward for all this? What part in the Messiah's kingdom? or what treasure in heaven?"
