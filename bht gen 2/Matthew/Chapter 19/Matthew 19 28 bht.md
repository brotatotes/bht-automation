# Matthew 19:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the final renovation of all things, when the judgment begins, the disciples will find themselves seated on thrones. This promise of sitting on twelve thrones carries with it a sense of honor, dignity, and authority. Though the condition is not explicitly stated, it is implied that this promise is contingent upon their faith, profession, and submission to Christ. As the new dispensation takes place after Christ's resurrection, ascension, and the outpouring of the Spirit, the disciples' role in judging the twelve tribes of Israel becomes even more significant than their mere act of following him.
