# Matthew 19:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers from all walks of life and from every generation are included in this promise, not just the apostles. While the reward may not necessarily be material possessions, God promises a rich and abundant blessing to those who follow Him faithfully. Even in this present world, believers can experience the manifold blessings of God's provision and goodness. The true measure of the reward, however, lies in the eternal life and fellowship with God that awaits those who wholeheartedly serve and love Him.
