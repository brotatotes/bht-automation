# Matthew 19:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The question put forth to Jesus regarding divorce was not asked with genuine interest in learning or being instructed but rather as an attempt to expose him. The Pharisees were seeking to make Jesus contradict Moses, as there was a dispute among the theological schools on the interpretation of Deuteronomy 24:1. By asking this question, they aimed to provoke Jesus into giving an answer that would either go against the law of Moses or be seen as contrary to his teachings.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This was a question of dispute between the rival Rabbinical schools of Hillel and Shammai; the former asserting the right of arbitrary divorce, from Deuteronomy 24:1, the other denying it except in case of adultery."
2. "It was also, says De Wette, a delicate question in the place where our Lord now was, in the dominions of Herod Antipas."
3. "πᾶσαν αἰτ., as E. V., for every cause; i.e. is any charge which a man may choose to bring against his wife to justify him in divorcing her?"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Two rival schools were divided on this question." 
2. "A delicate one, as DE WETTE pertinently remarks."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Tempting him - This means, to get him, if possible, to express an opinion that should involve him in difficulty."
2. "Is it lawful ... - There was the more art in the captious question which they proposed, as at that time the people were very much divided on the subject."
3. "Whatever opinion, therefore, Christ expressed, they expected that he would involve himself in difficulty with one of their parties."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The temptation turned upon the dispute dividing the two great Rabbinical schools."
2. "The querists would be anxious to know which side Jesus espoused."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Lord knows how to turn, in a wonderful manner, to the advantage of his people all the contrivances of wicked men to overthrow sound doctrine."
2. "The Son of God, who knew how to take the wise in their own craftiness, (Job 5:13,) disappointed them, sternly opposing unlawful divorces, and at the same time showing that he brings forward nothing which is inconsistent with the Law."
3. "For he includes the whole question under two heads: that the order of creation ought to serve for a law, that the husband should maintain conjugal fidelity during the whole of life; and that divorces were permitted, not because they were lawful, but because Moses had to deal with a rebellious and intractable nation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Even in remote Perea, almost the only remaining field of labor, Christ’s opposers sought Him."
2. "The school of Hillel held that almost any charge on the part of a husband would justify divorce. They wished not only to entangle Him in their party disputes but also to place Him in opposition to the law of Moses."
3. "An affirmative answer would probably have called forth the charge of lax morality."

### John Gill:
1. "These came unto him, not for the sake of learning, or to be instructed by him; but as spies upon him, to observe what he said and did, and watch every opportunity to expose him."
2. "This question being now agitated in the schools, they artfully put to Christ; not for information, but with a view to reproach him in some way or other."
3. "Should he forbid putting away of wives, which Moses allowed, they would then traduce him as contrary to Moses, and his law, which could not fail of setting the people against him."

### John Wesley:
1. "The Pharisees came tempting him - Trying to make him contradict Moses."
2. "For every cause - That is, for any thing which he dislikes in her. This the scribes allowed."
