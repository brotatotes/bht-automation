# Matthew 19:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This passage contains a paradoxical message about the reversal of status and reward in the kingdom of heaven. It warns against the complacency of relying on worldly advantages and reminds us that those who are considered first in this world may actually receive the lowest reward in the world to come. Conversely, those who are last in earthly status may be granted priority and exalted in the kingdom of heaven. This serves as a caution against placing too much importance on external measures of success and encourages us to prioritize a relationship with God, which brings eternal rewards.
