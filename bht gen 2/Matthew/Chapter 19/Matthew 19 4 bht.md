# Matthew 19:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Have you not read that in the beginning, God made them male and female? Our Lord uses the words of Moses to refute the Pharisees, implying that they have misunderstood the Scripture. From the very beginning of creation, God established the institution of marriage as the union between one man and one woman, condemning both polygamy and divorce. This question from the Pharisees serves no purpose other than to challenge Jesus, for the answer is clear in the account of creation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 4. And he answered and said unto
	them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made
	them male and female—or better, perhaps, "He that made
	them made them from the beginning a male and a female."

### John Calvin:
1. "He would plainly overturn the pretended sacrifice of the Mass."
2. "Now Christ assumes as an admitted principle, that at the beginning God joined the male to the female, so that the two made an entire man; and therefore he who divorces his wife tears from him, as it were, the half of himself."
3. "And thus from the order of creation is proved the inviolable union of one husband with one wife."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "An implied rebuke for their misunderstanding of the Scripture teaching on this point."
2. "The creation of man is affirmed."
3. "The question of the Pharisees is answered by what God did, in the original creation of man, instituting the sexual relation, and marriage as an indissoluble union between one man and one woman."

### John Gill:
1. "God, who in the beginning of time, or of the creation, as Mark expresses it, made all things, the heavens, and the earth, and all that is therein, and particularly 'man', as the Vulgate Latin, and Munster's Hebrew Gospel supply it here, made the first parents of mankind, male and female."
2. "In this original constitution, no provision was made for divorce, or polygamy. Adam could not marry more wives than one, nor could he put away Eve for every cause, and marry another."
3. "Either the Pharisees had read this account, or they had not; if they had not, they were guilty of great negligence and sloth; if they did understand it, there was no need for this question, which therefore must be put with an evil design."

### John Wesley:
1. "Have ye not read — So instead of contradicting him, our Lord confutes them by the very words of Moses."
2. "He who made them, made them male and female from the beginning — At least from the beginning of the Mosaic creation. And where do we read of any other?"
3. "By making them one man and one woman, he condemned polygamy: by making them one flesh, he condemned divorce."
