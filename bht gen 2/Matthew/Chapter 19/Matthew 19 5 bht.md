# Matthew 19:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through the words spoken by Adam in Genesis 2:24, God reveals His intention for the institution of marriage. He establishes the closeness, unity, and bond between a husband and wife. These words not only highlight the unique and intimate relationship between a married couple but also emphasize the importance of leaving one's parents and cleaving to one's spouse. God's design for marriage, expressed through the words of Adam, shows that the husband and wife are meant to become one flesh, inseparable and united in the covenant of marriage.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The essential bond of marriage consists not in unity of spirit and soul, by which indeed the marriage state should ever be hallowed and sweetened, but without which it still exists in all its binding power: the wedded pair are ONE FLESH, i.e. ONE MAN within the limits of their united life in the flesh, for this world."
2. "Beyond this limit, the marriage is broken by the death of the flesh."
3. "And herein alone lies the justification of a second marriage, which in no way breaks off the unity of love in spirit with the former partner, now deceased."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Jesus here sends them back to the original constitution of man as one pair, a male and a female; to their marriage, as such, by divine appointment; and to the purpose of God, expressed by the sacred historian..."
2. "...that in all time one man and one woman should by marriage become one flesh—so to continue as long as both are in the flesh."
3. "This being God's constitution, let not man break it up by causeless divorces."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "When a comparison is made between the claims, the wife is preferred to the father and mother."
2. "This expression condemns polygamy not less than it condemns unrestrained liberty in divorcing wives."
3. "Let the husband and wife, therefore, live together in such a manner, that each shall cherish the other in the same manner as if they were the half of themselves."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "God says, Christ says, that the relationship between a man and his wife is closer, higher, and stronger, than even that between children and parents."
2. "Notice: it is the man who leaves his parents."
3. "The essential bond is the fact that the twain, by marriage, ‘became one flesh,’ one man within the limits of their united life in the flesh, for this world."

2. "And they twain shall be one flesh. This is the true sense, for neither more nor less can possibly be meant; and denotes that near conjunction, and strict union, between a man and his wife, the wife being a part of himself, and both as one flesh, and one body, and therefore not to be parted on every slight occasion."


### John Wesley:
1. And said — By the mouth of Adam, who uttered the words. Genesis 2:24.
