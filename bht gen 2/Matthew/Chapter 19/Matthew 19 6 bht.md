# Matthew 19:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible teaches that marriage is a sacred and inviolable bond that God Himself has created. It is not merely a union of two individuals, but a joining together by God that makes them one flesh. This divine institution should not be dissolved by any human, for it is a permanent union that should be honored and respected. It is important to remember that marriage is not a man-made institution that can be changed or altered according to personal desires, but rather an appointment of God that should be upheld in reverence.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Christ is contemplating, not the individuals, but the unity which God cemented."
2. "The aorist tense seems to refer to the original ordinance of God at the creation."

### John Calvin:
1. "By this sentence Christ restrains the caprice of husbands, that they may not, by divorcing their wives, burst asunder the sacred knot."
2. "But the object which Christ had directly in view was, that every man should sacredly observe the promise which he has given, and that those who are tempted, by wantonness or wicked dispositions, to divorce, may reflect thus with themselves: 'Who, art thou that allowest thyself to burst asunder what God hath joined?'"
3. "The Papists, contriving for us a church separated from Christ the Head, leave us an imperfect and mutilated body. In the Holy Supper, Christ joined the bread and the wine; but they have dared to withhold from all the people the use of the cup. To these diabolical corruptions we shall be at liberty to oppose these words, What God hath joined let not man separate."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "What therefore God joined together, etc. Our Lord’s conclusion. The sentence forms a proper part of every Christian marriage ceremony. It is Christ’s protection of this holy relation."
2. "It also implies a warning against hasty marriages, against ignorance and forgetfulness of the fact that it is God who forms the indissoluble tie."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The marriage relation God has made. 'The creation of sex, and the high doctrine as to the cohesion it produces between man and woman, laid down in Gen., interdict separation' (Bruce)."
2. "The word for 'joined together' means 'yoked together,' a common verb for marriage in ancient Greek."
3. "Bill (βιβλιον). A little βιβλος (see on Matthew 1:1), a scroll or document (papyrus or parchment). This was some protection to the divorced wife and a restriction on laxity."

### John Gill:
1. "They were two before marriage, but now no more so; not but that they remain two distinct persons, but one flesh."
2. "The bond of marriage being made by God himself, is so sacred and inviolable, as that it ought not to be dissolved by any man."
3. "Marriage is an institution and appointment of God, and therefore not to be changed and altered by man at his pleasure."
