# Matthew 19:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Moses allowed divorces, not because he approved of them, but because of the stubbornness of the people's hearts. The Pharisees tried to challenge Jesus by bringing up this aspect of the law, which they believed contradicted His teachings on the sanctity of marriage. However, Jesus pointed out that Moses merely permitted divorce due to the people's inability to fully embrace God's original intention for marriage. The reference to Deuteronomy 24:1, Mark 10:2, and Luke 16:18 highlight the passages where this permission is mentioned.
