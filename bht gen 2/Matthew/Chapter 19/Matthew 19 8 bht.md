# Matthew 19:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Mosaic regulations on divorce were a temporary compromise, not an endorsement. They arose from the people's hardness of heart and moral state. God's original intent for marriage has never changed. It was and still is meant to be a lifelong commitment. These concessions were made to prevent further harm and to protect the vulnerable. By understanding the context and purpose of these regulations, we can better appreciate the unchanging nature of God's design for marriage. It serves as a reminder that His standards remain firm, even in the face of temporary concessions.
