# Matthew 19:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, in his teachings, challenges the prevalent notion of divorce and reiterates the original intention of marriage as an indissoluble union. He revokes any former allowances made by the laws of Moses and establishes that divorce is only justified in cases of adultery. Jesus's words emphasize the seriousness of the marriage covenant and condemn remarriages that occur after divorce without the grounds of adultery. By doing so, he upholds the divine law of marriage and underscores the importance of faithfulness within the marital relationship.
