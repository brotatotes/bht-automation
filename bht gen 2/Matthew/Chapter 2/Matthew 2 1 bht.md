# Matthew 2:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The birth of Christ in Bethlehem of Judea fulfills prophecy and emphasizes Jesus as the Bread of Life. The wise men from the East offer homage, foreshadowing the Gentiles' acceptance of the new faith, while Herod and the Jews display hostility. The Magi, scholars in astrology and philosophy, sought to worship the newborn king. Tradition speaks of three wise men based on the three types of gifts mentioned, although the exact number is uncertain. It is important to approach interpretations cautiously, as some associate the Magi with negative connotations, contradicting their actual purpose of seeking to worship Jesus.

A high hand was in all these movements."
2. "As Herod is known to have died in the year of Rome 750, in the fourth year before the commencement of our Christian era, the birth of Christ must be dated four years before the date usually assigned to it, even if He was born within the year of Herod's death, as it is next to certain that He was."
