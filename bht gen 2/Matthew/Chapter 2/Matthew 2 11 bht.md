## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I would rather regard the omission here as indicating a simple matter of fact, and contributing to shew the truthfulness of the narrative: that Joseph happened not to be present at the time."
2. "The general idea is, that the Purification was previous to the visit of the magi. Being persuaded of the historic reality of these narratives of Matt. and Luke, we shall find no difficulty in also believing that, were we acquainted with all the events as they happened, their reconcilement would be an easy matter; whereas now the two independent accounts, from not being aware of, seem to exclude one another."
3. "the gifts were carried during their journey... χρυσὸν αὐτῷ γεννηθέντι βασιλείας σύμβολον προσεκόμισαν οἱ μάγοι."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Clearly this was no civil homage to a petty Jewish king,
	whom these star-guided strangers came so far, and inquired so
	eagerly, and rejoiced with such exceeding joy, to pay, but a lofty
	spiritual homage."
2. "Visits were seldom paid to sovereigns without a present...
	These,
	with the 'gold' which they presented, seem to show that the
	offerers were persons in affluent circumstances."
3. "But that the feelings of these devout
	givers are to be seen in the richness of their gifts, and that the
	gold, at least, would be highly serviceable to the parents of the
	blessed Babe in their unexpected journey to Egypt and stay there—that
	much at least admits of no dispute."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Fell down - This was the usual way of showing respect or homage among the Jews."
2. "They presented unto him gifts - These were presented to him as King of the Jews, because they supposed he was to be a distinguished prince and conqueror."
3. "The offerings here referred to were made because they were the most valuable which the country of the Magi or wise men produced. They were tokens of respect and homage which they paid to the new-born King of the Jews."

### John Calvin:
1. "But they are convinced that he is divinely appointed to be a King. This thought alone, deeply rooted in their minds, procures their reverence."
2. "Almost all the commentators indulge in speculations about those gifts, as denoting the kingdom, priesthood, and burial of Christ. I see no solid ground for such an opinion."
3. "Our duty is, to adore him in a spiritual manner: for the lawful and reasonable worship which he demands is, that we consecrate first ourselves, and then all that we have, to his service."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Offering to the Lord what we have; He knows how to put it to the very best use."
2. "The holy family were thus providentially supplied with means for the journey to Egypt, and for the purification of Mary."
3. "These heathen show how the sight of Christ not only leads earnest hearts to worship, but willing hands to give."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Opening their treasures (ανοιξαντες τους θησαυρους αυτων). Here 'treasures' means 'caskets' from the verb (τιθημ), receptacle for valuables."
2. "Then it means the things laid up in store, treasure in heaven (Matthew 6:20), in Christ (Colossians 2:3)."
3. "In their 'caskets' the Magi had gold, frankincense, and myrrh, all found at that time in Arabia, though gold was found in Babylon and elsewhere."

### John Gill:
1. "Upon the sight of the young child, they fell down on their knees or faces to the ground, agreeably to the custom of their country, and worshiped him as a king."
2. "When they had opened their treasures, that is, their purses, bags or boxes, in which they put those things they brought with them necessary for their journey, they presented, or offered to him gifts, gold, frankincense and myrrh."
3. "According to the Ethiopians, these wise men were three, whose names they give us; the name of him that offered the gold, was Annoson; he that offered the frankincense, was Allytar; and he that offered the myrrh, Kyssad."

### John Wesley:
1. "They presented to him gifts — It was customary to offer some present to any eminent person whom they visited."
2. "Gold, frankincense, and myrrh — Probably these were the best things their country afforded; and the presents ordinarily made to great persons."
3. "This was a most seasonable, providential assistance for a long and expensive journey into Egypt, a country where they were entirely strangers, and were to stay for a considerable time."
