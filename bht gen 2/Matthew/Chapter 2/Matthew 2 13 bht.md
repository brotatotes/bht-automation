# Matthew 2:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The command for Joseph to take the child and flee was immediate, emphasizing the urgency of the situation. Egypt served as a convenient refuge, being close to Judea and having a large Jewish population. Interestingly, Egypt had previously been a place of refuge for the Jewish people, and now it became a safe haven for the newborn King. It is remarkable how God can use different means to preserve His people, even leading them to unexpected places. Ultimately, the purpose of this flight was to protect Jesus until the appointed time for Him to fulfill His mission.

### John Gill:

2. "Hence it appears to be lawful to flee from danger, from tyrants and persecutors, when the providence of God opens a way for escape."
3.
