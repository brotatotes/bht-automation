# Matthew 2:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Joseph awoke from his dream, he immediately arose and took Mary and the child by night, displaying his prompt obedience to God's command. This swift departure concealed their exit, ensuring their safety. Joseph's actions were reflective of genuine faith, as he wasted no time in obeying God. The timing of the wise men's visit and Joseph's journey to Egypt suggests that the events did not occur within a fortnight of Jesus' birth. It is likely that Jesus went to Alexandria in Egypt, a place frequented by Jews, where they could find sustenance.
