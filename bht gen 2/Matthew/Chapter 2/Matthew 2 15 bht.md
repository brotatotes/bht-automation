## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This citation shews the almost universal application in the N.T. of the prophetic writings to the expected Messiah, as the general antitype of all the events of the typical dispensation."
2. "It seems to have been a received axiom of interpretation... that the subject of all allusions, the represented in all parables and dark sayings, was He who was to come, or the circumstances attendant on His advent and reign."
3. "ἵνα must not be explained away; it never denotes the event or mere result, but always the purpose."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The prophet is reminding his people how dear Israel was to God in the days of his youth; how Moses was bidden to say to Pharaoh, 'Thus saith the Lord, Israel is My son, My first-born; and I say unto thee, Let My son go, that he may serve Me; and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, even thy first-born.'" 
2. "Viewing the words in this light, even if our Evangelist had not applied them to the recall from Egypt of God's own beloved, Only-begotten Son, the application would have been irresistibly made by all who have learnt to pierce beneath the surface to the deeper relations which Christ bears to His people, and both to God."
3. "...who are accustomed to trace the analogy of God's treatment of each respectively."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Herod died of a most painful and loathsome disease in Jericho."
2. "It might be said to be fulfilled in his calling Jesus from Egypt, because the words in Hosea aptly expressed this also."
3. "Perhaps, also, the place in Hosea became a proverb, to express any great deliverance from danger; and thus it could be said to be fulfilled in Christ, as other proverbs are in cases to Which they are applicable."

### John Calvin:
1. "The words of the prophet ought to be thus interpreted: 'When Israel was yet a child, I brought him out of that wretched bondage in which he had been plunged. He was formerly like a dead man, and Egypt served him for a grave; but I drew him out of it as from the womb, and brought him into the light of life.'"
2. "And justly does the Lord speak in this manner; for that deliverance was a sort of birth of the nation. Then were openly produced letters of adoption, when, by the promulgation of the law, they became 'the Lord's portion,' 'a royal priesthood, and a holy nation;' when they were separated from the other nations, and when, in short, God 'set up his tabernacle' to dwell in the midst of them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It seems to have been a settled axiom of interpretation... that the subject of all allusions, the represented in all parables and dark sayings, was He who was to come, or the circumstances attendant on His advent or reign."
2. "God did not forsake the Gentile world, though it forsook Him. His providential care was as really present in the formation of that civilization which issued from Egypt, as in the occurrences which led Israel and Jesus thither."
3. "The place of sojourn is unknown, though tradition points to a village called Metariyeh, not far from the city of Heliopolis, and near the site of the temple erected in Egypt for the Jews under the priesthood of Onias."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Magi had been warned in a dream not to report to Herod and now Joseph was warned in a dream to take Mary and the child along." 
2. "Matthew quotes Hosea 11:1 to show that this was in fulfilment of God's purpose to call his Son out of Egypt." 
3. "There is a Jewish tradition in the Talmud that Jesus 'brought with him magic arts out of Egypt in an incision on his body.'"

### John Gill:
1. "Jesus was not above three or four months in Egypt."
2. "The meaning of which passage is, either in connection with the last clause of the foregoing chapter thus; 'in a morning shall the king of Israel be cut off', because Israel is a child, a rebellious and disobedient one, acting a very weak and wicked part; yet I have loved him, or do love him, and have called, or will call, my son out of Egypt."
3. "This is the natural and unconstrained sense of these words, which justifies the Evangelist in his citation and application of them to Christ's going to Egypt, and his return from thence."

### John Wesley:
1. "That it might be fulfilled — That is, whereby was fulfilled...Christ being in a far higher sense the Son of God than Israel, of whom the words were originally spoken."
