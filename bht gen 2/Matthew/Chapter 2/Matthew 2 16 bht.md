# Matthew 2:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Upon hearing that the children had been slain, Herod's anger was greatly kindled. He saw this as a mockery and a threat to his throne, causing him to descend into a fit of rage. In his wickedness, he sought to assert his power and eliminate any potential rivals. This act of cruelty was characteristic of his reign, as evidenced by his past atrocities. Herod's actions were not only a manifestation of his own malevolence but also a fulfillment of prophecy, underscoring the divine judgment that would befall him.
