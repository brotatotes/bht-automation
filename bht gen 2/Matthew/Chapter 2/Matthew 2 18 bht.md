# Matthew 2:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Rachel, the mother of Joseph and Benjamin, was buried near Bethlehem. In the wake of the tragic events in Bethlehem, she is symbolically portrayed as rising from her grave to mourn the loss of her children, first through captivity and now through a brutal death. The grieving mothers of Bethlehem wonder why their innocent babies suffer while Isaac, the symbol of deliverance, is spared. However, there is a glimmer of hope that these children, through the blessed Babe of Bethlehem, will find solace in the knowledge that their sacrifice was for a greater purpose, foreshadowing the arrival of salvation.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In Rama was there a voice heard - Rama was a small town in the tribe of Benjamin. Rachel was the mother of Benjamin, and was buried near to Bethlehem... Rama is commonly supposed to be the same as the Arimarthea of the New Testament the place where Joseph lived who begged the body of Jesus."
2. "The tomb of Rachel, which is supposed to mark the precise spot where Rachel was buried... marks the actual site of her grave."

### Philip Schaff:

### John Wesley:
1. "Rachel weeping for her children â€” The Benjamites, who inhabited Rama, sprung from her. She was buried near this place; and is here beautifully represented risen, as it were out of her grave, and bewailing her lost children."
2. "Because they are not â€” that is, are dead."
3. "The preservation of Jesus from this destruction, may be considered as a figure of God's care over his children in their greatest danger. God does not often, as he easily could, cut off their persecutors at a stroke. But he provides a hiding place for his people, and by methods not less effectual, though less pompous, preserves them from being swept away, even when the enemy comes in like a flood."
