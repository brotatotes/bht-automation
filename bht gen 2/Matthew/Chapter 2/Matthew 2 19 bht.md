# Matthew 2:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Herod thought he was safe from a rival, he was actually the one in danger. His kingdom was divided amongst his three sons after his death. The Lord always comes to the aid of His people at the right time. The training of Jesus involved the cross, as this was the means by which He would redeem His Church. Herod's fear benefited us, as it ensured our safety. The length of Jesus' stay in Egypt varies, but it is clear that God's providence and the ministry of angels played a role in preserving Him.
