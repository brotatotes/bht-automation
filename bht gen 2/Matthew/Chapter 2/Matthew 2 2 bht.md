# Matthew 2:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Magi's journey to find the newborn King of the Jews was prompted by their observation of a star in the east. This aligns with the prevailing expectation of a significant figure emerging in Judea. They sought to pay homage to him, not necessarily in a religious sense, but with the respect and honor due to a king. Their journey serves as a reminder for us to diligently seek Christ and not remain indifferent to His presence. Even imperfect efforts in pursuing God's truth can be blessed by Him, as exemplified by the Magi's actions.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This expression of the magi, we have seen his star, does not seem to point to any miraculous appearance, but to something observed in the course of their watching the heavens."
2. "These circumstances would seem to form a remarkable coincidence with the history in our text. They are in no way inconsistent with the word ·ºÄœÉœÑŒ≠œÅŒ±, which cannot surely be pressed to its mere literal sense of one single star, but understood in its wider astrological meaning."
3. "To do homage to him, in the Eastern fashion of prostration. 'Necesse est enim, si in conspectum veneris, venerari te Regem, quod illi œÄœÅŒøœÉŒ∫œÖŒΩŒµ·øñŒΩ vocant.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Roman historians, SUETONIUS and TACITUS, bear witness to an expectation, prevalent in the East, that out of Judea should arise a sovereign of the world." 
2. "From all that is here said it is perhaps safest to regard it as simply a luminous meteor, which appeared under special laws and for a special purpose."
3. "Doubtless these simple strangers expected all Jerusalem to be full of its new-born King, and the time, place, and circumstances of His birth to be familiar to every one."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There was at that time a prevalent expectation that some remarkable personage was about to appear in Judea."
2. "The fact that such a person was expected is clearly attested."
3. "This does not mean that they had come to pay him religious homage, or to adore him. They regarded him as the King of the Jews, but there is no evidence that they supposed that he was divine."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The east [Œ±ŒΩŒ±œÑŒøŒªŒ∑] . Literally, the rising."
2. "Some commentators prefer to render at its rising, or when it rose."
3. "In Luke 1:78, the word is translated dayspring, or dawn."

### John Calvin:
1. "The notion of some commentators, that he is said to have been born King, by indirect contrast with one who has been made or created a king, appears to me too trifling."
2. "But if the sight of a star had so powerful an effect on the Magi, woe to our insensibility, who, now that Christ the King has been revealed to us, are so cold in our inquiries after him!"
3. "For their views, with regard to him, probably went no farther, than that his power and exalted rank would be so extraordinary as to impress all nations with just admiration and reverence."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A born King of the Jews is the hope of the Gentiles also, according to the promise now so widely fulfilled."
2. "God can use the imperfect researches of men, and blesses investigations which fail of obtaining the whole truth; otherwise modem science would be unblessed no less than astrology."
3. "Gentiles would hardly travel so far merely to render the homage usually accorded to earthly kings."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The words 'in the east' are probably to be taken with 'we saw' i.e. we were in the east when we saw it." 
2. "The Magi ask where is the one born king of the Jews. They claim that they had seen his star, either a miracle or a combination of bright stars or a comet."
3. "They came to worship the newly born king of the Jews."

### John Gill:
1. "The reason of their asking this question is, for we have seen his star in the east."
2. "Now this expectation of the appearing of such a star at the coming of the Messiah takes its rise from and is founded upon the above mentioned prophecy."
3. "The end proposed by them in taking such a journey is expressed, and are come to worship him; that is, either to pay adoration to him as God, of which they might be convinced by the extraordinary appearance of the star, or be assured of by divine revelation or rather to give him civil homage and respect, as an illustrious person, as being king of the Jews."

### John Wesley:
1. To do him homage ‚Äî To pay him that honour, by bowing to the earth before him, which the eastern nations used to pay to their monarchs.
