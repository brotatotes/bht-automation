# Matthew 2:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Joseph faithfully followed the command given by the angel and took the child and his mother to the land of Israel, without being directed to any specific place. The mention of those who sought the young child's life refers to Herod, the one who had actively pursued Him. This plural form may be idiomatic or signify a general statement based on a particular fact, a common way of expression.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The plural here is not merely idiomatic, nor, as Wordsw., 'for lenity and forbearance, in speaking of the dead;'" 
2. "perhaps a citation from Exodus 4:19, where the same words are spoken to Moses ('ζητεῖν τὴν ψυχήν' ═ 'בִּקֵּשׁ נֶפֶשׁ')"
3. "or, as Meyer, betokening, not the number, but the category."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "he was afterward expressly warned not to settle there, nor to Galilee, for he only went thither when he found it unsafe to settle in Judea but to 'the land of Israel,' in its most general sense; meaning the Holy Land at large"
2. "Joseph and the Virgin had, like Abraham, to 'go out, not knowing whither they went,' till they should receive further direction."
3. "the command is given to Moses to return to Egypt for the same reason that the greater than Moses was now ordered to be brought back from it—the death of him who sought his life."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They are dead who sought ... - This either refers to Herod alone, as is not uncommon, using the plural number for the singular;"
2. "or it may refer to Herod and his son Antipater."
3. "He was of the same cruel disposition as his father, and was put to death by his father about five days before his own death."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For they are dead (τεθνηκασιν). Only Herod had sought to kill the young child, but it is a general statement of a particular fact as is common with people who say: 'They say.'"


### John Gill:
1. "Joseph strictly observed and obeyed the divine command of the angel."
2. "He does not bid him go to Bethlehem or Nazareth, or any particular place, but the land of Israel, where he might go even into any part of it, without fear."
3. "They are dead which sought the young child's life."
