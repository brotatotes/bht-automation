# Matthew 2:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Fearing the cruel and tyrannical nature of Archelaus, Joseph, warned in a dream, hesitated to go to Judea where he ruled. Instead, he was directed by God to go to Galilee, a place of safety. Galilee, under the comparatively mild rule of Herod Antipas, provided a refuge for Joseph and his family. These two narratives, though distinct, complement each other and do not contradict one another.
