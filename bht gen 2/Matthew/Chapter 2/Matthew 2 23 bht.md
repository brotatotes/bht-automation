# Matthew 2:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Matthew's narrative serves to show how Jesus fulfilled the prophecies of the Messiah. By dwelling in the despised and lowly town of Nazareth, Jesus embodied the humility and rejection that was prophesied about the Messiah. The name Nazarene also connects Jesus to the shoot or twig, symbolizing his humble beginnings as the branch that would grow from the roots of Jesse. Jesus willingly embraced the identity of a Nazarene, fulfilling the prophecies regarding the despised and rejected nature of the Messiah.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "These words refer to the divine purpose in the event, not to that of Joseph in bringing it about."
2. "But surely this part of the Messiahâ€™s prophetic character is not general or prominent enough, in the absence of any direct verbal connexion with the word in our text, to found such an interpretation on."
3. "I leave it, therefore, as an unsolved difficulty."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Did we know exactly the sources from which the matter of each of the Gospels was drawn up, or the mode in which these were used, this apparent discrepancy would probably disappear at once."
2. "The best explanation of the origin of this name appears to be that which traces it to the word netzer in Luke 2:39-: â€”the small twig, sprout, or sucker, which the prophet there says, 'shall come forth from the stem (or rather, 'stump') of Jesse, the branch which should fructify from his roots.'"
3. "Thus, in the providential arrangement by which our Lord was brought up at the insignificant and opprobrious town called Nazareth, there was involved, first, a local humiliation; next, an allusion to Isaiah's prediction of His lowly, twig-like upspringing from the branchless, dried-up stump of Jesse; and yet further, a standing memorial of that humiliation which 'the prophets' had attached to the Messiah."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Lord Jesus, in fact, resided there until he entered on the work of his ministry until he was about 30 years of age."
2. "The character of the people of Nazareth was such that they were proverbially despised and contemned... To come from Nazareth, therefore, or to be a Nazarene, was the same as to be despised, or to be esteemed of low birth; to be a root out of dry ground, having no form or comeliness. This was what had been predicted by all the prophets."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Note the plural, as indicating not any one prediction in particular, but a summary of the import of several prophetic statements."
2. "The name is prophetically given to the Messiah (Isaiah 11:1)."
3. "As David sprang from the humble family of Jesse, so the Messiah, the second David, shall arise out of great humiliation."

### John Calvin:
1. "The word × ×–×™×¨, or Nazarite, signifies holy and devoted to God, and is derived from × ×–×¨, to separate...what was then shadowed out in the Nazarites, who were, in some sense, selected as the first-fruits to God, must have been fulfilled in the person of Christ."
2. "But Samson is called the 'Redeemer' or 'Deliverer' of the people, only because he was a figure of Christ...All that Scripture predicts, in a favorable manner, about Samson, may justly be applied to Christ."
3. "Joseph...is called a Nazarite of his brethren...God determined that the distinguished honor, of which he had given a specimen in Joseph, should shine again in Samson, and gave him the name of Nazarite, that believers...might look more earnestly at the Redeemer who was to come."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Matthewâ€™s narrative is not a biography, but brings up facts to prove the fulfilment of prophecy."
2. "The name Nazareth, seems to be an Aramaic form of a Hebrew word, meaning a shoot or twig, and applied by Isaiah (Isaiah 11:1) to the Messiah as a shoot from the prostrate trunk or stem of Jesse..."
3. "The various allusions to the despised and humble appearance of the Messiah are, so to speak, concentrated in that of Nezer."

1. "No single prophecy exists which says that the Messiah was to be called a Nazarene."
2. "The lowly Nazarene he was at first, but it is our glory to be the followers of the Nazarene."

### John Gill:
1. "This affair of going into Galilee, and settling at Nazareth, was brought about with this view, to accomplish what had been foretold by the prophets..." 
2. "...and designs the prophet Isaiah, and respects that prophecy of his in Isaiah 11:1 'and there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and × ×¦×¨, "a branch shall grow out of his roots"; a prophecy owned by the Jews themselves to belong to the Messiah, and which was now fulfilled in Jesus..."
3. "...so by dwelling at Nazareth, he would appear to be, and would be 'called a Nazarene, or Netzer, the branch'; being an inhabitant of Natzareth, or Netzer, so called from the multitude of plants and trees that grew there."

### John Wesley:
