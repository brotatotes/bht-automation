# Matthew 2:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Herod heard the news, he was greatly disturbed. This is understandable given his history of ruthless acts and fear of losing his throne. Not only was he troubled, but all of Jerusalem with him, as they too feared the consequences of such a revelation. The fulfillment of ancient prophecies added to Herod's alarm. The people's hearts melted like wax, as they were distressed and troubled by the prospect of the Messiah's arrival.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Ἡρώδῃ μὲν καταπαύσεως ἀρχῆς ὑπὸ Θεοῦ ἐψηφισμένης αὐτῷ τε καὶ γένει τῷ ἀπʼ αὐτοῦ." (Josephus, Antt. xvii. 2. 4) - Herod, as a foreigner and usurper, feared one who was born King of the Jews.
2. "There may also be a trace of the popular notion that the times of the Messiah would be ushered in by great tribulations." - The people, worn away by seditions and slaughters, feared fresh tumults and wars.
3. "πᾶσα Ἱεροσόλυμα" - Here and apparently at ch. Matthew 3:5, used as a feminine singular. Joseph. Bell. Jude 1:6.10.1, uses ἑάλω Ἱεροσ... ἁλοῦσα ..., but none of these instances are decisive: an ellipsis of ἡ πόλις being possible.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled—viewing this as a danger to his own throne: perhaps his guilty conscience also suggested other grounds of fear."
2. "and all Jerusalem with him—from a dread of revolutionary commotions, and perhaps also of Herod's rage."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He was troubled - Herod had obtained the kingdom by great crimes, and by shedding much blood. He was therefore easily alarmed by any remarkable appearances."
2. "...the fact that this star appeared, and that it was regarded as proof that a King of the Jews was born, alarmed him."
3. "There were many in Jerusalem to whom the coming of the Messiah would be a matter of joy; but all of Herod’s friends would doubtless be alarmed at his coming."

### John Calvin:
1. "But though, in the intoxication of prosperity, he was formerly accustomed to view the prophecies with scorn, the recollection of them now aroused him to sudden alarm." 
2. "For he would not have been so strongly moved by the simple tale of the Magi, if he had not remembered the predictions, which he had formerly looked upon as harmless, and of no importance."
3. "This shows how little they had profited under God’s chastisements: for they were so benumbed and stupified, that the promised redemption and salvation almost stank in their nostrils."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The reigning king was troubled, fearing for his throne, as might be expected from his jealous disposition."
2. "Many may have dreaded the Advent of the Messiah, either from stings of conscience or from dread of the troublous times which were expected to attend his coming."
3. "If the tyrant tremble, all his surroundings tremble with him. Unbelievers, in times of danger, are often the most superstitious. Those who do not believe in God, believe in ghosts or idols."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him" - Those familiar with the story of Herod the Great in Josephus can well understand the meaning of these words.
2. "Herod in his rage over his family rivalries and jealousies put to death the two sons of Mariamne (Aristobulus and Alexander), Mariamne herself, and Antipater, another son and once his heir, besides the brother and mother of Mariamne (Aristobulus, Alexandra) and her grandfather John Hyrcanus."
3. "He had made will after will and was now in a fatal illness and fury over the question of the Magi."
