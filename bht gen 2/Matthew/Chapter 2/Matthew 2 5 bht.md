# Matthew 2:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They confidently give the answer that is in accordance with popular Jewish belief, for it is a well-known notion that the Messiah would come from Bethlehem and be of the seed of David. This fact is supported by the prophetic declaration written by the prophet Micah, which they cite in their response. The use of the perfect passive indicative indicates that this prophecy has been written and remains on record. In Micah's prophecy, it is stated that the Messiah will shepherd his people, a correct understanding of the term compared to the earlier translation of shall rule.
