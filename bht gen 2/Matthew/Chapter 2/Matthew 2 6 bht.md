# Matthew 2:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Bethlehem, referred to as both Bethlehem Ephratah and Bethlehem in the land of Judah, is not the least among the princes of Judah. The apostles often paraphrased Scripture, focusing on conveying the general sense rather than an exact transcription. In this case, the words of Micah can be rendered as Art thou little? instead of Though thou be little, aligning the prophet's message with the evangelist's.
