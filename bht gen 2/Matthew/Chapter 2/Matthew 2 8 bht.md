# Matthew 2:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is intriguing that neither the Jews nor Herod himself accompanied the wise men to Bethlehem, which was a mere five or six miles from Jerusalem. The birth of a person of such importance should have garnered more attention. However, it is probable that God's providence ensured the safety of Jesus by orchestrating these events. Herod's cunning and deceitful nature led him to make hypocritical statements in an attempt to conceal his murderous intentions. Perhaps he doubted the truth of the wise men's claim, as a more suspicious ruler would have taken immediate action.
