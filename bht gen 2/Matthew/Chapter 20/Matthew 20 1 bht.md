# Matthew 20:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Gospel dispensation, represented by a householder, reflects the times of the Messiah. The laborers in the parable can refer to ministers of the Gospel or all Christians who strive in grace and duty. Their hiring by the householder, Christ, signifies His grace that makes them willing to serve and labor in His vineyard. It is not about merit or condition for salvation, but rather the influence of His grace in their lives.
