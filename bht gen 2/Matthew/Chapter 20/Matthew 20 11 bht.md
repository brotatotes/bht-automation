# Matthew 20:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The discontented ones in this passage grumbled and found fault with the householder, despite his generosity towards those who came later. Similarly, there were those who were uneasy about the inclusion of Gentiles in the privileges of the Gospel without adhering to the law. This grumbling can be compared to the complaints the Pharisees had against Jesus for associating with sinners. However, in the ultimate glory, there will be no grumbling as each person will be satisfied with their own happiness.
