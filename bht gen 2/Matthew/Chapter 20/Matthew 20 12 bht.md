# Matthew 20:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The workers' complaint about the fairness of their rewards arises from a misconception that salvation is earned through works. However, the householder's decision to treat the workers equally aligns with the message of God's impartiality in Acts 15:9. God does not differentiate between Jew and Gentile, but instead purifies all hearts through faith. It is important to recognize that salvation is not based on the duration or intensity of our labor, but on God's grace and His desire to bring all His children into the same glorious reward.
