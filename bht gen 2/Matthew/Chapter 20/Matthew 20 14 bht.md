# Matthew 20:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is the desire of the householder to bestow the same privileges on the last called as on the first called. This statement implies that the murmurers among the Jews should not trouble themselves any longer, as the householder has decided to grant the same outward blessings, in addition to special grace and eternal glory, to those who were called later. Furthermore, this act of generosity includes not only the Gentiles but also the newly converted publicans and sinners.
