# Matthew 20:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God has the right to bestow gifts and privileges as he pleases, whether it be the outward blessings of enjoying his word and ordinances or the eternal reward of heaven and glory. We must not complain or charge God with injustice, as he acts according to his sovereign will and never contrary to justice, truth, and goodness. We should not be envious of God's goodness, but rather rejoice in his graciousness towards all people, whether they be Jew or Gentile.
