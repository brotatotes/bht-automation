# Matthew 20:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The phrase So the last shall be first, and the first last is not just about the Jews and Gentiles, but applies to many other situations as well. In the context of the Gospel, it means that although many are called, only a few are chosen. This reminds us that it is not enough to simply hear the Gospel, but we must also obey it in order to be among the chosen ones.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The last were first, as equal to the first; first, in order of payment; first, as superior to the first (no others being brought into comparison), in that their reward was more in proportion to their work, and not marred by a murmuring spirit."
2. "The first were last in these same respects."
3. "The last words of the verse belong not so much to the parable, as to the first clause, and are placed to account for its being as there described; for, while multitudes are called into the vineyard, many, by murmuring and otherwise disgracing their calling, will nullify it, and so, although first by profession and standing, will not be of the number of the elect: although called, will not be chosen."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Take heed lest by indulging the spirit of these murmurers at the penny given to the last hired, ye miss your own penny, though first in the vineyard."
2. "Many receive the invitations of the Gospel whom God has never 'chosen to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth' (2 Thessalonians 2:13). But what, it may be asked, has this to do with the subject of our parable? Probably this—to teach us that men who have wrought in Christ's service all their days may, by the spirit which they manifest at the last, make it too evident that, as between God and their own souls, they never were chosen workmen at all."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Many that, in the order of time, are brought last into the kingdom, shall be first in the rewards."
2. "Higher proportionate rewards shall be given to them than to others."
3. "The parable teaches one truth, and but one; and where Jesus has explained it, we have no right to add to it, and say that it teaches anything else."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ only meant to say that every one who has been called before others ought to run with so much the greater alacrity, and, next, to exhort all men to be modest, not to give themselves the preference above others, but willingly to share with them a common prize."
2. "But that they might not be carried away by ambition or vain confidence in themselves, it was necessary also to remind them that others, who would long afterwards be called, would be partakers of the same glory."
3. "God is not limited to any person, but calls freely whomsoever He pleases, and bestows on those who are called whatever rewards He thinks fit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The parable, therefore, illustrates the truth that the order in the calling of individuals and nations will in many (not all) cases be reversed in their final position in heaven."
2. "[It is] an encouragement to those called late in life; a solemn warning to those called early, urging them to be humble, and ever mindful of their unworthiness before God."
3. "This is to be omitted, though found in many authorities. If genuine, it means, many are called to be heirs of salvation, yet few chosen to be preeminent. Free grace within the Church is thus indicated."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The last first and the first last." The adjectives change places as compared with Matthew 19:30. The point is the same, though this order suits the parable better. 
2. "After all one's work does not rest wholly on the amount of time spent on it."
3. "Even so hath Rabbi Bun bar Chija in twenty-eight years wrought more than many studious scholars in a hundred years."

### John Gill:
1. "So the last shall be first, and the first last,.... As he had asserted in Matthew 19:30 and which is clearly illustrated by this parable, as it may be applied to Jews or Gentiles, or to nominal and real Christians."
2. "but few among the Jews; as also in the Gentile world, comparatively speaking"
3. "but a few of those that are outwardly called, are inwardly and effectually called by the powerful grace of God, out of darkness into marvellous light, into the grace and liberty of the Gospel, into communion with Christ, and to the obtaining his kingdom and glory, according to the eternal purpose of God."

### John Wesley:
1. "So the last shall be first, and the first last — Not only with regard to the Jews and Gentiles, but in a thousand other instances."
2. "For many are called — All who hear the Gospel; but few chosen - Only those who obey it." (Matthew 19:30; 22:14.)
