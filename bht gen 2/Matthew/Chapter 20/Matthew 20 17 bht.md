# Matthew 20:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus was aware that his death was imminent, and he was prepared to sacrifice himself. The disciples, however, were filled with fear and apprehension. Their reverence for Jesus led them to suppress their own feelings and remain committed to him. The ignominy of the cross served as a powerful reminder of the fulfillment of prophetic promises. In their isolation, Jesus shared with his disciples the weight of his struggle and the significance of their journey to Jerusalem. This final journey held great importance and would serve to strengthen their faith in Jesus as the true Messiah.
