As Jesus and his disciples prepared to go up to Jerusalem for the last time, he forewarned them of the extraordinary events that would take place there.

It was the chief priests and Scribes, his most vehement adversaries, who would betray him, as they had already plotted to put him to death. This final journey to Jerusalem would mark the culmination of the prophetic words surrounding Jesus' life and mission.
