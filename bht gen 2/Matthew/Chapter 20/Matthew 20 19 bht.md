# Matthew 20:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The crucifixion, a cruel and shameful death reserved for slaves and the worst of criminals, was carried out by mocking Jesus as the King of the Jews. He was dressed in a scarlet robe, crowned with thorns, and hailed with sarcasm. Despite Jesus clearly stating that he would rise again on the third day, his disciples failed to grasp the meaning, demonstrating their lack of understanding and awareness of his divinity and Messiahship.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  And to crucify  (κα σταυρωσα). The very word now. The details fall on deaf ears, even the point of the resurrection on the third day. 

### John Gill:
1. "To mock him, as they did, by putting on him a scarlet robe, platting a crown of thorns, and placing it on his head, and a reed in his hand; and then bowed the knee to him, and cried, hail, king of the Jews!"
2. "And to crucify him: which, as it was a cruel and shameful death, such as slaves and the worst of malefactors were put to, so it was a Roman one."
3. "And the third day he shall rise again: this he said for the comfort of his disciples; but now, though these things were so clearly and distinctly expressed by Christ, and which show his omniscience, and give proof both of his deity and Messiahship, yet Luke observes of the disciples, 'that they understood none of these things, and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken'."
