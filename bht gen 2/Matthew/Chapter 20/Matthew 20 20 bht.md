# Matthew 20:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This narrative is a reminder that even in our pursuit of Christ, we can easily be swayed by selfish ambitions. It is important to maintain purity and guard against desires of recognition and honor, which can corrupt our devotion to God. The request made by the disciples' mother, on behalf of her sons, stemmed from a misunderstanding and an inclination towards personal gain. This serves as a cautionary tale for us to remain steadfastly focused on the true purpose and meaning of following Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "This narrative contains a bright mirror of human vanity; for it shows that proper and holy zeal is often accompanied by ambition, or some other vice of the flesh, so that they who follow Christ have a different object in view from what they ought to have."
2. "Nor is it enough that, at the commencement, we sincerely apply our minds to Christ, if we do not stead-lastly maintain the same purity; for frequently, in the midst of the course, there spring up sinful affections by which we are led astray."
3. "More especially, when any plausible occasion presents itself, we ought to be on our guard, lest the desire of honors corrupt the feeling of piety."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The request was suggested by her sons (comp. Mark 10:35), James and John, who were called Boanerges (Mark 3:17) and had been with Jesus on the Mount of Transfiguration (chap. Matthew 17:1)."
2. "Worshipping him, i.e., saluting Him with reverence, as was usual in asking favor of a king."
3. "Asking somewhat. She asked a favor but did not at once tell what it was, probably because doubtful of the propriety of the request."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Perhaps their minds had been preoccupied with the words of Jesus about their sitting on twelve thrones, taking them in a literal sense."
2. "The 'something' put forward as a small matter was simply the choice of the two chief thrones promised by Jesus."

### John Gill:
1. "It is not certain that Zebedee was ever a follower of him; and therefore the woman is described by her relation to her children, and not her husband."
2. "She herself had been a constant follower of, and attendant on him."
3. "They all three came, as Matthew relates, and the mother is the mouth, and speaks for her sons; so that they may be said to make such a request by her, she representing them."

### John Wesley:
1. "Considering what he had been just speaking, was ever anything more unreasonable?"
2. "Perhaps Zebedee himself was dead, or was not a follower of Christ."
