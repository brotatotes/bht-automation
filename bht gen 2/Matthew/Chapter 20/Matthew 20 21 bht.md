# Matthew 20:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus' disciples lacked understanding of the true nature of His kingdom, for they anticipated an earthly reign. Their request to sit at His right and left hand in His kingdom was driven by their ambition and desire for honor. However, Jesus, aware of the corruption of their hearts and worldly views, used this opportunity to guide them towards a greater understanding. He gently led them to voice their desires, ultimately revealing that they were seeking positions of honor in an earthly kingdom. This incident highlights the disciples' initial lack of comprehension regarding the spiritual nature of Christ's kingdom.
