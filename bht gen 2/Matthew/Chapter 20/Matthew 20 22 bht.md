# Matthew 20:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In their request for positions of honor in the kingdom, James and John were ignorant of the true nature of Christ's spiritual kingdom, which does not seek glory and riches of this world. Christ reminds them that to be advanced in his kingdom requires undergoing suffering and sharing in his own cup and baptism, which refers to his sufferings and death. The disciples, blinded by their ambition, did not understand that true advancement in Christ's kingdom comes through enduring hardship and embracing the way of the cross.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The flesh ever seeks to be glorified, before it is crucified: exalted, before it is abased."
2. "The ‘cup’ is a frequent Scripture image for joy or sorrow...It here seems to signify more the inner and spiritual bitterness, resembling the agony of the Lord Himself, and the baptism, which is an important addition in Mark, more the outer accession of persecution and trial, through which we must pass to the Kingdom of God."
3. "Stier rightly observes that this answer of our Lord contains in it the kernel of the doctrine of the Sacraments in the Christian Church."

### John Calvin:
1. "Whoever is not satisfied with the free adoption of God, and desires to raise himself, such a person wanders beyond his limits, and, by unseasonably pressing himself forward beyond what was proper for him to do, is ungrateful to God."
2. "Can you drink the cup which I shall drink? To correct their ambition, and to withdraw them from this wicked desire, he holds out to them the cross, and all the annoyances which the children of God must endure."
3. "For as it is his right to lay on every one his own burden according to his pleasure, in the same manner as a householder distributes and allots the portions of the members of his family, so He is said to give them a cup to drink."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Ye know not what ye ask. Addressed to James and John, who had prompted their mother."
2. "The request could scarcely have been occasioned by jealousy of Peter."
3. "When John saw the crucified thieves on the right and left hand of his dying Lord, he knew what he had asked."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Ye know not what ye ask." How often that is true.
2. "Αιτεισθε is indirect middle voice, 'ask for yourselves,' 'a selfish request.'"
3. "Amazing proof of their ignorance and self-confidence. Ambition had blinded their eyes."

### John Gill:
1. "They were ignorant of the nature of Christ's kingdom, which is spiritual, and not of this world."
2. "They might promise themselves much pleasure and happiness in the enjoyment of [honors and riches], and yet, if indulged with them, might be disappointed, and find unexpected troubles and uneasiness."
3. "Christ suggests to these disciples [...] whether they could think of enduring anything of the like kind, for his sake, which was most likely to be in a short time, what they would be called unto, and not to honors, ease, and pleasure; and what they must be sure, more or less, to undergo, before they entered the everlasting kingdom of glory."

### John Wesley:
1. "Ye know not what is implied in being advanced in my kingdom, and necessarily prerequired thereto."
2. "All who share in my kingdom must first share in my sufferings."
