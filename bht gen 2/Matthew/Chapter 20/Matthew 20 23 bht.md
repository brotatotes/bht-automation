# Matthew 20:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ warns his disciples that they will face persecution and suffering, just as James, the first apostle to be martyred, and John, who experienced a life of trouble and persecution, did. Their deaths symbolize the baptism of suffering that believers may go through. It is important for believers to understand that eternal life and heavenly glory are not for everyone, but for those who endure in faith and love. We should not seek to force our way into the mysteries of God, but rather be prepared to endure persecution and patiently trust in his sovereign will.

2. "Is not mine, etc. Either, it is not a boon to be gained by solicitation; or, it is not in my power, but it will be assigned to those for whom it has been prepared, according ‘to the eternal predestination of eternal positions in the kingdom of God.’ Yet these two might occupy the position."

3. "Eternal life, or the heavenly glory, is a kingdom prepared by his Father, from the foundation of the world, and not for anybody, and every person, but for some only, according to his Father's sovereign will and pleasure."

### John Wesley:
