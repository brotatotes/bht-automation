# Matthew 20:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The dispute about the primacy among the disciples was fueled by the ambition of James and John to secure top positions in the kingdom of Christ. Our Lord used this opportunity to expose the prevalent disease of pride lurking within the hearts of all the disciples. Their discontentment and resentment were further exacerbated by the perception that James and John had leveraged their relationship with Jesus for personal gain. It is clear that ambition and power can easily lead to division and strife unless checked by the spirit of modesty and humility that comes from heaven.
