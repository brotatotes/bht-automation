# Matthew 20:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
But Jesus called them unto him, recognizing that they were all harboring ambitious desires. To dissuade such thoughts and prevent discord among them, he gathered them close and reminded them of the ways of the Gentile rulers. He pointed out that the leaders of the nations assert their authority and exercise control over their subjects. However, Jesus reassures his disciples that in his kingdom, the paradigm shifts. The values of his reign are opposite to that of worldly systems. The desire for power and domination will have no place in the community of his followers.
