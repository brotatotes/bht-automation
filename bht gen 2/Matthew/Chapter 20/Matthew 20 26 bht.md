# Matthew 20:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If you desire to serve faithfully, strive to serve others and submit to your brethren, for deep humility in loving service is the measure of Christian greatness. Real greatness is not found in worldly pomp or external superiority, but in being a servant to all. While official orders in the Church are not forbidden, true greatness transcends such positions. In the kingdom of Christ, greatness is achieved by faithfully ministering the word and ordinances, denying oneself worldly honor and glory, and serving others. Be a minister and servant to all, just as Jesus taught.
