# Matthew 20:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To become a chief among others, one must be a servant to all, as exemplified by Jesus in the Gospel of Mark. Paul, although free, humbled himself to be a servant to gain people for Christ, showcasing true leadership. The Jewish belief that serving others in this world leads to freedom in the world to come further supports this idea. Embracing the role of a servant not only demonstrates true leadership but also promises eternal rewards.

### John Gill:
1. "And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant; or, as in Mark, shall be servant of all: not only a minister, but a servant; not a servant of some only, but of all."
2. "This was verified in the Apostle Paul, who became a servant to all men, though he was free, that he might gain some to Christ; and by so doing was the chief, though he reckoned himself the least of the apostles, yea, less than the least of all saints."
3. "The Jews have a saying somewhat like this, that everyone that makes himself as a servant, for the words of the law in this world, shall be made free in the world to come."
