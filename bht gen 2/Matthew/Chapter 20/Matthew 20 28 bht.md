# Matthew 20:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus came to this world not to be served, but to serve. He did not seek to be waited on or attended to in a grand manner. Rather, he willingly took on human form in order to minister through teaching the Gospel and performing miracles. Ultimately, Jesus gave up his very life as a ransom to set many free. His life was invaluable and offered as a precious sacrifice for the salvation of humanity.
