# Matthew 20:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Jesus departed from Jericho, accompanied by his disciples, a great multitude followed him out of the city. This multitude may have been drawn by the desire to hear him, witness his miracles, or even to be healed by him. While there are slight variations in the accounts, the circumstances align so perfectly that it is evident they are not different narratives but rather complementary perspectives on this event.

3. "Mark and Luke mention him only, and say nothing about the other, who was a sort of inferior appendage."
