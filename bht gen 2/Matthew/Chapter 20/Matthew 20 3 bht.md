# Matthew 20:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's chosen people are inherently part of this world, living according to its ways. However, once they are called by God, they belong to a different realm, even as they remain physically present in this one. Just as Christ sought out and called individuals from the market place, so too does the Gospel continue to find and transform those who seem to be lost or forgotten. Christ sees those who are standing idle, waiting for employment, and He speaks of them with care and concern.
