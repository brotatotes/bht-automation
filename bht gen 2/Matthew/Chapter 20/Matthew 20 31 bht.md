# Matthew 20:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Sometimes, even those who are following God may unwittingly hinder others from approaching Him. They may become too concerned with propriety and tradition rather than opening the door for those who seek His mercy. Instead of being turned away or discouraged, those who truly desire to encounter Him should persist even more in their cries for help. By increasing their faith and expanding their longing for His compassion, they will become bolder and more resolute. It is through perseverance and relentless faith that they will overcome the obstacles and receive the sought-after cure.
