# Matthew 20:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The call to follow Christ is a testament to the divine grace and goodwill that reaches out to the world. It is not a response to any merit or worthiness in us, but an invitation purely born out of God's benevolence. The individuals called are often ordinary, unremarkable people, perceived as insignificant by societal standards. The reward they receive is not explicitly defined, emphasizing the need for faith and trust in the goodness of God, as they depend on His wisdom and provision.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Whatsoever is rightâ€”just, equitable, in proportion to their time."

### Albert Barnes:
1. Whatsoever is right - Whatsoever it shall appear you can earn. The contract with the first was definite; with this one it depended on the judgment of the employer.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The wages promised indefinite; the correct reading in Matthew 20:7 omits all promise of reward."
2. "The parable illustrates the truth that salvation is of grace."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Whatsoever is right  (Î¿ ÎµÎ±Î½ Î· Î´Î¹ÎºÎ±Î¹Î¿Î½). "Is fair" (Allen), not anything he pleased, but a just proportionate wage. Indefinite relative with subjunctive ÎµÎ±Î½=Î±Î½. 

### John Gill:
1. "Expressive of a call of divine grace out of the world, into the church; and which arises from mere grace, and good will, without any merit in, or motive from man."
2. "Moreover, the persons called were a parcel of idle, mean, vulgar people, as market folks commonly are; the weak, base, and foolish things of the world."
3. "It properly signifies what is meet and convenient, and will be satisfying; and since it is not expressed what he would give them, and they should receive, it calls for faith and dependence on divine goodness."
