# Matthew 20:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The workers were called to offer themselves at the proper time, but some of them were idle all day and only decided to offer themselves at the last minute, just one hour before the end of the working day. Even though they came late, there was still room for them to work. The eleventh hour represents a time that is very late, long after the rest were called, and it shows that there is still opportunity for those who come late to find a place to serve.
