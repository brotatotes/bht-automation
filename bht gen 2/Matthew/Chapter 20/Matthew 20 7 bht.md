# Matthew 20:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Matthew 20:7, we see that the eleventh hour laborers were the ones who had no opportunity earlier. This can be seen as a reflection of how the Gentiles were overlooked by God for a long time, walking in their own ways. However, when the Gospel was presented to them, they were called by grace and became partakers of the promises and privileges of the church. This shows that even those who were neglected and had no previous chance can still be accepted and receive what is right.

### Philip Schaff:
1. Matthew 20:7.  Because no man hired us. The eleventh hour laborers are accepted, but they were mainly those who had no opportunity at an earlier period.
	

### John Gill:
1. "This may be fitly applied to the Gentiles, who hundreds of years were neglected by God; he overlooked the times of their ignorance, took no notice of them in their state of stupidity, blindness, and irreligion; but suffered them to walk in their own ways..."
2. "The Gospel was made the power of God unto salvation to them; they were called by grace, became of the same body the church, were fellow heirs with the believing Jews, partakers of the same promises and privileges..."
3. "They say unto him, because no man hath hired us...he saith unto them, go ye also into the vineyard...and whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive."
