# Matthew 20:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The wages of the hired servant were to be paid before night, indicating the importance of settling accounts in a timely manner. The overseer, like Christ, was entrusted with the task of distributing payment. The order of payment in the parable is deliberate, as it highlights the discontentment of those who expected more. The parable emphasizes that the rewards of eternal life are not based on merit, but rather freely given by God's grace. Ultimately, it points to the future fulfillment of Christ's words, where the first shall be last and the last shall be first.
