# Matthew 20:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers, whether Jews or Gentiles, are granted equal access to the privileges and blessings of the church. While individuals may receive varying measures of grace in this life, the rewards of heaven are not earned through works, but are a result of God's grace and the sacrifice of Christ. It is worth noting that different levels of punishment may exist in hell according to the sins committed, but there are no degrees of glory in heaven. The reward in heaven comes from God's justice and grace, rather than being based on our own works.
