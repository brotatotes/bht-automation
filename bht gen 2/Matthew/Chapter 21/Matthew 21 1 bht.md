# Matthew 21:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples made their way to Bethphage, meaning house of unripe young figs, a desolate area suitable for robbers. From there, Jesus sent two disciples, intending to give solemnity to the approaching scene and manifest Himself as King Messiah. This fulfilled the prophecy of Zechariah and aligned with God's earlier foretelling. Despite the potential unacceptability to the wicked, this move demonstrated that Jerusalem was near, signaling the time for Jesus to openly commence His reign. Bethphage's significance was in its location on the eastern slope of Olivet, playing a role in the unfolding of His divine plan.
