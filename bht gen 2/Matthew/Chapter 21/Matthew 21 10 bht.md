# Matthew 21:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the city was stirred with great excitement. The metropolis, being the seat of the ancient kings of Judah and of his father David, witnessed His public entrance like the judges and kings of Israel. The whole city, just like Bethlehem when Naomi with Ruth returned, was moved. Though Jesus had preached and performed miracles among them, they did not recognize Him in such grandeur, perplexed by His identity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "There was great excitement. The sight of such a multitude, the shouts of the people, and the triumphant procession through the city, excited much attention and inquiry."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Was moved [εσεισθη] . Moved is hardly strong enough. It is shaken as by an earthquake. Rev., stirred. As Morison happily observes, "a profounder ground - swell of feeling."

### John Calvin:
1. "Under this despicable aspect of the flesh the majesty of the Spirit was apparent."
2. "The substance of it therefore is, that Christ’s entrance was not made in a private manner, and that his enemies abstained from opposing it, not because they treated him with contempt, but rather because they were restrained by secret fear."
3. "At the same time, the Evangelist glances at the careless indifference of the city, and commends the piety of those who have just reached it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The question indicates a discussion of His character rather than ignorance of His person."
2. "The effect on the Pharisees is mentioned in Luke 19:39-40; John 12:19."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Was stirred  (εσεισθη). Shaken as by an earthquake. "Even Jerusalem frozen with religious formalism and socially undemonstrative, was stirred with popular enthusiasm as by a mighty wind or by an earthquake" (Bruce). 

### John Gill:
1. "And when he was come into Jerusalem..... The metropolis of the nation, the seat of the ancient kings of Judah, and of his father David, entering into it in this very public manner; as he never did before; riding in the manner the ancient judges and kings of Israel did, attended with a numerous retinue, shouting as they went along, and singing their 'Hosannas' to him." 
2. "All the city was moved; as Bethlehem was, when Naomi with Ruth returned thither; and of which the same phrase is used, as here, Ruth 1:19."
3. "They knew him not; for though he had preached unto them, and wrought miracles among them, yet they had never seen him in any such pomp and state; and could not devise who he should be, that entered their city in such a manner."
