# Matthew 21:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Galileans, familiar with Jesus as a well-known prophet, may have proudly spoken of him. However, when others questioned his identity, their enthusiasm may have wavered. The Galileans had a deeper understanding of Christ compared to the religious leaders of Jerusalem. Some may have referred to Jesus as this Jesus, the prophet, as he was anticipated by the Jews and mentioned by Moses in Deuteronomy. Although he was commonly believed to be from Nazareth, those genuinely seeking the truth would not stumble at this, discovering instead that he was actually born in Bethlehem.
