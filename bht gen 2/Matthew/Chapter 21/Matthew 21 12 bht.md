# Matthew 21:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ once again displayed His righteous indignation by casting out those who were selling and buying in the temple. This was not the first time He had taken such action, as three years prior He had warned against turning the house of God into a marketplace. In this instance, not only were goods being exchanged, but also foreign coins were being converted into the local currency, necessary for temple offerings. Christ's actions were a clear rebuke, reminding all that the sacredness of the temple should never be compromised for worldly gains.

2. "That zeal, indeed, by which Christ was animated to do this, ought to be held in common by all the godly; but lest any one, under the pretense of imitation, should rush forward without authority, we ought to see what our calling demands, and how far we may proceed according to the commandment of God."
