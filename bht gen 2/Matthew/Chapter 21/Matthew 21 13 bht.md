# Matthew 21:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The temple, meant as a house of prayer, was being profaned by turning it into a market. This act of greed and exploitation was reminiscent of a den of robbers, as prophesied in the scriptures. The temple was meant to be a place for the worship of God, but instead, it became a symbol of hypocrisy. Jesus, in his righteous anger, cleansed the temple and restored its intended purpose. This cleansing act carried a Messianic significance, emphasizing the importance of prayer and the inclusion of all nations in the worship of God.
