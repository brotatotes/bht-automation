## BHT:
In Matthew 21:14, Jesus curing the blind and lame in the temple signifies a significant shift in the purpose of the temple. Previously known as a house of prayer, Jesus transforms it into a house of mercy by showcasing God's power and proclaiming his own authority as the Messiah. These miraculous healings serve as evidence of Christ's divine power, enabling the blind to see and the lame to walk. Additionally, God's approval of Jesus' actions through his voice from heaven reaffirms the message preached by the multitude.
