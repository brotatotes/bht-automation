# Matthew 21:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The religious leaders were vehemently opposed to Jesus and his followers, going so far as to try to discredit him. They disapproved not only of the children who fervently praised Jesus, but also of their parents who allowed it. The fact that the children were declaring Jesus as the Messiah, the son of David, only fueled their resentment. The high priests and Scribes viewed this act of praise with great disdain, as they were threatened by Jesus' growing influence.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "Christ replied, that it was in vain for them to make opposition; because God would rather make the stones cry out than permit the reign of His Son to be forgotten." 
2. "But as the truth is wickedly suppressed by those who ought to have been its lawful witnesses, it is not wonderful if God raise up others, and — to their shame — make choice of children."
3. "Though wicked men leave no stone unturned for concealing the reign of Christ, we learn from this passage that their efforts are in vain. God will sooner give mouths and tongues to stones than allow the kingdom of His Son to be without witnesses."

3. "It was indeed no unusual thing for children to sing the 'Hosanna' at the feast of tabernacles... but that they should cry 'Hosanna' to Jesus, as David's son was very extraordinary, and what the high priests, and Scribes, took notice of with great resentment."
