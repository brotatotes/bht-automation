# Matthew 21:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
From the mouths of infants and young children, strength and praise flow, even though they are seen as insignificant and lacking understanding. Their words proclaim the power of God, who needs no other elaborate forms of worship to make known His might. By using the weak and feeble to declare His glory, God's strength is displayed in its fullest perfection.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. "While the songs and shouts are rising, the priests turn angrily to Christ with the question, 'Hearest thou what these are saying?'"
2. "Thou has provided the perfection of praise."
3. "The quotation from Psalms 8:2 follows the Septuagint, and not the Hebrew, which is, 'Thou hast founded strength.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "Literally the words run, Out of the mouth of infants and sucklings thou hast founded strength, by which David means that, though every tongue were silent, God needs no other orators to proclaim his power than mere infants, who are still hanging on their mothers’ breasts." 
2. "For he who considers with himself how the child is formed in the mother’s womb, is nourished there for nine months, afterwards comes into the world, and finds nourishment provided as soon as it is born, must not only acknowledge that God is the Creator of the world, but will be altogether carried away into admiration of Him."
3. "But since the praises of God are heard from the tongue of infants, Christ infers from this, that it is not strange if He cause them to be uttered by children who have already acquired the use of speech."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They seem to complain that children express a religious sentiment, and contemptuously hint that only children call Him Messiah. Bigotry can always find some trifle on which to ground its objections."
 2. "A pointed rebuke, for He quotes from the Book it was their business to read."
 3. "The praise of the Messiah is the praise of God. The praise of children is a praise which God Himself has prepared for Himself, the miraculous energy of His Spirit."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Hearest thou (ακουεις). In a rage at the desecration of the temple by the shouts of the boys they try to shame Jesus, as responsible for it."
2. "Thou hast perfected (κατηρτισω). The quotation is from Psalms 8:3 (LXX text)."
3. "Here it is the timeless aorist middle indicative with the perfective use of κατα-. It was a stinging rebuke."

### John Gill:
1. "From such poor, little, silly creatures, so void of knowledge and understanding..."
2. "...strength and praise expressed with a strong voice, or in a very vehement manner, as it was by these babes and sucklings..."
3. "His strength was made perfect in their weakness, and his praise the more glorious."

### John Wesley:
1.  Psalm 8:2.
