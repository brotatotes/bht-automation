# Matthew 21:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, after entering Jerusalem and surveying the temple, departed for Bethany with his disciples as evening approached. This journey to Bethany served as a contrast to the faithlessness and disobedience exhibited by the city of Jerusalem. Bethany, meaning house of depression or misery, provided solace and comfort to Jesus during the crucial week ahead. This faithful and obedient village was fitting for the One who would soon endure suffering for the sins of humanity. Moreover, Bethany's abundance of fig trees attested to its fruitful nature. Thus, Jesus sought refuge in this place of respite before the impending crisis.
