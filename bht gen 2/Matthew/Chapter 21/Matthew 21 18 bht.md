# Matthew 21:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ rose early from Bethany to Jerusalem, hungered along the way. This hunger served to overcome his physical needs and demonstrate his desire to promote the glory of the Father. It also presented an opportunity for Jesus to perform a miracle and teach his disciples. Furthermore, his hunger symbolized his longings for better fruit from his chosen people, while exposing the emptiness and folly of hypocritical ostentation. Thus, rising early, Jesus felt the human want and showed forth his divine power simultaneously, all while highlighting the similarity of his human nature to ours.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "Certainly it was not the fury of passion that led him to curse the tree, but as hunger was troublesome to him according to the feeling of the flesh, he determined to overcome it by an opposite affection; that is, by a desire to promote the glory of the Father."
2. "I am the more inclined to this conjecture, because hunger gave him an opportunity of performing a miracle and of teaching his disciples."
3. "He intended, however, to present in this tree an outward sign of the end which awaits hypocrites, and at the same time to expose the emptiness and folly of their ostentation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To give point to the incident, Matthew, unites the two morning walks from Bethany (on Monday and Tuesday)."
2. "An actual physical want; it may have been occasioned by His leaving Bethany very early in His zeal to purify the temple where He had seen the abuses as He looked about on the previous evening."
3. "Human want and Divine power are exhibited simultaneously. On Sunday He entered Jerusalem amid hosannas, on Monday in hunger. This hunger may symbolize His longings for some better fruit from His chosen people."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  He hungered  (επεινασεν). Ingressive aorist indicative, became hungry, felt hungry (Moffatt). Possibly Jesus spent the night out of doors and so had no breakfast. 

### John Gill:
1. "So early did Christ rise, and return from Bethany to Jerusalem."
2. "Thus Christ, day after day, went to and from Jerusalem: in the evening he went to Bethany, or to some part of the Mount of Olives, and there abode all night, and returned in the daytime to Jerusalem, and taught in the temple."
3. "He hungered, rising so early before his friends were up, he had eaten nothing that morning, and so before he had got far from Bethany, found himself hungry; which proves the truth of his human nature, which was in all respects like to ours, excepting sin."
