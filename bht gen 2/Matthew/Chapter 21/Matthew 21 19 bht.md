# Matthew 21:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The solitary fig tree, with its leaves but no fruit, becomes a symbol of barrenness and hypocrisy. The curse placed on the tree condemns it to perpetual fruitlessness, highlighting the severity of its judgment. The withering of the tree serves as a vivid demonstration of the consequences of falsehood and the need for Christ for true fruitfulness. Its lack of fruit was not due to the season, but rather a manifestation of its inherent barrenness. The imagery of the fig tree reminds us to seek true holiness and genuineness in our faith, rather than being content with mere appearances.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "A solitary fig-tree."
2. "By the road-side: so Herod. vii. 6, αἱ ἐπὶ Λήμνου ἐπικείμεναι νῆσοι: Demosth. p. 300. 16, ἡ ἐπὶ τοῦ ποταμοῦ μάχη."
3. "It was the practice to plant fig-trees by the road-side, because it was thought that the dust, by absorbing the exuding sap, was conducive to the production of the fruit. Plin. [158]. [159]. xv. 19."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Presently, in popular speech, has acquired something of a future force."
2. "I will do such a thing presently means, I will do it, not immediately, but soon."
3. "The rendering here was correct in the older English sense of instantly."

### John Calvin:
1. "Let us learn from this what is the meaning of the word curse, namely, that the tree should be condemned to barrenness..."
2. "God blesses, when by his voice he bestows fertility."
3. "It appears more clearly from Mark, that the fig-tree did not instantly wither, or, at least, that it was not observed by his disciples, until they saw it next day stripped of leaves."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The tree bears two crops, an early ripe fig which is crude and without flavor and valueless, and a later fig which is full of sweetness and flavor, and highly esteemed. All trees bear the first, only good ones have the second."
2. "The solitary tree was a figure of Israel set by itself; the leaves represented the hypocritical pretensions to sanctity, the barrenness the lack of real holiness. Applicable to false professors in every age."
