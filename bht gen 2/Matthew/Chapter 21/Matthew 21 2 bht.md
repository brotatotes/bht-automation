# Matthew 21:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Jesus entered the village across from Jerusalem, it is likely that this village was Bethany, which was within sight of Jerusalem. Christ instructed his disciples to bring both the mother ass and the young colt. They brought both animals, and Jesus rode on them. This can be seen allegorically, where the ass represents the Jews who carried the burdensome rituals of the law, and the colt represents the wild Gentiles. Jesus' arrival to both symbolizes his mission to first reach the Jews and then the Gentiles.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "To ride on a horse was sometimes an emblem of war; on a mule and an ass, the emblem of peace."
2. "Riding in this manner, then, denoted neither poverty nor degradation, but was the appropriate way in which a king should ride, and in which, therefore, the King of Zion should enter into his capital, the city of Jerusalem."
3. "Mark and Luke say that he told them they should find 'a colt tied.' This they were directed to bring. They mention only the colt, because it was this on which he rode."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. A colt with her. The Lord does not separate the colt from its dam.

### John Calvin:
1. "But as kings are wont to ascend their chariots, from which they may be easily seen, so the Lord intended to turn the eyes of the people on himself, and to place some mark of approbation on the applauses of his followers, lest any might think that he unwillingly received the honor of a king."
2. "Christ sat first on the ass for this reason, that it was proper for him to begin with the Jews; and afterwards he passed over to the colt, because he was appointed to govern the Gentiles also in the second place."
3. "In this way he proved his Divinity; for both to know absent matters, and to bend the hearts of men to compliance, belonged to God alone."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The more literal fulfilment of the prophecy is thus shown."
2. "The unbroken animal would be quieter if the mother was with him."
3. "Loose them. This act was to be significant of Christ’s royal prerogative. Yet in His exercise of power the willingness of men concurs."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Into the village that is over against you (εις την κωμην την κατεναντ υμων). Another use of εις. If it means 'into' as translated, it could be Bethany right across the valley and this is probably the idea." 
2. "And a colt with her (κα πωλον μετ' αυτης). The young of any animal. Here to come with the mother and the more readily so."

### John Gill:
1. "And it is very likely this was the village; for Nob was very near to Jerusalem; it was over against it, within sight of it, and from thence might be taken a view of the whole city..."
2. "The other evangelists only make mention of the colt, or young ass; but, no doubt, both were spoken of by Christ, and both were found by the disciples, the ass, and the colt by her, and both were brought away by them; and on both of them, very probably, Christ rode..."
3. "The ancient allegorical sense of the ass and colt is not to be despised: that the ass may signify the Jews, who had been used to bear the burdensome rites and ceremonies of the law; and the colt, the wild and untamed Gentiles, and the coming of Christ, first to the one, and then to the other..."
