# Matthew 21:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the disciples passed by the fig tree the next day, they saw that it had withered away, just as Jesus had commanded. The immediate withering of the tree surprised them, as they had heard Jesus speak to the tree the day before, but hadn't noticed the effect of his words at the time. This miraculous event served as a powerful demonstration of Christ's authority and dominion over all creation, showcasing his divine power and control over both living and non-living things.
