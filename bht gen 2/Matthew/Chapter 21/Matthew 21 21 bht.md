# Matthew 21:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
True faith in God involves confidently expecting to receive from Him what we need, relying on His promises and goodness. Prayer is a true test of faith. The cursing of the fig tree serves as a symbolic warning against unfruitfulness in religion. Unwavering faith enables us to do greater things when the well-being of others, the spread of the Gospel, and the glory of God necessitate it. Miracles confirm and strengthen our faith, reminding us that a fruitful life is the evidence of genuine belief.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "To have faith in God means, to expect, and to be fully assured of obtaining, from God whatever we need."
2. "Christ shows that those only are believers who, relying on his goodness and promises, betake themselves to him with humility."
3. "This passage shows also that the true test of faith lies in prayer."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Such faith also could perhaps exist only in Christ Himself, but as it was approximated by the disciples their power would correspond."
2. "The latter reference suggests that they in their faith should bring about the destruction of the Jewish theocracy. Punitive power is spoken of; hence the faith required forbids arbitrariness and also an unforgiving spirit."
3. "This promise has a spiritual application to all believers, but gives no encouragement to fanatical attempts at working miracles."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Doubt not... the opposite of 'faith', trust, confidence." 
2. "The cursing of the fig-tree has always been regarded as of symbolic import, the tree being in Christ's mind an emblem of the Jewish people, with a great show of religion and no fruit of real godliness."
3. "Certainly 'this mountain' is a parable and one already reported in Matthew 17:20."

### John Gill:
1. "The mind must not be divided between the power and will of God, and the difficulties and discouragements which attend the case, but must believe in hope against hope, with a full persuasion of accomplishment."
2. "as difficult and amazing as this may seem, it shall be done: that is, provided the person doubts not; or, as it is said in Mark, 'shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things, which he saith, shall come to pass, he shall have whatsoever he saith'".
3. "his sense is, that, had they faith, they should be able not only to do such lesser miracles, as, comparatively speaking, the withering of the fig tree was, but they should be able to perform things much more difficult and surprising, whenever the good of the souls of men, the propagation of the Gospel, and the glory of God required them."

### John Wesley:
1. "If ye have faith â€” Whence we may learn, that one great end of our Lord in this miracle was to confirm and increase their faith."
2. "Another was, to warn them against unfruitfulness."
