# Matthew 21:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believing in the power of prayer in Christ's name defines effective prayers. When we pray in faith and agree with the will of God, our prayers have great power and avail with Him. We can confidently ask for anything that aligns with God's will, for His honor, the spread of the Gospel, our spiritual growth, and the welfare of souls. God is faithful to answer our prayers according to His promises in His Word, even when our requests seem impossible to the natural mind.
