# Matthew 21:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The religious leaders questioned Jesus, demanding to know by what authority he performed his teaching and miracles. They were not concerned with the truth or falsehood of his doctrines or the authenticity of his miracles, but rather sought to challenge his authority. They wanted to assert their own power and discredit him, either by accusing him of blasphemy if he claimed divine authority or dismissing him if he claimed human authority. The question reflected their hostility towards Jesus and their refusal to recognize his role as a prophet sent from God.

### Henry Alford:
1. "It was an official message, sent with a view to make our Saviour declare Himself to be a prophet sent from God in which case the Sanhedrim had power to take cognizance of His proceedings, as of a professed Teacher."
2. "The question was the result of a combination to destroy Jesus."
3. "They do not now ask, as in John 2:18, 'τί σημεῖον δεικνύεις ἡμῖν ὅτι ταῦτα ποιεῖς?' for they had had many signs which are now included in their ταῦτα. The second question, καὶ τίς κ.τ.λ., is an expansion of ποίᾳ."

	and who gave thee this

1. "He was instructing them in the things relating to himself, and his kingdom, dispensing the mysteries of his grace, the doctrines of regeneration, justification, and salvation."
2. "They do not object to his doctrines, or dispute whether they were true or false; nor examine his miracles, whether they were of God, or of the devil...they attack him about his commission and authority under which he acted."
3. "Should he say that God gave him the authority to do these things, they would charge him with enthusiasm and blasphemy...if he should say that he had his authority from men, they would confront him, and absolutely deny that he had any from them."

### John Wesley:
1. "Who thought he violated their right: and the elders of the people."
2. "These, with the chief priests, seem purposely to have appeared in a considerable company, to give the more weight to what they said, and if need were, to bear a united testimony against him."
