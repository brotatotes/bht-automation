# Matthew 21:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus was asked about his authority, he skillfully responded by posing another question, revealing that the authority of John the Baptist and his own were intertwined. By asking whether John's baptism was from heaven or from men, Jesus challenged the religious leaders to consider their own judgment regarding John's authority. He promised to provide a satisfactory answer to their question if they could honestly respond to his. Ultimately, the outcome of their response would lead them to the undeniable truth that John testified to Jesus as the Christ, confirming the divine origin of Jesus' authority.
