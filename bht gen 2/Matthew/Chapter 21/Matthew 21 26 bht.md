# Matthew 21:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The religious leaders were in a predicament. They believed that John's ministry and baptism were merely human, but they were afraid to openly admit this because they knew that the people esteemed him as a prophet. They feared the potential uprising of the people if they denied John's divine authority. This reveals their hypocrisy and lack of true conviction in their beliefs.
