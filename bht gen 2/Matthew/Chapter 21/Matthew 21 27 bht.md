# Matthew 21:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, in response to the religious leaders, refuses to give them a direct answer. This is because they had already been given the truth multiple times, yet they stubbornly refused to believe. Instead, Jesus exposes their insincerity and lack of genuine understanding by turning their question back onto them. His response reveals their hypocrisy and highlights the futility of their attempts to challenge and undermine Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Their difficulty was, how to answer, so as neither to shake their determination to reject the claims of Christ nor damage their reputation with the people. For the truth itself they cared nothing whatever."
2. "What composure and dignity of wisdom does our Lord here display, as He turns their question upon themselves, and, while revealing His knowledge of their hypocrisy, closes their mouths!"
3. "Taking advantage of the surprise, silence, and awe produced by this reply, our Lord followed it up immediately by the two following parables."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Christ answers their thought: we will not tell. This refusal is similar to that made when a sign from heaven was demanded."
2. "The answer assumes their proven and confessed incompetency to decide on the authority of a prophet, and consequently His superiority to their questioning."
3. "Such a defeat increased their opposition."

### John Gill:
1. "They chose rather therefore to speak against their own consciences, and tell a wilful lie, and incur the reproach of ignorance."
2. "They did not know, and could not tell from whence John had his commission, and who gave him his authority."
3. "Though by the question he put to them he tacitly suggests, that he had his authority not from man, but from God."

### John Wesley:
1. Neither tell I you â€” Not again, in express terms: he had often told them before, and they would not believe him.
