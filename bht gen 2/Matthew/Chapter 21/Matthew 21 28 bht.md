# Matthew 21:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parable highlights the distinction between two classes of people responding to God's call. The first class openly refuse to work in His vineyard, representing the unrepentant sinners who defy God to His face. The second class, portraying the hypocritical Scribes and Pharisees, show outward acceptance but lack the true intention of obedience. Their ungodliness far surpasses the actions of the sinful harlots, stripping them of any honor they may claim. Through this parable, Christ unmasks the false piety and calls for true fruitfulness in the lives of His followers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The following parable refers, under the image of the two sons, to two classes of persons, both summoned by the great Father to 'work in His vineyard'... the first answer the summons by a direct and open refusal these are the open sinners, the publicans and harlots, who disobey God to His face."
2. "But afterwards, when better thoughts are suggested, they repent, and go."
3. "The second class receive the summons with a respectful assent... having however no intention of obeying... These are the Scribes and Pharisees, with their show of legal obedience, who 'said, and did not'."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "True religion is a practical thing, a 'bringing forth fruit unto God.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "He unmasks those hypocrites... that they may no longer boast of being the ministers of God, or hold out a pretended zeal for godliness."
2. "Christ rebukes their impudence by showing that they were at the greatest possible distance from what they boasted."
3. "He strips them of the honor of which they were unworthy because their ungodliness was worse than the lasciviousness of the harlots."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But what think ye. Peculiar to Matthew. This parable assumes the concealment and falsity of their real opinion. Spoken in love, as an invitation and warning, it led to greater enmity."
2. "Go work today in the vineyard. God asks His people to labor every day in the work He appoints to them, but a special work is here meant, namely, ‘belief;’ see Matthew 21:32; comp. John 6:29: ‘This is the work of God, that ye believe on Him, whom He -hath sent.’"

### John Gill:
1. "The design of [this parable] is to show the hypocrisy and deceit of the Scribes and Pharisees, in pretending to works of righteousness, and not doing them."
2. "God, the Father, seems rather to be here intended, who is sometimes compared to a husbandman and a vinedresser."
3. "By them [the two sons] are meant two sorts of people, among the Jews, the Scribes and Pharisees, and publicans and sinners."
