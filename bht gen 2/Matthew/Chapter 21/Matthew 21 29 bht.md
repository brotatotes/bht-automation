# Matthew 21:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Man's will naturally inclines towards evil and resists doing what is good. It is only through the grace of God that one can be brought to true repentance. This repentance is not simply sorrow for wrongdoings or the consequences they bring, but a sincere change of heart and a turning towards God. It is a result of being spiritually instructed and having faith in Christ, knowing that we have the hope of forgiveness and the love of God in our hearts.
