# Matthew 21:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Lord, who has supreme power and authority, has a need for these creatures specifically for His service. When the owner of the animals hears that the Lord requires them, he willingly sends them along, understanding the urgency of the situation. This exchange between the Lord and the owner serves as a clear demonstration of the all-knowing nature of Christ.
