# Matthew 21:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The quote highlights the unexpected truth that those who were deemed outcasts, like the publicans and harlots, were actually entering into God's kingdom ahead of the religious leaders. This serves as a reminder of God's mercy and the transformative power of repentance. On the other hand, it warns against the danger of self-righteousness and empty promises, as those who only outwardly profess faith but lack true repentance will not inherit the blessings of God's grace.
