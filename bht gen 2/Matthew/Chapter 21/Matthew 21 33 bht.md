# Matthew 21:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parable in question draws inspiration from Isaiah 5:1-7, reinforcing its significance with Old Testament backing. In this parable, the husbandmen represent spiritual leaders who are responsible for nurturing righteousness. Jesus, depicted as the owner of the vineyard, briefly withdraws, symbolizing a period during the Jewish era when the vineyard was entrusted to the spiritual leaders. The distinctive features mentioned, such as the wine-fat and tower, reflect the purposeful design and careful planning in spiritual cultivation. The parable emphasizes the consequences of wickedness and the need for continuous diligence in God's work.
