# Matthew 21:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God, after patiently waiting for fruit from the Jewish people, sent His prophets and messengers to call for the fruits of righteousness. The conduct of the husbandmen towards the slaves reflects the behavior of the Jewish people towards the prophets and now towards Christ. The treatment of God's prophets by the Jews serves as a pointed illustration of this parable. Now, the time has come for fruits of justice and righteousness to be brought forth by the people, to honor and glorify God.
