# Matthew 21:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parable illustrates the mistreatment of God's messengers throughout history, culminating in the rejection and crucifixion of His Son. The servants who were beaten, killed, and stoned represent the prophets who were similarly persecuted by the Jews. Despite the reverence the Jews should have shown towards God's messengers and their message, they not only refused to listen but also killed and stoned them. This pattern of rejecting and mistreating God's messengers continued even with the arrival of His Son, as the Jews failed to recognize and honor Him as they should have.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one—see Jeremiah 37:15; Jeremiah 38:6."
2. "and killed another—see Jeremiah 26:20-23."
3. "and stoned another—see 2 Chronicles 24:21. Compare with this whole verse Matthew 21:35; Matthew 23:37, where our Lord reiterates these charges in the most melting strain."

### John Calvin:
1. "the Jews will dare to act towards the Son in the same manner as they have repeatedly done towards the prophets"
2. "Hence it appears how obstinate their malice was, for the correction of which no remedies were of any avail."
3. "That God did not, on account of the cruelty of the priests, fail to send prophets; but raising them up — as it were — in troops, fought against their malice."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The maltreatment of the servants appears in the history of the prophets (Elijah, Jeremiah, Isaiah); comp. Nehemiah 9:26; Matthew 23:29-31; Matthew 23:34; Matthew 23:37; 1 Thessalonians 2:15; Hebrews 11:36-38; Revelation 16:6; Revelation 18:24."
2. "God's messengers have often suffered since at the hands of the official personages in the external Church."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They will reverence my son" - εντραπησοντα τον υιον μου. Second future passive from εντρεπω, to turn at, but used transitively here as though active or middle.
2. "It is the picture of turning with respect when one worthy of it appears."

### John Gill:
1. "So far were they from treating these servants with respect, as they ought to have done; considering whose they were, from whom they came, and upon what account; and also so far from delivering to them the fruit due to their master, or excusing their inability to make a suitable return, as might be expected, they use them very roughly."
2. "And killed another; that is, with the sword. There were four kinds of death in the power of the sanhedrim, of which this is one, and what follows is another; and were these, stoning, burning, killing (i.e. beheading with the sword), and strangling."
3. "And stoned another; as they did Zechariah, 2 Chronicles 24:21 and doubtless many others; since Jerusalem had the character of killing the prophets, and stoning them that were sent unto her."
