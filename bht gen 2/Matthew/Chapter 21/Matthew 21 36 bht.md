# Matthew 21:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The sending of the second group of servants in the parable is a representation of God's enduring patience and long-suffering. The increase in their number demonstrates the abundance of God's grace and mercy towards the husbandmen. The servants faced similar treatment as the first group, subjected to beatings and even death. This emphasizes the unwavering wickedness and hostility of the husbandmen towards God and His messengers. The repetition of these actions highlights the unrepentant nature of those who reject God's message.
