# Matthew 21:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ, was sent to bless the house of Israel and turn them away from their sins. He is to be revered just as the Father, as he is equal to Him in nature and glory. However, instead of showing reverence, the husbandmen despised and rejected Him, treating Him with cruelty and hatred. This rejection of the Son of God was a clear demonstration of the impiety and sinfulness of their hearts.

2. "Certainly the chief reason why the priests raged against Christ was, that, they might not lose their tyranny, which might be said to be their prey; for he it is by whom God chooses to govern, and to whom He has given all authority."

2. "The Son of God is to be reverenced equally as his Father, since he is in nature and glory equal to him; and it is the will of his Father he should be so reverenced, as he is by the angels in heaven, and by the saints, both in heaven and in earth."
