# Matthew 21:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This passage portrays the capture and expulsion of Jesus from the vineyard, symbolizing both his excommunication and crucifixion outside Jerusalem. Despite the rulers' determination to kill him, there is a profound sense of love in his warning. The scene shifts to Jesus being apprehended in the garden by soldiers and officers sent by the chief priests and Pharisees. They then deliver him to the Gentiles, who subject him to mockery, scourging, and death. Although Pilate, a non-Jewish governor, sentenced Jesus, it was at the insistence of these Jewish leaders.
