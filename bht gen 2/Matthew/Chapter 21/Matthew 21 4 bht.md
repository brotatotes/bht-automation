# Matthew 21:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, it was not merely a coincidence that people laid palm branches before Him; it was a deliberate fulfillment of prophecy. Jesus did not quote the passage Himself, but His actions matched the predictions. He rode into Jerusalem on a donkey to make a statement, not because He couldn't walk or was too tired. As He rode, the people welcomed Him, saying the words foretold in Scripture. It is clear that all of this was divine orchestration, according to the counsel of God.
