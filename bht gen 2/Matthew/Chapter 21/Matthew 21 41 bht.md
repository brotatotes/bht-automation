# Matthew 21:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is said that perhaps some of the onlookers, rather than the chief priests or Pharisees, made this statement. This is in reference to the severe punishment that the wicked men in the parable deserve, for their crimes of mistreating and even killing the servants sent by the owner of the vineyard. However, when this parable is presented to the Jews and applied to them, they object, saying, God forbid that we should ever be guilty of such crimes and incur such punishment.
