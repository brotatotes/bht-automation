# Matthew 21:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The rejection of the stone by the builders, as mentioned in the scriptures, highlights the importance of Christ as the foundation of the true temple of God. Despite being rejected by the religious experts, Christ remains the firm and everlasting foundation that cannot be replaced. He is the cornerstone that not only supports and links the church together, but also unites Jews and Gentiles in the body of Christ. Ultimately, God has the final say, setting aside the building experts and exalting His Son as the Head of the corner.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The words here are those of the LXX."
2. "The οἰκοδομοῦντες answer to the husbandmen, and the addition is made in this changed similitude to show them that though they might reject and kill the Son, yet He will be victorious in the end."
3. "εἰς κεφ. γων. The corner-stone binds together both walls of the building; so Christ unites Jews and Gentiles in Himself."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Jesus saith unto them. Did ye never read in the scriptures... The stone which the builders rejected, &c."
2. "A bright Messianic prophecy, which reappears in various forms and was made glorious use of by Peter before the Sanhedrim."
3. "He recurs to it in his first epistle."

### John Calvin:
1. "Though they are unfaithful in the execution of the office committed to them, yet he gives them this title with respect to their calling."
2. "That stone is made the head of the corner. Still more emphatic is this clause, in which God declares that the wicked, by rejecting Christ, will avail nothing, but that his rank will remain unimpaired."
3. "For on what does the authority of the word of God depend, according to them, but on the opinion of men, so that no more power is left to God than what the Church is pleased to allow him? Far otherwise does the Spirit instruct us by this passage, namely, that as soon as the majesty of God appears, the whole world ought to be silent."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The most important foundation stone, joining two walls. A reference to the union of Jews and Gentiles in Christ (as in Ephesians 2:19-22) may be included, but the main thought is, that the Messiah, even if rejected by the ‘builders,’ should become the corner-stone of the real temple of God."
2. "This involves the important idea, that the ‘builders’ would be themselves rejected: the parable left the Son dead outside of the vineyard, this citation, representing Him as victor and avenger (Matthew 21:44), points to the resurrection."
3. "‘This’ must grammatically refer either to ‘head’ or ‘comer.’ Others understand it as ‘this thing,’ this exaltation of the despised one."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The builders rejected... A most telling quotation." 
2. "These experts in building God's temple had rejected the corner-stone chosen by God for his own house."
3. "But God has the last word and sets aside the building experts and puts his Son as the Head of the corner. It was a withering indictment."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ is the sure, firm, and everlasting foundation, which God has laid in Zion, and the only one of any avail; nor can any other be laid to any purpose; and if he is neglected, and laid aside, in the ministration of the word, the building which men endeavour to rear, or exhort unto, will come to nothing."
2. "Christ is the foundation, on which the church, and every believer, are built, and therefore will abide; for the gates of hell cannot prevail against them."
3. "Notwithstanding the former and present rejection, and ill treatment of him, he is become the head of the corner: he is the corner stone in the building which knits and cements it together, angels and men, Jews and Gentiles; Old and New Testament saints; saints above, and saints below, and in all ages and places, all meet, and are united together in this corner stone."

### John Wesley:
1. "The builders — The scribes and priests, whose office it was to build up the Church."
2. "Is become the head of the corner — Or the chief corner stone: he is become the foundation of the Church."
3. "On which the whole building rests, and is the principal corner stone, for uniting the Gentiles to it, as the chief corner stone of a house supports and links its two sides together."
