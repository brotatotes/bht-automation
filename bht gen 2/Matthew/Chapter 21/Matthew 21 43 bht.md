# Matthew 21:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The rejected corner stone symbolizes the rejection of the Gospel by the Jewish leaders and the consequence of their unbelief. This rejection leads to the removal of the kingdom of God from their midst, as the Gospel is taken away from them. However, this does not mean that the Gospel will disappear entirely, as it will be given to another nation, to all nations, to gather the elect and extend God's mercy globally.

3. "This vastly important statement is given by Matthew only."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ denounces against all indiscriminately the dreadful vengeance of God; for as the priests were inflated with the desire of holding the highest power, so the rest of the people gloried on the ground of having been adopted."
2. "Christ now declares that God was not bound to them, and, therefore, that he will convey to another the honor of which they rendered themselves unworthy."
3. "The perpetuity of that kingdom, which is here described, may afford comfort to all the godly. For by these words Christ assures us that, though the ungodly destroyed the worship of God among themselves, they would never cause the name of Christ to be abolished, or true religion to perish."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The kingdom of God shall be taken away from you. The ‘vineyard’ means the ‘kingdom of God’ in all ages, not exclusively the Jewish people."

3. "Though God may take away the Gospel from a people, as he did from the Jews; yet he does not, nor will he, as yet, take it out of the world...to the Gentiles, to all the nations of the world...to gather his elect out of them...and it is likewise a national mercy wherever it comes."

### John Wesley:
