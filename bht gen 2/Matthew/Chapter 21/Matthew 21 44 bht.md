# Matthew 21:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ is the cornerstone of the kingdom, but he also becomes a stumbling block for those who reject him. Falling on this stone leads to brokenness and harm, while the stone remains unchanged. Those who take offense at Christ only bring hurt upon themselves. However, there is still hope for those who stumble and fall upon the cornerstone. As long as there is life, there is the possibility of repentance. Yet, for those who persist in their rejection, the stone will eventually come upon them, leading to their utter destruction.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The stone is the whole kingdom and power of the Messiah summed up in Himself."
2. "He that takes offence, that makes it a stone of stumbling, shall be broken."
3. "On whomsoever, as its enemy, it shall come in vengeance, it shall dash him in pieces."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Kingdom of God is here a Temple, in the erection of which a certain stone, rejected as unsuitable by the spiritual builders, is, by the great Lord of the House, made the keystone of the whole."
2. "On that Stone the builders were now 'falling' and being 'broken.' They were sustaining great spiritual hurt."
3. "Soon that Stone should 'fall upon them' and 'grind them to powder'â€”in their corporate capacity, in the tremendous destruction of Jerusalem, but personally, as unbelievers, in a more awful sense still."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Shall be broken [ÏƒÏ…Î½Î¸Î»Î±ÏƒÎ¸Î·ÏƒÎµÏ„Î±Î¹] . The verb is stronger: broken to pieces."
2. "Grind him to powder [Î»Î¹ÎºÎ¼Î·ÏƒÎµÎ¹ Î±Ï…Ï„Î¿Î½]. But the A. V. misses the picture in the word, which is that of the winnowing-fan that separates the grain from the chaff."
3. "Literally it is, will winnow him. Rev., scatter him as dust."

### John Calvin:
1. "...he suffers no loss or diminution when he is rejected by the wicked, because, though their obstinacy were like a stone or like iron, yet by his own hardness he will break them."
2. "...they might not flatter themselves, while they thus dashed against him."
3. "...they will be bruised under the stone, against which they so insolently dashed themselves."

1. "He that falleth on this stone, i.e., the corner-stone, Christ...will be broken."
2. "And whomsoever it shall fall, it will scatter him as chaff."
3. "Repentance may intervene and avert this final result."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Shall be broken to pieces...The verb means to shatter. We are familiar with an automobile that dashes against a stone wall, a tree, or a train and the ruin that follows."
2. "Will scatter him as dust...The verb was used of winnowing out the chaff and then of grinding to powder. This is the fate of him on whom this Rejected Stone falls."

### John Gill:
1. "As he is the foundation and corner stone to some, and is set for the rising of them, and to whom he is precious; so he is a stone set for the fall of others, and at which they stumble and fall, and fall upon it."
2. "For as a man that stumbles at a stone, and falls upon it, breaks his head or his bones, at least bruises himself, does not hurt the stone, but the stone hurts him; so all such as are offended at Christ, injure their own souls."
3. "But whilst there is life, the means of grace continue, the kingdom of God is not taken away; there is hope that such may be recovered from their impenitence and unbelief."

### John Wesley:
1. "Whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken"
2. "Stumblers at Christ shall even then receive much hurt"
3. "But on whomsoever it shall fall... it will utterly destroy him"
