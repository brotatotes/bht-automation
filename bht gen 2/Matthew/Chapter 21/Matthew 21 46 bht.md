# Matthew 21:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The religious leaders were filled with a murderous rage towards Jesus and were eager to harm him, but their fear of the multitude restrained them from doing so. The people recognized Jesus as a prophet, understanding the power and authority with which he taught and the extraordinary miracles he performed. This recognition made the leaders hesitant to openly oppose Jesus or denounce his teachings, for they were aware of how the people viewed him. Despite their anger, they could not deny the profound impact Jesus had on the lives of many through his compassionate healing and powerful words.
