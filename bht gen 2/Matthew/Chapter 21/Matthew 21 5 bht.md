# Matthew 21:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Behold, as the daughter of Zion, the Jewish synagogue, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, anticipate the King Messiah's arrival, fulfilling the prophetic words from Isaiah and Zechariah. The humble state of Jesus, riding upon a beast of burden as a symbol of meekness and lowliness of mind, presents a striking contrast to worldly pomp and grandeur. This choice of entry by our Lord embodies his role as the Prince of Peace, demonstrating his rejection of warlike animal symbolism and embracing a position of humility that brings comfort and honor to believers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The phrase emphasized the humble state of Jesus."
2. "He is mounted, not on a stately charger with embroidered and jeweled housings, nor even on an ass for the saddle, the Eastern ass being often of great beauty and spirit, and in demand for this purpose."
3. "He rides on a common beast-of-burden, furnished with the everyday garments of his disciples."

### John Calvin:
1. "The coming of Christ yields to believers a full and complete ground of joy."
2. "Since God is not reconciled to them in any other way than through the agency of the Mediator, and as it is the same Mediator who delivers his people from all evils, what can there be, apart from him, that is fitted to cheer men ruined by their sins, and oppressed by troubles?"
3. "When the Redeemer is present with them, they ought to be perfectly joyful."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Our Lord was to enter Jerusalem in a prominent position, not lost in the crowd thronging to the Passover feast; He chooses to ride upon the foal of an ass, not on a horse, the symbol of pride."
2. "But He thus fulfilled a prophetic announcement, in which the Messiah is represented as the king entering Jerusalem, and yet as lowly, the meekness symbolized by His riding upon an ass’s colt."
3. "The Fathers allegorized the incident, regarding the colt as a symbol of the Gentiles, untamed and unclean before Christ sat upon them and sanctified them, the mother representing Judaism under the yoke the law."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The daughter of Zion (τη θυγατρ Σιων). Jerusalem as in Isaiah 22:4 (daughter of my people). So Babylon (Isaiah 47:1), daughter of Tyre for Tyre (Psalms 45:12)."
2. "Riding (επιβεβηκως). Perfect active participle of επιβαινω, 'having gone upon.'"
3. "The use of υποζυγιου (a beast of burden, under a yoke) for ass is common in the LXX and in the papyri (Deissmann, Bible Studies p. 161)."

### John Gill:
1. "by the daughter of Zion is meant, not the city of Jerusalem, but the inhabitants thereof, the Jewish synagogue; or as the Targum renders it, כנישתא דציון, "the congregation of Zion", the people of the Jews;"
2. "behold, thy king cometh unto thee: this, and what follow, are cited from Zechariah 9:9 and to be understood of the king Messiah"
3. "a character it is, that well agrees with Jesus, who, in the whole of his deportment, both in life and in death, was a pattern of meekness and lowliness of mind"

### John Wesley:
1. "The first words of the passage are cited from Isaiah 62:11; the rest from Zechariah 9:9."
2. "The Prince of Peace did not take a horse, a warlike animal. But he will ride on that by and by, Revelation 19:11."
3. "Was it a mean attitude wherein our Lord then appeared? Mean even to contempt! I grant it: I glory in it: it is for the comfort of my soul for the honour of his humility, and for the utter confusion of all worldly pomp and grandeur."
