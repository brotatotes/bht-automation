# Matthew 21:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the disciples prepared for Jesus to ride on the colt, they placed their loose upper garments on the animal, serving as makeshift saddles. This act was not unusual, as it was a token of respect. The disciples did not know which animal Jesus would choose to ride on, so they placed their clothes on both. As Jesus took his seat on the garments, it was a demonstration of ease and decency. This gesture of placing garments on animals for riding purposes was not out of the ordinary.
