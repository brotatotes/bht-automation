# Matthew 21:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people cried out, possibly moved by a divine impulse, even though many did not fully understand their own words. Jesus had previously refrained from public displays of honor to avoid the interference of his enemies, but now he allowed the crowd's acclamations as a public testimony against their wickedness. The specific expressions recorded by other gospel writers may vary slightly, but it is certain that some among the multitude used all of them.
