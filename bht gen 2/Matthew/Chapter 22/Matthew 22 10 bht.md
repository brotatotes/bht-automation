# Matthew 22:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The servants faithfully fulfilled their duty to gather all people, regardless of their righteousness or lack thereof. This inclusivity is emphasized, as the servants went out and brought in Jews, Samaritans, and even the outlying heathens. This parable highlights that no one is excluded from the call of the Gospel, and salvation is available to all who respond to it.
