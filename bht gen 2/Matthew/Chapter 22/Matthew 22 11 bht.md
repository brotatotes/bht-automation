# Matthew 22:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The members of the visible Church are the guests in this parable. Their true character will be inspected by the omniscient Lord Jesus and only those found wearing the proper wedding garment, which represents the righteousness of Christ, will be partakers of everlasting life. Those who choose to rely on their own righteousness or present themselves with filth and rags will be rejected by the King of Zion. It is through faith in Christ and His righteousness imputed to us that we are granted entrance into the kingdom of heaven.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Solemn expression this, of that omniscient inspection of every professed disciple of the Lord Jesus from age to age, in virtue of which his true character will hereafter be judicially proclaimed!"
2. "The language here is drawn from the following remarkable passage in Zephaniah 1:7; Zephaniah 1:8: —'Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord God; for the day of the Lord is at hand: for the Lord hath prepared a sacrifice, He hath bid His guests. And it shall come to pass in the day of the Lord's sacrifice, that I will punish the princes, and the king's children, and all such as are clothed with strange apparel.'"
3. "And what can that be but what is meant by 'putting on the Lord Jesus,' as 'THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS?'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The garments worn on festival occasions were chiefly long white robes, and it was the custom of the person who made the feast to prepare such robes to be worn by the guests."
2. "This beautifully represents the conduct of the hypocrite in the church. A garment of salvation might be his, performed by the hands of the Saviour, and dyed in his blood; but the hypocrite chooses the filthy rags of his own righteousness, and thus offers the highest contempt for that provided in the gospel."
3. "He is to blame, not for being invited - not for coming, if he would come, for he is freely invited but for offering the highest contempt to the King of Zion in presenting himself with all his filth and rags, and in refusing to be saved in the way provided in the gospel."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. To see [θεασασθαι] . Rev., somewhat stiffly, behold; but the idea is correct, as the verb denotes careful seeing, looking intently, inspection. See on Matthew 11:7.

### John Calvin:
1. "The general truth conveyed is, that not all who have once entered the Church will become partakers of everlasting life, but only those who are found to wear the dress which befits the heavenly palace."
2. "Christ intended only to state, that the Lord calls us on the express condition of our being renewed by the Spirit after his image; and that, in order to our remaining permanently in his house, we must put off the old man with his pollutions and lead a new life."
3. "Whomsoever the Lord invites he at the same time supplies with clothing, and in all of us is fulfilled what Ezekiel says, that God finds nothing in us but wretchedness, and nakedness, and abominable filth, but adorns us with magnificent attire."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The lesson is not that each guest should take pains to provide himself with the proper habit. The gift of the wedding garment accords far better with the Scripture doctrines of grace."
2. "'The wedding garment' is not faith; that is the putting on of the garment; it is ‘righteousness,’ given of God in Christ; to be distinguished but not divided, as imputed and in-wrought."
3. "Charity or holiness; this leads to legalism by throwing the gospel basis of holiness into the background."

### John Gill:
1. "He takes notice how they behave in the exercise of grace, and discharge of duty, and distinguishes hypocrites from real believers."
2. "The righteousness of Christ... covers and protects them, and beautifies and adorns them."
3. "He had got into a church state without it, though there is no entrance into the kingdom of heaven but by it."

### John Wesley:
