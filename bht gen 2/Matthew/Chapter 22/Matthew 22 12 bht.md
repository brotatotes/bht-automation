# Matthew 22:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The man in the parable did not have a wedding garment, symbolizing the righteousness of Christ. This garment is both imputed and implanted, received through faith. The absence of the garment suggests that the man tried to enter God's presence through his own works or merits. However, this parable does not refer to the Lord's Supper; it pertains to God's judgment on the last day.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 12. Friend, how camest thou in
	hither, not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless—being
	self-condemned.

### Albert Barnes:
1. Friend - Rather, “companions.” The word does not imply friendship.He was speechless - He had no excuse. So it will be with all hypocrites.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The man had not a wedding garment. When the king addresses the guest, he is thinking not so much of the outward token of disrespect, as of the guest's mental attitude toward the proprieties of the occasion."
2. "It implies... that the man was conscious of the omission when he entered, and was intentionally guilty of the neglect."
3. "He was speechless. Lit., he was muzzled or gagged... Peter uses it of putting the ignorant and foolish to silence."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Friend. The word used in chap. Matthew 20:13, and addressed to Judas (chap. Matthew 26:50). It means ‘companion,’ without implying friendship."
2. "How camest thou! It was a bold intrusion, a despising of the king, to appear in his own ordinary dress. This points to the pride of self-righteousness. Some think it indicates lawlessness or hypocrisy."
3. "He was speechless. There can be no excuse for failure to have on the wedding garment, to be righteous through and in Christ Jesus."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Not having a wedding-garment (μη εχων ενδυμα γαμου)."
2. "There is a subtle distinction between μη and ου like our subjective and objective notions."
3. "Wunsche does report a parable by a rabbi of a king who set no time for his feast and the guests arrived, some properly dressed waiting at the door; others in their working clothes did not wait, but went off to work and, when the summons suddenly came, they had no time to dress properly and were made to stand and watch while the others partook of the feast."

### John Gill:
1. "Since he did not come in by faith, in the righteousness of Christ... intimating, that he climbed up some other way, and was a thief and robber."
2. "How couldest thou expect to meet with acceptance with me, or to be suitable company for my people, not being arrayed with the garments of salvation, and robe of righteousness, as they are?"
3. "He had nothing to say for himself... their mouths will be stopped, and they will have nothing to say in vindication of themselves; their righteousness will not answer for them in a time to come."

### John Wesley:
1. "A wedding garment - The righteousness of Christ, first imputed, then implanted."
