# Matthew 22:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When it says to bind him hand and foot, it means to render him completely powerless. This punishment of being cast into outer darkness signifies the exclusion from the joy and festivities of the heavenly city. It is a dismal retribution, experiencing not only the absence of the kingdom's brightness and glory but also being thrust into a region of darkness. The phrase there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth further portrays the anguish and despair that await the unworthy. The attendants, likely angels serving as ministers of judgment, will enforce this punishment, leaving no room for escape.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Bind him hand and foot—putting it out of his power to resist."
2. "To be 'outside' at all—or, in the language of Matthew 25:30, to be 'without' the heavenly city, excluded from its joyous nuptials and gladsome festivities—is sad enough of itself, without anything else. But to find themselves not only excluded from the brightness and glory and joy and felicity of the kingdom above, but thrust into a region of 'darkness,' with all its horrors, this is the dismal retribution here announced, that awaits the unworthy at the great day."
3. "There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."

### Albert Barnes:
1. Cast him into outer darkness - See the notes at Matthew 8:12. This, without doubt, refers to the future punishment of the hypocrite, Matthew 23:23-33; Matthew 24:51.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The attendants. A different word from that used before, referring not to the ‘servants’ who invited, nor to the guests, but probably to angels, as ministers of judgment."
2. "Bind him hand and foot. For secure transfer to his place of punishment. The best authorities omit, ‘and take him away.'"
3. "Outer darkness. See chap Matthew 8:12. There the fate of ‘the children of the kingdom ‘is referred to; here of a Gentile, who entered in, despising the King; their punishment is the same; their sin was the same, the sin of pride."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Was speechless (εψιμωθη). Was muzzled, dumb from confusion and embarrassment."
2. "The outer darkness (το σκοτος το εξωτερον). See Matthew 8:12. All the blacker from the standpoint of the brilliantly lighted banquet hall."
3. "There shall be (εκε εστα). Out there in the outer darkness."

### John Gill:
1. "By whom are meant, either the ministers of the Gospel, and pastors of churches, who by the order of Christ, and in the name of the churches, cast out all such as appear, by their bad principles and evil practices, to be without the grace of God, and righteousness of Christ."
2. "Such methods being taken, that there could be no escaping it."
3. "This clause is not in the Vulgate Latin, nor in the Syriac and Arabic versions, nor in Munster's Hebrew Gospel, but is in all the ancient Greek copies."
