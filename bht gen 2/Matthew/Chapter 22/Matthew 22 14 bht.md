# Matthew 22:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Many are called but few are chosen. This statement by Jesus emphasizes that while many hear the call to faith, only a few truly respond and believe. It is important to recognize that being a member of the visible church does not automatically make one a part of the invisible Church. The distinction lies in the genuine faith and belief in Jesus Christ.
