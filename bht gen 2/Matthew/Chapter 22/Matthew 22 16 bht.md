# Matthew 22:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The way of God is set apart from the teachings of men. True teachers stay faithful to the pure word of God, not adding their own ideas or altering the message. They prioritize edification and the salvation of the people over seeking approval from others. The danger lies in deviating from the truth, conforming to the desires of men, and compromising the integrity of the teaching. True devotion to God necessitates a disregard for the appearance and status of individuals.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "The way of God is contrasted with the inventions of men, and with all foreign doctrines; and truth is contrasted with ambition, covetousness, and other wicked dispositions, which usually corrupt the purity of instruction."
2. "He ought to be reckoned a true teacher, who does not introduce the contrivances of men, or depart from the pure word of God, but gives out, as it were, with his hands what he has learned from the mouth of God, and who, from a sincere desire of edification, accommodates his doctrine to the advantage and salvation of the people, and does not debase it by any disguise."
3. "Nothing has a more powerful tendency to withdraw teachers from a faithful and upright dispensation of the word than to pay respect to men; for it is impossible that any one who desires to please men should truly devote himself to God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The devil never lies so foully as when he speaks the truth."
2. "His independence and sincerity had just been demonstrated, but their acknowledgment of these peculiarities was to tempt Him."
3. "Thou regardest not the person of men."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Their disciples (τους μαθητας αυτων). Students, pupils, of the Pharisees as in Mark 2:18."
2. "The Herodians (των Hερωιδιανων). Not members of Herod's family or Herod's soldiers, but partisans or followers of Herod."
3. "The person of men (προσωπον ανθρωπων). Literally, face of men. Paying regard to appearance is the sin of partiality condemned by James (James 2:1; James 2:9) when προσωπολημψια, προσωπολημπτειν are used, in imitation of the Hebrew idiom."

### John Gill:
1. "Learned men are very much divided in their sentiments about these men; some think they were Gentiles under the government of Herod; but it is not likely that the Pharisees would join themselves with such, whose company they carefully shunned; others, that they were Gentile proselytes, as Herod was; but that on either of these accounts, they should be called by his name, there seems to be no reason." 
2. "Others, that they were a set of men, that formed a new scheme of religion, consisting partly of Judaism, and partly of Gentilism, approved and espoused by Herod, and therefore called by his name."
3. "Luke observes, that these men, the disciples of the Pharisees and the Herodians, were sent forth as 'spies, which should feign themselves just men'; men of religion and holiness, and who were upright and sincere in their question, and who had strong inclinations to become his disciples."

### John Wesley:
1. "The Herodians were a set of men peculiarly attached to Herod, and consequently zealous for the interest of the Roman government..."
2. "...which was the main support of the dignity and royalty of his family."
3. "Thou regardest not the person of men - Thou favourest no man for his riches or greatness."
