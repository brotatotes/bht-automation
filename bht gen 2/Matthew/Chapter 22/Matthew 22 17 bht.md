# Matthew 22:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When confronted with a question about the poll tax, those who asked it hoped that Jesus would give an answer that would either allow them to accuse him to the people as a betrayer of the country's liberties or accuse him to the Roman governor. However, their true motive was not their usual hostility towards Rome but their intense hatred for Jesus. Jesus skillfully avoided their trap, understanding their deceitful intentions and refusing to give them the opportunity to manipulate his words against him.
