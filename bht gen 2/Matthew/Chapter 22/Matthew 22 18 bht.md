# Matthew 22:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ, being omniscient, saw through the hypocrisy of their hearts and was well aware of their deceptive intentions. He did not judge them based on their outward appearances or false claims of righteousness, but saw through their masks and exposed their true intentions. Their attempt to deceive and trap Him in their questioning was evident to Him, despite their outward show of concern.
