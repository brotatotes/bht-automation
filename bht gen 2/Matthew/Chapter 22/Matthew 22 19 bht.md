Shew me the tribute money, they brought unto him a penny. The tribute money referred to here is the Roman coin used for paying taxes. It was a currency that carried the image of Caesar, signifying the authority and acknowledgment of the Roman government. The choice to use Roman money for tribute indicated the Jews' acceptance of Roman rule and their submission to its taxation. This specific coin, known as a penny or denarius, served as an example of the currency used for tribute payments, demonstrating the practicality of Jesus' request.
