## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The great marriage supper (Rev 19:9) of the Son of God: i.e. His full and complete union to His Bride the Church in glory: which would be to the guests the ultimate result of accepting the invitation." 
2. "The difficulty, of the totality of the guests in this case constituting the Bride, may be lessened by regarding the ceremony as an enthronization, in which the people are regarded as being espoused to their prince."
3. "On the whole imagery, cf. Psalms 45:1-17."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In this parable, we see how the Lord is revealing Himself in ever clearer light as the central Person of the kingdom, giving here a far plainer hint than in the last parable of the nobility of His descent."
2. "The 'marriage' of Jehovah to His people Israel was familiar to Jewish ears; and in Matthew 22, this marriage is seen consummated in the Person of Messiah 'THE KING,' Himself addressed as 'GOD' and yet as anointed by 'HIS GOD' with the oil of gladness above His fellows."
3. "But observe carefully, that THE BRIDE does not come into view in this parable; its design being to teach certain truths under the figure of guests at a wedding feast, and the want of a wedding garment, which would not have harmonized with the introduction of the Bride."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The kingdom of heaven - See the notes at Matthew 3:2. The idea here is, 'God deals with man in his kingdom, or in regard to the dispensation of the gospel, as a certain king did,' etc."
2. "This parable refers, undoubtedly, to the rejection of the Jews and to the calling of the Gentiles. The gospel, with all its privileges, was offered to the Jewish people; but through their wickedness and pride they rejected it, and all its blessings were offered to the Gentiles and accepted."
3. "A marriage for his son - Rather a 'marriage-feast,' or a feast on the occasion of the marriage of his son. The king here doubtless represents God providing for the salvation of the world."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Made a marriage [εποιησεν] . But the phrase refers to the marriage - feast, rather than to the marriage - ceremony. In Esther 9:22, the word is used of feasting without any reference to a marriage. Rev., a marriage - feast.

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ now brings it as a reproach against the Jews, that they gave utterance to beautiful expressions about the kingdom of God, but, when God kindly and gently invited them, they rejected his grace with disdain."
2. "God bestowed on the Jews distinguished honor, by providing for them, as it were, a hospitable table; but they despised the honor which had been conferred upon them."
3. "The allusion is to a practice customary among men, that those who intended to make a marriage drew up a list of the persons whom they intended to have as guests, and afterwards sent invitations to them by their servants."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A marriage feast for his son. The word includes any great feast, but here a marriage feast is meant, since the word ‘son’ must not be thrown into the background."
2. "It was Christ’s marriage, i.e., with His covenant people, according to the imager of the Old Testament."
3. "The union of the Divine and human natures of Christ underlies the other union, but is not prominent here."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The plural, as here (Matthew 22:2; Matthew 22:3; Matthew 22:4; Matthew 22:9), is very common in the papyri for the wedding festivities." 
2. "The very phrase here, γαμους ποιειν, occurs in the Doric of Thera about B.C. 200." 
3. "The singular γαμος is common in the papyri for the wedding contract, but Field (Notes, p. 16) sees no difference between the singular here in Matthew 22:8 and the plural."

### John Gill:
1. "The design of which is to express the great love of God the Father, who is represented by this certain king, in espousing any of the children of men to his own son."
2. "The view of it is to set forth the plenteous provisions of grace made under the Gospel dispensation in the word and ordinances."
3. "The person that contracted this relation between them [Christ and the church], is the Father of Christ, who chose them for him to be his spouse and bride."

### John Wesley:
1. A king, who made a marriage feast for his son — So did God, when he brought his first - begotten into the world.
