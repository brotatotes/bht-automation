# Matthew 22:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus says, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, he is reminding the people to pay tribute and honor to the earthly authorities without neglecting their obedience and reverence to God. By accepting Caesar's coin, they are acknowledging his authority. It is important for believers to fulfill their obligations and show respect to the governing powers, as long as it does not compromise their devotion to God. In doing so, they maintain a proper balance between their civic responsibilities and their ultimate loyalty to God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "Christ intended to refute the error of those who did not think that they would be the people of God, unless they were free from every yoke of human authority." 
2. "Christ declares that it is no violation of the authority of God, or any injury done to his service, if, in respect of outward government, the Jews obey the Romans." 
3. "But this doctrine extends still farther, that every man, according to his calling, ought to perform the duty which he owes to men; that children ought willingly to submit to their parents, and servants to their masters; that they ought to be courteous and obliging towards each other, according to the law of charity, provided that God always retain the highest authority."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Render to ‘the powers that be,’ the service due them. Obedience to this precept would have spared Jerusalem, but the subtlest snare they devised for our Lord became their own destruction."
2. "Real religion makes men better citizens, since it enjoins a religious fulfilment of political obligations."
3. "Both [Church and State] are of Divine origin and authority: the one for the temporal, the other for the eternal welfare of men. They ought to be kept distinct and independent in their respective spheres, without mixture and confusion, and yet without antagonism, but rather in friendly relation in view of their common origin in God, and their common end and completion in ‘the kingdom of glory’ where God shall be all in all."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Render  (αποδοτε). "Give back" to Caesar what is already Caesar's. 

### John Gill:
1. "Christ's advice is, render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God, the things that are God's: give Caesar the tribute and custom, and fear, and honour, and obedience, which are due to him; which may be done without interfering with the honour of God, and prejudicing his interest and glory."
2. "Subjection to civil magistrates is not inconsistent with the reverence and fear of God; all are to have their dues rendered unto them, without entrenching upon one another."
3. "And the Jews themselves allow, that a king ought to have his dues, whether he be a king of Israel, or of the Gentiles."

### John Wesley:
1. "Plainly acknowledging, by their having received his coin, that they were under his government."
2. "The current coin of every nation shows who is the supreme governor of it."
3. "Render therefore, ye Pharisees, to Cesar the things which ye yourselves acknowledge to be Cesar's: and, ye Herodians, while ye are zealous for Cesar, see that ye render to God the things that are God's."
