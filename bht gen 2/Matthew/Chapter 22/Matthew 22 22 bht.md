# Matthew 22:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Matthew 22:22, the people who were questioning Jesus were left in a state of marvel and amazement. They were confounded and impressed by his prudence and wisdom in answering them. Despite their attempts to discredit him, Jesus proved himself victorious over them, causing them to leave him silenced and disappointed. They were unable to bring him into contempt with the people or charge him with any wrongdoing, resulting in a lackluster account of their mission for those who sent them.
