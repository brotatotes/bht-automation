# Matthew 22:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Sadducees, known for their denial of the resurrection, gather together to challenge Jesus on this matter. They not only reject the idea of the resurrection but also deny the existence of angels and the immortality of the soul. Their disbelief in the afterlife and spiritual beings leads them to assert that the soul dies with the body. The Sadducees' false teachings aim to undermine the hope and future of believers, but Jesus stands firm in opposing their errors.
