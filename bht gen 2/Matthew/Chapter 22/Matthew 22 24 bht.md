# Matthew 22:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Sadducees, in their attempt to challenge Jesus, brought up a Levirate marriage scenario, a practice aimed at preserving families in the Jewish context. They used a conundrum to test Jesus, but their ulterior motive was to discredit him and the true doctrine of godliness. This law of the Levirate marriage only applied when a man died without children, and the purpose was to ensure that the deceased brother's name and inheritance were preserved. The birth of a child from this marriage would be considered the seed of the deceased and would inherit his estate, according to the law.
