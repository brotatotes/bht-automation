# Matthew 22:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When faced with the complex question of marriage in the resurrection, the religious leaders were seeking to trap Jesus in their entangling question. They hoped he would be forced to abandon his belief in the resurrection, thereby eliminating the need for an answer. However, Jesus both rebukes and denies their false assumptions regarding human relationships in the future state. Their attempt to discredit him and force him into a corner ultimately fails, as he offers a profound response that goes beyond their expectations.
