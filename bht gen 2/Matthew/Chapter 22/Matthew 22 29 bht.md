# Matthew 22:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is clear that the individuals being addressed in this passage lacked a true understanding of the Scriptures, particularly concerning the doctrine of resurrection. Their ignorance led to errors and misunderstandings, as they failed to grasp the power of God to bring about the resurrection. The words of our Lord expose their lack of knowledge and highlight the importance of humbly and submissively seeking the truth in the Scriptures. This cautionary tale serves as a reminder of the potential dangers that arise from a lack of knowledge and understanding of God's Word.
