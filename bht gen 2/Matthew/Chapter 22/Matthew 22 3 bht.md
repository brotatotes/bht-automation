# Matthew 22:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The servants in the parable represent the messengers that God has sent to invite people to his kingdom and participate in the feast. The first messengers, including John the Baptist, the Twelve, and the Seventy, were the initial announcers of the Gospel, proclaiming the nearness of the Kingdom of heaven. Even Jesus himself, in his role as a servant, shared this truth with the weighty addition of inviting people to come to him. However, sadly, many refused to heed this call, a recurring theme throughout the ministry of Jesus and his disciples.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The office of these δοῦλοι was καλέσαι τοὺς κεκλημένους, to summon those who had been invited, as was customary."
2. "These first δοῦλοι are then the first messengers of the Gospel, John the Baptist, the Twelve, and the Seventy, who preached, saying 'The Kingdom of heaven is at hand.'"
3. "Even our Lord Himself must in some sort be here included, inasmuch as He μορφὴν δοὺλου ἔλαβεν, and preached this same truth, with however the weighty addition of δεῦτε πρός με."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Sent forth his servants—representing all preachers of the Gospel."
2. "Called them that were bidden—here meaning the Jews, who were 'bidden,' from the first choice of them onwards through every summons addressed to them by the prophets to hold themselves in readiness for the appearing of their King."
3. "They would not come—as the issue of the whole ministry of the Baptist, our Lord Himself, and His apostles thereafter, too sadly showed."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "These represent the messengers that God has sent to invite people to his kingdom."
2. "It appears that there were two invitations - one considerably previous to the time of the feast, that they might have opportunity to prepare for it, and the other to give notice of the precise time when they were expected."
3. "So all the difficulty that sinners ever labour under in regard to salvation is in the will. It is a fixed determination not to come and be saved."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "To call them that were bidden [καλεσαι τους κεκλημενους]. Perhaps an unconscious play on the words, lost in both A. V. and Rev., to call the called."
2. "This was according to the Oriental custom of sending a messenger, after the invitations have been issued, to notify the invited guests that the entertainment is prepared."
3. "Thus Esther invites Haman to a banquet on the morrow, and, at the actual time, the chamberlain comes to bring him to the feast (Esther 5:8; Esther 6:14)."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "His servants. In this prophetic parable, not the prophets but the first messengers of the gospel."
2. "To call them that were bidden. The Oriental custom was to invite twice: first to the feast generally ('bidden'), then to the beginning of the feast itself ('call'). Those 'bidden' were the Jews. The second invitation was a summons to expected guests, rather than an invitation. The first servants, whose message was rejected, were John the Baptist, Christ, and His disciples up to this time."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "To call them that were bidden (καλεσα τους κεκλημενους). 'Perhaps an unconscious play on the words, lost in both A.V. and Rev., to call the called' (Vincent)."
2. "The prophets of old had given God's invitation to the Jewish people. Now the Baptist and Jesus had given the second invitation that the feast was ready."
3. "This negative imperfect characterizes the stubborn refusal of the Jewish leaders to accept Jesus as God's Son (John 1:11). This is 'The Hebrew Tragedy' (Conder)."

### John Gill:
1. "And sent forth his servants,.... The ministers of the Gospel, who are the servants of the most high God, of his choosing and ordaining, of his calling and sending, and of his qualifying and employing..."
2. "This call is of grace; it springs from the free grace and favour of God, and it is effected by the mighty power of his grace; and it is to special blessings of grace; it is a fruit of God's everlasting love, and an evidence of it; and is according to the eternal purpose of God, which is never frustrated..."
3. "But besides this, there is a bare external call to the sons of men, through the preaching of the word; which is not to make their peace with God, a thing impossible to be done by them, and which is contrary to the Gospel, and reflects dishonour on Christ, the peacemaker..."

### John Wesley:
1. Them that were invited — Namely, the Jews.
