# Matthew 22:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Neither men nor women will be married in the same way as in earthly life, as this is a practice carried out by parents. After the resurrection, the relationship between married individuals will not be reestablished, as those raised up will be like angels in heaven. While they will not be incorporeal like angels, their bodies will be spiritual, without the need for sustenance through eating and drinking. So, the power of God is truly demonstrated in the incorruptibility and immortality of the redeemed.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "He does not mean that the children of God will be, in all respects, like the angels, but only so far as they shall be free from every infirmity of the present life."
2. "Now though we know that we are the children of God, yet as it doth not yet appear what we shall be, till, transformed into his glory, we shall see him as he is, we are not as yet actually reckoned to be his children."
3. "In this sense our adoption is said by Paul to be delayed till the last day."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Neither marry, spoken of the man; nor are given in marriage, of the woman, since the father gave away the bride in marriage."
2. "This relation is not to be reestablished in the state after the resurrection, because those raised up are as angels in heaven."
3. "Equality with angels in mode of existence is affirmed, but the redeemed are distinguished from them."

### John Gill:
1. "Neither the men marry wives, nor are the women given in marriage to men, which is done by their parents here, generally speaking, they having the right of disposing of children in marriage."
2. "But are as the angels of God in heaven; or, as in Luke, 'are equal unto the angels'; and which he explains their immortality: 'neither can they die any more'; no more than the angels can."
3. "they will not be incorporeal, as the angels are, but then, even their bodies will be spiritual, and in some respects, like spirits; they will not stand in any need of sustenance, by eating and drinking, any more than the angels; nor will there be any such things as marriage, and procreation of children among them, any more than among angels."

### John Wesley:
1. They are as the angels — Incorruptible and immortal. So is the power of God shown in them! So little need had they of marriage!
