# Matthew 22:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ assumes the truth of the book of Exodus, stating Have ye not read, which points to the Sadducees' particular reverence for the writings of Moses. This reference to the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Bible, serves as undeniable proof that the doctrine in question was not merely an interpretation, but was actually implied in the writings of Moses themselves.
