# Matthew 22:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disagreement between the Sadducees and the other Jews centered around the concept of resurrection. While the Sadducees denied the possibility of resurrection based on the law, the other Jews saw it as a fundamental principle. Jesus addresses this by affirming that God is the God of the living, not the dead. To emphasize his point, Jesus refers to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as still being alive, indicating that the belief in resurrection extends beyond the soul and includes the body. Thus, this passage emphasizes the eternal nature of the soul and the reality of life after death.

### John Gill:
1. "The Sadducees expressly denied, that the resurrection could be proved out of the law."
2. "Hence, in opposition to this notion of the Sadducees, the other Jews say that 'Though a man confesses and believes that the dead will be raised, yet that it is not intimated in the law, he is an heretic; since it is a fundamental point, that the resurrection of the dead is of the law.'"
3. "Thus our Lord having to do with the same sort of persons, fetches his proof of the doctrine of the resurrection out of the law, and from a passage which respects the covenant relation God stands in to his people, particularly Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and which respects not their souls only, but their bodies also, even their whole persons, body and soul."

### John Wesley:
1. "God is not the God of the dead, but of the living." 
2. "Therefore, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are not dead, but living."
3. "The soul does not die with the body."
