# Matthew 22:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A scribe, known as a Mosaic jurist specializing in the interpretation of the Law, approached Jesus with a tempting question. This question served as a test of both Jesus' wisdom and his claim to be the Son of God. The scribe sought to draw Jesus into a response that would either disprove his Messiahship or provide grounds for accusing him of blasphemy. This interaction followed the previous incident in which Jesus had silenced the Sadducees with his astute answers.
