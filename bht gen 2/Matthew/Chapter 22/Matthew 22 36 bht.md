# Matthew 22:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The question being asked is not to determine which specific commandment is the greatest, but to inquire about the kind of commandment that holds the greatest significance within the Mosaic law. The scribes and Pharisees were known for their debates and distinctions between different commandments, whether they were oral or written, and even preferred the traditions of the elders over the written law of Moses. However, Jesus cuts through their complex arguments and desires to address the heart of the matter, providing clarity amidst the multitude of opinions surrounding this topic.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1.  36.   ποία ἐντ  .   μεγ  . ] Not, ‘  which is the great commandment ,’ but  which (  what kind of a )  commandment is great in the law? In Mark, otherwise.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Which is the great commandment [ποια εντολη μεγαλη]. The A. V. and Rev. alike miss the point of this question, which is: which kind of command is great in the law?"
2. "Not, which commandment is greatest as compared with the others? The scribes declared that there were 248 affirmative precepts, as many as the members of the human body; and 365 negative precepts, as many as the days in the year; the total being 613, the number of letters in the Decalogue."
3. "It was in view of this kind of distinction that the scribe asked the question; not as desiring a declaration as to which commandment was greatest, but as wanting to know the principle upon which a commandment was to be regarded as a great commandment."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "What commandment is great in the law?" i.e., the Mosaic law. Not merely greater than the rest, but ‘great,’ as including the rest. Comp. Matthew 22:38; Matthew 22:40.
	
2. If there was a reference to the disputes of the Rabbins about great and small commandments, the meaning would be: ‘What kind of a commandment is great in the law?’ but this sense, though literally correct, does not suit the answer so well.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The positive adjective is sometimes as high in rank as the superlative."
2. "But Jesus cuts through such pettifogging hair-splitting to the heart of the problem."

### John Gill:
1. "The question is not which of the laws was the greatest, the oral, or the written law: the Jews give the preference to the law delivered by word of mouth; they prefer the traditions of the elders before the written law of Moses."
2. "It was moved that it might be said which was the greatest and weightiest of them all."
3. "In this multiplicity of opinions, Christ's is desired on this subject, though with no good intention."
