# Matthew 22:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This demand for our supreme affection is found in Deuteronomy 6:5. It calls us to love the Lord our God with all our heart, soul, and mind. This means loving Him with the entirety of our being, including our will, understanding, and affections. Our love for God should be sincere, upright, and perfect, free from any hypocrisy or pretense. It is a love that goes beyond all other objects of our affection, as we deeply acknowledge and respond to God's everlasting and unchanging love for us.
