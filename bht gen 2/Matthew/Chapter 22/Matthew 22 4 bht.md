# Matthew 22:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The dinner of the kingdom of heaven is prepared with rich provisions for all. The Gospel dispensation offers a grand feast, filled with a variety of spiritual nourishment for different people. In comparison, the privileges enjoyed by the patriarchs and prophets, as well as the people of Israel, were like a small breakfast, lacking the abundance and richness of the Gospel. The ministry of the word and ordinances under the new covenant provides both milk for the babes in Christ and meat for the mature believers, catering to the needs of each according to their spiritual growth.

### John Calvin:
