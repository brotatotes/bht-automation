# Matthew 22:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The teachings of the Old Testament, whether from the law or the writings of the prophets, can be summed up in two main principles: our duty to God and our duty to other people. While not every aspect of the Old Testament can be reduced to these two precepts, everything related to our moral obligations can be encompassed by them. Love is the essence of the law, and the prophets' writings serve to explain and elaborate on this principle. All the commandments and teachings are consistent with and dependent on these two foundational concepts.
