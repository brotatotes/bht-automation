# Matthew 22:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus puts the Pharisees to the test by asking them about the Messiah as a descendant of David, knowing that the Scriptures clearly spoke of such a person. Some may find it difficult to answer this question, revealing that they do not have any thoughts of Christ. However, for those who have faith and believe in Him, Christ is precious, filling them with joy and glory beyond words.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "God having so frequently promised that Christ would proceed from the seed, or from the loins of David, this conviction was so deeply rooted in their minds, that they could not endure to have him stripped of human nature."
2. "Satan therefore permitted Christ to be acknowledged as a true man and a son of David, for he would in vain have attempted to overturn this article of faith; but—what was worse—he stripped him of his Divinity, as if he had been only one of the ordinary descendants of Adam."
3. "For as the weakness of the flesh, by which he approached to us, gives us confidence, that we may not hesitate to draw near to him, so if that weakness alone were before our eyes, it would rather fill us with fear and despair than excite proper confidence."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Pharisees included the acknowledged interpreters of the Old Testament. Our Lord would prove the insufficiency of their interpretation on a point which they rightly deemed of most importance."
2. "What they thought of Him, He does not ask them. Since He has been abundantly proven to be ‘the Christ,’ the question comes to us in this form, as an all-important one. One answer only can be correct."
3. "On this one-sided view of the Messiah, as a descendant of David, the king and warrior, their false political false hopes had been based."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Messiah, of course, not Christ as a proper name of Jesus."
2. "By his pungent question about the Messiah as David's son and Lord he really touches the problem of his Person (his Deity and his Humanity)."
3. "They were unable to answer."

### John Gill:
1. "He knew, that he was so plainly spoken of in the writings of the Old Testament, which they had in their hands, that they could not be ignorant, that such a person was prophesied of."
2. "If this question was put to some persons, it would appear, that they have no thoughts of Christ at all."
3. "Faith is a good thought of Christ; to them that believe, he is precious; and such, through believing in him, are filled with joy unspeakable, and full of glory."

### John Wesley:
1. Luke 20:41.
