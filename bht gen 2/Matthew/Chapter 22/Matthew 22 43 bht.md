# Matthew 22:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If Jesus is just a human descendant of David, then how could David, under divine inspiration, call him Lord? This question challenges the Pharisees' limited understanding of Jesus' identity and points to a higher nature and purpose beyond mere lineage. The inspiration of the Holy Spirit guided David in his recognition of Christ's divine authority - a truth that the Pharisees failed to grasp. Their attempt to entrap Jesus through questioning is now thwarted, revealing their inability to comprehend the profound significance of David's declaration.
