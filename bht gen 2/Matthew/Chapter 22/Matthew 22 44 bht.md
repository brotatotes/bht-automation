## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "Whatever may be the madness of men, all that they shall dare to contrive will be of no avail for destroying the kingdom of Christ, which has been set up, not by the will of men, but by the appointment of God, and therefore is supported by everlasting strength."
2. "This phrase is used metaphorically for the second or next rank, which is occupied by Godâ€™s deputy. And therefore it signifies, to hold the highest government and power in the name of God, as we know that God has committed his authority to his only-begotten Son, so as to govern his Church by his agency."
3. "And God declares that Christ will sit till his enemies be subdued, in order to inform us that his kingdom will remain invincible against every attack."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "My lordâ€™ implies superiority, not only to David himself, but to his own royal race and the people of Israel, or the inquiry would not cause perplexity."
2. "Sit thou at my right hand (the place of honor and trust and power), till I put thine enemies underneath thy feet (until He is complete victor)."
3. "This refers to an exaltation, exceeding any attainable by a mere man; and to a triumph beyond any political one. The latter thought opposes the false hopes of the Jews, while the whole passage shows the superhuman exaltation of the Messiah."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'my Lord', the person spoken to, the Messiah is designed, who was David's 'Adon', or Lord, by right both of creation and redemption."
2. "The words said unto him are, sit thou on my right hand; which is a figurative phrase, and expressive of the exaltation, dignity, power, and authority of the Messiah."
3. "That these words were spoken of the Messiah, and therefore pertinently cited, and properly applied to him, by Jesus, is evident from the silence of the Pharisees."

### John Wesley:
1. "This his dominion, to which David himself was subject, shows both the heavenly majesty of the king, and the nature of his kingdom."
2. "Sit thou on my right hand â€” That is, remain in the highest authority and power."
