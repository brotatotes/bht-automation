# Matthew 22:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The question posed challenges the Pharisees to reconcile the Messiah's identity as both the Son of David and the Son of God. The Pharisees' flawed understanding prevents them from answering, for they fail to grasp the true nature of the Messiah. By claiming to be both the Son of David and the Son of God, Jesus asserts his divinity. This confrontation serves to elicit a confession or silence the Pharisees, exposing the profound truth of Jesus' claim and leaving them unable to form a rebuttal. Understanding the Messiah's dual identity is key to comprehending the solution.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "The solution is not given here; but plainly preached by the Apostles from the day of Pentecost: the Messiah was Son of David according to the flesh, yet the preexistent eternal Son of God: the God-man." 
2. "Our Lordâ€™s claims involved this: He had been called the â€˜Son of David;â€™ He had claimed to be the Son of God some time before (John 10:24-38), and they afterwards accused Him of so doing."
3. "They at least knew what His solution was, and that He claimed to be both â€˜Son of Davidâ€™ and â€˜Lord.â€™"

### John Gill:
1. "The question is to be answered upon true and just notions of the Messiah, but unanswerable upon the principles of the Pharisees."
2. "Had they understood and owned the proper divinity of the Messiah, they might have answered, that as he was God, he was David's Lord, his maker, and his king; and, as man, was David's son, and so both his root and offspring."
3. "This our Lord meant to bring them to a confession of, or put them to confusion and silence, which was the consequence."
