# Matthew 22:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Pharisaical Judaism and Christ had a permanent separation when faced with this particular situation. The Pharisees, unwilling to acknowledge the divinity of the Messiah or admit their ignorance, chose to remain silent instead. Consequently, they ceased questioning Jesus, not seeking to trap or deceive him any further.
