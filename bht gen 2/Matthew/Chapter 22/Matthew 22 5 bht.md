# Matthew 22:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The attitude depicted in the passage reflects a lack of value and importance placed on the invitation presented to them. The individuals involved not only neglected it, but they also prioritized their own personal interests and material pursuits over spiritual matters. This serves as a reminder of the potential dangers and consequences that can arise when we choose to prioritize worldly affairs over the things of God.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 5. But they made light of it, and
	went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "But they made light of it - Treated it with contempt, as a thing of no consequence - an exact representation of the conduct of sinners in regard to the gospel."
2. "One to his farm - So people are engaged so much in their worldly employment that they pretend they have no time to attend to religion. The world is, in their view, of more value than God."
3. "Merchandise - Traffic; trading."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Made light of it [αμελησαντες] . Not in the sense of jeering. They simply gave it no heed."
2. "His farm [ιδιον αγρον] . Rev., his own farm; bringing out the contrast between his selfish interest and the respect due to his king."
3. "Compare 2 Chronicles 30:10."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ pronounces the Jews to have been so entirely devoted to the world and to earthly things, that no man found leisure to approach to God."
2. "The cares of this world...are so many impediments in our way to keep us back from the kingdom of God."
3. "It deserves our attention, that ungodly men hold out fair pretences for rejecting the grace of God; as if their indolence might be excused, because they are entirely occupied with the affairs of the present life, and care little about a heavenly inheritance."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "All had a guilty contempt for the invitation which was manifested however in two distinct forms: Some went away, in indifferent worldliness; others became persecutors of the messengers."
2. "Many refer 'made light of it' to the indifferent class alone, but the other view is more grammatical. All modes of rejecting the gospel, even persecution, are really making light of it."
3. "Worldliness is here represented by the two leading occupations of men. The application is, primarily, to the irreligious and careless Jewish people; then to all such in any age."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Made light of it (αμελησαντες). Literally, neglecting, not caring for. They may even have ridiculed the invitation, but the verb does not say so. However, to neglect an invitation to a wedding feast is a gross discourtesy."
2. "One to his own farm (ος μεν εις τον ιδιον αγρον) or field, another to his merchandise (ος δε επ την εμποριαν αυτου) only example in the N.T., from εμπορος, merchant, one who travels for traffic (εμπορευομα), a drummer."

### John Gill:
1. "They neglected the ministry of the Gospel; they did not care for it, nor showed any regard to it."
2. "The Gospel and the ordinances of it are looked upon as things of no importance; not knowing the real worth and value of them."
3. "The things they were invited to were such as concerned their immortal souls, and the spiritual and eternal welfare of them; in short, it was no other than the great salvation, wrought out by the great God, and our Saviour, for great sinners, at the expense of his blood and life, which they neglected."

### John Wesley:
1. One to his farm, another to his merchandise — One must mind what he has; another, gain what he wants. How many perish by misusing lawful things!
