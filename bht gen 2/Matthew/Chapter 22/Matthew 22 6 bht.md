# Matthew 22:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Some sinners neglect religion, while others actively oppose it with harsh words and threats. They not only disregard the message but also mistreat and abuse those who bring it. Their malice can escalate to the point of taking the lives of those messengers. This progression from indifference to hostility is a common pattern, with indifference often leading to outright opposition.
