# Matthew 22:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The king, in his anger and grief, sent forth the Roman armies as the instruments of his wrath to punish the unbelieving and obstinate Jews. Their city, once the city of the Great King, became their city as it was left desolate. This serves as a stern warning that those who reject the Gospel and persecute its messengers can expect a judgment far worse than the destruction of Jerusalem.
