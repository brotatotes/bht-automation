# Matthew 22:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The wedding feast, representing the Gospel dispensation, was prepared and ready, but those originally invited were not considered worthy due to their disrespectful treatment of the gracious invitation. These individuals not only lacked personal worthiness, but also behaved inappropriately towards the invitation. They contradicted and blasphemed it, clearly demonstrating their unworthiness. As a result, the approach was altered, and others were invited from the by-ways and turnings of the road, illustrating the inclusive nature of the Gospel message.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthyâ€”for how should those be deemed worthy to sit down at His table who had affronted Him by their treatment of His gracious invitation?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. Matthew 22:8.  Not worthy. Compare Paulâ€™s language to the Jews at Antioch in Pisidia (Acts 13:46): â€˜judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life.â€™
	

### John Gill:
1. "the marriage feast, or the Gospel dispensation, which was ushered in, and the ministry of it, to which nothing was wanting; all the promises, prophecies, types, and shadows, of the former dispensation, were now accomplished"
2. "they were not only unworthy in themselves, as all men are, of such a blessing and privilege, but they behaved towards it in a very unworthy manner"
3. "they contradicted and blasphemed it, and by their own outrageous carriage, showed plainly that they were unworthy of it"

### John Wesley:
1. Go into the highways â€” The word properly signifies, the by-ways, or turnings of the road.
