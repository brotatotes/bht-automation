# Matthew 22:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Go therefore into the highways, the outlets and thoroughfares where humans are to be found. As you go, invite the despised and undeserving sinners, those who have nothing to recommend them to God's favor, to the joyous celebration of His grace. And as you come across them, bid them to the marriage feast, urging them to attend the Gospel ministry and partake in the ordinances of God.
