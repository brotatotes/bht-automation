# Matthew 23:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Lest the people, upon witnessing the ignorance and errors of the religious leaders, become disillusioned and abandon their faith, Jesus spoke to both the crowds and his disciples, teaching them not to disregard religion entirely. He cautioned his disciples against blindly following the teachers, urging them to be discerning and not succumb to the vices of these leaders, such as their pride, hypocrisy, covetousness, and cruelty. By doing so, Jesus showed that he was not an opponent of the Law, but rather someone who desired to uphold it correctly and faithfully.
