# Matthew 23:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Leaders in the church have the responsibility of guiding and directing believers towards Christ by setting an example in their words, actions, faith, and purity. They are to lead according to the teachings of God's word, not their own interpretations, and teach others to follow the commands and ordinances of Christ, not human traditions. Ultimately, their role is to point people to Christ as the one Lord and the head of the church, emphasizing the unity of faith and baptism in Him.
