# Matthew 23:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The true observance of a precept is not simply about following its letter, but rather about embodying its spirit through sincere service. In the Church, the highest honor does not come from positions of authority, but from the humble act of serving others. As Christians, we are called to not only desire brotherly fellowship on an equal footing under our heavenly Father but also to use our gifts and grace in service to others.
