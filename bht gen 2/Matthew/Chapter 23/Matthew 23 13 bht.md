# Matthew 23:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus delivers a stern reproof to the scribes and Pharisees, who are condemned for shutting up the kingdom of heaven and obstructing the path for others. They not only fail to enter the kingdom themselves but also hinder those who wish to enter. Their false teachings and hypocritical practices obscure the simple gospel and prevent people from embracing the truth. This tragic situation serves as a cautionary tale for all preachers and teachers of the kingdom of God to ensure that they do not become stumbling blocks, but rather open the door to eternal life for those seeking it.
