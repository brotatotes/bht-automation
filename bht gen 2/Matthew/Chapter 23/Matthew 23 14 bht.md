# Matthew 23:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For they sold their prayers in exactly the same manner as hirelings dispose of their daily labor. They claimed a very exact knowledge of the law and a perfect observance of it, while preying on widows and taking advantage of the helpless condition of those who trusted them. But God will not be mocked; therefore, they shall receive the greater condemnation for their greed and hypocrisy. This serves as a cautionary reminder that true piety is not measured by outward shows of religious observance but by genuine compassion and righteousness towards others.
