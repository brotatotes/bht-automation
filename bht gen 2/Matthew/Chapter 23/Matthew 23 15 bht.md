# Matthew 23:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The scribes and Pharisees were zealous in their efforts to make converts, going to great lengths to win them over. However, their motives were not genuine or pure. Their goal was not to guide these proselytes towards true righteousness, but rather to incorporate them into a corrupt system. In doing so, they ended up making these converts even more depraved and condemned than themselves, exacerbating their own guilt and judgment.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Lord speaks not here of those pious God-fearing men who were found dwelling among the Jews but of the proselytes of righteousness who took on the whole Jewish law and its observances."
2. "For what could such a proselyte become? A disciple of hypocrisy, neither a sincere heathen nor a sincere Jew - doubly the child of hell, condemned by the religion which he had left and condemned again by that which he had taken."
3. "These proselytes were rare, and it was to their credit that they were."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte...and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves." 
2. "condemned, for the hypocrisy he would learn to practice, both by the religion he left and that he embraced."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Ye compass sea and land - You take every means, spare no pains, to gain proselytes."
2. "Twofold more the child of hell - That is, twice as bad. To be a child of hell was a Hebrew phrase, signifying to be deserving of hell, to be awfully wicked."
3. "The Pharisees gained them either to swell their own numbers, or to make gain by extorting their money under various pretences; and when they had accomplished that, they took no pains to instruct them or to restrain them."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ declares... they more and more provoke the vengeance of God." (15)
2. "As it was a holy and excellent work to gain disciples to God, so to allure the Gentiles to the Jewish worship... was nothing else than to hurry them from Scylla to Charybdis." (15)
3. "The monks... diligent in culling proselytes from every quarter, but those proselytes, from being lascivious and debauched persons, they render altogether devils... it would corrupt even the heavenly angels." (99)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Shutting the kingdom of heaven in the faces of their own people (Matthew 23:13), the Pharisees yet sought proselytes among the heathen."
2. "Real missionary effort was contrary to the spirit of the Pharisees, indicating too high an estimate of the Gentiles."
3. "'Proselytes' generally become more extreme than their teachers. In this case they would become Pharisees, rather than Jews, lacking even the remnant of good in their teachers."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is a convert to Pharisaism rather than Judaism that is meant by 'one proselyte'... There were two kinds of proselytes: of the gate, of righteousness."
2. "The Pharisaic missionary zeal was a comparative failure. And success was even worse, Jesus says with pitiless plainness."
3. "The Pharisees claimed to be in a special sense sons of the kingdom... They were more partisan than pious."

### John Gill:
1. "Woe unto you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites....for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte." 
2. "The making a proselyte was reckoned a very great action, and is ascribed to the patriarchs Abraham and Jacob, and made equal to creation."
3. "And when he is made, ye make him two fold more the child of hell than yourselves."
