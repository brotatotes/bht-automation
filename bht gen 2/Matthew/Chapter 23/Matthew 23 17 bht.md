# Matthew 23:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage highlights the folly of elevating the significance of gold over the temple. According to the insights shared, the gold is made holy by the temple, as sanctification is the act of making something holy. Consequently, it is illogical to consider oaths made by the gold of the temple as more sacred than oaths made by the temple itself. This serves as a rebuke to the blind Pharisees, whose minds are clouded by their greed and ignorance. They fail to grasp that true sanctity originates from the presence of God within the temple.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "The temple that sanctifieth the gold - To sanctify is to make holy."
2. "The gold had no holiness but what it derived from the temple."
3. "It was foolish, then, to suppose that [the gold] was more holy than the temple, from which it received all the sanctity which it possessed."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Fools and blind. The distinction was foolish and false, revealing the character of those making it."
2. "The temple that hath sanctified the gold. Any sanctity in the gold came from the temple, and the sanctity of the temple came from God."
3. "No inanimate thing can witness an oath. Hence Matthew 23:20-22 declare that every oath is an oath by God. Pharisees reversed the order of the hallowed things. Their casuistry is rebuked, but neither of the oaths is sanctioned."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Ye fools (ŒºœâœÅŒø). In Matthew 5:22 Jesus had warned against calling a man ŒºœâœÅŒøœÇ in a rage, but here he so terms the blind Pharisees for their stupidity."
2. "It shows that not the word but the spirit in which it is uttered is what matters" (McNeile).

### John Gill:
1. "Who must be stupid and sottish to the last degree, and their minds foolishly blinded with avarice."
2. "The temple was sanctified by the presence of God in it; and the gold sanctified by the temple, being devoted to the service of it."
3. "It must be most extravagantly ridiculous and foolish in them, to make oaths by the gold of the temple, and gifts dedicated to its service, and on that score sanctified by it, more binding and sacred than such as were by the temple itself."
