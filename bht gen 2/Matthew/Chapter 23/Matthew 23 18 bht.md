# Matthew 23:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who swore by the altar in the temple believed that their oaths were not sinful or binding. However, Jesus exposes this faulty understanding, emphasizing that their focus should not be on the gift offered on the altar, but on the sacredness and authority of the altar itself. By swearing by the gift rather than by God, they were guilty of perjury and obligated to fulfill their oath. Jesus reminds us that our focus should always be on honoring the sacred and not on the material offerings or gifts that may accompany it.
