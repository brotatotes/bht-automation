# Matthew 23:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Matthew 23:19, Jesus addresses the blind and challenges their understanding of the sanctification of offerings. He explains how the altar plays a vital role in transforming a common gift into a holy one by its presence and consecration. Jesus adeptly employs the language and reasoning of the law and traditions to refute their erroneous teachings. His assertion that the altar holds greater significance further discredits the Pharisees' misguided beliefs.
