# Matthew 23:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The scribes, as appointed teachers of the law, fulfill the role of sitting in the seat of Moses, reading and explaining the divine teachings. Their authority to teach should be respected, but their conduct should not be imitated. Christians should not presume to sit in the seat of Christ, as that position is reserved for Him alone. It is important to heed the teachings of the scribes while being cautious of conforming to their conduct. Instead, we are to adhere to the teachings of Christ and recognize the authority of those who interpret and teach His Word.
