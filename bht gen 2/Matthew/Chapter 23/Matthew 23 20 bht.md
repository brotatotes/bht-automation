# Matthew 23:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus speaks about swearing by the altar, it is clear that he does not condone such oaths. Swearing by the altar, the temple, or even by heaven is disapproved by Christ elsewhere in the Bible. However, it is important to understand that when someone swears by the altar, they are also swearing by all the gifts and offerings placed upon it, as well as everything that is connected to the altar. The act of swearing by the altar is seen as an implicit appeal to God, as all oaths by creatures ultimately acknowledge His authority.
