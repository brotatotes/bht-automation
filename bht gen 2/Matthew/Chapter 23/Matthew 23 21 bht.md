# Matthew 23:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The temple is not just a physical structure, but a dwelling place for God Himself. This is evident in the visible symbol of the cloud resting on the mercy seat, through which God manifested Himself. An oath made by the temple should be regarded as sacred and binding because it is essentially an oath made by God. However, the Pharisees in this passage have lost sight of the true significance of the temple, forgetting its purpose and meaning.
