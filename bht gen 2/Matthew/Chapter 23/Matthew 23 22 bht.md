# Matthew 23:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Heaven is the glorious throne of God, the place where he sits in splendor and majesty. When we swear by anything that is connected to God, it is essentially swearing by God himself and should be regarded as binding. It is futile to swear by inanimate objects or any creation, as our appeals should only be made to God, who knows and examines the depths of our hearts. These verses in Matthew remind us not just of the prohibition against swearing falsely, but also the importance of living a life of truthfulness in both our words and actions.
