# Matthew 23:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our Lord teaches that the Pharisees were meticulous about observing external matters, such as tithing and following traditions, but neglected the more important aspects of the law, such as justice and fidelity. Jesus emphasizes the importance of upholding the entire law, not just certain parts of it. This reminds us that true religion encompasses both external actions and internal attitudes, and that our faith should be demonstrated through righteous living and treating others with fairness and integrity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "They grounded this practice on Leviticus 27:30, which they interpreted rigidly. Our Lord purposely names the most trifling products of the earth as examples of what they punctiliously exacted the tenth of." 
2. "[Jesus] makes all acceptable religion to consist of three elements—'doing justly, loving mercy, and walking humbly with our God'; which third element presupposes and comprehends both the 'faith' of Matthew and the 'love' of Luke."
3. "There is no need for one set of duties to jostle out another; but it is to be carefully noted that of the greater duties our Lord says, 'Ye ought to have done' them, while of the lesser He merely says, 'Ye ought not to leave them undone.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "How much more mild and gentle are the laws of Christianity under which we live!"
2. "Our Saviour says that they were precise in doing small matters which the law had not expressly commanded, while they omitted the greater things which it had enjoined."
3. "Attention to even the smallest points of the law of God is proper, but it should not interfere with the 'higher' and more important parts of that law."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Tithe is tenth; also in older English, tethe, as tethe hest, the tenth commandment."
2. "A tething was a district containing ten families."
3. "The tithe of these plants would be very small; but to exact it would indicate scrupulous conscientiousness."

### John Calvin:
1. "Hence he infers that they overturn the natural order who employ themselves in the smallest matters, when they ought rather to have begun with the principal points; for tithes were only a kind of appendage."
2. "It is therefore our duty to preserve entire the whole Law, which cannot be violated in any part without contempt for its Author; for He who has forbidden us to commit adultery, and to kill, and to steal, has likewise condemned all impure desire."
3. "Hence we conclude that all the commandments are so interwoven with each other, that we have no right to detach one of them from the rest."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Left undone the weightier matters. A striking and distinctive feature of Pharisaism. Scrupulous attention to some regulation of dress, of meat and drink, of outward observance, is often joined with an utter neglect of humility, faith, and charity."
2. "Of the law. Comp. Micah 6:8; Hosea 12:6; Isaiah 1:17."
3. "These ye ought, etc. First, the ‘weightier matters;’ then the lesser ones can be done in the right spirit. Our Lord does not decide the question of minute tithes, but teaches that if, having fulfilled the great duties, their consciences led them to this, not to leave it undone. Faithfulness in what is great, never leads to neglect of what is least. But attention first of all to what is least, leads to neglect of what is great."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Talmud tells of the ass of a certain Rabbi which had been so well trained as to refuse corn of which the tithes had not been taken" (Vincent).
2. "Jesus does not condemn tithing. What he does condemn is doing it to the neglect of the weightier matters" (τα βαρυτερα).
3. "The Pharisees were externalists; cf. Luke 11:39-44."

### John Gill:
1. "They were very strict in observing some outward things, which gave them credit with the people, and especially the priests and Levites, some little trifling ceremonies and traditions of their elders, whilst they neglected internal religion, and those things which were of the greatest moment and importance."
2. "The distinction of the commandments of the law into lighter and heavier, or weightier, to which Christ here refers, is frequent with the Jews."
3. "Christ instances in the weightier matters of both tables of the law, which these men neglected, and the latter, as well as the former; not believing the revelation of the Gospel, nor the Messiah, who was promised, and prophesied of by God, in the writings of the Old Testament."

### John Wesley:
1. Judgment — That is, justice: Faith - The word here means fidelity.
