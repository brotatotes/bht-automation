# Matthew 23:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These blind guides meticulously strain out the tiniest insects from their drinks, showing great concern for minor details. Yet, they neglect the weightier matters of justice, mercy, and faithfulness. Their focus on minor matters while disregarding more significant issues is akin to straining out a gnat and swallowing a camel. They appear pious by following ceremonial laws but lack true righteousness and love for God. Such hypocrisy is evident in their actions, as they prioritize the trivial and neglect matters of true importance. Their misguided priorities reveal their lack of understanding and the emptiness of their religious practices.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Ye blind guides, which strain out... lest unawares they should drink down some little unclean insect therein and thus transgress."
2. "It was the custom... as the Buddhists do now in Ceylon and Hindustan... and to this custom of theirs our Lord here refers."
3. "The largest animal the Jews knew, as the 'gnat' was the smallest; both were by the law unclean."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "You Jews take great pains to avoid offence in very small matters, superstitiously observing the smallest points of the law, like a man carefully straining out the animalculae from what he drinks, while you are at no pains to avoid great sins - hypocrisy, deceit, oppression, and lust - like a man who should swallow a camel."
2. "The gnat has its origin in the water; not in great rivers, but in pools and marshes. In the stagnant waters, they appear in the form of small 'grubs' or 'larvae.'"
3. "It is used here to denote a very small matter, as a camel is to denote a large object."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Strain at is an old misprint perpetuated. Hence the Rev. correctly, as Tynd., strain out."
2. "Insects were ceremonially unclean, so that the Jews strained their wine in order not to swallow any unclean animal."
3. "Moreover, there were certain insects which bred in wine."

### John Calvin:
1. "They act as absurdly as if a man were to strain out a small crumb of bread, and to swallow a whole loaf."
2. "For while they pass by judgment, mercy, and faith, and even tear in pieces the whole Law, they are excessively rigid and severe in matters that are of no great importance."
3. "While in this way they pretend to kiss the feet of God, they proudly spit in his face."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Strain out the gnat, i.e., to filter wine, so as to avoid swallowing a gnat."
2. "And swallow the camel, i.e., indulge in the greatest impurities."
3. "The reality of Pharisaic sin exceeds the figure."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Strain out the gnat. By filtering through, not the 'straining at' in swallowing so crudely suggested by the misprint in the A.V." 
2. "Swallow the camel. Gulping or drinking down the camel. An oriental hyperbole like that in Matthew 19:24."
3. "Both insects and camels were ceremonially unclean. 'He that kills a flea on the Sabbath is as guilty as if he killed a camel.'"

### John Gill:
1. "To strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel, became at length a proverb, to signify much solicitude about little things, and none about greater."
2. "These men would not, on any consideration, be guilty of such a crime, as not to pay the tithe of mint, anise, and cummin, and such like herbs and seeds; and yet made no conscience of doing justice, and showing mercy to men, or of exercising faith in God, or love to him."
3. "Just as many hypocrites, like them, make a great stir, and would appear very conscientious and scrupulous, about some little trifling things, and yet stick not, at other times, to commit the grossest enormities, and most scandalous sins in life."

### John Wesley:
1. "Ye blind guides, who teach others to do as you do yourselves, to strain out a gnat - From the liquor they are going to drink!"
2. "It is strange, that glaring false print, strain at a gnat, which quite alters the sense, should run through all the editions of our English Bibles."
