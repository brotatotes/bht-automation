# Matthew 23:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus rebuked the religious leaders, exposing their hypocrisy. While they focused on external appearances and observance of religious traditions, their hearts were filled with greed and indulgence. Jesus used the metaphor of cleaning the outside of a cup and dish, while leaving the inside dirty. Their actions conveyed a false sense of holiness, masking the reality of their dishonest practices. This serves as a warning against prioritizing outward rituals without genuine inner transformation. We should strive for integrity, ensuring that our actions align with our beliefs, both inwardly and outwardly.
