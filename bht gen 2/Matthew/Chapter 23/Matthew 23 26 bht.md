# Matthew 23:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The religious leaders of the time were hypocritical, for while they honored the prophets by building their tombs, they failed to follow their teachings or live out their examples. They focused on external displays of reverence, but neglected the internal transformation and obedience that was required. Their actions were empty and devoid of the true heart of worship.

2. "A remarkable example this of our Lord's power of drawing the most striking illustrations of great truths from the most familiar objects and incidents in life." 
3. "As the greed of these hypocrites was one of the most prominent features of their character, our Lord bids them exemplify the opposite character, and then their outside, ruled by this, would be beautiful in the eye of God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Cleanse first that which is within the cup and the platter - Let them be filled with the fruits of honest industry, and then the outside and the inside will be really 'clean.'"
2. "By this allusion to the cup and platter he taught them that it was necessary to cleanse the heart first, that the external conduct might be really pure and holy."

3. "The great concern of all men should be, inward purity; that their hearts be purified by faith in the blood of Christ, and sprinkled from an evil conscience by the same; that principles of grace and holiness be formed in them by the Spirit of God; and then their outward lives and conversations being influenced thereby, will be honourable and agreeable to their professions."

### John Wesley:
1. Ye build the tombs of the prophets — And that is all, for ye neither observe their sayings, nor imitate their actions.
