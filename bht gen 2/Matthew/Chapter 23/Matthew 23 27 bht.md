# Matthew 23:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, were men of influence who were repeatedly called out by Jesus. They were compared to whitewashed tombs, marked with lime to be easily seen and avoided by priests, Nazarites, and travelers. Outwardly, they appeared beautiful and pristine, but within, they were filled with decay and filth, like rotting corpses. This vivid imagery illustrates the hypocrisy and defilement that characterized their hearts despite their outward righteousness.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like whited sepulchres... which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness." 
2. "Ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets... convicting themselves daily of as exact a resemblance in spirit and character to the very classes over whose deeds they pretended to mourn, as child to parent."
3. "Ye are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over them are not aware of them... the plausible exterior of the Pharisees kept people from perceiving the pollution they contracted from coming in contact with such corrupt characters."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The graves are kept clean and white as snow, a very striking emblem of those painted hypocrites, the Pharisees, beautiful without, but full of dead men’s bones and of all uncleanness within."
2. "Thus 'whited,' they appeared beautiful; but within they contained the bones and corrupting bodies of the dead."
3. "Their outward conduct appeared well, but their hearts were full of hypocrisy, envy, pride, lust, and malice - suitably represented by the corruption within a whited tomb."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Gill:
1. "Woe unto you Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites,.... It is much these men could bear to hear themselves so often called by this name; and it shows great courage in our Lord, so freely to reprove them, and expose their wickedness, who were men of so much credit and influence with the people."
2. "For ye are like unto whited sepulchres; or 'covered with lime', as the Syriac, Arabic, and Persic versions, render it. For the Jews used to mark their graves with white lime, that they might be known: that so priests, Nazarites, and travellers, might avoid them, and not be polluted with them."
3. "Which indeed appear beautiful outward; especially at a distance, and when new marked: but within are full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness; worms and rottenness, which arise from the putrefied carcasses, and are very nauseous and defiling."
