# Matthew 23:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Beware of the treacherous nature of appearances. The danger lies in the faÃ§ade of righteousness, masking the corruption within. Like beautiful sepulchers, these individuals may appear pure from the outside, but their hearts remain impure. Their hypocrisy contaminates not only themselves but also those who are deceived by their false piety. This serves as a reminder that true righteousness is not about putting on a show for others, but stems from a genuine devotion to God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "Your heart is not a temple of the living God, but a grave of pestilent corruption: not a heaven, but a hell."
2. "Hypocrisy is the whitewash. Iniquity, literally meaning 'lawlessness;' their outward righteousness was put on, their hearts were really opposed to God's law."
3. "As in the case of the sepulchres, such persons are not only impure themselves but contaminate others; the more easily from the false outward appearance."

### John Gill:
1. "By reason of these things they looked like whited sepulchres, outwardly beautiful: so these appeared outwardly righteous, they looked like righteous persons, and were not."
2. "But this outward show and appearance of righteousness was only 'unto men', not unto God."
3. "What our Lord charges these men with is owned by their own doctors; they say that 'the iniquity of those that were under the first temple was open and manifest, but the iniquity of those that were under the second temple was not open'."
