# Matthew 23:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These verses convey Jesus's criticism towards the Pharisees for their hypocritical actions. They built monuments for the prophets, whom their forefathers had killed, and adorned the tombs of the righteous, all to gain favor and appear righteous in the eyes of others. However, Jesus exposes their hypocrisy, stating that their actions are not out of genuine respect for the prophets, but rather an attempt to convince others of their innocence and holiness. It is important to note that Jesus's words here are directed not only at the Pharisees but at the entire Jewish nation.

2. "Now our Lord must not be understood as blaming them for barely building the tombs of the prophets, and garnishing the sepulchres of the righteous, which they might have done without blame. But because they did all this, that they might be thought to be very innocent and holy men, and far from being guilty of the crimes their forefathers were."
3. "The sepulchres of the prophets were especially very sacred. 'All sepulchres might be removed, but the sepulchres of a king, and the sepulchres of a prophet'; they say unto him, were not the sepulchres of the sons of David removed? and the sepulchres of the sons of Huldah were in Jerusalem, and a man might not touch them, to remove them forever."
