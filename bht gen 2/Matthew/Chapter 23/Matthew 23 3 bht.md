# Matthew 23:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Their teachings are to be observed and followed, as long as they align with the commandments of the law. They hold the authority as successors of Moses but their actions should not be imitated or taken as an example. Their official position and knowledge may be respected, but it is important to be cautious of their hypocrisy and inconsistency. The focus should be on upholding the law of God rather than blindly following the actions of these religious leaders.

### Henry Alford:
1. "Because they sit on Moses' seat: and this clears the meaning, and shews it to be, 'all things which they, as successors of Moses, out of his law, command you to observe, do;'" 
2. "There being a distinction between their lawful teaching as expounders of the law, and their frivolous traditions superadded thereto, and blamed below."
3. "Do, as occasion arises. Observe, having respect to them as a constant rule of conduct. The present binds on the habitual practice to the mere momentary act of the aorist."

2. "He who denounced the traditions of such teachers cannot have meant here to throw His shield over these."
3.

### Albert Barnes:

2. "The interpretation which they give to the law is in the main correct, but their lives do not correspond with their teaching."
