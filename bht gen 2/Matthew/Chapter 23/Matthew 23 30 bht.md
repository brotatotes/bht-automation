# Matthew 23:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They claimed that they would not have been partakers with their fathers in the blood of the prophets, but their smooth words and actions testified against them, revealing that they were truly the children of those who killed the prophets. In Matthew 23:3-30, Jesus exposes the pretense of religion that keeps people from entering the kingdom of God and attaining true Christian virtues. It is a deception, with a facade of piety and virtue, masking the depths of hypocrisy and wickedness.
