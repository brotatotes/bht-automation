# Matthew 23:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, it becomes evident that the individuals are not only aware of their ancestors' role in the killing of the prophets, but they are also trying to distance themselves from any culpability. However, their attempts to shift the blame onto others are futile, as their own conscience bears witness to their hypocrisy. Their actions, or lack thereof, reveal that they possess the same spirit and would have acted similarly in those circumstances. The focus here lies on their own self-awareness, as their words and behaviors betray their true nature.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "Ye be witnesses unto yourselves - The emphasis, here, lies in the words 'to yourselves.' It is an appeal to their conscience."
2. "It was not by their building the tombs that they were witnesses that they were the children of those who killed the prophets; but that, in spite of all this pretence of piety, under all this cloak of profession, they knew in their consciences, and were witnesses to themselves, that it was mere hypocrisy..."
3. "They not only showed that they were descended from them, but that they possessed their spirit, and that, in similar circumstances, they would have done as they did."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "You acknowledge the sins of your fathers, but hypocritically deny your own, adding hypocrisy to impiety."
2. "Ye witness to yourselves, your own consciences condemning you, that ye are the sons (morally as well as naturally) of them that slew the prophets."
3. "Doing this in appearance only, the Pharisees showed that they had no true conception of either their own condition, or the crime of their fathers."

### John Gill:
1. "They plainly owned, that their fathers killed the prophets, and that they descended from them; though they meant not so much to reproach their ancestors, as to give themselves a greater character."
2. "Their own words testified against them, that they were a seed of evildoers; their practices showed them to be of the same spirit and principles with their progenitors."
