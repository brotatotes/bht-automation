# Matthew 23:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers. This statement is not a command, but rather a permission given to the people. It signifies that the time has come for them to follow their own desires and show their true nature. It is an acknowledgment that they have chosen to continue the sinful ways of their ancestors and reach the culmination of their wickedness. They are now given free reign to fill up the measure of their fathers and partake in the consequences that will follow.
