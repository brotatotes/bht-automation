2. "There is a curse in the Talmud somewhat like this: 'Woe to the house of Annas! Woe to their serpent-like hissings.'"

### John Gill:
1. "The latter of these names, John the Baptist calls the Sadducees and Pharisees by, in Matthew 3:7 and Christ, in Matthew 12:34 both express their craft and subtlety, their inward poison, and venomous nature; their fair outside, and specious pretences; their hypocrisy, malice, and wickedness."
