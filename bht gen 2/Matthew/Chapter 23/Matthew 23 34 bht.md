# Matthew 23:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The rejection of God's messengers reflects the continuation of the same stubbornness and resistance shown by previous generations. These messengers, sent by Christ Himself, would not only be equal to the revered prophets of old but even surpass them. Their mission would be met with persecution, including the killing of Stephen and James, as well as crucifixion. Despite their supernatural credentials and wisdom, the obstinate hearts of the people would persist in rejecting the message of salvation.
