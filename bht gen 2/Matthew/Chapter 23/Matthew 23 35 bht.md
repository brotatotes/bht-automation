# Matthew 23:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The murder of Abel marked the beginning of the conflict between unrighteousness and holiness. The Jews, in their actions then and now, can be seen as representing the murderers of the first. As a result, they must face the consequences in God's day of wrath. The killing of Zacharias, possibly the son of Jehoiada, also held significance. Our Lord mentions these murders, linking them to the plea of the dying man, as a reminder that God will require an account for shedding innocent blood.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The murder of Abel was the first in the strife between unrighteousness and holiness, and as these Jews represent, in their conduct both in former times and now, the murderer of the first, they must bear the vengeance of the whole in Godâ€™s day of wrath."
2. "Most likely it is Zacharias, the son of Jehoiada, who was killed there, and of whose blood the Jews had a saying, that it never was washed away till the temple was burnt at the captivity."
3. "Our Lord mentions this last murder, not as being the last even before His own day, but because it was connected specially with the cry of the dying man, 'The Lord look upon it and require it.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That upon you may come ... - That is, the nation is guilty. Your fathers were guilty. You have shown yourselves to be like them. You are about, by killing the Messiah and his messengers, to fill up the iniquity of the land."
2. "The patience of God is nearly exhausted, and the nation is about to be visited with signal vengeance. These national crimes deserve national judgments; and the proper judgment for all these crimes are about to come upon you in the destruction of your temple and city."
3. "All the righteous blood - That is, all the judgments due for shedding that blood. God did not hold them guilty for what their fathers had done; but temporal judgments descend on children in consequence of the wickedness of parents."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "Since they are all involved in a wicked conspiracy, we ought not to think it strange if God, in punishing all without reserve, make the punishment due to the fathers to fall upon the children."
2. "For as God, by an uninterrupted course of patience, has unceasingly contended with the malice of the whole people, so the whole people is justly held guilty of the inflexible obstinacy which continued to the very last."
3. "The crime is rendered still more heinous by the circumstance of the place, since they did not revere the sacredness of the temple... It is evident, therefore, that there must have been furious rage, when the sight of the altar and of the temple could not restrain the Jews from profaning that sacred place by a detestable murder."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The inevitableness, suddenness, power, and grandeur of the judgment is intimated."
2. "The blood of Abel' was a symbol of avenging justice, and even the blood of Christ has a condemning office."
3. "Our Lord distinctly refers to what occurred in past generations."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "A half-dozen possibilities can be suggested."
3. "In the case of Abel a reckoning for the shedding of his blood was foretold (Genesis 4:10) and the same thing was true of the slaying of Zachariah (2 Chronicles 24:22)."

### John Gill:
1. "All men are of one blood, and that is tainted, they that are righteous, are not so naturally, nor by any righteousness of their own, but by the righteousness of Christ."
