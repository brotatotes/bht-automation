# Matthew 23:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Upon this generation, all these things shall come. The iniquity of Israel was allowed to accumulate over time, until that generation when the punishment for their rejection of Christ came to pass. The destruction of Jerusalem, along with the calamities that befell the Jewish people, were evident of this fulfillment. The guilt of their sins were imputed to them, and the punishment due unto them was inflicted upon them. It was a national punishment, executed upon that generation, as the final consequence in a series of hypocrites and persecutors.
