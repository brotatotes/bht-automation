# Matthew 23:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
How often did I long to gather to myself the people of Jerusalem under my protective wings, just as a hen lovingly gathers her chicks for safety. They had been entrusted with so much, but they rejected my prophets and now they reject me. It is a great sorrow that Jerusalem, the city of God's chosen people, would not embrace the grace and salvation that I offer them.
