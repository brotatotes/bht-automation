# Matthew 23:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
From this time forward, the people would no longer see Jesus amongst them, as he declared his departure. The desolation of the house was a result of their being deprived of his presence. However, hope remained, as there would come a time when the Jews would be converted and recognize Jesus as their Savior. After a period of desolation and suffering, the people would joyfully welcome him, saying, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord. This future conversion and joyful reception would fulfill the declaration of Jesus, though it would occur in due time.
