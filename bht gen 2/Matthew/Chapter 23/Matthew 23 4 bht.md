# Matthew 23:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Pharisees, with their seemingly endless list of rules and regulations, were notorious for burdening the people with their heavy religious traditions. They were quick to demand strict observance from others, but they themselves would not lift a finger to alleviate the burdens they imposed. Their hypocrisy was evident in their rigid adherence to the letter of the law while neglecting its true spirit. Jesus, however, came to offer a different way—a way that releases us from the weight of legalistic burdens and invites us to find rest and freedom in Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The φορτία then are not, as so often misinterpreted (even by Olshausen, i. 834), human traditions and observances, but the severity of the law, which they enforce on others, but do not observe." 
2. "The irksomeness and unbearableness of these rites did not belong to the Law in itself, as rightly explained, but were created by the rigour and ritualism of these men, who followed the letter and lost the spirit."
3. "τῷ δακ. αὐτῶν, not αὑτῶν: the emphasis is not on the pronoun, but on the δακτύλῳ. As a general rule, when the pron. is simply reflexive, the smooth breathing should always be printed."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them—"touch them not" (Matthew 23:4)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The 'heavy burdens' refer not here to the traditions and foolish customs of the Pharisees, for Jesus would not command the people to observe them; but they clearly mean the ceremonies and rights appointed by Moses, which Peter says neither 'they nor their fathers were able to bear,' Acts 15:10."
2. "The Pharisees were rigid in requiring that all the people should pay the taxes, give of their property, comply with every part of the law with the utmost rigor, yet they indulged themselves, and bore as little of the expense and trouble as possible."
3. "With one of their fingers - In the least degree. They will not render the least aid."

### John Calvin:
1. "That the Law of God should be called a heavy and intolerable burden is not wonderful, and more especially in reference to our weakness."
2. "Christ reproves the stern and rigid manner of teaching which was usually followed by those proud hypocrites, who authoritatively demand from others what they owe to God, and are rigorous in enforcing duties, and yet indolently dispense with the performance of what they so strictly enjoin on others."
3. "But it is impossible to imagine any thing that can exceed the insolence in commanding, or the cruelty, of stupid despisers of God, because they give themselves no concern about the difficulty of doing those things from which they relieve themselves."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They so presented the correct law as to make its precepts heavy burdens, like loads, packs on beasts of burden."
2. "Imposing such burdens, they did not in the least lighten them by spiritual precept or example."
3. "A fourfold rebuke: 1. they make religion a burden; 2. an intolerable burden; 3. they lay it upon the shoulders of others; 4. they leave it untouched themselves, i.e., they have no idea of fulfilling these precepts in spirit and in truth."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  With their finger  (τω δακτυλω αυτων). A picturesque proverb. They are taskmasters, not burden-bearers, not sympathetic helpers. 

### John Gill:
1. "The traditions of the elders...are called their 'heavy' things...all of them are heavy." 
2. "Now the binding of these heavy things, means the imposing them on men, obliging them to observe them very strictly, under great penalties, should they omit them."
3. "They...lay them on men's shoulders, but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers."

### John Wesley:
1. Luke 11:46.
