# Matthew 23:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The behavior of the scribes and Pharisees is condemned for their desire to seek human recognition and applause. Their outward displays, such as wearing phylacteries and enlarging the fringes of their garments, were symbolic acts that originated from a literal interpretation of the Scriptures. However, these practices had become mere ostentation and showmanship, devoid of true devotion and significance. Jesus exposed the emptiness of their self-righteousness, warning against the dangers of placing excessive importance on external religious practices rather than genuine inward transformation.
