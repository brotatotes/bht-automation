# Matthew 23:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Loving the highest places of honor at feasts and in synagogues goes against Christ's teachings of humility and unity. The honor of sitting in the foremost places at feasts was highly regarded, but Jesus warns against seeking such positions. This desire for recognition led to disputes among the disciples themselves. Today, some may display a superficial humility by sitting in the back at church, while still desiring worldly honor. However, Jesus' teachings remind us to prioritize humility and love for others, rather than seeking our own exaltation.
