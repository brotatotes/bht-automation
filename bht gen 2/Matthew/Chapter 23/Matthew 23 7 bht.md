# Matthew 23:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In public places, people desired to be noticed and respected. Some ministers today also long to be recognized and feel that their dignity is not acknowledged if not called upon to partake in church services. Jesus was addressed as Rabbi, which means teacher or my master. The use of titles such as Rab and Rabboni demonstrated honor and authority. It is important to understand the spirit and intention behind greetings and titles, recognizing that they can either reveal an ungodly desire for attention or a genuine respect for wisdom and authority.
