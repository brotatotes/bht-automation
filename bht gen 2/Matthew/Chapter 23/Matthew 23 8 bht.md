# Matthew 23:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do not seek titles of authority among yourselves, for you are all equal in position and spiritual status as brethren. There is only one true Master, Christ Himself, who holds the ultimate authority over the church. Embrace the unity and equality that comes from being children of God and followers of Christ, and do not boast or take pride in any titles or positions of power.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 8. But be not ye called Rabbi; for

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They were to be equal in authority; they were brethren; and they should neither covet nor receive a title which implied either an elevation of one above another, or which appeared to infringe on the absolute right of the Saviour to be their only Teacher and Master."
2. "Everything which would tend to make a distinction among them or destroy their parity - everything which would lead the world to suppose that there were ranks and grades among them as ministers, they were to avoid."
3. "This title corresponds with the title 'Doctor of Divinity' as applied to ministers of the gospel; and, so far as I can see, the spirit of the Saviour’s command is violated by the reception of such a title, as really as it would have been by their being called 'Rabbi.' It makes a distinction among ministers."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But this prohibition includes all the manifestations of religious pride spoken of, since it prohibits the pride itself."
2. "Because One is our Teacher, all are our brethren; hence the prohibition 'against loving, and in any religious matter, using such titles, signifying dominion over the faith of others' (Alford)."
3. "Not the title, but the spirit which claims authority in teaching, is forbidden."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "But be not ye called Rabbi (υμεις δε μη κληθητε Ραββε). An apparent aside to the disciples."
2. "Some even regard verses Matthew 23:8-10 as a later addition and not part of this address to the Pharisees, but the apostles were present."
3. "Euthymius Zigabenus says: 'Do not seek to be called (ingressive aorist subjunctive), if others call you this it will not be your fault.'"

### John Gill:
1. "Do not be ambitious of any such title, fond of it, or affect it, or be elated with it, should it be given you; nor look upon yourselves as men of power and authority over others."
2. "One is your master, even Christ; meaning himself, the true Messiah, the head of the church, King of saints, and Lord of all; who had all power in heaven and in earth, to make laws, appoint ordinances, and oblige men to receive his doctrines, and obey his commands."
3. "And all ye are brethren; not merely as the descendants of Adam, but as being in a spiritual relation, the children of God, and disciples of Christ, and so have no superiority one over another."
