# Matthew 23:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus cautioned his disciples against seeking titles of honor and assuming authority over others, as if they were the ones responsible for the doctrines and ordinances of the Christian religion. He wanted his followers to recognize that they should not give or take such titles in a way that would oppose the authority of God as their heavenly Father. In this context, Jesus emphasized that there is only one true Father, who has both created and adopted his children, and is worthy of all honor and obedience.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "To construe these injunctions into a condemnation of every title by which Church rulers may be distinguished from the flock which they rule, is virtually to condemn that rule itself and accordingly the same persons do both—but against the whole strain of the New Testament and sound Christian judgment."
2. "But when we have guarded ourselves against these extremes, let us see to it that we retain the full spirit of this warning against that itch for ecclesiastical superiority which has been the bane and the scandal of Christ's ministers in every age."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Christian brethren are equal. Only God has supreme authority." 
2. "He only has a right to give laws; to declare doctrines that shall bind the conscience; to punish disobedience." 
3. "Christ taught them that the source of all life and truth was God, and they ought not to seek or receive a title which properly belongs to him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Father [πατερα] . Aimed at those who courted the title Abba, or Father. Compare the title Papa - Pope.

### John Calvin:
1. "He claims for God alone the honor of Father, in nearly the same sense as he lately asserted that he himself is the only Master."
2. "The true meaning therefore is, that the honor of a father is falsely ascribed to men, when it obscures the glory of God."
3. "All the degrees of relationship depend on God alone through Christ, and are held together in such a manner that, strictly speaking, God alone is the Father of all."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It rather forbids honoring any one as an absolute spiritual authority, because this opposes the authority of our Father in heaven." 
2. "A natural father is not meant. Nor are titles of respect to the aged forbidden."
3. "It [the verse] rather forbids honoring any one as an absolute spiritual authority, because this opposes the authority of our Father in heaven."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus meant the full sense of this noble word for our heavenly Father."
2. "Certainly the ascription of 'Father' to pope and priest seems out of harmony with what Jesus here says."
3. "He should not be understood to be condemning the title to one's real earthly father."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ's sense is, that he would have his disciples not fond of any titles of honour at all; and much less assume an authority over men, as if they were to depend on them, as the founders of the Christian religion, the authors of its doctrines and ordinances; and to take that honour to themselves, which did not belong to them."
2. "Our Lord inveighs against them, and cautions his disciples against giving or taking all such titles, in such sense."
3. "For one is your Father, which is in heaven; who is so, both by creation and adoption, and is possessed of all paternal authority; and is to be honoured and obeyed by all; from whom all wisdom and knowledge is derived, and who has the care and government of all in heaven and in earth."
