# Matthew 24:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus left the temple for the last time, fulfilling his own prophecy of its destruction. As he and his disciples looked back at the impressive structure, they marveled at its grandeur and strength, questioning why such a magnificent building would be demolished so easily. In the temple, valuable items were dedicated and displayed, adding to its splendor. Yet, Jesus knew that outward beauty and wealth couldn't save it from its impending fate.
