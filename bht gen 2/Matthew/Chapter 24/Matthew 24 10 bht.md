# Matthew 24:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When trials and persecution arise, many who claim to be Christians may stumble, fall away, and compromise their faith. False prophets and apostates may even betray true believers. However, it is crucial to hold fast to faith, love one another, and maintain hope until the end. By doing so, believers can avoid shipwrecking their faith and find deliverance from destruction.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The persons spoken of in this verse are Christians."
2. "These Judaizing teachers, among others, are meant by the ψευδοπροφῆται."
3. "See especially Acts 20:30; Galatians 1:7-9; Romans 16:17-18; Col 2:17 end: 1 Timothy 1:6-7; 1Ti 1:20; 1 Timothy 6:3-5; 1 Timothy 6:20-21; 2 Timothy 2:18; 2Ti 3:6-8; 2 Peter 2:1-22 (and Jude): 1Jn 2:18; 1 John 2:22-23; 1 John 2:26; 1Jn 4:1; 1 John 4:3; 2 John 1:7; ψευδαπόστολοι, 2 Corinthians 11:13."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Many who 'professed' to love me will then show that they had no 'real' attachment to me; and in those trying times it will be seen that they knew nothing of genuine Christian love."
2. "Those who thus apostatize from professed attachment to me will betray others who really love me. This they would do to secure their own safety, by revealing the names, habitations, or places of concealment of others."
3. "Not that real Christians would do this, but those who had professed to be such would then show that they were not his true followers, and would hate one another."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ is to many a stone of offense, on which some dash themselves, or by meeting which some are thrown back, and others fall away."
2. "In this expression Christ appears to me to include many kinds of troubles; for not only do they that had entered into the right course fall away, but many are exasperated against Christ; others, forgetful of moderation and justice, break out into rage; others grow profane, and lose every feeling of piety; and others, amidst the confusion which prevails, take upon themselves a liberty to commit crimes."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Then shall many be offended, or ‘fall away.’ The Apostles understood this of the first century; see the repeated warnings against apostasy in the Epistles. The fulfilment will culminate in the last days."
2. "Deliver up one another, i.e., to tribunals, to heathen magistrates, as was the case in Apostolic times. A natural development of apostasy, then, and to be repeated before ‘the end’ comes."
3. "Hate one another. Whenever apostasy occurs, this recurs, since this is the opposite of Christian love. The Great Apostasy (2 Thessalonians 2:3) will thus manifest itself."

### John Gill:
1. "When they saw the apostles, some of them beaten, and imprisoned; others put to death, and others forced to fly from place to place; and persecutions and affliction, because of Christ and his Gospel, likely to befall themselves, would be discouraged hereby, and stumble at the cross; and fall off from the faith of the Gospel, and the profession of it."
2. "Meaning, that the apostates, who would fall off from the Christian religion, would prove treacherous to true believers, and give in their names to the persecutors, or inform them where they were, that they might take them, or deliver them into their hands themselves."
3. "These are the false brethren, the Apostle Paul was in perils among: and shall hate one another; not that the true Christians should hate these false brethren, any more than betray them; for they are taught to love all men, even their enemies."

### John Wesley:
1. "Then shall many he offended — So as utterly to make shipwreck of faith and a pure conscience." 
2. "Hold ye fast faith, in spite of false prophets: love, even when iniquity and offences abound."
3. "And hope, unto the end. He that does so, shall be snatched out of the burning."
