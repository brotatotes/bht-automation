# Matthew 24:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
False prophets refer to false teachers who claim to have a special knowledge of prophecy or revelation, distorting the true understanding of the Scriptures. These individuals, such as Simon Magus, Cerinthus, and the Gnostics, denied essential truths about the nature of Christ and led many astray with their deceptive teachings. It is important for believers to be aware of the presence of these false prophets and stand firm against their heretical doctrines, lest they be swayed by their enticing words and immoral practices.
