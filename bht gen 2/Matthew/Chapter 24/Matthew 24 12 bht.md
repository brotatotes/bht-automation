# Matthew 24:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the face of rampant wickedness and false teachings, the love and zeal of many believers could grow cold. The poisonous influence of iniquity and betrayal from those professing Christianity would chill and blight their spiritual energy. Despite these challenges, some true believers remained steadfast in their love for Christ, the Gospel, and fellow believers, while others experienced a decline in their love due to the pervasive presence of sin. However, it is important to note that their love was not completely lost, but rather it grew cold.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is against this ἀνομία especially that James, in his Epistle, and Jude, in more than the outward sense the brother of James, were called on to protest, the mixture of heathen licentiousness with the profession of Christianity." 
2. "Because the iniquity is filled up, on account of the horrible state of morality...the love and mutual trust of the generality of Christians shall grow cold."
3. "Even the Church itself is leavened by the distrust of the evil days."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'iniquity' here seems to include the cruelty of the Jews and Romans in their persecutions; the betraying of Christians by those who professed to be such; and the pernicious errors of false prophets and others."
2. "The effect of all this would be that the ardor of feeling of many Christians would be lessened."
3. "The fear of death and the deluding influence of false teachers would lessen the zeal of many timid and weak professors; perhaps, also, of many real but feeble Christians."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "It is not the love of many people only that shall be chilled, but of the many, the majority, the great body."
2. "The picture is that of spiritual energy blighted or chilled by a malign or poisonous wind."

### John Calvin:
1. "For in consequence of the superior clearness with which the light of the gospel discovers the malice of men, even good and properly regulated minds grow cool, and almost lose the desire to exercise benevolence."
2. "Each of them reasons thus with himself, that the duties which they perform to one person, or to another, are thrown away, because experience and daily practice show that almost all are ungrateful, or treacherous, or wicked."
3. "But we must observe the source of this evil, which Christ points out, namely, that many lose courage, because through their weakness they are unable to stem the flood of iniquity which flows on every hand."
