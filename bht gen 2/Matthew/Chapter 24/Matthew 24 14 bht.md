# Matthew 24:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Gospel of the kingdom was not only preached in Judea, but also in all the nations of the world. Through the ministry of the apostles, the message spread throughout the various parts of the inhabited world. This widespread preaching of the Gospel served as a sign of the approaching destruction of Jerusalem. The historical account of Josephus, a Jew who witnessed and recorded the events of the Jewish War, serves as a remarkable confirmation of the fulfillment of this prophecy.
