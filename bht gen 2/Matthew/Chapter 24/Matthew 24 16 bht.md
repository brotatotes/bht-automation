# Matthew 24:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the end is near, it is crucial for Christians to seek a place of safety, as advised in Matthew 24:16. This could mean fleeing to the mountains, as it was the case when the Romans approached Jerusalem. The mountains provided a safe retreat for those in danger, such as the Christians who sought refuge in Pella and Mount Libanus. It is important to heed such warnings and not underestimate the need for protection during times of crisis. Even when the Romans temporarily withdrew, the Christians recognized it as an opportunity to retreat and be preserved.
