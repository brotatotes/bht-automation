# Matthew 24:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The urgency of the situation is emphasized as it is advised that one should not even take a moment to gather any belongings from their house. In Eastern cultures, the houses had flat roofs, which were commonly used as places of relaxation and communication. The idea of escaping from roof to roof is mentioned, along with the need to descend by the exterior stairs to avoid any delays. The suddenness and severity of the calamity serves as a reminder to flee without hesitation, akin to the swift escape of Lot from Sodom.
