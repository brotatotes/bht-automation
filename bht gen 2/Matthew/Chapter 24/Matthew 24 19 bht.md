# Matthew 24:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This passage conveys a sense of compassion towards mothers who find themselves in challenging circumstances, being either pregnant or having young children. The commentators emphasize the difficulty faced by these mothers, who are torn between their natural affection for their children and the need to escape quickly. While they cannot easily leave their little ones behind, they also lack the physical ability to carry them to safety. This predicament makes their situation even more distressing compared to others who have the freedom to abandon their belongings.
