# Matthew 24:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A prophecy stated that not one stone of the magnificent temple would be left upon another, and this prediction perplexed the disciples who assumed it was linked with the end of the world. However, Jesus provided distinct answers about the destruction of the temple and city, the signs preceding it, his own coming, and the end of the world, emphasizing the importance of understanding each event separately.
