# Matthew 24:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ's disciples were urged to pray that their escape would not occur during winter, as it would be harsh and challenging. Additionally, they were advised to pray against fleeing on the Sabbath because traveling on that day would be inconvenient and could be seen as a violation of Jewish law. This request from Jesus reflects his concern for the well-being of his followers, as he encourages them to seek divine intervention regarding the timing of their flight. By avoiding winter and the Sabbath, they would have a greater chance of a safe journey.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "The destruction was certainly coming. It could not be prevented; yet it was right to pray for a mitigation of the circumstances, that it might be as mild as possible."
2. "We must die, but it is right to pray that the pains of our dying may be neither long nor severe."
3. "Jesus teaches his disciples to pray that their flight might not be on the Sabbath, because, if they should not go farther than a Sabbath-day’s journey, they would not be beyond the reach of danger, and if they did, they would be exposed to the charge of violating the law."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Pray ye. The trying events were distinctly predicted, yet prayer is just as distinctly enjoined."
2. "Not in the winter, which would not only make it more disagreeable, but might prevent their fleeing far enough."
3. "On a Sabbath. On the Jewish Sabbath. On that day the gates of the cities were usually closed (Nehemiah 13:19-22), besides travelling on that day would expose them still more to Jewish fanaticism. The Jewish Christians, up to the time of the destruction of Jerusalem, observed the Jewish Sabbath, and might scruple to travel more than the Sabbath day’s journey (about an English mile). Our Lord’s anxiety is not for the observance of the Jewish Sabbath, but for His people."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In winter because of the rough weather."
2. "On a sabbath because some would hesitate to make such a journey on the sabbath."
3. "Josephus in his Wars gives the best illustration of the horrors foretold by Jesus in verse Matthew 24:21."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ directs to pray to God, who has the disposal of all events, and of the timing of them, that he would so order things in the course of his providence, that their flight might not be in such a season of the year..."
2. "...there was encouragement to pray to him, that they might be indulged with the like favour when Jerusalem should be besieged again."
3. "And though the Jews did allow, that the Sabbath might be violated where life was in danger, and that it was lawful to defend themselves against an enemy on the Sabbath day; yet this did not universally obtain..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Pray ye that your flight be not in the winter — They did so; and their flight was in the spring."
2. "Neither on the Sabbath — Being on many accounts inconvenient; beside that many would have scrupled to travel far on that day."
3. "For the Jews thought it unlawful to walk above two thousand paces (two miles) on the Sabbath day."
