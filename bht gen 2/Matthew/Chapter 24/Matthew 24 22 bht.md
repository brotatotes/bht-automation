# Matthew 24:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The days of tribulation, marked by the distress and destruction during the siege of Jerusalem, were such that if they were not cut short, no Jew in the city would have been saved. However, there was a divine intervention to ensure the preservation of the chosen ones, the elect, who were the Christians. It was for their sake that the days were shortened, bringing an earlier end to the siege and its calamities. This showed God's mercy, preventing the total annihilation of the elect and demonstrating His faithfulness to His chosen people.

2. "As a fact, various causes did combine to shorten the siege.

3. "Titus himself confessed that God was against the Jews, since otherwise neither his armies nor his engines would have availed against their defences."

2. "This affords us a striking proof of the judgment of God, when he afflicts his visible Church to such a degree, that we would be ready to conclude that it had altogether perished; and yet, in order to preserve some seed, he miraculously rescues from destruction his elect, though few in number, that, contrary to expectation, they may escape from the jaws of death."
3. "Thus, in punishing the Jews, the wrath of God burned to an extent which was truly awful, and yet, contrary to the expectation of men, he restrained it in such a manner, that not one of the elect perished."

### Philip Schaff:
