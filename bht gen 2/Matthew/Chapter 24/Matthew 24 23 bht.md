# Matthew 24:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During tumultuous times, there is a real danger of being deceived by false claims of the Messiah's presence. People may try to manipulate the desperate circumstances to gain followers by proclaiming, Lo, here is Christ, or there, but we should not be swayed by such claims. This was a caution given by Jesus to his disciples, reminding them to stay alert and not be misled by those who falsely claim to be the Messiah.
