# Matthew 24:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These false Christs, accompanied by their deceiving prophets, will perform great signs and wonders, aiming to persuade people that they are the long-awaited Messiah. While their miracles may resemble true works of God, they are ultimately meant to deceive and lead astray. However, the elect, those who have been chosen by God, will not be easily deceived by these imposters. God's protection and guidance will ensure the safety of His chosen ones, preventing them from falling into error.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "False Christs - Persons claiming to be the Messiah."
2. "Shall show great signs and wonders - That is, shall pretend to work miracles."
3. "If it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect - So nearly would their pretended miracles resemble true miracles as to render it difficult to detect the imposture..."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The words do not denote different classes of supernatural manifestations, but these manifestations regarded from different points of view."

3. "Terav (derivation uncertain) is a miracle regarded as a portent or prodigy, awakening amazement."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ therefore exhorts and arouses his disciples to keep watch, and at the same time reminds them that there is no reason for being troubled at the strangeness of the sight, if they see many persons on every hand led away into error."
2. "While he excites them to solicitude, that Satan may not overtake them in a state of sloth, he gives them abundant ground of confidence on which they may calmly rely, when he promises that they will be safe under the defense and protection of God against all the snares of Satan."
3. "For they have not sufficient energy to resist the attacks of Satan unless in consequence of their being the sheep of Christ, which none can pluck out of his hand. It must therefore be observed, that the permanency of our salvation does not depend on us, but on the secret election of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "False Christs. While this may refer to the impostors of the first century, it now points to ‘Antichrist,’ or the many ‘antichrists’ (1 John 2:18), constantly arising."

### John Gill:
1. "These false Christs had their false prophets, who endeavored to persuade the people to believe them to be the Messiah."
2. "They may be, and oftentimes are, deceived after conversion; but then this is in part only, and not totally; in some lesser, and not in the greater matters of faith."
3. "This clause, as it expresses the power of deceivers, and the efficacy of Satan, so the influence and certainty of electing grace and the sure and firm perseverance of the saints, to the end, notwithstanding the cunning and craft of men and devils."

### John Wesley:
