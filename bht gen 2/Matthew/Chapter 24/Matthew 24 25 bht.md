# Matthew 24:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Matthew 24:25 reminds us of the warning given by Jesus beforehand. Mark 13:23 emphasizes the need to be cautious. This warning is not limited to the first century; it still applies to us today. Jesus provided this warning so that people would be prepared and not caught off guard. The fulfillment of these events would serve as evidence of Jesus' authenticity as the true Messiah, distinguishing Him from false prophets. By foretelling these events, Jesus demonstrated His omniscience and strengthened the faith of His followers, protecting them from deception.
