# Matthew 24:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Beware of being deceived by those who claim that the Messiah can only be found in secluded places, such as the wilderness or inner chambers. These false Christs are attempting to mislead and distract you from the truth. Don't be swayed by rumors or claims that the Messiah is hidden away in secret locations, for these are merely idle notions. Instead, keep your focus on the truth and remain steadfast in your faith, knowing that the true Messiah will reveal himself in due time.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "Behold, he is in the desert - The Jews had formed the expectation that the Messiah would appear suddenly from some unexpected quarter; hence, many would be looking to desert places, expecting that he would come from them."
2. "Go not forth - Do not follow them; they will only deceive you."
3. "In secret chambers - Concealed in some house, or some retired part of the city. Many would, doubtless, pretend that the Messiah was concealed there, and, either for the purpose of encouraging or deceiving the people, would pretend that they had discovered him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. In the desert - Secret chambers. Rev., wilderness - inner chambers. Both retired places, indicating that the false Messiahs will avoid public scrutiny.

### John Calvin:
1. "For we know that the false Christs —in accordance with the gross and foolish hope of that nation—drew along with them as large bodies of men as they could collect into the recesses of the desert, or into caverns, or other places of retirement, in order to throw off the yoke of the Roman government by force and by arms."
2. "The disciples were thus reminded that they must no longer seek a Redeemer within the small enclosure of Judea, because he will suddenly extend the limits of his kingdom to the uttermost ends of the world."
3. "And, indeed, this astonishing rapidity, with which the gospel flew through every part of the world, was a manifest testimony of divine power."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Behold, he is in the wilderness, whither the impostors led their followers (Acts 21:38)."
2. "Behold, he is in the inner chambers, teaching in private, proposing some scheme of deliverance."
3. "The caution then is against enthusiasm, superstition, and fanaticism, in the days of the waiting Church."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In the wilderness (εν τη ερημω). Like Simon son of Gioras (Josephus, War, IV,9,5,&7)." 
2. "In the inner chambers (εν τοις ταμειοις). Like John of Giscala (Josephus, War, V,6,1)." 
3. "False Messiahs act the role of the Great Unseen and Unknown."

### John Gill:
1. "Do not go out of the places where you are to see, or hear, and know the truth of things; lest you should, in any respect, be stumbled, ensnared, and brought into danger."
2. "Behold, he is in the secret chambers, believe it not; or should others say behold, or for certain, the Messiah is in some one of the secret and fortified places of the temple; do not believe them."
3. "Some say, that he is hid in the sea; others, in the walks of the garden of Eden; and others, that he sits among the lepers at the gates of Rome. But these are all idle notions, and none of them to be believed."
