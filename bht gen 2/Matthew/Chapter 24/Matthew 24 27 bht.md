# Matthew 24:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The coming of the Son of Man will be like the striking presence of lightning, with a rapidity and unexpectedness that cannot be ignored. It will not be confined to a particular region, but will be visible to all people across the globe. While the words initially referred to the destruction of Jerusalem, they hold a broader significance, indicating Christ's eventual return for judgment. This final coming will be personal and universally witnessed, fulfilling the prophecy of every eye beholding him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "He does not mean to affirm that the 'Son of man' will come from the 'east,' but that he will come in a rapid and unexpected manner, like the lightning."
2. "So rapidly, so unexpectedly, in so unlooked-for a quarter, would be his coming."
3. "The words had, doubtless, a primary reference to the destruction of Jerusalem, but they had, at the same time, such an amplitude of meaning as also to express his coming to judgment."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The coming of the Lord will be a plain, unmistakable fact, like the lightning which lightens both ends of the heaven at once, and is seen of all."
2. "It will not be connected with some particular place, but will manifest itself and be recognized over the whole world."
3. "Every eye shall see him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "At this point we must accept a direct reference to the end of the world. The destruction of Jerusalem was sudden, but here the ulterior sense, which was never absent, becomes the prominent one."
2. "The sense is Christâ€™s coming will be sudden and all-pervading, unmistakable and fearful; visible too, we infer; glorious and purifying also, like the lightning."
3. "Only a Personal coming will fulfil this prediction."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  As seen  (Ï†Î±Î¹Î½ÎµÏ„Î±). Visible in contrast to the invisibility of the false Messiahs. Cf. Revelation 1:7. Like a flash of lightning. 

### John Gill:
1. "For as the lightning cometh out of the east....and shineth even unto the west;...so shall also the coming of the son of man be."
2. "which must be understood not of his last coming to judgment, though that will be sudden, visible, and universal; he will at once come to, and be seen by all, in the clouds of heaven."
3. "but of his coming in his wrath and vengeance to destroy that people, their nation, city, and temple."

### John Wesley:
1. For as the lightning goeth forth â€” For the next coming of Christ will he as quick as lightning; so that there will not be time for any such previous warning.
