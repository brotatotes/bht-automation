# Matthew 24:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
No matter where evil exists, there will always be forces of destruction and judgment that gather together. This is evident in the impending fate of the Jewish nation, who cannot escape the inevitable destruction that awaits them. The Roman eagles, symbolizing the power and might of the Roman empire, will relentlessly seek out the Jewish people, devouring them like a lifeless carcass. Their destiny has been sealed, and there is no escaping the imminent judgment that will befall them.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The answer is, first, at Jerusalem: where the corrupting body lies, thither shall the vultures (literally) gather themselves together, coming as they do from far on the scent of prey."
2. "Secondly, in its final fulfillment, over the whole world; for that is the Ï€Ï„á¿¶Î¼Î± now, and the á¼€ÎµÏ„Î¿Î¯ the angels of vengeance."
3. "The interpretation which makes the Ï€Ï„á¿¶Î¼Î± our Lord, and the á¼€ÎµÏ„Î¿Î¯ the elect, is quite beside the purpose."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Wherever wicked people are, there will be assembled the instruments of their chastisement."
2. "The Roman armies will find it out, as the vultures do a dead carcass, and will come around it to devour it."
3. "He would come, by means of the Roman armies, as 'certainly;' as 'suddenly,' and as unexpectedly as whole flocks of vultures and eagles, though unseen before, see their prey at a great distance and suddenly gather in multitudes around it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Carcase [Ï€Ï„Ï‰Î¼Î±] . From piptw, to fall. Originally a fall, and thence a fallen body; a corpse." 
2. "Eagles [Î±ÎµÏ„Î¿Î¹] . Rev. puts vultures in margin. The griffon vulture is meant, which surpasses the eagle in size and power." 
3. "Aristotle notes how this bird scents its prey from afar, and congregates in the wake of an army."

### John Calvin:
1. "By whatever methods Satan endeavors to scatter the children of God in various directions, still in Christ himself is the sacred bond of union, by which they must be kept united."
2. "Here then is a method laid down for promoting a holy union, that the separations produced by errors may not tear in pieces the body of the Church; and that method is, when we remain united to Christ."
3. "Christ intended to argue from the less to the greater, that if birds have so great sagacity as to flock in great numbers from distant places to a single carcass, it would be disgraceful in believers not to assemble to the Author of life, from whom alone they derive their actual nourishment."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The 'carcass' represents moral corruption; the 'eagles,' God's means of certain punishment when the time is ripe."
2. "The context points to two special occasions: 1. The destruction of Jerusalem when the Roman 'eagles' appeared as ministers of vengeance; 2. the last days when the cup of the world's iniquity shall be full and God's swift messengers of judgment ('the angels') shall come."
3. "This verse answers the cry of the waiting Church: 'How long, O Lord' (Revelation 6:10)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Carcase (Ï€Ï„Ï‰Î¼Î±). As in Matthew 14:12, the corpse. Originally a fallen body from Ï€Î¹Ï€Ï„Ï‰, to fall, like Latin cadaver from cado, to fall."
2. "The proverb here as in Luke 17:37, is like that in Job 39:30; Proverbs 30:17."
3. "Eagles (Î±ÎµÏ„Î¿). Perhaps the griffon vulture, larger than the eagle, which (Aristotle) was often seen in the wake of an army and followed Napoleon's retreat from Russia."

### John Gill:
1. "Not Christ, as he is held forth in the Gospel, crucified and slain, through whose death is the savour of life, and by whom salvation is..."
2. "wherever the Jews were, whether at Jerusalem, where the body and carcass of them was, in a most forlorn and desperate condition; or in any other parts of the country, the Roman eagles, or legions, would find them out, and make an utter destruction of them."
3. "the eagle still is, to this day, the ensign of the Roman empire."

### John Wesley:
1. "For wheresoever the carcass is, there will the eagles be gathered together â€” Our Lord gives this, as a farther reason, why they should not hearken to any pretended deliverer."
2. "Expect not any deliverer of the Jewish nation; for it is devoted to destruction."
3. "It is already before God a dead carcass, which the Roman eagles will soon devour."
