# Matthew 24:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After the distress and tribulation that would come upon the people, Jesus begins to speak about his final coming. It is important to understand that Jesus is speaking from a divine perspective, where time is not measured in the same way as it is for humans. Some early Christians misunderstood this and believed that Jesus would come back immediately in the literal sense, but this misconception was corrected by the Apostle Paul in his writings. The powers of the heavens likely refers to the influences of the heavenly bodies.

### Henry Alford:
1. "The important insertion in Luke (Luk 21:23-24) shews us that the θλῖψις includes ὀργὴ τῷ λαῷ τούτῳ, which is yet being inflicted."
2. "The Knowledge of God shall be obscured, the Truth nigh put out, worldly wisdom darkened, the Church system demolished, and her teachers cast down. And all this in the midst of the fearful signs here (and in Luke 21:25-26, more at large) recounted: not setting aside, but accompanying, their literal fulfilment."
3. "The influences which rule human society, which make the political weather fair or foul, bright or dark; and encourage the fruits of peace, or inflict the blight and desolation of war."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Immediately after the tribulation of those days" - Such events would "shortly" or "soon" occur, and would occur "before long."
2. "The images used here are not to be taken literally. They are often employed by the sacred writers to denote 'any great calamities.'"
3. "The roaring of the waves of the sea denotes great tumult and affliction among the people. 'Perplexity' means doubt, anxiety; not knowing what to do to escape. 'Men’s hearts should fail them for fear,' or by reason of fear. Their fears would be so great as to take away their courage and strength."

3. "In a word, all the creatures above and below will be, as it were, heralds to summon men to that tribunal, which they will continue to treat with ungodly and wanton contempt till the last day."

1. "After the tribulation of those days, not the tribulation attending the destruction of Jerusalem, but the period of trial which belongs to the ‘last times.’"
2. "The sun shall be darkened... the moon shall not give her light... the stars shall fall from heaven... the powers of the heavens shall be shaken: the influences which rule human society shall be disturbed."
3. "Others refer the whole to the fall of heathenism with its worship of Nature, but this is less probable, since terrifying occurrences seem to be meant."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
