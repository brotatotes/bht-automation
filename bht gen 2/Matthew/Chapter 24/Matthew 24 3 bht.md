# Matthew 24:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus intentionally sat in a specific place to start a conversation with his disciples about the signs that would precede the destruction of Jerusalem. The disciples, however, were focused on when Jesus would establish his earthly kingdom and desired a sign to give them hope for a magnificent new temple. They didn't comprehend that Jesus would depart from them and ultimately return. This reveals their misconception about Jesus' role as the true Messiah and their misunderstanding of his mission.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Against this mistake He warns them, Matthew 24:6; Matthew 24:14, Luke 21:24, and also in the two first parables in our ch. 25."
2. "Even in this part, however, we cannot tell how applicable the warnings given may be to the events of the last times, in which apparently Jerusalem is again to play so distinguished a part."
3. "Another weighty matter for the understanding of this prophecy is, that (see Mar 13:32) any obscurity or concealment concerning the time of the Lord‚Äôs second coming, must be attributed to the right cause, which we know from His own mouth to be, that the divine Speaker Himself, in His humiliation, did not know the day nor the hour."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "From that mount there was a magnificent view of the whole city."
2. "The principle on which this combined description of two events was spoken appears to be, that 'they could be described in the same words,' and therefore the accounts are intermingled."
3. "Sign of thy coming - Evidence that thou art coming. By what token shall we know that thou art coming?"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Coming [œÄŒ±œÅŒøœÖœÉŒπŒ±œÇ] . Originally, presence, from pareinai, to be present."
2. "Of the second coming of Christ : James 5:8; 1 John 2:28; 2 Peter 3:4; 1 Thessalonians 4:15."
3. "They do not ask the signs of the Messiah's coming at the end of all time, to judge the world."

### John Calvin:
1. "Having believed from their infancy that the temple would stand till the end of time, and having this opinion deeply rooted in their minds, they did not suppose that, while the building of the world stood, the temple could fall to ruins."
2. "They associate the coming of Christ and the end of the world as things inseparable from each other; and by the end of the world they mean the restoration of all things, so that nothing may be wanting to complete the happiness of the godly."
3. "But above all, a foolish hope which they entertained, as to the immediate reign of Christ, drove them to hasten to the attainment of happiness and rest, without attending to the means."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The mount of Olives. Opposite the temple. The siege of Jerusalem began from this place, and at the same season of the year."
2. "The disciples. Mark (Mark 13:3): 'Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew,' the four fishermen first called and first named in all the lists, the confidential disciples."
3. "They identified these, and joined them with the destruction of Jerusalem. As these disciples had been told most fully of His death (comp. chap. Matthew 17:9 ff.), they probably mean a coming (parousia, appearance) after death, to usher in the end of the world, i.e., the end of the former dispensation of things, not the destruction of the world."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus treats all three [questions about the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple, his own second coming, and the end of the world] in this great eschatological discourse, the most difficult problem in the Synoptic Gospels."
2. "In a painting the artist by skilful perspective may give on the same surface the inside of a room, the fields outside the window, and the sky far beyond. Certainly in this discourse Jesus blends in apocalyptic language the background of his death on the cross, the coming destruction of Jerusalem, his own second coming and the end of the world."
3. "The destruction of Jerusalem came as he foretold. There are some who would date the Synoptic Gospels after A.D. 70 in order to avoid the predictive element involved in the earlier date. But that is to limit the fore-knowledge of Jesus to a merely human basis."

### John Gill:
1. "This place, very probably, our Lord chose to sit in, that he might give his disciples an occasion to discourse more largely with him on this subject; and that he might take the opportunity of acquainting them with what would be the signs and forerunners of this desolation..."
2. "They wanted to be informed, by what sign they might know, when he would set up his temporal kingdom; for since the temple was to be destroyed, they might hope a new one would be built, much more magnificent than this..."
3. "He was come in the flesh, and was the true Messiah, they firmly believed: he was with them, and they expected he would continue with them, for they had no notion of his leaving them, and coming again."
