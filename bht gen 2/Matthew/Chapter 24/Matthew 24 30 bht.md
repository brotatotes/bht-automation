# Matthew 24:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
And then, at the time of great tribulation, the sign of the Son of man, perhaps the cross, shall be revealed in the glory of the Lord. This sign, which may not only involve the sun, moon, and stars of our own system, but also the heavenly bodies, will be a clear indication of Christ's imminent return.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "When these things shall have been somewhile filling men's hearts with fear, THEN shall, &c."
2. "This is manifestly some sign in the Heavens, by which all shall know that the Son of Man is at hand."
3. "This coming of the Son of Man is not that spoken of ch. Matthew 25:31, but that in 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17, and Revelation 19:11 ff., His coming at the commencement of the millennial reign to establish His Kingdom."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The sign of the Son of man - The 'evidence' that he is coming to destroy the city of Jerusalem."
2. "All the tribes of the earth mourn - That is, either all the 'tribes or people' of the land of Judea shall mourn at the great calamities coming upon them, or all the nations of the world shall wail when he comes to judgment."
3. "And they shall see the Son of man - The Lord Jesus coming to judgment. Probably this refers more directly to his coming at the last day, though it may also mean that the 'evidence' of his coming to destroy Jerusalem will then be seen."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "The confused mixture of things which we now perceive does certainly, on the one hand, darken our minds, and, on the other hand, bury the grace of Christ, and make it almost vanish from our sight, so that the salvation obtained by him, so far as relates to the perception of the flesh, is not comprehended."
2. "He threatens also against all nations mourning and lamentation; because it is proper, that by his presence he should crush and destroy the rebels, who, while he was absent, despised his authority."
3. "For it is no slight ground of offense to see the ungodly living without concern, because they think that their mockery of God will remain unpunished... Christ declares that it will at length be turned into mourning and gnashing of teeth."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Something like the Star of the wise men, some suppose; the Fathers thought, a sign of the cross in the heavens; a luminous appearance visible to all, itself a glory like the Shekinah of old, is the view of many."
2. "All races and peoples shall join in one chorus, first of great and solemn lamentation; not necessarily of real penitence, though that is not excluded, but rather of terror, occasioned by the events which have occurred and the foreboding of what is to follow."
3. "This coming is evidently that referred to in 1 Thessalonians 4:16, at the first resurrection; a comparison with Revelation 19:11 ff. suggests that this Advent precedes the millennium, but upon that point there has been much dispute."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The sign of the Son of Man in heaven (το σημειον του υιου του ανθρωπου εν ουρανω)... Many theories have been suggested like the cross in the sky, etc."
