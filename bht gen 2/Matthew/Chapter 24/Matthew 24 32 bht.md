# Matthew 24:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus teaches a parable, using the fig tree as an illustration to convey the message about the signs preceding significant events. He begins by addressing the disciples' question about the timing of the destruction of Jerusalem, providing an answer to their inquiry. However, Jesus distinguishes the time of the end of the world, stating that no one knows that specific day or hour. His parable serves as a lesson on recognizing the signs and being prepared for the future events that will unfold.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "Now learn a parable - See the notes at Matthew 13:3. The word here means, rather, 'an illustration,' make a 'comparison,' or judge of this as you do respecting a fig-tree."
2. "Fig-tree - This was spoken on the Mount of Olives, which produced not only olives, but figs. Possibly one was near when he spoke this."
3. "When his branch ... - When the juices return from the roots into the branches, and the buds swell and burst, 'as if tender,' and too feeble to contain the pressing and expanding leaves when you see that, you judge that spring and summer are near."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A parable [την παραβολην] . More strictly, the parable which she has to teach."

### John Calvin:
1. "For as in winter the trees, contracted by the severity of the cold, show greater vigor, but in spring lose their toughness, and appear more feeble, and are even cleft asunder to open up passage for fresh twigs, so the afflictions by which, according to the perception of the flesh, the Church is softened, do not in any way impair its vigor."
2. "The general instruction conveyed is, that the weak and frail condition of the Church ought not to lead us to conclude that it is dying, but rather to expect the immortal glory for which the Lord prepares his people by the cross and by afflictions."
3. "For they [the disciples] did not view the kingdom of God in the Gospel as consisting in the peace and joy of faith and in spiritual righteousness, but sought that blessed rest and glory which is concealed under hope till the last day."
