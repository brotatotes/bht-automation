# Matthew 24:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The fig tree's leaves symbolize the approaching summer, just as the signs surrounding Jerusalem foreshadow its impending destruction. These signs serve as an indication that the Son of Man has manifested his power and glory. Additionally, they represent the nearness of God's kingdom or an expanded phase of the Gospel, as the winter of the Mosaic law has ended and the spring of the Gospel era has begun. Through the preaching of John the Baptist and the apostles, the summer of the Gospel is now close, spreading its influence throughout the Gentile world.
