# Matthew 24:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The prediction made by Jesus about the destruction of Jerusalem has been shown to be true, as the events unfolded within the generation of those who were alive at that time. The words used by Jesus encompassed not just the immediate events, but also had a broader significance that extended to future judgments. The coming destruction was not a distant event, but one that would directly impact the present generation. The fulfillment of this prophecy serves as a testament to the truth and accuracy of Jesus' words.

2.

3. "He expressly foretold that those things related to their own age."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "'Generation' in the sense of 'race,' as often. (a) Applied to the Jewish nation, meaning that the Jewish people shall remain until the fulfillment of all these things, and that one of the signs of the final fulfillment, will be a sudden greening of that withered race." 
3. "Till all these things, including apparently both the signs and the coming. Be done, literally, 'become.' The idea of actual occurrence is the prominent one, not that of fulfillment."
