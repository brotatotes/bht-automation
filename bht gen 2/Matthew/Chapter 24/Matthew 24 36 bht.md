# Matthew 24:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
But the exact day of judgment, no one knows, not even the Son of God Himself. At the time when Jesus walked on earth, He did not possess this knowledge. However, it is possible that this information was later revealed to the apostle John.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The very important addition to this verse in Mark, and in some ancient MSS. here (but see digest), οὐδὲ ὁ υἱός, is indeed included in εἰ μὴ ὁ πατήρ [ μου ] μόνος, but could hardly have been inferred from it, had it not been expressly stated: ch. Matthew 20:23." 
2. "All attempts to soften or explain away this weighty truth must be resisted; it will not do to say with some Commentators, 'nescit ea nobis,' which, however well meant, is a mere evasion."
3. "In the course of humiliation undertaken by the Son, in which He increased in wisdom (Luk 2:52), learned obedience (Heb 5:8), uttered desires in prayer (Luke 6:12, &c.), this matter was hidden from Him: and as I have already remarked, this is carefully to be borne in mind, in explaining the prophecy before us."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The 'general signs' of its approach have been given, as the budding of the fig-tree is a certain indication that summer is near; but 'the precise time' is not indicated by these things."
2. "He now replies to them by saying that the precise time would not be foretold."
3. "Knoweth no man, no, not the angels."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ intended to hold the minds of believers in suspense that they might not, by a false imagination, fix any time for the final redemption."
2. "He therefore wishes the day of his coming to be the object of such expectation and desire, that none shall dare to inquire when it will happen."
3. "That men may not feel uneasy at not knowing that day, Christ represents angels as their associates in this matter; for it would be a proof of excessive pride and wicked covetousness, to desire that we who creep on the earth should know more than is permitted to the angels in heaven."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Christ did not know the day and hour of His future coming since Matthew 24:37 shows that this is referred to."
2. "This seems to be a voluntary self-humiliation in knowledge, a part of Christ’s emptying of Himself."
3. "His voluntarily not knowing, or 'sacred unwillingness to know,' the day of judgment during the days of His flesh, is a warning against chronological curiosity and mathematical calculation in the exposition of Scripture prophecy."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Not even the Son...The idea is really involved in the words 'but the Father only.'"
2. "He now as pointedly states that no one but the Father knows the day or the hour when these things will come to pass."
3. "One may, of course, accuse Jesus of hopeless confusion or extend his confession of ignorance of the date of the second coming to the whole chain of events."

### John Gill:
1. "now, though the destruction itself was spoken of by Moses and the prophets, was foretold by Christ, and the believing Jews had some discerning of its near approach; yet the exact and precise time was not known."
2. "nor the son [...] must be understood of Christ as the son of man, and not as the Son of God; for as such, he lay in the bosom of the Father, and knew all his purposes and designs;"
3. "but the sense is, that as he, as man and mediator, came not to destroy, but to save; so it was not any part of his work, as such, to know, nor had he it in commission to make known the time of Jerusalem's ruin."

### John Wesley:
1. "But of that day — The day of judgment"
2. "Knoweth no man - Not while our Lord was on earth."
3. "Yet it might be afterward revealed to St. John consistently with this."
