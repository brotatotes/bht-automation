# Matthew 24:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the days of Noah, people were given warning of the coming flood, yet they remained unprepared. Similarly, when the Son of man returns, it will be sudden and unexpected. Many will be indifferent or have misguided beliefs about his second coming. However, few will be eager and truly expectant, leaving the plans and timing to God. The flood in Noah's time serves as a reminder of the consequences that result from being unthoughtful and unprepared.
