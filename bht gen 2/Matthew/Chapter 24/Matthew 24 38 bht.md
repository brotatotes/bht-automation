# Matthew 24:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people of that time engaged in everyday activities, such as eating and drinking, without considering the impending catastrophe that was to come upon them. This doesn't imply that these actions were inherently wrong, but rather that their focus was solely on their earthly pursuits. Instead of being mindful of the impending judgment, they indulged themselves in gluttony, drunkenness, and immoral behavior. They ignored the warning given by God through Noah and persisted in their wicked ways.
