# Matthew 24:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Even after receiving warning, the people did not believe the truth of the impending flood and were therefore hardened in their unbelief. This parallels the situation of the Jews before the destruction of Jerusalem, who ignored the warnings and lived in a state of carelessness and security. They cried peace when destruction was imminent, just as the unbelieving world will be caught unawares at the second coming of Christ, engrossed in their everyday lives and indifferent to the signs of His return.
