# Matthew 24:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of calamity, there will be no escape for those taken by it. The cautionary tale of Lot's wife serves as a reminder to forget the past and press forward. Our minds must be strengthened by faith to avoid hesitation and continue on our course. Christ is the banner of unity, gathering all God's children. Believers must live in the world until the appointed time. Being taken or left does not necessarily mean death, but rather being rescued or facing common calamities. Our Lord speaks with complete knowledge of events.
