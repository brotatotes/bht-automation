# Matthew 24:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we gain insight into the everyday life in the East, where grinding was a common task performed by women. They would work together in pairs, with one woman taking hold of the mill-handle and turning it halfway, and the other woman completing the revolution. This imagery highlights the significance of the distinctions and judgments that will occur, with one person being taken and the other being left behind. This showcases the providential workings of God in the lives of individuals.
