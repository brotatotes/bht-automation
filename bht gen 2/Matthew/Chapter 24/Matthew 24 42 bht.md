# Matthew 24:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Watch for the coming of the Lord, for its time is uncertain. Be on guard, for it may happen when you least expect it. The parables and descriptions of judgment serve to prepare us for the last scene of things on earth. We do not know the hour in which the Lord will come to require our souls or to bring judgment upon the wicked. Therefore, let us be vigilant and ready at all times.
