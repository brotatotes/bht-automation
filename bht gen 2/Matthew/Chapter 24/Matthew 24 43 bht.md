# Matthew 24:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are urged to be ready for the coming of the Son of Man, likened to a thief in the night, not in a negative sense but to highlight the secrecy and suddenness of his arrival. Christians are portrayed as the good man of the house, responsible for their own souls and spiritual affairs. Just as it is necessary for one to watch and be prepared for a thief, so too it is crucial for believers to be alert, vigilant, and waiting for their Lord's return.

1. "The coming of the son of man is here represented by the coming of the thief in the night: but when he is compared to a thief, this is not to be understood in a bad sense...but this only respects the manner of Christ's coming, which is like that of a thief, secretly, suddenly, and at unawares."
