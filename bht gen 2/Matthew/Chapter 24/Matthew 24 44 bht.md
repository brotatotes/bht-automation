# Matthew 24:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are urged to be in a state of constant readiness, as the coming of Christ will be sudden and unexpected. It is important to remain vigilant and not allow ourselves to become consumed by worldly distractions or indulgences. Judgment is imminent, and it is foolish to ignore the warning. Those who are prepared, who are found in Christ and have put on his righteousness, will be received into eternal bliss and will forever dwell with him in everlasting habitations.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "Luke 21:36 says that he charged them to pray always, that they might be accounted worthy to escape those things - the judgments coming upon the wicked - and to stand before the Son of man - that is, to stand there approved by him, or to be admitted to his favor."
2. "He also charged them Luke 21:34 to take heed and not to suffer their hearts to be overcharged with surfeiting, or too much eating, or drunkenness, or the cares of this life, lest that day should come upon them unawares."
3. "Things improper if there were no judgment - especially mad and wicked when the judgment is near."

### John Calvin:
1. "Since, therefore, we are informed that Christ’s coming will be sudden and unexpected, like that of a robber, and since we are expressly forewarned that we must always watch, lest he come upon us when asleep, and we be swallowed up with the ungodly, there is no excuse for our indolence."
2. "The tendency of these words therefore is, that the warning of Christ should arouse us; for, though the last judgment be delayed for a long time, yet it hangs over us every hour; and, therefore, when there is ground for alarm, and when danger is near, it is unreasonable that we should be sluggish."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To be ready at all is to be ready always."
2. "The caution of this passage is not a threatening for the Lord’s people."
3. "He does not rule them by terror; those ready find Him a Friend; only those not ready find His coming as uncomfortable as that of a thief."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "That ye think not (η ου δοκειτε ωρα). It is useless to set the day and hour for Christ's coming."
2. "It is folly to neglect it."
3. "This figure of the thief will be used also by Paul concerning the unexpectedness of Christ's second coming (1 Thessalonians 5:2)."

### John Gill:
1. " expresses the suddenness of it, may excite to watchfulness and readiness"
2. "this lies...in being in Christ, having on his righteousness, and being washed in his blood"
3. "happy will those be that are ready; they will be received by Christ into everlasting habitations, and be for ever with him"
