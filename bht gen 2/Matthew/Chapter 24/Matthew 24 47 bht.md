# Matthew 24:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The faithful servant is commended for his loyalty and readiness for his lord's return, being called 'blessed.' This truth is certain and dependable. His faithfulness will be rewarded with promotion, making him ruler over all his master's possessions. This promotion is not exclusive, but rather like the spreading of love, where the abundance of gifts benefits all. The servant can expect to receive greater gifts, more knowledge of the Gospel, increased usefulness in the church, and ultimately, inherit all things in the eternal realm, experiencing glory, happiness, and bliss.
