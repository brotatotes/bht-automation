# Matthew 24:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They imagine that the day of accountability will never come, and under the pretext of Christ's absence, they believe they will remain unpunished. This misconception leads them to indulge in sinful desires and neglect their responsibilities. However, they fail to realize that no one will be able to escape the severe punishment that awaits such unbounded wickedness. The caution for the faithful is to persevere, while this serves as a warning to those who intrude into the ministry and veer off the path of righteousness.
