# Matthew 24:49 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Unfaithfulness to Christ is revealed through the conduct of censuring and displaying pride towards others, along with exerting control over fellow believers. This can lead to a disregard for the welfare of the community and an invitation for worldly influences to thrive. Behaving in such a manner not only harms the spiritual health of the household, but also leads to indulgence, self-satisfaction, and an abandonment of serving the Lord. It is crucial to avoid demeaning and burdensome actions that cause harm within the Christian family.
