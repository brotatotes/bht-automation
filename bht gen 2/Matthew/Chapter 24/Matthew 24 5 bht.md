# Matthew 24:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During the period leading up to the destruction of Jerusalem, there was a rise in false Christs and prophets who claimed to be the Messiah. These impostors took advantage of the heightened Messianic hopes of the Jewish people and falsely professed to be the deliverers they were longing for. The presence of these deceivers was a fulfillment of Jesus' warning that many would come in His name and deceive many. The prevalence of these impostors indicates the desperation and vulnerability of the people as they awaited the fulfillment of God's promised Messiah.
