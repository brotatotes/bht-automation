# Matthew 24:50 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ is the ultimate authority, even over those who are unfaithful and sinful. His coming is not hindered by doubt or disbelief; in fact, it serves as a reminder that He will come unexpectedly, catching people off guard. This unexpected and sudden coming occurred in the past when He executed judgment on the Jewish nation, and it will happen again on the day of judgment.
