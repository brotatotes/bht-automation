# Matthew 24:51 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The punishment described in this passage signifies more than just earthly affliction, as it symbolizes a dreadful separation of one's conscience and actions that will torment and condemn the wicked. The wicked servant mentioned is not merely a hypocrite, but one who will receive the punishment deserving of hypocrites. Regardless of the degree of their wrongdoing, both those who falsely claim godliness and those who do not believe will share the same fate. Let us therefore seek God's grace to reform our lives and avoid the devastating consequences of hypocrisy.

2. "Such a servant is not necessarily a mere hypocrite, but his conduct deserves and will receive the punishment allotted to hypocrites."

### John Gill:
