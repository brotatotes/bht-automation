# Matthew 24:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In times of wars and rumors of wars, we must not give in to fear. These conflicts are not random, but serve as warnings of imminent destruction. They mark the end of an era, but not the end of the world. Instead, they signal the beginning of sorrowful events which will ultimately lead to a greater purpose. So, let us be watchful and not be overwhelmed by these tribulations, for they are part of a divine plan for lasting peace. Trusting in God's sovereignty, we can navigate through these uncertain times with hope and perseverance.
