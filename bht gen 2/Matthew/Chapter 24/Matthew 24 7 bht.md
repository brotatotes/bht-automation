# Matthew 24:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom, indicating conflicts within the Jewish nation and between different nations. This prophecy foreshadows the devastating wars and seditions that plagued the Jews, leading to their ultimate calamity. Famines further emphasize the impending destruction, as one severe famine in Jerusalem resulted in many deaths. The mention of earthquakes serves as both literal seismic activity and metaphorical political upheaval, symbolizing the chaotic events preceding the destruction of Jerusalem. These verses encompass the crises and challenges that characterized the New Testament dispensation, culminating in the downfall of the Jewish nation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom." - At Caesarea the Jews and Syrians contended about the right to the city, and twenty thousand of the Jews were slain. At this blow the whole nation of the Jews was exasperated, and carried war and desolation through the Syrian cities and villages.
2. "And there shall be famines." - There was a famine foretold by Agabus Acts 11:28, which is mentioned by Tacitus, Suetonius, and Eusebius, and which was so severe in Jerusalem, Josephus says, that many people perished for want of food.
3. "Earthquakes." - In prophetic language, earthquakes sometimes mean political commotions. Literally, they are tremors or shakings of the earth, often shaking cities and towns to ruin. The earth opens, and houses and people sink indiscriminately to destruction. Many of these are mentioned as preceding the destruction of Jerusalem.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Nation shall rise against nation, etc. Primarily, national uprisings of the Jews." 
2. "Even the times preceding the dissolution of the Roman Empire have not exhausted this prediction."
3. "The passage combines in one view the whole of the various social, physical, and climatic crises of development in the whole New Testament dispensation."

### John Gill:
1. "This seems to be a distinct and third sign, foreboding the general calamity of the Jews; that there should be not only seditions and intestine wars, in the midst of their country, but there should be wars in other nations, one with another; and with the Jews, and the Jews with them."
2. "And there shall be famines: a fourth sign of the desolation of the city and temple."
3. "And pestilences: a pestilence is described by the Jews after this manner: 'a city that produces a thousand and five hundred footmen, as Cephar Aco, and nine dead men are carried out of it in three days, one after another, lo! this is a pestilence'."
