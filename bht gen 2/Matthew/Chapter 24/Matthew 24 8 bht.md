# Matthew 24:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These sorrows mark the beginning of something far more severe to come, as if a woman is in the pains of childbirth. The sufferings of the Messiah, referred to as 'the sorrows of the Messiah' by the Jews, align with these intense sorrows. It is the death throes of the Jewish state, preceding the regeneration of the universal Christian Church. These woes should not be seen as proof of the end, but rather the beginning. They serve as a reminder of the importance of faith in Jesus, the true Messiah, as the only means of escaping the calamities.
