# Matthew 24:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During times of affliction, persecution, and even death, the disciples were warned that they would encounter hatred from all nations. This fulfilled prophecy illustrated the unpleasant reality that the gospel, although it bore the most glorious name, would often be met with opposition and disdain. The disciples would face deliverance into the hands of those who saw them as the cause of trouble and would be subjected to beatings and imprisonment by civil authorities. The universal abhorrence that they would experience was not proof of their faith, but rather the result of bearing the name of Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "To be afflicted - By persecution, imprisonment, scourging, etc."
2. "Ye shall be hated of all nations - This was fulfilled then, and has been in all ages. It was judged to be a crime to be a Christian. Multitudes for this, and for nothing else, were put to death."
3. "For my nameâ€™s sake - On account of attachment to me, or because you bear my 'name as Christians'."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ treats here strictly of the afflictions which the disciples had to endure on account of the gospel."
2. "He intended to warn his disciples that the doctrine of the gospel, of which they were to be witnesses and messengers, would never be pleasant or agreeable to the world."
3. "Christ means that his gospel will be so much the more fully attested, when they have defended it at the risk of their lives."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Then, i.e., â€˜during this time,â€™ not â€˜after this.â€™"
2. "They shall deliver you up, etc. Soon literally fulfilled. But it may now be referred to the spirit of persecution, always latent in the world and to break out in the last times."
3. "Hated of all the nations. (Mark and Luke: â€˜of all men;â€™ comp. chap. Matthew 10:22). The Roman historian Tacitus speaks of the early Christians as a hated race of men. But to be universally abhorred is not a proof of being a Christian. It must be for my nameâ€™s sake. This hatred has not ceased; it will probably manifest itself anew in startling form."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Ye shall be hated... to emphasize the continuous process of the linear action." 
2. "For tribulation, a word common... for the oppression (pressure) that the Christians received."
3. "The most glorious name in the world today, but soon to be a byword of shame... The disciples would count it an honour to be dishonoured for the Name's sake."
