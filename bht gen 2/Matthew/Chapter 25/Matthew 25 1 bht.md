# Matthew 25:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parable speaks to the distinction between genuine and nominal Christians, illustrating the fate of believers during the time preceding Jerusalem's destruction. It cautions against the possible exclusion from heaven, urging believers to discern the authenticity of their faith. While Christ initially came in humble form, clothed as a servant, his second coming will showcase him as a triumphant bridegroom. The parable's connection to the previous chapter underscores its relevance in understanding the events surrounding Jerusalem's destruction.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The difference consists in some having made a provision for feeding the lamps in case of delay, and the others none and the moral of the parable is the blessedness of endurance unto the end."
2. "The interpretation is these are souls come out from the world into the Church, and there waiting for the coming of the Lord not hypocrites, but faithful souls, bearing their lamps..."
3. "All views of this parable which represent the foolish virgins as having only a dead faith, only the lamp without the light, the body without the spirit, &c., are quite beside the purpose; the lamps were all burning at first, and for a certain time."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This entire and beautiful change of figure brings out the lesson of the former parable in quite a new light."
2. "But let it be observed that, just as in the parable of the Marriage Supper, so in this—the Bride does not come into view at all in this parable; the Virgins and the Bridegroom holding forth all the intended instruction."
3. "nor could believers be represented both as Bride and Bridal Attendants without incongruity."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The phrase here refers to his coming in the day of judgment."
2. "The marriage relation is the most tender, firm, and endearing of any known on earth, and on this account it suitably represents the union of believers to Christ."
3. "These torches were dipped in oil, and gave a large light."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Lamps [λαμπαδας] . Lit., torches. Probably a short, wooden stem held in the hand, with a dish at the top, in which was a piece of cloth dipped in oil or pitch."

### John Calvin:
1. "By this term is meant the condition of the future Church, which was to be collected by the authority and direction of Christ."
2. "He employs this remarkable title, that believers may not deceive themselves by an erroneous opinion that they have arrived at absolute perfection."
3. "The general instruction of the parable consists in this, that it is not enough to have been once ready and prepared for the discharge of duty, if we do not persevere to the end."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The best explanation is: that the bridegroom was coming from a distance, before the wedding; that the virgins went out to meet him to attend him to the wedding at the house of the bride, where the marriage was to take place."
2. "Christ, the Bridegroom, comes from a distance, the bride is the Church; but she is not mentioned here, while the ‘virgins’ represent the individuals making up the Church, as do the guests in the parable of the wedding of the king’s son (chap. Matthew 22:1-14)."
3. "Other views refer this to the procession, after the wedding, to the bridegroom’s house, where the closing festivities were held. This accords with Eastern customs, but is far less appropriate."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The scene is apparently centered round the house of the bride to which the bridegroom is coming for the wedding festivities."
2. "But Plummer places the scene near the house of the bridegroom who has gone to bring the bride home. It is not pertinent to the point of the parable to settle it."
3. "Probably torches with a wooden staff and a dish on top in which was placed a piece of rope or cloth dipped in oil or pitch."

### John Gill:
1. "The parable is manifestly connected with, and refers to the preceding chapter, which chiefly treats of Jerusalem's destruction."
2. "The design of it is to show, what will be the case of professors at that time; the difference between nominal and real Christians; how far persons may go in a profession of religion, and yet, at last, be shut out of heaven."
3. "His first appearance was mean, in the form of a servant, in the likeness of sinful flesh, in garments rolled in blood; but when he comes a second time, he will appear as a bridegroom in his nuptial robes."
