# Matthew 25:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parable of the ten virgins portrays the contrast between the wise and the foolish. The foolish virgins made some efforts to prepare but lacked the necessary oil, symbolizing a true readiness for the coming of the bridegroom. They were shut out when he finally arrived. In contrast, the wise virgins were prepared and entered in with the bridegroom. The shutting of the door signifies the finality of their fate. The shut door separates the eternal joy and communion with Christ experienced by the wise virgins from the regret and loss faced by the foolish ones.
