# Matthew 25:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The foolish virgins found themselves in a dire situation when they discovered the door shut in their faces. These virgins were different from the wise ones, as they were unprepared and lacked true devotion. They did not truly acknowledge the bridegroom as their Lord, merely giving him the title without the obedience he deserved. However, despite the door being shut, they still had hope that their pleas and entreaties could persuade the bridegroom to open it. This emphasizes the persistence of the self-deceived and showcases their desperate attempt to gain entry into the kingdom.
