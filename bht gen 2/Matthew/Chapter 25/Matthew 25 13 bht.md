# Matthew 25:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Watch therefore in all aspects of your life - in your prayers, in your thoughts, in your actions. Hold the light of faith and keep your vessel filled with the oil of the Spirit. Be aware that the time of the Lord's coming is unknown, whether it be in death, judgment, or His second coming. Stay vigilant, for He will come at an unexpected hour. Though you may be at peace, remain watchful, for the day is certain, and it is our duty to be prepared.

1. "Watch therefore,.... In ordinances, in prayer, public and private, in hearing the word, at the Lord's supper, and in every religious exercise; over the heart, the thoughts and affections of it; over words, actions, life, and conversation; and against all sin and unbelief, Satan's temptations, the world, and its charms and snares, false teachers, and their doctrines, and for the bridegroom's coming."
2. "This is the use and application of the whole parable, and shows the general design of it; the reason to enforce watchfulness follows:for ye know neither the day nor the hour; of death, or of judgment, or of the coming of the son of man, of one or the other."
3. "That he will come is certain, and that quickly; the time is fixed, but when it will be is unknown; and therefore it becomes us to be our watch and guard."
