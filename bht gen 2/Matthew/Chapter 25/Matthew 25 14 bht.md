# Matthew 25:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The kingdom of heaven is like a man traveling to a far country, representing the Lord Jesus going into heaven. It is described as a better country, out of sight, symbolizing its distance and the heavenly realm. The parable refers to a specific group of people, the ministers of the word, who are depicted in a vivid manner. These faithful and slothful servants are meant to represent the ministers of the Gospel, entrusted with the rich treasure of divine truths. May all who hear this parable have the ears to hear and hearts to understand its message.

"by 'his own servants' are meant, not all mankind...nor all the elect of God only, or all are not the elect of God that are designed...but ministers of the word are here meant...for the ministers of the word, whether faithful or slothful, good or bad, are in a very lively manner described in this parable."
3. "The Gospel, that rich treasure of divine truths, the dispensation of it, and gifts to preach it; all which are Christ's goods and his gifts, and not man's."
