# Matthew 25:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the parable, each person is given different abilities or gifts from God, which are entrusted to them according to their own capacity. These gifts can range from natural talents and riches to ministerial gifts, such as those that qualify individuals to preach the Gospel. There is no Pelagianism involved, as the powers and abilities themselves are granted by God. While the distribution of these gifts may seem unequal, each person is expected to faithfully use what they have been given. Ultimately, God is the one who assigns people to fill certain roles and expects them to fulfill their responsibilities.
