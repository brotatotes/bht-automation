# Matthew 25:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The person in question appears to have been indifferent towards the gift they received, neither using it for their own benefit nor for the benefit of others. They neglected their duty and had a strong attachment to earthly possessions. Perhaps they lacked the ambition or drive to fully utilize their talents, using their perceived inadequacy as an excuse. Instead of embracing their calling or purpose, they chose to hide away what was entrusted to them. This raises the question for us all: Are we also concealing the talents bestowed upon us by God?
