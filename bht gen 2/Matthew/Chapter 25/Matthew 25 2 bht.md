# Matthew 25:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parable of the ten virgins emphasizes the importance of wisdom in our spiritual lives. The distinction between the wise and foolish is not based on moral goodness, but on their understanding of salvation. The wise virgins are those who recognize their need for salvation, put their faith in Christ, and live according to their profession of faith. In contrast, the foolish virgins rely on external factors or false foundations. This parable serves as a reminder to approach our faith with wisdom, understanding the significance of salvation and diligently preparing for our eternal destiny.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "They are not distinguished into good and bad, but into 'wise' and 'foolish'â€”just as in those who reared their house for eternity are distinguished into 'wise' and 'foolish builders'; because in both cases a certain degree of goodwill towards the truth is assumed."
2. "To make anything of the equal number of both classes would, we think, be precarious, save to warn us how large a portion of those who, up to the last, so nearly resemble those that love Christ's appearing will be disowned by Him when He comes."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is reasonable, that the heavier the charge which any man sustains, and the more important the matters in which he is employed, the wisdom with which he conducts himself should be the greater."
2. "He demands wisdom from all the children of God in general, that they may not, through inconsiderate rashness, expose themselves to be the prey of Satan."
3. "Now this kind of wisdom he describes by saying, that they are to provide themselves with the supplies necessary for completing the course of their life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. Matthew 25:2.  And five of them were foolish, etc. This equal division may have a meaning. The correct order is transposed in the common version.
	

### John Gill:
1. "The wise virgins are such, who are wise unto salvation; who not only know the scheme of it, but are sensible of their need of it; apply to Christ for it; venture their souls on him, and commit them to him."
2. "The wise virgins are also wise in the business of a profession, as well as in the affair of salvation; they take up a profession of religion aright, upon principles of grace, and after mature thought and deliberation; hold it fast without wavering, walk becoming it in their lives and conversations."
3. "The foolish virgins are those who build their hopes of salvation on birth privileges, on a carnal descent from good men, on a religious education, on their own righteousness, or on the absolute mercy of God; and not on Christ, the one only, and sure foundation."
