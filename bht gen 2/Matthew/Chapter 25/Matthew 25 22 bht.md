# Matthew 25:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parable teaches us that both servants who received two talents are commended equally for their faithfulness. They are praised in the same terms and receive the same reward. They are entrusted with a lesser degree of ministerial gifts, but they both demonstrate diligence in trading and gaining. As a result of their faithful stewardship, they are invited to enter into the joy of their lord, sharing in the joy that belongs to their master himself.
