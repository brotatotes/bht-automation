# Matthew 25:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Matthew 25:23, we see the same commendation for the same faithfulness, even though the amount entrusted was smaller. This shows us that in spiritual matters, faithfulness is the measure of success. It doesn't matter if someone has lesser gifts or is of less usefulness, they can still be just as good and faithful in their service. Ultimately, in the glory of the future, the joy and happiness of all the saints will be the same. Good and faithful servants are commended by Christ and receive great things, not because they deserve it, but because of His grace and goodness.

1. "A man that has lesser gifts, and is of less usefulness, may be as good and as faithful in his service, and as praiseworthy, as a man of greater gifts, and more extensive usefulness."
2. "Whatever difference may be made between the saints, or between one minister and another in the Millennium state, yet in the ultimate glory, their joy, bliss, and happiness, will be alike."
3. "Good and faithful servants are indeed commended by Christ, and he graciously promises great things to them, which are not proportioned to their deserts... and bids them 'enter into the joy of their Lord'; into the joy, which of his grace and goodness, he has provided for them, and not which they have merited and procured for themselves."
