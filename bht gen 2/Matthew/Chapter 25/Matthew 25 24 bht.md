# Matthew 25:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do not negate or underestimate the gifts and talents that God has given us. No matter how small or few, we are still responsible for using them for the good of others and for the glory of God. It is a common excuse to view God as harsh and demanding, but this is not the true nature of our Lord. He generously bestows his grace and gifts, and only requires from us what he has already equipped us to do. Let us not blame God for our own failures, but acknowledge our own responsibility and dependence on his grace.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I knew thee that thou art an hard man—harsh."
2. "The sense is obvious: 'I knew thou wast one whom it was impossible to serve, one whom nothing would please: exacting what was impracticable, and dissatisfied with what was attainable.'"
3. "Thus do men secretly think of God as a hard Master, and virtually throw on Him the blame of their fruitlessness."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "No one is excused for neglecting his duty because he has few talents."
2. "A hard man - Of a sordid, griping disposition; taking advantage of the poor, and oppressing them."
3. "Reaping ... - This is indicative of an avaricious and overbearing disposition; compelling the poor to sow for him, and reaping all the benefit himself."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Hard [σκληρος] . Stronger than the austere [αυστηρος] of Luke 19:21 (see there), which is sometimes used in a good sense, as this never is."
2. "The scattering refers to the winnowing of the loosened sheaves spread out upon the threshing - floor. 'The word,' as Trench observes 'could scarcely be applied to the measured and orderly scattering of the sower's seed. It is rather the dispersing, making to fly in every direction.'"
3. "Hence used of the pursuit of a routed enemy (Luke 1:51); of the prodigal scattering his good; making the money fly, as we say (Luke 14:13); of the wolf scattering the sheep (Matthew 26:31)."

### John Calvin:
1. "This harshness has nothing to do with the substance of the parable... Christ did not intend to describe such rigor."
2. "Christ only means, that there will be no excuse for the indolence of those who both conceal the gifts of God, and waste their time in idleness."
3. "Hence also we infer that no manner of life is more praiseworthy in the sight of God, than that which yields some advantage to human society."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A common excuse: the master is hard and selfish. Men represent God as demanding from them what they cannot perform."
2. "'This is man's lie, to encourage himself in idleness' (Alford). Didst not scatter. A repetition of the former thought, the sowing being represented as a scattering to bring into contrast the gathering into the bam."
3. "A reference to 'winnowing' is less satisfactory."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Note the perfect active participle to emphasize the fact that he still had it." 
2. "Experimental knowledge (γινωσκω) and proleptical use of σε." 
3. "Harsh, stern, rough man, worse than αυστηρος in Luke 19:21, grasping and ungenerous."

### John Gill:
1. "For he that has the least gifts, is accountable for them; and therefore ought to make use of them to the good of his fellow creatures, and the interest of his Lord and Master."
2. "This wicked servant goes on to traduce him, and adds, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed: which seem to be proverbial expressions."
3. "Christ is neither niggardly, nor exacting; he requires nothing that is not his, and gives his grace, and bestows his gifts liberally, and upbraids not; nor does he call any to service, of whatsoever sort, but he gives them grace, strength, and abilities, proportionate to it."

### John Wesley:
1. "He never knew God, who thinks him a hard master."
2. "Requiring more of us than thou hast given us power to perform."
3. "Every obstinate sinner, in one kind or other, lays the blame of his own sins on God."
