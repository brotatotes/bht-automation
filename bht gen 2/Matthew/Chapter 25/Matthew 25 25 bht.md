# Matthew 25:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The servant's fear was not a valid reason, but rather an excuse for his failure to make use of the talent given to him. He was afraid of losing the talent or not gaining enough from it, ultimately fearing the severity of his master's judgment. However, simply preserving the talent without making any effort to improve it was deemed inadequate. It is important to recognize that fear should not hinder us from using our gifts and fulfilling our responsibilities.
