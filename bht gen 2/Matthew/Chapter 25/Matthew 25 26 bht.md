# Matthew 25:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If we truly know the character of God, we are called to not only avoid doing wrong but also actively do what is right. The parable of the slothful servant expresses the disappointment of the master towards one who neglected his responsibilities and buried his talents. The servant's failure to act diligently and utilize his God-given abilities is deemed wickedness. The underlying message is that it is not enough to merely avoid sin; we are called to actively pursue righteousness and make the most of the gifts and opportunities we have been given.
