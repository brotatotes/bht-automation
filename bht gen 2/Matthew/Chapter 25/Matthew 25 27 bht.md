# Matthew 25:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Therefore, it was necessary for you to have entrusted my money to the bankers so that it could have been safe and also increased in value, and then I would have received it back with profit. This is not to encourage usury, but rather to criticize the laziness and lack of effort shown by this servant. He failed to act upon his own reasoning and the character he had described of his master.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 27. thou oughtest therefore to have
	put my money to the exchangers—the bankers. 
	and then at my coming I
	should have received mine own with usury—interest.

1. "The 'exchangers' were persons who were in the habit of borrowing money, or receiving it on deposit at a low rate of interest, to be loaned to others at higher interest."
2. "This money was left with the servant, not to exchange, nor to increase it by any such idle means, but by honest industry and merchandise."
3. "The word 'usury,' in our language, has a bad signification, meaning unlawful or exorbitant interest. This was contrary to the law."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Put [βαλειν] . Lit., throw or fling down, as one would throw a bag of coin upon the exchanger's table."
2. "Usury [τοκω] . A very graphic word, meaning first childbirth, and then offspring. Hence of interest, which is the product or offspring of capital."
3. "The Jewish law distinguished between interest and increase. In Rome very high interest seems to have been charged in early times. Practically usury was unlimited."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Thou oughtest therefore to have put. Lit. 'thrown,' i.e., thrown on the money-table, which required no exertion."
2. "To the bankers; the Greek word has the same etymology as the English one. These probably represent stronger spiritual characters who would have quickened his spirituality."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It was a necessity (εδε) that he did not see." 
2. "Usury only means 'use' in itself. The word is from τικτω, to bring forth."

### John Gill:
1. "Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers... put it into the hand of these bankers, where it would have been not only safe... but also would have made some increase, and would have been returned with profit..."
2. "...this is said not so much to encourage usury, though it may be lawful... but to reprove the sloth and inactivity of this servant..."
3. "...upon his own reasonings, and the character he had given of his master."

### John Wesley:
1. Thou oughtest therefore — On that very account, on thy own supposition, to have improved my talent, as far as was possible.
