# Matthew 25:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through this command, whether it refers to spiritual or temporal gifts, it is made clear that God may take away the talent given to someone who fails to utilize it properly. Such gifts can fail, cease, and vanish. However, those who are diligent and laborious in their service are rewarded with even more spiritual light and knowledge. In a sense, the act of judgment on the slothful servant becomes an act of mercy to the faithful one, as their own gifts appear all the more illustrious in comparison to the laziness of others.
