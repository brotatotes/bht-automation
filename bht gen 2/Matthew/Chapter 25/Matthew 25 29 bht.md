# Matthew 25:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Throughout history, God has consistently adhered to the principle of giving more to those who already possess. This principle, as seen in Matthew 13:12, reflects God's faithfulness and commitment to rewarding those who are already blessed. Since the beginning of time, God has operated in accordance with this process, ensuring that those who have been entrusted with gifts and talents receive even more abundance. It is a divine expression of grace, granted to those who have demonstrated their ability to faithfully steward what they have been given.
