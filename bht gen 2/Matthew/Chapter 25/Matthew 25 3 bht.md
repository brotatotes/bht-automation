# Matthew 25:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parable of the ten virgins tells of those who were foolish and brought their lamps but no oil. These virgins lacked the oil of grace, failing to realize their need until it was too late. It is important to have a lasting grace of the Spirit, which is holy, sanctifying, and valuable. The lamp represents faith, and without the oil of grace, faith cannot sustain itself. This parable serves as a reminder to be prepared with the oil of grace, continuously filling and maintaining the lamp of faith, ensuring its endurance and effectiveness.
