# Matthew 25:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The unprofitable servant, who does no service for his Master, is described as useless and is cast into outer darkness. This contrast of light and darkness highlights the consequences for those banished from God's kingdom. The connection between this parable and the previous ones is evident. It alludes to the future Marriage Supper of the Lamb. The servant's wickedness stems from his slothfulness, a reminder that mere harmlessness is not enough for salvation. These parables reinforce the truth that there is no such thing as negative goodness, appearing multiple times in this chapter.
