# Matthew 25:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
At the final judgment, all nations, including both Gentiles and Jews, will be gathered together. The distinction made will be based on the true believers in Christ versus those who only profess to be Christians. The angels, who will accompany Christ, will assist in this gathering. The judge, being all-knowing, will easily discern between those who have true faith in their hearts and those who only have a mere outward profession.
