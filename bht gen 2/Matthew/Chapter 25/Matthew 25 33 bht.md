# Matthew 25:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The believers, symbolized by the sheep, will be set on Christ's right hand which signifies honor and respect. This placement of the sheep reflects Christ's affection for them and foreshadows their future exaltation and glory. In contrast, the goats, representing the wicked, will be placed on the left, which denotes dishonor and condemnation. As a mark of disaffection, this position signifies their disgrace and miserable condition. These distinct positions not only represent Christ's judgment but also serve as a preview of the different outcomes that await the righteous and the wicked.
