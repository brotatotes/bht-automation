# Matthew 25:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The inheritance of the kingdom which the saints are called to enjoy is not by their own merit, but is a gracious gift from God. The promise of this heavenly kingdom has been prepared and designated for believers since the foundation of the world. This indicates that God's purpose of redemption was not a reactionary plan after the fall of angels. Rather, it emphasizes the grandeur and magnificence of the happiness and glory that await the saints in the place prepared for them by God.

2. "Blessed of my Father - Made happy or raised to felicity by my Father" 
3. "Prepared for you... - That is, 'designed' for you, or appointed for you. The phrase 'from the foundation of the world' is used to denote that this was appointed for them in the beginning; that God has no new plan; that the rewards which he will now confer on them he always intended to confer."

### John Calvin:

3. "Yet we must observe another object which our Lord had in view.
