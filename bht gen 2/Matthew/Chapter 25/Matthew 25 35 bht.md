# Matthew 25:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
I was hungry, and ye gave me meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink. These acts of outward mercy require faith and love, and are accompanied by works of spiritual mercy. The Judge could not mention works such as recalling someone to the truth or bringing them to repentance, as these are not tangible acts. However, visiting prisoners is crucial, as they are often lonely and abandoned by others. These deeds of compassion and care are not only physical but also spiritual, reflecting the grace and love bestowed upon us by God.
