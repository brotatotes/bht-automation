# Matthew 25:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the righteous are called to account, they respond to Christ's description of their actions with astonishment and disbelief. The righteousness they possess is not of their own doing, but a righteousness imputed to them by Christ. Therefore, they do not have the same estimation of their own works as the Judge does. They understand that their works are not the basis of their justification or acceptance with God, but rather it is their faith and trust in the person, blood, righteousness, and sacrifice of Christ.

2. "But as this was not so deeply impressed on their minds as it ought to have been, he holds out to them this lively representation."
3. "The admiration which Christ here expresses is intended to instruct us to rise above the apprehension of our flesh, whenever afflicted brethren ask our confidence and aid, that the aspect of a despised man may not hinder us from treating him with kindness."

### John Gill:
1. "From whence it appears, that only such shall be at the right hand of Christ, who are righteous persons, who have the righteousness of Christ imputed to them."
2. "And those, upon hearing such works ascribed unto them, will, with wonder and astonishment, reply, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungered, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?"
3. "Which shows, that they had put no confidence in their works, or depended upon them for their justification before God, and acceptance with him; these were out of sight, and mind; their only trust being in the person, blood, righteousness, and sacrifice of Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "It cannot be, that either the righteous or the wicked should answer in these very words."
2. "What we learn herefrom is, that neither of them have the same estimation of their own works as the Judge hath."
