# Matthew 25:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people had always experienced Jesus as fully satisfied, both physically and spiritually, never witnessing his hunger or thirst. However, during his earthly life, Jesus indeed experienced these human needs but was miraculously provided for by angels and supported by generous women who gave from their own possessions. The people had also observed how Jesus cared for his followers, including the poor, by ensuring they were clothed and their physical needs were met.
