# Matthew 25:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus bore the illnesses of his people, yet he never experienced sickness himself or imprisonment. This is a familiar experience for many of God's servants, including John the Baptist, Peter, and Paul, who were treated tenderly and affectionately by their fellow believers. It is a reminder of the selflessness and burden-bearing that characterizes the lives of those who serve God. Despite the hardships they face, they continue to demonstrate love and compassion. This serves as an example for us to follow, showing kindness and support to one another in times of trial and persecution.
