# Matthew 25:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The foolish, lacking the essential preparation for meeting Christ, were insufficient and lacking the inward reality of grace. The wise, on the other hand, sought and received the oil of grace from Christ and had this principle of light, life, love, and holiness dwelling in their hearts. This inward supply of grace, received from the Spirit of Jesus Christ, distinguished the wise and made them vessels of God's making, sanctified and filled with the oil of God's grace.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "the insufficiency of this without something else, of which they never possessed themselves, shows that 'the foolish' mean those who, with all that is common to them with real Christians, lack the essential preparation for meeting Christ."
2. "this supply of oil must mean that inward reality of grace which alone will stand when He appears whose eyes are as a flame of fire."
3. "this supply of oil, then, representing that inward grace which distinguishes the wise, must denote, more particularly, that 'supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,' which, as it is the source of the new spiritual life at the first, is the secret of its enduring character."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In their vessels (εν τοις αγγειοις). Here alone in the N.T., through αγγη in Matthew 13:48."
2. "Extra supply in these receptacles besides the oil in the dish on top of the staff."

### John Gill:
1. "They were concerned for the true grace of God, being enlightened by the Spirit of God... and having received it from him, through the power of the Holy Ghost, exercised it on him; and herein lay their wisdom." 
2. "They went to Christ for it; and having received it from him... these are vessels of God's making, though through sin are become impure, and empty of all spiritual good... sanctified by the Spirit of God, the wise virgins had the oil of grace, which is an internal thing."
3. "It is a principle of light, life, love, and holiness wrought in a man's heart; it has its seat in the mind, understanding, and judgment, in the will, conscience, and the affections."

### John Wesley:
1. The wise took oil in their vessels — Love in their hearts. And they daily sought a fresh supply of spiritual strength, till their faith was made perfect.
