# Matthew 25:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus said, Inasmuch as ye did it to one of the least of these my brethren, ye did it to me, he revealed the profound truth that our actions towards the marginalized and needy are a direct reflection of our relationship with Him. The emphasis on treating others with compassion and kindness serves as a reminder of the honor bestowed upon them as brothers and sisters in Christ. This profound understanding should motivate us to actively engage in acts of generosity and love towards all, as we recognize the presence of Christ in every person we encounter.
