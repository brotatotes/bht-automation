# Matthew 25:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who are on the left hand will be sentenced to depart into the everlasting fire, which was specifically prepared for the devil and his angels. This signifies that the punishment they will face was not intended for them originally, but they have chosen to align themselves with the devil and his rebellion against God. They are warned of their impending fate, in order to recognize the gravity of their actions and turn towards the path of righteousness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "As for you on the left hand, ye did nothing for Me. I came to you also, but ye knew Me not: ye had neither warm affections nor kind deeds to bestow upon Me: I was as one despised in your eyes."
2. "But thus ye treated these little ones that believe in Me and now stand on My right hand. In the disguise of these poor members of Mine I came soliciting your pity, but ye shut up your bowels of compassion from Me: I asked relief, but ye had none to give Me."
3. "Take back therefore your own coldness, your own contemptuous distance: Ye bid Me away from your presence, and now I bid you from Mineâ€”Depart from Me, ye cursed!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To curse" is the opposite of "to bless." It implies a negation of all the blessings of heaven, and a positive infliction of eternal sufferings.
2. The image of fire is used to express extreme suffering, as a death by burning is one of the most horrible that can be conceived.
3. The fact that the wicked will be eternally punished, cursed of God, should awe every spirit, and lead every man to strive most earnestly to secure his salvation.

### John Calvin:
1. "He threatens, therefore, that he will come as their Judge, and that he will make them forget those luxurious enjoyments to which they are now so entirely devoted...believers, warned of their dreadful ruin, may not envy their present lot."
2. "For as promises are necessary for us, to excite and encourage us to holiness of life, so threatenings are likewise necessary to restrain us by anxiety and fear... believers may not envy their present lot."
3. "But now Christ says, that hell is prepared for the devil, that wicked men may not entertain the belief that they will be able to escape it... in their crime is plainly seen the cause of their destruction, when they reject the grace of their calling."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "All these differences show that God is ever merciful, and that the punishment on those 'accursed' is a just one, that they go to torment prepared for the devil and his angels, because they have prepared themselves for it." 
2. "The word eternal means never-ending, scarcely admits of a doubt; it is used in Matthew 25:46 of the life of the righteous."
3. "Only sins of omission are mentioned; the absence of good works, the destitution of love, or the dominion of selfishness is sufficient, even without positive crimes, to exclude from heaven."

### John Gill:
1. "They are banished from his presence, which is what is commonly called the punishment of loss; the loss of the presence of God, Father, Son, and Spirit, angels, and saints; and is thought to be greater than the punishment of sense, hereafter expressed." 
2. "The phrase [everlasting fire] expresses the intolerable fierceness of [God's wrath], and its perpetual continuance; the sense of which, without intermission, will ever be felt in the conscience; and is the punishment of sense, the wicked will forever endure." 
3. "It is here said to be prepared for the devil and his angels; showing, that the same punishment will be inflicted on hypocrites and carnal professors, as on the devils themselves."

### John Wesley:
1. Depart into the everlasting fire, which was prepared for the devil and his angels â€” Not originally for you: you are intruders into everlasting fire.
