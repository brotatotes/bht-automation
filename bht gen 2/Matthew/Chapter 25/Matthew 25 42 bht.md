# Matthew 25:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Some who claimed to be Christians failed to meet the needs of the needy, even though they dwelt among believers and professed the Christian name. By not giving to the poor members of Christ in distress, they displayed their lack of true faith and love for Christ. Their failure to show compassion revealed that they did not belong to Christ and were not genuine believers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "No meat (ουκ εδωκατε μο φαγειν). You did not give me anything to eat. The repetition of the negative ου in Matthew 25:42 and Matthew 25:43 is like the falling of clods on the coffin or the tomb."
2. "The surprise here shown both by the sheep and the goats. Some sheep will think that they are goats and some goats will think that they are sheep."

### John Gill:
1. "These were such as dwelt among Christians, and professed the Christian name, and yet disregarded the poor members of Christ in distress."
2. "Did not communicate to them for Christ's sake; which showed that they had no true faith in him, and love to him."
3. "Manifest tokens and evidences that they did not belong to Christ, were not true believers in him, nor had they any real love to him."
