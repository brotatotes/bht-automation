## BHT:
The failure to show compassion and kindness towards the needy is highlighted by these quotes. They emphasize neglect and indifference towards those who are suffering, which is opposite to the behavior of the righteous. The lack of care for the poor, sick, and imprisoned leads to a different judgment for these individuals. This serves as a reminder of the importance of demonstrating love and compassion towards others in need.

2. "Did not take the poor members of Christ into their houses, and take care of them in their families, when they were obliged to flee from their places of abode, or wandered about preaching the Gospel; and who must have perished in the streets, if others, that bore the Christian name, had not been more compassionate than they."
3. "Their conduct, behaviour, and character, are just the reverse of the righteous, and therefore it is no wonder that their sentence is different."
