# Matthew 25:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On the day of judgment, those who have deceived themselves with empty excuses will be confronted with the truth. Just as they had deceived themselves into thinking that their excuses would suffice, they will come to realize that their self-righteousness holds no weight in the presence of God. This serves as a warning for us to examine our own hearts and ensure that we are not falling into the trap of self-deception and pride.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "The same kind of striking delineation which Christ had formerly employed is now repeated, in order to inform the reprobate, that their vain excuses, by which they now deceive themselves, will be of no avail to them at the last day."
2. "For whence comes the great cruelty of their pride towards the poor, but because they think that they will not be punished for despising them?"
3. "To destroy this self-complacency, our Lord gives them warning, that they will one day feelâ€”but when it will be too lateâ€”what they do not now deign to consider, that those who are now so greatly despised are not less esteemed by Christ than his own members."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A self-righteous plea of ignorance, implying that they would have done such good works, had they seen Him."
2. "Many fancy they would do good to Christ, who fail to see Him in the person of His followers."
3. "The deceitful fancy often continues until the day of retribution."

### John Gill:
1. "Hence it is clear again, that these men were nominal Christians, who had made a profession of Christ."
2. "They own him as Lord; and suggest that they had seen him, and known him, though never in such circumstances."
3. "If they had, such was their love to him, and great respect and veneration for him, as they pretend, they would, to be sure, have ministered unto him."

### John Wesley:
1. Then will they answer â€” So the endeavour to justify themselves, will remain with the wicked even to that day!
