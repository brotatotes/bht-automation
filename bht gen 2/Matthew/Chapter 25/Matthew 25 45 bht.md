# Matthew 25:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Christ confronts those who failed to do good to His followers, He sternly responds, expressing His deep disappointment in their lack of love towards Him. By neglecting to show kindness to the least among His brethren, they effectively demonstrated their disregard for Christ Himself. This omission of good deeds towards His people becomes the public reason for condemning them. In this passage, Christ emphasizes His identification with the poor, needy, and strangers, affirming them as His own brothers and sisters. This serves as a profound reminder that our treatment of others reflects our love for Christ.

### John Gill:
1. "Then shall he answer them,.... With a stern countenance, in great resentment, as one highly offended, and with the authority of a judge:saying, verily I say unto you, inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not unto me..."
2. "...he reckoned this neglect of them, and want of compassion to them, all one as if he himself in person had been so treated..."
3. "...if then judgment will righteously proceed against men for sins of omission, much more for sins of commission; and if such will be dealt with in this manner, who have taken no notice, and shown no respect to the members of Christ; what will the end be of those, who are injurious to them, their persons, and properties, and persecute and kill them?"
