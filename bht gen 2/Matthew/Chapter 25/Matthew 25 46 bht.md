# Matthew 25:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The punishment and reward mentioned in this passage are contrasting terms. The punishment is not mere annihilation but rather a state of everlasting misery and suffering, in contrast to the reward of everlasting blessedness and bliss. The wicked will be punished in the sight of the righteous, while the righteous will enter into eternal life. The word everlasting denotes unlimited duration, both for punishment and reward. The details of these realities are awe-inspiring and withheld, but the irrevocable sentence will be executed and witnessed by all.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The same epithet is used for κόλασις and ζωή which are here contraries for the ζωή here spoken of is not bare existence, which would have annihilation for its opposite; but blessedness and reward, to which punishment and misery are antagonist terms."
2. "I very much questioned whether the thorough study of Scripture prophecy would not make me more and more distrustful of all human systematizing, and less willing to hazard strong assertion on any portion of the subject."
3. "The coincidence of these portions with the process of the great last things in Revelation 20:1-15; Rev 21:1-27 is never to be overlooked, and should be our guide to their explanation, however distrustful we may be of its certainty."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Sentence, it should seem, was first pronounced—in the hearing of the wicked—upon the righteous, who thereupon sit as assessors in the judgment upon the wicked...but sentence is first executed, it should seem, upon the wicked, in the sight of the righteous." 
2. "Their descent into 'their own place' will be witnessed by the righteous, as BENGEL notes." 
3. "This is said to be 'prepared for the devil and his angels,' because they were 'first in transgression.' But both have one doom, because one unholy character."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Sin is nothing but an 'act'... and, to be reached at all, it must be reached by punishing the offender himself."
2. "It [the word 'punishment'] does not mean simply a 'state or condition,' but absolute, positive suffering; and if this word does not teach it, no word 'could' express the idea that the wicked would suffer."
3. "The literal meaning of the word ['everlasting'] expresses absolute eternity... the obvious and plain interpretation of the word demands this signification in this place... it denotes unlimited duration... the same sense of unlimited duration must be given it when used of future punishment."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word ‘punishment’ expresses positive misery, not ‘annihilation;’ especially ‘life,’ the contrasted expression, means here far more than mere continued existence."
2. "Endless and boundless life is contrasted with endless and boundless misery."
3. "The two facts, one transcendently glorious, the other unspeakably awful, are revealed: the details, blissful and terrible alike, are wisely withheld."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The word κολασιν comes from κολαζω, to mutilate or prune. Hence those who cling to the larger hope use this phrase to mean age-long pruning that ultimately leads to salvation of the goats, as disciplinary rather than penal."
2. "The same adjective αιωνιος is used with κολασιν and ζωην. If by etymology we limit the scope of κολασιν, we may likewise have only age-long ζωην."
3. "The difficulty to one's mind about conditional chastisement is to think how a life of sin in hell can be changed into a life of love and obedience."

### John Gill:
1. "Their excuses will not be regarded, their pleas will be of no avail, their pretensions to interest in Christ, and love to him, will be set aside; the sentence will remain irrevocable..."
2. "...these goats, or formal professors, shall be obliged, whether they will or not, to depart from the presence of Christ; the angels will be ordered to take and cast them into everlasting burnings..."
3. "...the righteous into life eternal; such as are justified by the righteousness of Christ... these shall go into heaven, the place appointed for them, to enjoy that eternal life in soul and body, which is the free gift of God, through Christ..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Either therefore the punishment is strictly eternal, or the reward is not: the very same expression being applied to the former as to the latter."
2. "The wicked shall then go away into everlasting fire, in the view of the righteous. Thus the damned shall see nothing of the everlasting life; but the just will see the punishment of the ungodly."
3. "It is not only particularly observable here, 1. That the punishment lasts as long as the reward; but, 2. That this punishment is so far from ceasing at the end of the world, that it does not begin till then."
