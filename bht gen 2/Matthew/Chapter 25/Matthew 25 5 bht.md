# Matthew 25:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
While awaiting the bridegroom, they all fell into a state of slumber and sleep, which can be viewed as both a physical and spiritual condition. This slumbering does not necessarily imply laziness or spiritual declension, but rather a time of waiting and expectancy. It is a time when believers may experience a sense of spiritual peace, whether true or false, while anticipating the coming of Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Christ 'tarries,' among other reasons, to try the faith and patience of His people."
2. "The world 'slumbered' signifies, simply, 'nodded,' or, 'became drowsy'; while the world 'slept' is the usual word for lying down to sleep, denoting two stages of spiritual declension."
3. "Such was the state alike of the wise and the foolish virgins, even till the cry of the Bridegroom's approach awoke them."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The bridegroom tarried - That is, while they waited for him. It was uncertain at what time he would come. He delayed longer than they expected."
2. "All slumbered and slept - Waiting until near midnight, they fell into repose."
3. "This circumstance is designed simply to show more clearly the 'duty of being ready.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Slumbered and slept [ενυσταξαν και εκαθευδον] . Slumbered is, literally, nodded."

### John Calvin:
1. "Some interpret this slumbering in a bad sense, as if believers, along with others, abandoned themselves to sloth, and were asleep amidst the vanities of the world; but this is altogether inconsistent with the intention of Christ, and with the structure of the parable."
2. "There would be greater probability in explaining it to denote death, which overtakes believers before the coming of Christ; for it is not at that time only that we must look for salvation, but also when we have left the world and are sleeping in Christ."
3. "But I take it more simply as denoting earthly occupations, in which believers must be engaged, so long as they dwell in the body; and, though forgetfulness of the kingdom of God ought never to steal upon them, yet the distracting influence of the occupations of this world is not inappropriately compared to sleep."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Now while the bridegroom tarried; as they were waiting for him; an allusion to the delay of the Lord."
2. "All slumbered and slept. Sleep overcame them, even while trying to keep awake. This probably refers to a gradual forgetfulness of, or ceasing to expect at once, the coming of Christ. It indicates an unconscious giving way to the influence of the world."
3. "Christ’s coming will be unexpected by all, even by those who make calculations about it."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They all slumbered and slept" - They dropped off to sleep, nodded (ingressive aorist) and then went on sleeping (imperfect, linear action), a vivid picture.
2. "Many a preacher has seen this happen while he is preaching." - Many a preacher has seen this happen.

### John Gill:
1. "Because such an expectation will not be answered, or Christ will not come so soon as was hoped for, and expected, a general drowsiness, and security, and unconcernedness, especially about the coming of Christ, will fall upon the churches."
2. "Christ tarries to try the graces of his people, who should exercise faith in his coming, by looking, watching, and waiting for it, desirous of it, and hastening unto it; being ready for him, prepared to receive him, and to go with him to the nuptial-chamber."
3. "And by this slumber, and sleep, is not meant a natural death; though that is sometimes called a sleep, and to which true believers are subject, as well as others; yet all at the coming of Christ will not be asleep in this sense."

### John Wesley:
1. "While the bridegroom delayed - That is, before they were called to attend him, they all slumbered and slept..."
2. "...they all slumbered and slept - Were easy and quiet, the wise enjoying a true, the foolish a false peace."
