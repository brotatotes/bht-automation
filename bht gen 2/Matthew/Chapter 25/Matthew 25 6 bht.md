# Matthew 25:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The cry at midnight is a call that resounds unexpectedly, like a thief in the night. It breaks the silence and prompts a decisive change, awakening those who were asleep and ushering in a sense of urgency. The coming of the Bridegroom is imminent, and it will be a momentous event that will bring about great astonishment and wonder. This cry serves as a reminder to be ready, prepared, and expectant for the arrival of the Lord. It warns against complacency and encourages vigilant anticipation, as no one knows the exact time when the cry will come.
