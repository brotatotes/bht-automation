# Matthew 25:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parable of the ten virgins highlights the importance of being prepared for the coming of the bridegroom. The foolish virgins, although proactive in trimming their lamps and attempting to make themselves ready, lacked the essential oil of grace. True believers may experience seasons of spiritual decline but will ultimately rise again in their faith, as they are sustained by the power of God. The lesson here is that external acts of preparation cannot replace the need for a genuine, enduring spiritual life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Looking at the mere form of the parable, it is evident that the folly of 'the foolish' consisted not in having no oil at all... their folly consisted in not making provision against its exhaustion."
2. "The parable behooved to accommodate itself... by making the lamps of the foolish to burn, as well as those of the wise, up to a certain point of time, and only then to discover their inability to burn on for want of a fresh supply of oil."
3. "The real difference between the two classes who profess to love the Lord's appearing is a radical oneâ€”the possession by the one class of an enduring principle of spiritual life, and the want of it by the other."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Trimmed their lamps - Burning until midnight, the oil was exhausted: they gave a dim and obscure light."
2. "They trimmed them by removing the burnt parts of the linen or the torch, so that they would burn clear."
3. "This strikingly represents the conduct of most people at the approach of death. They then begin to make ready. They are alarmed, anxious, and trembling, and then they ask the aid of others, but often when it is forever too late."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Then all those virgins arose...the virgins, those former ones." 
2. "Trimmed...meaning to put in order or arrange." 
3. "Their lamps...emphasizing the personal preparation in contrast with the foolish."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Arose, and trimmed their lamps, i.e., trimmed the wick and put on fresh oil, so as to make a brilliant flame."
2. "'All' did this; the foolish virgins were not lacking in effort."
3. "But mere trimming does little good if there is no oil."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "The wicks were trimmed, the lights being out while they slept, fresh oil put in the dish, and lit again."
3. "A marriage ceremony in India is described by Ward (View of the Hindoos) in Trench's Parables: 'After waiting two or three hours, at length near midnight it was announced, as in the very words of Scripture, 'Behold the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.'"


### John Gill:
1. "True believers may fall into a very low condition, with respect to the exercise of grace, and discharge of duty; but they shall arise again, for they are held and upheld by the right hand of God."
2. "The foolish virgins also arose; which may intend some awakenings of conscience, and reformation of life, and a more diligent attendance on duties and ordinances; all which they did to make them meet for Christ, and to obtain salvation; but after all it appears, they were destitute of the oil of grace."
3. "The former by removing what hindered the clear burning of them; by casting off the works of darkness, and causing the light of good works to shine before men, in the discharge of them, from a principle of grace."

### John Wesley:
1. They trimmed their lamps â€” They examined themselves and prepared to meet their God.
