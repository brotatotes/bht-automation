# Matthew 25:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The foolish virgins in the midnight hour represent those who, in their desperation, acknowledge their lack. Their cry, Give us of your oil, for our lamps are gone out, reveals their dead faith. This realization comes too late, as they find themselves without oil when they need it the most. It serves as a sobering reminder that seeking grace and assistance from others at such a critical juncture is futile, for no mere mortal can provide the help that is truly needed.
