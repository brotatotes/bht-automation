# Matthew 25:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The wise replied with a resounding denial, not out of selfishness but out of indignation and a sense of insufficiency. Their immediate response reflected their astonishment at the state of those who had previously received their assistance. They understood that each person should have enough grace for themselves, as no one can possess more holiness than what they need. They made it clear that the opportunity to obtain the necessary grace had passed and would not be given again.

A flat denial; and which sprung not from want or compassion; nor from a narrow, niggardly spirit...nor from an uncivil, morose, and churlish disposition; or from a careless and indolent one...but from an indignation at the honor put upon them, and the slight put upon God and Christ, and the Spirit of grace."
2. "This denial arose from a consciousness of insufficiency to help them."
3. "Directing them to go to proper persons for grace; not to men, even ministers of the Gospel, nor to angels; but to God the Father, the Father of mercies, and God of all comfort, who sits on a throne of grace, and gives it liberally to them that come to him for it through Christ, and ask it of him."
