# Matthew 26:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The act of anointing Jesus was not just a good work, but a noble act of love that should be remembered in all churches. It was motivated by a genuine and sincere love for Christ, springing from a secret movement of the Spirit. Christ defended the cause of the woman against the criticism of His disciples, showcasing His approval of her good work. However, it is often disheartening when even fellow believers speak against acts of genuine love and devotion to Christ. Regardless, these acts of love and honor should be cherished and celebrated, as they bring glory to Him.
