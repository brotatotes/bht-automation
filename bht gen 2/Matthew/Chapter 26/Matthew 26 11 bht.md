# Matthew 26:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ's words remind us that our care for the poor should not be limited to a single act, but be a continual duty towards humanity. The presence of poverty in the world highlights the ongoing need for us to reach out and help those in need, serving as a reminder of the opportunities we have to lay up treasures in heaven through our acts of compassion and generosity. Through these actions, we align ourselves with God's wise and gracious providence, fulfilling our calling to care for those less fortunate (Quotes 1, 2, 3).

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "Christ plainly makes this exception, that what he wished to be done once would not be agreeable to him in future."
2. "True, indeed, we know and fed by the experience of faith, that he is present with us by power and spiritual grace; but he is not visibly with us, so as to receive from us earthly honors."
3. "This passage teaches us that, though the Lord commands us to dedicate to him ourselves and all our property, yet, with respect to himself, lie demands no worship but that which is spiritual, and which is attended by no expense, but rather desires us to bestow on the poor what superstition foolishly expends on the worship of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The main point is, that this opportunity could never return; while the care of the poor would be a daily 'duty to humanity down to the end of time.'"
2. "The act was justified by the special occasion. It ought not to be cited to defend expensive modes of worship at the cost of neglecting the poor."
3. "This verse suggests that no reorganization of society will ever banish poverty from the earth. There is but one way of doing this, namely, by Christâ€™s people recognizing the poor as 'with them' and under the impulse of love like that of Mary, making the care of them the usual expression of that love."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ seems to have respect to Deuteronomy 15:11, and which, agreeably to the sense of the Jews, refers to the times of the Messiah: for they say, 'there is no difference between this world (this present time) and the times of the Messiah, but the subduing of kingdoms only... for the poor shall never cease out of the land.'" 
2. "Our Lord's words also show, that there will always be poor persons in the world; that there will always be such with his people, and in his churches; for God has chosen, and he calls such by his grace."
3. "Referring not to his divine and spiritual presence, which he has promised to his people, churches, and ministers, to the end of the world, but to his corporeal presence; for he was to be but a little while with them, and then go to the Father."

### John Wesley:
1. "Such is the wise and gracious providence of God, that we may have always opportunities of relieving their wants."
2. "Opportunities of relieving their wants, and so laying up for ourselves treasures in heaven."
