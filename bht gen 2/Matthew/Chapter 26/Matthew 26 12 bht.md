# Matthew 26:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Mary's anointing of Jesus was not simply about the fragrance of the ointment, but rather a symbolic act in preparation for His burial. It is likely that Mary understood Jesus' predictions of His impending death, making her action a demonstration of her deep understanding and loyalty. Jesus interpreted her act as an anointing for His burial, symbolizing not only the embalming of His body, but also confirming His previous teachings about His approaching death. Through this act of love and devotion, Mary unknowingly fulfilled a significant role in the fulfillment of prophecy.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I can hardly think that our Lord would have said this, unless there had been in Mary's mind a distinct reference to His burial, in doing the act."
2. "All the company surely knew well that His death, and that by crucifixion, was near at hand: can we suppose one who so closely observed His words as Mary, not to have been possessed with the thought of that which was about to happen?"
3. "The προέλαβεν μυρίσαι μου τὸ σῶμα of Mark ( Mar 14:8 ) and the ἵνα εἰς τὴν ἡμ . τοῦ ἐνταφ . μου τηρήσῃ αὐτό of John ( Joh 12:7 ) point even more strongly to her intention."

### John Calvin:
1. "By these words Christ confirms what we have said, that the precious ointment was not valued by him on account of its odor, but solely in reference to his burial."
2. "It was because he wished to testify by this symbol, that his grave would yield a sweet odor, as it breathed life and salvation through the whole world."
3. "Since Christ, in departing from the sepulcher, perfumed not one house, but the whole world, by the quickening odor of his death, it would be childish to repeat an action for which no reason and no advantage could be assigned."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Mary may have been aware of the predicted crucifixion, and thought of His actual burial when she anointed Him."
2. "The Lord gives to acts of love a significance beyond the intention."
3. "The expressions in Mark 14:8; John 12:7, imply that she had a presentiment of an impending crisis, after which anointing would be unnecessary or impossible."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Mary alone had understood what Jesus had repeatedly said about his approaching death."
2. "The disciples were so wrapped up in their own notions of a political kingdom that they failed utterly to sympathize with Jesus as he faced the cross."
3. "Mary with the woman's fine intuitions did begin to understand and this was her way of expressing her high emotions and loyalty."

### John Gill:
1. "She did it for my burial; not for the interment of his body, but for the embalming of it, previous to it."
2. "Either this woman had some revelation made to her, that the death of Christ was near at hand, and she feared, or knew, she should not be able to anoint him when dead; and therefore, as Mark has it, 'she hath done what she could; she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying,'"
3. "The Holy Ghost directed her to this action, with this view, as it were, for the performing of these funeral rites before he was dead."

### John Wesley:
1. "She hath done it for my burial — As it were for the embalming of my body."
2. "Indeed this was not her design: but our Lord puts this construction upon it."
3. "To confirm thereby what he had before said to his disciples, concerning his approaching death."
