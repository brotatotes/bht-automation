# Matthew 26:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Judas Iscariot, one of Jesus' twelve apostles, was not just a common hearer or follower, but a trusted companion who was called, qualified, and sent forth by Jesus to preach the Gospel. Despite this close relationship, Judas had a hidden motive - avarice - which ultimately led to his betrayal of Jesus. Even after Christ's admonition during the Last Supper, Judas remained unchanged, immediately going to make an infamous bargain with his enemies. Let this be a solemn reminder for us to examine our own hearts and repent early, lest we allow the reign of Satan to take hold within us.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "Christ’s admonition was so far from being of any avail for softening the heart of Judas, or producing any change in it for the better, that he immediately went away, without any concern, to transact an infamous bargain with his enemies."
2. "The bare mention of the burying ought to have softened a heart of iron; for it would have been easy to infer from it, that Christ offered himself as a sacrifice for the salvation of the human race."
3. "Let us therefore learn to repent early, lest our long-continued harshness should confirm the reign of Satan within us; for as soon as we have been abandoned to this tyranny, his rage will have no bounds."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The principal motive [for Judas' betrayal], as is inferred from the strong expression of John, was avarice."
2. "The character of Judas laid him open to this Satanic influence, and nothing could do this more effectually than love of gain."
3. "The rest were neither well instructed nor highly spiritual, and in outward appearance Judas was probably equal to any of them."

### John Gill:
1. "He was not an open enemy, nor one of Christ's common hearers, nor one of the seventy disciples, but one of his twelve apostles."
2. "He made his intimates and associates; whom he selected from all others, and called, qualified, and sent forth to preach his Gospel, and perform miracles."
3. "It was one of these that meditated the delivery of him into the hands of his enemies, and never left pursuing his scheme till he had effected it."

### John Wesley:
1. Mark 14:10; Luke 22:3.
