# Matthew 26:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They haggled over the price, settling at thirty shekels of silver, the amount paid for a servant's life. This price itself was a demeaning insult, as it equated the value of the Son of God to that of a mere slave. Judas, motivated by his greed, was willing to sell out his Master for this sum. In contrast, Mary demonstrated selfless love by freely spending her resources. The transaction exposed not only Judas's avarice but also the low regard the religious leaders held for Jesus.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Thirty shekels, the price of the life of a servant..." 
2. "The mention of thirty pieces of silver with the verb ·ºîœÉœÑŒ∑œÉŒ±ŒΩ has arisen from the prophecy of Zechariah, which St. Matthew clearly has in view." 
3. "It is just possible that the thirty pieces may have been merely earnest-money, but a difficulty attends the supposition."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "What will ye give? [œÑŒπ Œ∏ŒµŒªŒµœÑŒµ ŒºŒøŒπ Œ¥ŒøœÖŒΩŒ±Œπ? ] Rather, What are ye willing to give me? It brings out the chaffering aspect of the transaction."
2. "Thirty pieces of silver [œÑœÅŒπŒ±Œ∫ŒøŒΩœÑŒ± Œ±œÅŒ≥œÖœÅŒπŒ±] . Matthew refers to Zechariah 11:12. These pieces were shekels of the sanctuary, of standard weight, and therefore heavier than the ordinary shekel."
3. "He who 'took on him the form of a servant' was sold at the legal price of a slave."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The price was itself an insult, since this was the price for the life of a slave (Exodus 21:2). Our Lord died the death of a slave and a malefactor, that He might redeem us from the slavery and eternal misery of sin."
2. "Thirty pieces of silver. Silver shekels, each worth a little more than two shillings, or fifty cents."
3. "Some think that this was the earnest money. But Judas returned thirty pieces (chap. Matthew 27:3), and the answer then given him indicates that the rulers were done with him."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Mary and Judas extreme opposites: she freely spending in love, he willing to sell his Master for money."
2. "The use of Œ∫Œ± with a co-ordinate clause is a colloquialism...the traitor mean in style as in spirit."
3. "These thirty silver shekels were equal to 120 Œ¥ŒµŒΩŒ±œÅŒπ, less than five English pounds, less than twenty-five dollars, the current price of a slave."

### John Gill:
1. "They did not tempt him, by first offering him so much money, if he would betray him; but he himself first moves it to them, and tempts them with it to offer him an handsome reward."
2. "The value of a shekel of gold... was, of our money, 'fifteen shillings'; and some make it to come to a great deal more; to 'one pound sixteen shillings and sixpence' sterling."
3. "This was the 'goodly price', which Christ, who appeared in the form of a servant, was prized at, according to the prophecy in Zechariah 11:12, and which the high priests thought a very sufficient one."

### John Wesley:
1. "They bargained with him for thirty pieces of silver - about three pounds fifteen shillings sterling; or sixteen dollars sixty-seven cents."
