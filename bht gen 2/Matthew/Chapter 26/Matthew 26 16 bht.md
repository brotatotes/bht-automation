## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "Opportunity. A time and place suited to the crafty policy of the Sanhedrin. The ‘opportunity ‘soon offered; only one night intervened."
2. "To betray him, or ‘deliver him up.’ The same word as in Matthew 26:2; Matthew 26:15. Judas was not merely to tell where they could take him, but himself to be the active agent in taking Him and transferring Him into the hands of His enemies (see Matthew 26:47-50; Matthew 26:57). So that ‘betray ‘is the real meaning."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Sought opportunity  (εζητε ευκαριαν). A good chance. Note imperfect tense. Judas went at his business and stuck to it. 

### John Gill:
1. "he narrowly watched, and diligently observed, the best and most fitting season to perform his enterprise"
