# Matthew 26:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On the first day of unleavened bread, which fell on a Thursday, the disciples sought the guidance of Jesus on how to make preparations for the Passover. This day carried great significance, as it marked the commemoration of the Israelites' hurried departure from Egypt, when they had no time to leaven their dough. Understanding their master's instructions was crucial, as the Passover meal was traditionally eaten in Jerusalem. The disciples' inquiry demonstrates their commitment to faithfully observe the Passover and their willingness to assist a householder in making the necessary arrangements for the feast.
