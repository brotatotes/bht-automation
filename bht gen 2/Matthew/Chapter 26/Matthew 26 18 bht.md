# Matthew 26:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Lord's words, My time is at hand, indicate that he is referring to the time of his suffering. This phrase does not mean the time of the feast, but rather his own appointed time for the sacrifice. It is significant because it reveals that Jesus had a deep understanding of his upcoming suffering and willingly embraced it, showing that he was not constrained by external circumstances, but rather acting according to his own divine knowledge and purpose.
