# Matthew 26:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The events that took place during the celebration of the Passover provide significant insight into the subsequent circumstances. The supper commenced with the consumption of unleavened bread and bitter herbs, symbolizing the unleavened, sinless life of Jesus and the bitter trials he would face. During this meal, Jesus consecrated the bread and the cup, transforming them into a perpetual reminder of his sacrificial death for humanity. This act foreshadowed the ultimate fulfillment of the Passover lamb in Christ, who would become the true Sacrifice that would bring redemption to all who believe.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The delivery of our Lord to be crucified, and the taking place of the Passover, strictly coincided."
2. "The solemn mention of them in this connexion is equivalent to a declaration from Himself, if it were needed, of the identity, both of time and meaning, of the two sacrifices."
3. "The latter clause, καὶ ὁ υἱὸς κ . τ . λ . depends on οἴδατε as well as the former."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The 'opportunity' which he sought, therefore, was one in which the multitude would not see him, or could not rescue the Saviour."
2. "The word 'betray' commonly means to deliver into the hands of an enemy by treachery or breach of trust; to do it while friendship or faithfulness is 'professed.' All this took place in the case of Judas."
3. "But the word in the original does not necessarily imply this. It means simply to 'deliver up,' or to give into their hands."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Son of Man is betrayed according to the divine decree."
2. "The present tense expresses here something which, though future, is as good as present, because already determined, or because it must ensue in virtue of an unalterable law."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "After two days. This means, 'the day after tomorrow,' according to Jewish usage."
2. "The passover cometh... The lamb was not consumed on the altar, nor made the portion of the priests, but used as food by the household of the offerer."
3. "Delivered up to be crucified. The prophecy here is of the time. The events had already been foretold. That time was appointed, because our Lord would thus fulfil all that was typified in the Passover."

3. "Thus Jesus sets a definite date for the coming crucifixion which he has been predicting for six months."

### John Gill:
1. "This was said on Tuesday, and on the Thursday following, the passover began. Christ speaks of this as a thing well known to the disciples, as it must be, since it always began on a certain day."
2. "Christ knew not only that he should be betrayed, but he knew from the beginning who would betray him; he not only knew that he should die, but he knew what kind of death he should die, even the death of the cross; and he knew the exact time when he should die."
3. "The crucifixion and death of Christ were not casual and contingent events, but were determined by the counsel of God, with all circumstances attending."

### John Wesley:
1. "The manner wherein this was celebrated gives much light to several circumstances that follow."
