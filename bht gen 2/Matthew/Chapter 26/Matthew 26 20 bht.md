# Matthew 26:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Judas, who had deceitfully waited for this opportune moment, took his place among the disciples as if he was innocent and friendly. The posture of reclining was the customary way the Jews ate during the Passover, lying back on their left side on couches. This custom was so distinct that they acknowledged it in their declaration, highlighting the difference of this night from all others. On all other nights, they ate either sitting or lying in any way they pleased, but on this night, they all reclined.
