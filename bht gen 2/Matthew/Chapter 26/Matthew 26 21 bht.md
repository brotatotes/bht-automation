# Matthew 26:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On this particular night, it is customary to recount the signs and wonders that were done by God for our ancestors in Egypt. This repetition serves as a way to engage the children, to pique their curiosity, and to emphasize the distinctiveness of this night compared to all other nights. In fact, it is necessary for everyone to say these three words, the passover, the unleavened bread, and the bitter herbs, in order to fulfill the obligation of this important occasion.
