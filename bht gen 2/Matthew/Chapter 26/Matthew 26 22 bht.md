# Matthew 26:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples, although aware of the cruelty that awaited Jesus, were astonished and could not fathom which one among them would betray Him. They fervently denied any involvement in such an atrocious sin, incapable of even considering it. Their concern stemmed from their recognition of the deceitfulness of their hearts and fear that, if left to their own devices, they might succumb to committing such an awful iniquity. It was the result of their profound self-awareness and dread of their own potential for treachery.
