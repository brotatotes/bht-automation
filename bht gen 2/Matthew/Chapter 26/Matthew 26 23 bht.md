# Matthew 26:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus stated, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, he was referring to Judas who was dipping his hand into the dish alongside him. This action was an indication to the disciples of the betrayer's identity. The dish they were using was filled with vinegar, in which they dipped their bitter herbs as part of the Passover meal. Through this symbolic act, Jesus gave his disciples a clear signal to recognize the one who would betray him.
