# Matthew 26:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The death of Jesus was not a mere accident, but a divine appointment to atone for the sins of the world. Scripture testifies to this truth, for it is written that the Son of Man would go through suffering and ultimately be glorified. Though God ordained Christ's death for our redemption, Judas showed his treachery and avarice in betraying Jesus, bringing upon himself righteous condemnation. In fact, it would have been better for Judas if he had never been born, emphasizing the severity of his punishment and raising questions about the doctrine of universal salvation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "But the usefulness of this doctrine extends much farther; for never are we fully confirmed in the result of the death of Christ, till we are convinced that he was not accidentally dragged by men to the cross, but that the sacrifice had been appointed by an eternal decree of God for expiating the sins of the world."
2. "For though God, by his righteous judgment, appointed for the price of our redemption the death of his Son, yet nevertheless, Judas, in betraying Christ, brought upon himself righteous condemnation, because he was full of treachery and avarice."
3. "Hence it is evident that it is but an ignorant subterfuge which is employed by those who betake themselves to bare foreknowledge."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Son of man goeth, even as it is written of him."
2. "Woe unto that man... Our Lord seems to forget His own woes in pity for this man."
3. "Good were it for that man... forbidding the thought of any deliverance however remote."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "There are some today who seek to palliate the crime of Judas."
 
2. "But Jesus here pronounces his terrible doom."
3. "And Judas heard it and went on with his hellish bargain with the Sanhedrin."

### John Gill:
1. "The phrase is expressive of his death, as in Joshua 23:14, and denotes the voluntariness of it, and which is no ways inconsistent with the divine determinations about it."
2. "Christ died for the sins of his people, in perfect agreement with these Scriptures, which were written of him."
3. "It would have been better for him [Judas] if he had not been created, signifying that it is better to have no being at all, than to be punished with everlasting destruction."

### John Wesley:
1. "The Son of man goeth through sufferings to glory, as it is written of him."
2. "Miserable will that man be: it had been good for that man if he had not been born."
3. "May not the same be said of every man that finally perishes? But who can reconcile this, if it were true of Judas alone, with the doctrine of universal salvation?"
