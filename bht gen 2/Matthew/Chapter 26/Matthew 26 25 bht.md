# Matthew 26:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Though Judas boldly asks if he is the one who will betray Jesus, his hardened heart prevents him from showing any guilt or concern. Despite being warned about being the betrayer, Judas persists in his audacious inquiry, suggesting that he couldn't possibly be the guilty one. In his response, Jesus acknowledges Judas's statement by affirming that it is indeed as Judas has said.

1. "If the question  μήτι ἐγώ εἰμι ; before, represented  ἔβλεπον εἰς ἀλλήλους ἀπορούμενοι , and was our author’s impression of what was in reality not a  spoken but a  signified question, why now also should not this question and answer represent that Judas took part in that ἀπορία , and was,  not by word of mouth, but by a decisive sign , of which our author was not aware, declared to be the traitor?"
