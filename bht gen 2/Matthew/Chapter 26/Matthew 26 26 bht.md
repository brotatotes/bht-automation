# Matthew 26:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The bread, which Jesus took and broke, symbolized his body that would be broken as a sacrifice for the sins of his people. It was a representation of his impending sacrifice, not a literal transformation. As the disciples took and ate the bread, they were symbolically receiving and feeding on Christ through faith. This act of communion replaced the Old Testament passover, continuing the tradition of using bread to signify a deeper spiritual meaning. Through this symbolic act, believers are reminded of Christ's death and his incredible love for us.

3. "In the literal meaning then, this (is) my Body, we have BREAD, 'the staff of life,' identified with THE BODY OF THE LORD: not that particular ἄρτος with that particular σάρξ which at that moment constituted the Body before them, nor any particular ἄρτος with the present Body of the Lord in heaven: but τοῦτο, the food of man, with τὸ σῶμά μου."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus broke one of the passover wafers or cakes that each might have a piece, not as a symbol of the breaking of his body as the Textus Receptus has it in 1 Corinthians 11:24."
2. "The bread as a symbol represents the body of Jesus offered for us, 'a beautifully simple, pathetic, and poetic symbol of his death' (Bruce)."

2. "Now when he says, 'this is my body', he cannot mean, that that bread was his real body; or that it was changed and converted into the very substance of his body; but that it was an emblem and representation of his body, which was just ready to be offered up, once for all."
3. "The words, 'take, eat', show that Christ did not put the bread into the mouths of the disciples, but they took it in their hands, and ate it; expressive of taking and receiving Christ by the hand of faith, and feeding on him in a spiritual manner."
