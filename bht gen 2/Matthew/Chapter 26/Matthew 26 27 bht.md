# Matthew 26:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
At the Last Supper, Jesus took the cup of thanksgiving, symbolizing the gratitude expressed by the Jews after their meals. This act of Jesus was consistent with the customary practice of the master of the family giving each individual a cup after supper. By engaging in this tradition, Jesus emphasizes the significance and continuity of the Passover feast, while also foreshadowing the ultimate sacrifice of his own blood for the forgiveness of sins.
