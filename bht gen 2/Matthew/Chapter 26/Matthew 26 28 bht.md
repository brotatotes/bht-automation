# Matthew 26:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The blood of the Lamb of God, shed for us, is not only sprinkled on but actually partaken and assimilated by the faithful soul, making it the blood of the new covenant. Wine, in general, is nourishment to us in Christ, but in the context of the new covenant, it holds a peculiar propriety as a symbol of His blood. In the sacrament, we receive not the forgiveness of sins itself, but the refreshing and confirming assurance of being forgiven. Through His death, Jesus brought about the actual forgiveness of sins, and His blood represents this covenant relationship with God.

1. "The blood of the Lamb of God, slain for us, being not only, as in the former case, sprinkled on, but actually partaken spiritually and assimilated by, the faithful soul, is the blood of the new covenant."
2. "Wine, in general, does not represent by itself the effects (on the creation) of the blood of Christ; it, like every other nourishment of the body, is nourishment to us by and in Him, forasmuch as in Him all things consist: but there is no peculiar propriety whereby it is to us his Blood alone. But it is made so by a covenant office which it holds in his own declaration."
