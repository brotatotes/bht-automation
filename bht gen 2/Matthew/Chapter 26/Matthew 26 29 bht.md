Jesus is indicating that his time with them is limited, implying that his stay would be short. He uses the language of tasting wine to symbolize the enjoyment and fullness of the future glorious kingdom of God. By abstaining from wine until that time, Jesus emphasizes the distinct and unparalleled nature of the heavenly kingdom. His disciples are assured that they too will partake in this joyful celebration with him.
