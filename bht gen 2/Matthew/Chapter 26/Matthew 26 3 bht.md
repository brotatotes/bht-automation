# Matthew 26:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The gathering mentioned consisted of the heads of families, those who had held the high priest position, and the selected members of the great council, known as the Sanhedrin.

They chose to meet at the high priest's palace to maintain privacy and to discuss important matters without drawing attention.
