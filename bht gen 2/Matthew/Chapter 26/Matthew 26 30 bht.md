# Matthew 26:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples sang a hymn, which was likely the second part of the Jewish Hallel, consisting of six psalms from the 113th to the 118th. After this, Jesus and his disciples went out, possibly to the mount of Olives, which was about two miles from Jerusalem and was the place where the high priest performed significant rituals. This location holds great symbolism for Christ, the great high priest, and his disciples, as it is where his sorrows and sufferings began.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The ὕμνος was in all probability the last part of the Hallel, or great Hallel."

3. "Luke adds κατὰ τὸ ἔθος namely, of every evening since his return to Jerusalem."

1. "Sung a hymn. Very probably the second part of the Jewish Hallel or Hallelujah, embracing Psalms 115:116, Psalms 115:117, Psalms 115:118."
2. "They went out. In the original institution of the Passover it was enjoined that no one should go out of his house until morning (Exodus 12:22). Evidently this had ceased to be regarded as obligatory."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Between the hymn and the going out we must insert the discourse and prayer of John 14-17."
2. "The place of eating the Passover was probably kept concealed, to give time for that closing interview, appropriately called, 'the Holy of Holies.'"

1. "The last part of the 'Hallell', Christ deferred to the close of his supper there being many things in it pertinent to him, and proper on this occasion."
2. "The place where he went with his disciples, was the Mount of Olives, which was on the east side of Jerusalem; and was the place where the high priest stood, and burnt the red heifer, and sprinkled its blood."
3. "In this same way it is very probable, went Christ the great high priest, who was typified by the red heifer, and his companions the disciples, to the same place, where he had his bloody sweat, and where his sorrows and sufferings began."

### John Wesley:
1. "The hymn...consisteth of six psalms, from the 113th to the 118th."
