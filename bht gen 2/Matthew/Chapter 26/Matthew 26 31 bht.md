# Matthew 26:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus said, All ye will be offended at me, he was foretelling an event in which the disciples would stumble and fall away from him. This was in accordance with the prophecy in Zechariah 13:7, which speaks of a time when a shepherd would be struck and his flock scattered. This was not just a casual prediction, but a realization that fear and dread would cause the disciples to abandon Jesus and seek their own safety. However, this was all part of God's sovereign plan, as the sufferings of Christ were ordained by his will and his command.
