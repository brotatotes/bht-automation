## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In this announcement our Lord seems to have in mind the remainder of the verse in Zechariah: 'and I will turn ( הֵשִׁיב , reducere manum, i.e. impiis sublatis curam agere, &c. Schröder) mine hand upon the little ones.'"
2. "Our Lord gives the announcement of its fulfilment, in a promise to precede them ( προάγ ., a pastoral office, see Joh 10:4 ) into Galilee, whither they should naturally return after the feast was over: see ch. Matthew 28:7 ; Matthew 28:10 ; Matthew 28:16."
3. "I confess that I see no improbability in the case; but the three references to this promise just quoted make it surely in the highest degree improbable that it should have been subsequently foisted in. We do not find such elaborate attempts to preserve the appearance of consistency in our Gospels. The reader who sees in it the reference to prophecy, will form a very different opinion."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "I will go before you."
2. "The thought links itself with what Christ had just said about the shepherd and the sheep."
3. "Compare John 10:4."

### John Calvin:
1. "After having treated of the restoration of the Church... declares, that when the government has been brought into a state of confusion, or even completely overturned, there will be a sad and miserable dispersion, but yet the grace of God will be victorious."
2. "I have no doubt that the Lord intended to include that whole period during which, after the tyranny of Antiochus, the Church was deprived of good shepherds, and reduced to a state of desolation; for at that time God permitted the sword to commit fearful devastation, and, by slaying the shepherds, to throw the people into a state of wretched confusion."
3. "Thus we see, that Christ quoted this passage appropriately, that the disciples might not be too much alarmed by the future dispersion, and yet that, aware of their own weakness, they might rely on their Shepherd."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The resurrection is again announced."
2. "The figure of a shepherd is continued."
3. "In Galilee He collected His disciples."

### John Gill:
1. "But after I am risen again... he should rise again; and though they should be scattered abroad, yet should be gathered together again by him, their good shepherd..."
2. "who would after his resurrection, appear to them, be at the head of them, and go before them, as a shepherd goes before his sheep..."
3. "I will go before you into Galilee; the native place of most, if not all of them... where they might expect to see him."

### John Wesley:
1. But notwithstanding this, after I am risen I will go before you (as a shepherd before his sheep) into Galilee. Though you forsake me, I will not for this forsake you.
