# Matthew 26:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter's reply to Jesus demonstrates his misguided confidence and failure to understand the true nature of his own weaknesses. While he speaks with sincerity and deep affection, his overconfidence and pride prevent him from recognizing the prophecies about Jesus' resurrection. As a result, Peter underestimates the vulnerability of the other disciples and overestimates his own fidelity. This serves as a reminder of the importance of humility and relying on God's strength rather than our own. Peter's subsequent denials, lasting over an hour, further highlight the magnitude of his betrayal and the consequences of self-reliance.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Nothing can bear a greater impress of exactitude than this reply."
2. "Men do not bring themselves out so strongly (εἰ πάντες, οὐκ ἐγώ: and not only so, but, οὐδέποτε, as opposed to ἐν τῇ νυκτὶ ταύτῃ) unless their fidelity has been previously attainted."

### John Calvin:
1. "Thus the event showed, that Peter promised more for himself than he was able to accomplish, because he had not been sufficiently careful to examine himself."
2. "Believers ought, indeed, to be prepared for the contest in such a manner that, entertaining no doubt or uncertainty about the result and the victory, they may resist fear; for trembling and excessive anxiety are marks of distrust."
3. "We are taught by this example, that we ought to attempt nothing, except so far as God stretches out his hand; for nothing is more fading or transitory than inconsiderate zeal."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Instead of laying hold of the comforting part of the promise, Peter reverts to the first part."
2. "The utterance of affection, yet of self-confidence and arrogance, since 'all' refers to the other disciples."
3. "This reply differs from that given by Luke and John. Its tone points to a previous declaration respecting his want of fidelity."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Peter ignored the prophecy of the resurrection of Jesus and the promised meeting in Galilee." 
2. "He was intent on showing that he was superior to 'all' the rest. Judas had turned traitor and all were weak, Peter in particular, little as he knew it."
3. "The three denials lasted over an hour."

### John Gill:
1. "Though all the men in the world, friends and foes, though even all the rest of the disciples... should be so stumbled at what should befall him, as to flee from him... yet nothing should ever cause him, in the least, to stumble and fall, to desert him, or hesitate about him..." 
2. "No doubt he said this in the sincerity of his heart, and out of his great fervour of affection for Christ..."
3. "...what he failed in, was trusting to his own strength, being self-confident; and in entertaining greater opinion of himself, and his steady attachment to Christ, than of the rest of the disciples..."
