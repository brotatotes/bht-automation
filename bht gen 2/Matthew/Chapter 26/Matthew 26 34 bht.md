# Matthew 26:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Before the early hours of the morning, when the rooster typically crows, Peter would not only deny knowing Jesus, but would do so three times consecutively. It is important to understand that this denial goes beyond a simple rejection of association with Jesus; it represents a denial of faith in Him as the Son of God, a betrayal of their close relationship. The anticipation of the rooster's crow serves as a warning from Jesus, initiating the fulfillment of this prophecy.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The contrast to Peter’s boast, and the climax, is in these words the strongest..."
2. "It is most likely that Peter understood this expression as only a mark of time, and therefore received it, as when it was spoken before, as merely an expression of distrust on the Lord’s part..."
3. "We must not overlook the spiritual parabolic import of this warning. Peter stands here as a representative of all disciples who deny or forget Christ and the watchful bird that cries in the night is that warning voice which ‘speaketh once, yea twice,’ to call them to repentance..."

2. "Before the cock crow a second time, which is most properly the cock crowing, Peter should three times deny his master, as he did."
3. "Cock crowing and midnight are distinguished by the Jews, who say, 'that on all other days they remove the ashes from the altar, at cock crowing, or near unto it, whether before or after; but on the day of atonement, at midnight.'"
