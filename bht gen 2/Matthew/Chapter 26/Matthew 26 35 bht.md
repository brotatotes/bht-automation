# Matthew 26:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Such was the tenderness of our Lord, that he did not rebuke Peter and the disciples for their false confidence, but instead, silently acknowledged their words. He understood the sincerity of Peter's declaration, that even if it meant dying with him, he would never deny him. Jesus chose not to further aggravate their sin, for he knew that their words reflected their love and loyalty, even if they were misguided.
