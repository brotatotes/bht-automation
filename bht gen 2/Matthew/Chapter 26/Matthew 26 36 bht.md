# Matthew 26:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we learn about a significant location called Gethsemane, which is described as a valley of fatness. It was beyond the Kedron torrent, close to the foot of the Mount of Olives. The garden of Gethsemane, with its ancient olive trees, holds a special significance as a sacred memorial in Jerusalem. It is here that our Lord went to seek solace in prayer before His impending trial and crucifixion. We see the example of Jesus, perceiving the distress that awaited Him, retreating to this place for communion with God, highlighting the importance of prayer in times of difficulty.
