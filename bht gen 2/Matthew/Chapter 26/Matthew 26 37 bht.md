# Matthew 26:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of his greatest trial, Jesus sought the company of his disciples to find comfort, but even they could not fully provide the solace he needed. As he prayed to his Father, he experienced a profound sorrow and deep anguish, surpassing anything he had previously known. The weight of his sufferings was unbearable, and he began to be overwhelmed by the immense burden that was placed upon him. In this moment, Jesus fully embraced his humanity, enduring the most intense sorrow and profound grief, all for the sake of our redemption.

### Henry Alford:
1. "He takes with Him, not only nor principally as witnesses of his trial this indeed, in the full sense, they were not but as a consolation to Him in that dreadful hour to ‘watch with Him.’ In this too they failed yet from his returning to them between his times of prayer, it is manifest that, in the abasement of his humanity, He regarded them as some comfort to Him." 
2. "He began, as He had never done before."
3. "ἀδημονεῖν = λίαν λυπεῖσθαι, ἀπορεῖν, Suidas; τὸ βαρυθυμεῖν νοεῖται, Euthym; ἀγωνιᾷν, Hesychius; ἀδήμων, ὁ ἐξ ἄδου, ὅ ἐστι κόρου τινὸς ἢ λύπης, ἀναπεπτωκώς. ἀδημονεῖν, τὸ ἀλύειν καὶ ἀμηχανεῖν, Eustathius."

### John Calvin:
