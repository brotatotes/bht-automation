# Matthew 26:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the face of overwhelming turmoil, Jesus cries out, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death. His soul was beset on all sides with the sins of humanity, leading to a heartbreaking anguish. The sorrows of death and hell surrounded him, leaving little room for comfort. With sorrow overwhelming his being, Jesus retreats a little further to pour out his soul unto God, seeking solace and strength in the midst of his anguish.

### Henry Alford:
1. "Our Lord’s whole inmost life must have been one of continued trouble of spirit...but there was an extremity of anguish now, reaching even to the utmost limit of endurance, so that it seemed that more would be death itself." 
2. "The expression is said to be proverbial...but we must remember that though with us men, who see from below, proverbs are merely bold guesses at truth, with Him, who sees from above, they are the truth itself, in its very purest form." 
3. "The expression ἡ ψυχή μου, in this sense, spoken by our Lord...It is the human soul, the seat of the affections and passions, which is troubled with the anguish of the body...Our Lord’s soul was crushed down even to death by the weight of that anguish which lay upon Him."

### John Calvin:
1. "My soul is sorrowful. He communicates to them his sorrow, in order to arouse them to sympathy; not that he was unacquainted with their weakness, but in order that they might afterwards be more ashamed of their carelessness."
2. "This phrase expresses a deadly wound of grief; as if he had said, that he fainted, or was half-dead, with sorrow."
