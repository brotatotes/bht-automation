# Matthew 26:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Jesus prayed, he was on his face, showing his reverence for God and the weight of the impending suffering. His distress was evident as he could not even lift up his head. Although there were two wills present in Christ, the human and divine, they were not contrary to each other but in complete harmony. Jesus' cry for the cup to pass from him was followed by God taking away the terror and severity of the inward conflict, showing His mercy and comfort.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The glorifying begins with suffering, as the previous words might lead us to expect. The power over all flesh shows itself first as power of the conflicting and victorious spirit over his own flesh, by virtue of which He is 'one of us.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "When we are withdrawn from the gaze of men, we succeed better in collecting our senses, so as to attend more closely to what we are doing."
2. "The believing soul unfolds itself with greater familiarity, and with greater simplicity pours its wishes, and groans, and anxieties, and fears, and hopes, and joys, into the bosom of God."
3. "We ought to be satisfied with this single consideration, that at the time when he uttered a prayer to be delivered from death, he was not thinking of other things which would have shut the door against such a wish."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If it is possible. ... The bitterness of this cup was so great, that He desired its removal, but even this desire was subordinated to the holy will of His Father."
2. "This cup... All His sufferings, including the specific sorrow of that hour. Hope of relief remains in our anguish; but He foreknew all."
3. "Not as I will, but as thou wilt. In this real struggle, His will was still fixed in its obedience to that of His Father."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He was on his face, not on his knees... the figure can mean only the approaching death." 
2. "He was not afraid that he would die before the Cross, though he instinctively shrank from the cup, but instantly surrendered his will to the Father's will and drank it to the full."
3. "Here Jesus won the power to go on to Calvary."

### John Gill:
1. "Partly to show his great reverence of God, the sword of whose justice was awaked against him, the terrors of whose law were set in array before him, and whose wrath was pouring down upon him; and partly to signify how much his soul was depressed, how low he was brought, and in what distress and anguish of spirit he was, that he was not able to lift up his head, and look up."
2. "That there are two wills in Christ, human and divine, is certain; his human will, though in some instances, as in this, may have been different from the divine will, yet not contrary to it; and his divine will is always the same with his Father's."

### John Wesley:
1. "And going a little farther — About a stone's cast, Luke 22:41-So that the apostles could both see and hear him still."
2. "If it be possible, let this cup pass from me — And it did pass from him quickly. When he cried unto God with strong cries and tears, he was heard in that which he feared."
3. "God did take away the terror and severity of that inward conflict."
