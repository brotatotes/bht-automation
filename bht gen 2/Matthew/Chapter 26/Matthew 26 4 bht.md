# Matthew 26:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The religious leaders were determined to take Jesus by subtilty, to prevent another escape from their grasp. They were troubled by the influence he had over the people and sought to devise a secret plan to apprehend him. Their goal was to deliver him to the Roman governor and publicly accuse him of crimes, fulfilling the prophecy in Psalm 2:2. This shows the extent of their desire to eliminate Jesus and the lengths they were willing to go to achieve it.
