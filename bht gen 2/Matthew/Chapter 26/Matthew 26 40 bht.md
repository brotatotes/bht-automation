# Matthew 26:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples' sleep in this passage not only represented their physical exhaustion and sorrow, but also symbolized the spiritual sleep and complacency that can affect believers. It serves as a reminder that even those close to Jesus can become spiritually drowsy and inattentive. The disciples' inability to be awakened by Christ's words initially reflects the reality that sometimes the mere preaching of the Word may not stir the hearts of believers. This passage highlights the need for believers to be vigilant and constantly seek renewal and awakening in their spiritual lives.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Mark agrees, except in relating the beginning of the address in the singular...for it was Peter, who had pledged himself to go with Him to prison and death."
2. "'οὕτως'...implies their utter inability, as shown by their present state of slumber. Are ye so entirely unable?"
3. "μίαν ὥραν need not imply that our Lord had been absent a whole hour...it would be that the whole trial would last about that time. But most likely it is in allusion to the time of our Lord's trial, so often called by that name."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. What! It is hardly possible to convey the exact force of the Greek outwv, thus or so. The idea is, "are ye thus unable, or so utterly unable to watch?"

### John Calvin:
1. "Believers are not required to be so constant in prayer as never to cease from conversing with God; but on the contrary, following the example of Christ, they continue their prayers till they have proceeded as far as their infirmity allows, then cease for a short time, and immediately after drawing breath return to God."
2. "As he had voluntarily taken upon him our infirmities, we need not wonder if the indifference of those whom he had selected to be his companions added a heavy and distressing burden to his grief."
3. "His expostulation is not feigned, but out of the true feeling of his mind, he declares that he is grieved at having been forsaken. And, indeed, he had good grounds for reproaching them with indifference, since, amidst the extremity of his anguish, they did not watch at least one hour."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Sleeping. Not sound asleep, as we infer from Matthew 26:43, but in a dozing, drowsy state. Excessive sorrow has this result (comp. Luke 22:45). Spiritual influences, too, exhaust the body." 
2. "Their drowsiness does not prove insensibility; they had, however, been warned to watch." 
3. "Unto Peter, who had promised most. What, or ‘so then.’ This indicates disappointment, if not displeasure. His chosen friends had failed to comfort Him in this crisis."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Did you not thus have strength enough to keep awake one hour?"
2. "Every word struck home."

### John Gill:
- "The chief reason of their sleepiness was their sorrow..."
- "Now, though this sleep was natural bodily sleep, which the disciples fell into, yet was an emblem of, and carried in it a resemblance to, the spiritual sleep and drowsiness of the people of God."
- "Yet as the disciples were so much asleep, that the bare words of Christ did not arouse them from it for a while; so such is the sleep of the saints sometimes, that they are not to be aroused by the bare ministry of the word..."
