## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The command has respect to the immediate trial which was about to try them, and also to the general duty of all disciples in all time."
2. "εἰσελθεῖν εἰς π . is not to come into temptation merely, to be tempted: this lies not in our own power to avoid, and its happening is rather joy than sorrow to us."
3. "I cannot doubt that this is said by our Lord in its most general meaning, and that He Himself is included in it. At that moment He was giving as high and pre-eminent an example of its truth, as the disciples were affording a low and ignoble one."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ therefore threatens that, if they do not watch and pray, they may be soon overwhelmed by temptation."
2. "The manner of resistance which is here enjoined is, not to draw courage from reliance on our own strength and perseverance, but, on the contrary, from a conviction of our weakness, to ask arms and strength from the Lord."
3. "We ought to draw from it a general rule, that it is our duty to keep diligent watch by praying; for we do not yet possess the power of the Spirit in such a measure as not to fall frequently through the weakness of the flesh, unless the Lord grant his assistance to raise up and uphold us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They needed then, and, as the original implies what is habitual, always to watch, to be on their guard, as well as to pray."
2. "The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. 'The spirit,' i.e., the human spirit, but only as quickened by the Holy Spirit."
3. "In Him, though weighed down by sorrow, so that the flesh almost gave way to death in its weakness ('even unto death'), the willingness of the spirit triumphed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "Spirit here is the moral life as opposed to the flesh."
3. "This delicate distinction accurately presents the real attitude of Jesus towards this subtle temptation."

### John Gill:
1. "There is, and ought to be, a watching before prayer, and 'unto' it; a watching all opportunities, the most suitable and convenient to perform it."
2. "The reason of this exhortation follows, that ye enter not into temptation; not that they might not be tempted at all...but that they might not enter into them, throw themselves in the way of temptation, be surprised by them at an unawares, fall into them headlong, be immersed in them, fall by them, and be overcome with them, so as to forsake Christ, or to deny him."
3. "The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak: meaning either that the evil spirit Satan was very desirous of having them in his hands... and they were but flesh and blood, very weak and infirm, and unequal to the enemy."

### John Wesley:
1. "The spirit — Your spirit: ye yourselves."
2. "The flesh — Your nature."
3. "How gentle a rebuke was this, and how kind an apology! especially at a time when our Lord's own mind was so weighed down with sorrow."
