1. "By these words Christ seems as if, having subdued fear, he came with greater freedom and courage to submit to the will of the Father."
2. "Yet it is probable that, at the second time, he labored more to yield obedience to the Father, and that the first encounter with temptation animated him to approach death with greater confidence."

1. "The sense of this prayer to his God and Father is, that if his sufferings and death could not be dispensed with; if it was not consistent with the decrees of God, and the covenant of grace, that he should be excused from them; or if the glory of God, and the salvation of his people required it, that he must drink up that bitter cup, he was content to do it."
2. "Desiring in all things to submit unto, and to fulfill his Father's will, though it was so irksome and disagreeable to nature."
