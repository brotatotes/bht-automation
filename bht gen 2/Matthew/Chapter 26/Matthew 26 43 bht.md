# Matthew 26:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples were struggling to stay awake, as their eyes were heavy with sleep and the weariness of their circumstances. They were in a state of confusion and could not even formulate a response to Jesus. Despite the previous encounter where Jesus had admonished them for falling asleep, they could not resist the pull of drowsiness. This highlights their human frailty and serves as a reminder for us not to be discouraged or grow weary in our prayers, even if our requests are not immediately fulfilled.
