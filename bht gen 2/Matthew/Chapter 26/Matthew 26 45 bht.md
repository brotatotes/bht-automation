## BHT:
The hour is at hand, and Jesus has warned his disciples, but they remain indifferent. Even as they sleep, the betrayer approaches. Jesus recognizes their lack of understanding and reprimands them. Now is the time for action, for the fulfillment of the prophecies. The disciples have missed their chance for sympathy with Jesus in His hour of need. The betrayal is imminent, and Jesus, facing it bravely, knows that He must now face the worst without their aid.
