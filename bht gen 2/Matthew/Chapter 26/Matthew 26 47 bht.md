# Matthew 26:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The betrayer, Judas, who was one of the twelve apostles, approached Jesus in the garden with a band of armed men, prepared to take him into custody. The chief priests and elders, intent on crushing what they perceived as a seditious plot, had organized this armed multitude to ensure Jesus' capture. This shocking act of treachery by one who had been chosen by Jesus and had spent years in close fellowship with him emphasizes the severity of the betrayal. The precision with which Jesus anticipated Judas' actions is remarkable, highlighting his divine knowledge of all things.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Judas is specified as εἷς τῶν δώδεκα, probably because the appellation, as connected with this part of his history, had become the usual one thus we have in Luke ὁ λεγόμενος Ἰούδ. εἷς τῶν δώδεκα fuller still."
2. "There is nothing improbable in this (as Meyer, Schleiermacher, &c. maintain), seeing that we have these persons mixing among the multitude and stirring them up to demand the crucifixion of Jesus afterwards."
3. "The intention of the chief priests evidently was to produce an impression to the effect that a seditious plot was to be crushed, and resistance might be expected."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "By the time Matthew's Gospel was written, the phrase had become a stereotyped designation of the traitor, like he that betrayed him."
2. "A great multitude... Part of the band would consist of this regularly - armed cohort, and the rest of a crowd armed with cudgels, and embracing some of the servants of conspicuous men in the Sanhedrin."

### John Calvin:
1. "The event itself showed that nothing occurred by chance; and since Christ's prediction directed them to contemplate the glory of his divinity."
2. "The circumstance of an armed multitude having been sent by the chief priests...makes it evident that an evil conscience wounded and tormented them."
3. "It is a display of amazing rage, that, relying on the power of arms, they do not hesitate to rise up against God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This haste favors the view that avarice was his leading motive."
2. "The size of the crowd may have been a recognition of our Lord’s power or designed to produce the impression on Pilate that some great plot was to be crushed, and on the people that Jesus was a great criminal."
3. "They had lanterns and torches, for although the moon was full, they expected to take Him in a deep valley, where these might be needed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
