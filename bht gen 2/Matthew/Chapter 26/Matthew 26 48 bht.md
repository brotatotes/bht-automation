# Matthew 26:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Judas, driven by his shame and fear, hesitated to openly identify himself as one of Jesus' foes. He chose to give the religious leaders a sign by kissing Jesus, a common act of affectionate intimacy. The kiss served as a way to definitively point out Jesus to the Roman soldiers who may not have recognized him. Furthermore, Judas may have used this sign to prevent Jesus from escaping, anticipating that Jesus' divine power or his disciples' intervention could foil their plans.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The common rendering of ἔδωκεν as a plusq. perf. is unnecessary and unwarranted: the aorist is simply historical, gave them a sign; when is not stated."
2. "On Mark’s addition, καὶ ἀπαγάγετε ἀσφαλῶς, see notes there."

### John Calvin:
1. "Judas was restrained, either by reverence for our Lord, or by shame for his crime, from venturing openly to avow himself as one of the enemies." 
2. "The warning which, Mark tells us, he gave the soldiers — to lead them away cautiously, was given, I conjecture, for this reason, that he recollected the numerous proofs by which Christ had formerly attested his divine power." 
3. "It was, at the same time, astonishing madness, either to attempt to conceal himself by frivolous hypocrisy, when he came into the presence of the Son of God, or to oppose the tricks and dexterity of men to his boundless power."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The kiss among the ancients was a sign of affectionate and cordial intimacy, and particularly a token of fidelity." 
2. "Judas may have feared He might still elude them, either by some exercise of His acknowledged power, or, more probably, with the help of His disciples." 
3. "If the incidents mentioned by John (John 18:4-9) took place, as is probable, on the first appearance of the crowd, most of those present already knew which was Jesus. But the signal agreed upon would be necessary to point Him out to the Roman soldiers, who might not have understood the conversation or had orders to act upon this sign."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Judas had given the leaders to understand that he would kiss Jesus in order to identify him for certain."
2. "The kiss was a common mode of greeting and Judas chose that sign and actually 'kissed him fervently'."
3. "This revolting ostentatious kiss is 'the most terrible instance of the εκουσια φιληματα εχθρου', the profuse kisses of an enemy."

### John Gill:
1. "Judas himself might not be able to discern him, so as to point him out, until he came very near him."
2. "It is very likely that the Roman soldiers...might never have seen him, and so could not know him without some sign was given them."
3. "Judas might the rather pitch upon this to be the sign...lest this should put Jesus upon taking some measures to make his escape."
