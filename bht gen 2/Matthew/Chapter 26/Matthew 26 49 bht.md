# Matthew 26:49 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Judas, the deceitful wretch, approached Jesus with a salutation full of pretended respect, wishing him health, prosperity, and happiness. Concealing his treacherous intentions, he addressed Jesus as his master, even as he planned to hand him over to his enemies. With a kiss, he feigned friendship and sincere concern, attempting to cover up his true motives and suggesting that he had no involvement in the imminent arrest of Jesus.

3.
