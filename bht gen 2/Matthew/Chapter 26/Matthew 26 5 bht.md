# Matthew 26:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The religious leaders had initially decided not to arrest Jesus during the feast, fearing a potential uprising and wanting to avoid a disturbance with the crowds. However, their plans were disrupted when Judas arrived with his betrayal. Yet, despite the human wisdom and schemes, God's counsel prevailed. It was the divine intention that Jesus would be sacrificed on the very day of the Passover, fulfilling the ancient foreshadowing with the ultimate sacrifice of eternal redemption. The plans of men may falter, but the purposes of God cannot be thwarted.
