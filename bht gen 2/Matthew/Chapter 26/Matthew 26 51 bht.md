# Matthew 26:51 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the heat of the moment, Peter, without waiting for his Master's response, drew his sword and attempted to strike the servant's head, but his aim wavered, causing him to only cut off the servant's ear. The servant's healing was a divine intervention, as the servant was spared from being struck down. This impulsive act of Peter serves as a reminder for us to consider the teachings and guidance of the Lord rather than acting out of rashness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The real reason of the non-apprehension was, that the servant was healed by the Lord."
2. "Then, while the other (for there were but two swords in the company) was waiting for the reply, the rash Peter, in the very spirit of ch. Matthew 16:22, smote with the sword the weapon of the flesh."
3. "The aim was a deadly one, and Peter narrowly escaped being one ὅστις ἐν τῇ στάσει φόνον πεποιήκει."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The servant [τον δουλον] . The article marks the special servant; the body - servant."
2. "Ear [ωτιον] . A diminutive in form but not in sense; according to a Greek popular usage which expressed parts of the body by diminutives."
3. "Peter aimed his blow at the servant 's head, but missed."

### John Calvin:
1. "We are much more courageous and ready for fighting than for bearing the cross."
2. "We ought always to deliberate wisely what the Lord commands, and what he requires from every one of us, lest the fervor of our zeal exceed the bounds of reason and moderation."
3. "Instead of a proper and well-regulated zeal, confused irregularity for the most part reigns in us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Carnal weapons used in Christ's cause deprive His opponents of 'ears,' i.e., of the willingness to listen to the truth."
2. "Christ's grace may restore this willingness, as it healed this ear."
3. "The double effect of Peter's rashness, damage to Malchus and danger to himself, were thus removed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Evidently Peter aimed to cut off the man's head, not his ear (ωτιον is diminutive in form, but not in sense, as often in the Koine)."
2. "His name, Malchus, is also given by John (John 18:10) because Peter was then dead and in no danger."


### John Gill:
1. "He being now thoroughly awaked with the rest, by what Christ had said to him; and more so by the surprise of the multitude of armed men about him."
2. "Without knowing his master's mind, or waiting his answer to the question the other disciples put, stretched out his hand, and drew his sword."
3. "The blow was levelled at his head, and with an intention, no doubt, to have, cleaved him down, but sloping on one side took off his ear."

### John Wesley:
1. "Cut off his ear - Aiming, it seems, to cleave his head, but that by a secret providence interposing, he declined the blow."
