# Matthew 26:52 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They shall perish with the sword, for the Lord's command is clear, Put up again thy sword. And so, those who take up the sword without God's authorization, without the necessary authority, will meet their own demise. For it is not the role of private individuals to use the sword for their own personal reasons, but rather to trust in the justice that God will bring forth.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The sheath is the place for the Christian’s sword...only in His willing self-sacrifice, and in that kingdom which is to be evolved from his work of redemption, is the sword altogether out of place."
2. "There is no allusion...the saying is general and the stress is on λαβόντες...taking up the sword’ of his own will; taking that vengeance which belongs to God, into his own hand."
3. "ἐν μαχαίρῃ ἀπολ...is a command...a repetition by the Lord in this solemn moment of Genesis 9:6...thought of by those well-meaning but shallow persons, who seek to abolish the punishment of death in Christian states."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Put up again. Peter was still brandishing his sword.

### John Calvin:
1. "First, we must make a distinction between a civil court and the court of conscience; for if any man resist a robber, he will not be liable to public punishment, because the laws arm him against one who is the common enemy of mankind."
2. "Thus, in every case when defense is made against unjust violence, the punishment which God enjoins earthly judges to carry into execution ceases. And yet it is not the mere goodness of the cause that acquits the conscience from guilt unless there be also pure affection."
3. "But there are fanatics who have foolishly misapplied this passage, so as to wrest the sword out of the hands of judges. They contend that it is unlawful to strike with the sword. This I acknowledge to be true, for no man is at liberty to take the sword at his own pleasure, so as to commit murder." (148 words)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For all they that take the sword. A general proposition in regard to unwarranted recourse to measures of violence."
2. "Shall perish with the sword. The special reference is to Peter. In taking the sword he had been imprudent, and exposed himself to a superior force; had been revolutionary, for these came with authority; had been cruel, for the mutilation of a human being in a spiritual cause is uncalled for."
3. "The great lesson is: The Church, a spiritual body, may use spiritual weapons only (comp. 2 Corinthians 10:3-4); never carnal and violent measures."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Put up again thy sword (αποστρεψον την μαχαιραν σου). Turn back thy sword into its place." 
2. "The reason given by Jesus has had innumerable illustrations in human history. The sword calls for the sword." 
3. "Offensive war is here given flat condemnation."

### John Gill:
1. "This Christ said not only to rebuke Peter for his rashness, but to soften the minds of the multitude, who must be enraged at such an action."
2. "For all they that take the sword, shall perish with the sword. This is not to be understood of magistrates... but of private persons that use the sword, and that not in self-defense, but for private revenge."
3. "And as an argument to make and keep Peter easy and quiet, and exercise patience, since, in a little time, God would avenge himself of them; and that the Jews, who now made use of the sword of the Roman soldiers, would perish by the sword of the Romans, as in a few years after the whole nation did."

### John Wesley:
1. All they that take the sword — Without God's giving it them: without sufficient authority.
