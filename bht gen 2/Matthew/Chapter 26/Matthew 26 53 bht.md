# Matthew 26:53 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Even now, at this very moment, in this crisis, Jesus could have called upon his Father and he would have immediately provided him with more than twelve legions of angels. A Roman legion consisted of about six thousand soldiers, so the power and might of these angelic legions would have been immeasurable. However, Christ willingly chose not to resist his arrest and suffer for the salvation of mankind. He had the authority and ability to be rescued, but he submitted himself to God's plan.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Majesty of our Lord, and His Patience are both shewn here."
2. "The power, implied in δοκεῖς ὅτι οὐ δύναμαι, shews the entire and continued free self-resignation of the Lord throughout and carries on the same truth as He expressed John 10:18."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Twelve legions of angels. Compare the story of Elisha at Dothan (2 Kings 6:17).

### John Calvin:
1. "The substance of what he says is this. 'As he has been appointed by the eternal purpose of God to be a sacrifice, and as this has been declared by the predictions of Scripture, he must not fight against it.'" 
2. "But Christ speaks conditionally, that he has a far better method of defending his life, were it not that the will of the Father was opposed to it. This takes away all contradiction, for Christ refrained from presenting such a request to his Father, because he knew that it was contrary to his decree." 
3. "Yet from this we draw a useful doctrine, that those who resort to unlawful means on the plea of necessity pour dishonor on God... all who are impelled, by their restlessness and excessive anxiety, to stretch out their hands to forbidden remedies for evils, do unquestionably renounce the providence of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Even now, at this crisis when all seems to be lost."
2. "A mighty host, all-sufficient to help them."
3. "Christ, in mercy to men, chose to gain His victory by suffering and long-suffering."

2. "But Jesus sees more than twelve legions at his command (one for each apostle) and shows his undaunted courage in this crisis."
3. "One should recall the story of Elisha at Dothan (2 Kings 6:17)."

### John Gill:
1. "Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father...if he thought proper, or that there was any necessity for it, or that he was desirous of being rescued out of such hands he was falling into." 
2. "And he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels. A Roman legion consisted of about six thousand soldiers...And that there is an innumerable company of angels...is certain...and what is it that such a company of angels is not capable of."
3. "Had Christ had any inclination to have been rescued from the present danger, he stood in no need of Peter's sword."

### John Wesley:
1. He will presently give me more than twelve legions of angels — The least of whom, it is probable, could overturn the earth and destroy all the inhabitants of it.
