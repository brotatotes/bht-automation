## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Passion and Death of Christ were especially ἡ τῶν γραφῶν πλήρωσις. In this they all found their central point. Compare his dying word on the Cross, τετέλεσται, with this his assertion."
2. "Some of them did not flee far. Peter and John went after Him to the palace of the High-priest: John 18:15."
3. "Chrys.’s remark is worth noting: ὅτε μὲν γὰρ κατεσχέθη, ἔμενον · ὅτε δὲ ἐφθέγξατο ταῦτα πρὸς τούς ὄχλους, ἔφυγον · εἶδον γὰρ λοιπόν, ὅτι οὐκ ἔτι διαφυγεῖν ἔνι, ἑκόντος ἑαυτὸν παραδόντος αὐτοῖς καὶ λέγοντος κατὰ τὰς γραφὰς τοῦτο γίνεσθαι."

### John Calvin:
1. "First, therefore, we are here informed, that whatever may be the unbridled rage by which Satan and all ungodly men are actuated, still the hand of God always prevails, so as to draw them reluctantly wherever he pleases."
2. "Still Christ intended not only to promote the advantage of his disciples, but also to repress the pride of his adversaries, that they might not triumph as if they had achieved victory."
3. "While all things are mingled in confusion, and while the devil, by spreading darkness abroad, appears to overturn the whole order of the world, let us know that the providence of God shines above in heaven, to bring at length to order what is confused; and let us, therefore, learn to raise the eyes of faith to that calm sky."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This word of our Lord is therefore His final surrender of Himself to death; a willing offering of Himself for others, in accordance with the purpose of a merciful God."
2. "Only after Christ died for men, could men die for Him."
3. "The Church can never fail; new Christians take the place of the old ones."

### John Gill:
1. "The Scriptures of the prophets he refers to, as having, or about to have, by this conduct, their accomplishment, were such, as regarded the betraying him by Judas, the taking him in this secret, private, insidious, yet violent manner; in all which he showed great meekness, calmness, and submission."
2. "Then all the disciples forsook him and fled; not only went away from him, and left him alone, as he foretold they would, John 16:32, but they ran away from him in a precipitant manner, like timorous sheep, the shepherd being about to be smitten; and they fearing, lest Peter's rash action should be imputed to them all, and they suffer for it."
