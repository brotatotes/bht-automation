# Matthew 26:58 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter's actions of following Jesus from a distance reveal different motivations. On one hand, his love for Jesus compelled him to stay close, yearning to know what would happen to him. However, his fear caused him to keep his distance, afraid of being noticed and facing danger. Sadly, his decision to join the servants of the high priest betrayed a lack of integrity and exposed him to unfit companions. Ultimately, Peter's actions serve as a reminder to examine our own motivations and commitment to following Christ closely.
