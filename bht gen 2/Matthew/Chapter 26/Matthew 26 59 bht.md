# Matthew 26:59 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The religious leaders took Jesus into custody and then set out to find false witnesses to testify against him. They were determined to put him to death by any means necessary, even if it meant using dishonest testimony. Their actions in dealing with Jesus, whom they viewed as a false prophet, were different from how they typically handled such cases. Instead of directly confronting Jesus themselves, they sent officers to search for individuals who would provide incriminating evidence against him. It is likely that these individuals were promised a reward for their cooperation.
