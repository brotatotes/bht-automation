# Matthew 26:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As the time of Christ's death was approaching, he remained close to Jerusalem, the place where he would endure suffering and die on behalf of sinners. Throughout his ministry, Jesus performed numerous healing miracles, including the cleansing of lepers. These miracles not only served as evidence of his identity as the Messiah but also testified to his divine nature. Furthermore, Jesus not only healed the leper but also entered and dwelled with those whom he healed. This willingness to enter into the lives of the transformed individuals exemplifies his continuous reputation as a welcome guest.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

1. "Not at this time a leper, or he could not be at his house receiving guests."
2. "It is at least possible, that he may have been healed by our Lord."
3. "He had been probably absent with Jesus at Ephraim, and on this account and naturally for other reasons would be an object of interest, and one of the ἀνακείμενοι."

### John Calvin:
1. "They did not venture to attack Christ by open violence, and to oppress him by stratagem was no easy matter; but now that Judas suggests to them a plan of which they had not thought, the very facility of execution leads them to adopt a different opinion."
2. "As to some slight diversity between John’s narrative and that of Matthew and Mark, it is easy to remove the apparent inconsistency... Let us therefore hold it to be a settled point, that all the three Evangelists relate the same narrative."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Probably already healed by Jesus, since otherwise he would have been unclean." 
2. "He must not be confounded with the Pharisee called Simon, at whose house in Galilee a similar anointing had taken place long before (Luke 7:36-50). The two occurrences are clearly distinguished in many ways."
