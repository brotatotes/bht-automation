# Matthew 26:61 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The witnesses falsely accused Jesus of saying, I am able to destroy the temple of God. However, they deliberately misrepresented his words. Jesus did not claim to have the power or desire to destroy the temple; instead, he challenged the Jews to destroy this temple. In reality, Jesus was referring to his own body and his ability to resurrect it after three days. The witnesses distorted the true meaning of his words by applying them to the physical temple in Jerusalem. Their misrepresentation not only perverted Jesus' intended sense, but also led to a disagreement between the two witnesses.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The false witness consisted in giving that sense to His words, which it appears they knew they did not bear."
2. "There is perhaps a trace, in the different reports of Matt. and Mark, of the discrepancy between the witnesses."
3. "The instance likewise of his zeal for the honour of the temple which had so lately occurred, might tend to perplex the evidence produced to the contrary."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Probably both forms of giving in the testimony were used on the trial, and Matthew has recorded it as it was given at one time and Mark at another, so that there is no contradiction."
2. "That which they 'attempted' to accuse him of is what he had said respecting his body and their destroying it, John 2:19; 'Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.' This he spoke of his body; they perverted it, endeavoring to show that he meant the temple at Jerusalem."
3. "They neither stated it as it was, nor did they state correctly its meaning, nor did they agree about the words used. It was therefore very little to their purpose."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "'Fellow' conveys a sneer, not contained in the original."
2. "The witnesses were probably guilty of wilful misinterpretation."
3. "The words of our Lord are a prophecy of His death, and yet of His ultimate victory; this, in their blindness and fanaticism they could make a ground for condemnation."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I am able to destroy the temple of God."
2. "What he had said referred to the temple of his body."
3. "It was a pitiful perversion of what Jesus had said."
4. "Even so the two witnesses disagreed in their misrepresentation."

### John Gill:
1. "He did not say, 'I am able to destroy the temple,' but only said, 'destroy this temple'; signifying neither his power, nor his will and inclination to it; but put it upon the Jews, and left it to them to do it."
2. "He did not say one word about the temple of God [...] but only 'this temple', referring to his body, or human nature [...] intending the resurrection of his body by his own power, after it had been dead three days."
3. "They perverted his sense, as well as misquoted his words; applying that to the material temple at Jerusalem, what he spoke of the temple of his body, and of its resurrection from the dead, on the third day."
