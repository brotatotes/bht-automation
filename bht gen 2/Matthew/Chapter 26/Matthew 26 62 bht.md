# Matthew 26:62 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The high priest, filled with anger and frustration, couldn't understand why they couldn't produce better testimony against Jesus. And yet, Jesus remained silent, choosing not to dignify their accusations with a response. His silence spoke volumes, not only because the witnesses did not deserve a reply, but also because Jesus knew that the time for his true defense had not yet come. The high priest, in his haste to condemn Jesus, demanded to know the meaning of the testimony, but in reality, silence was all the answer needed, for Jesus' hour had indeed arrived.
