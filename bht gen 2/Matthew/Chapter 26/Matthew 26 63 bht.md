# Matthew 26:63 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, knowing that his words would have no effect on those determined to bring about his death, chose to remain silent and not defend himself. In a court of justice, silence was considered a virtue, and Jesus displayed this virtue by refusing to offer a defense. The high priest, wielding his authority, put Jesus under oath and charged him to speak the truth. Jesus, fully aware of the gravity of the situation, affirmed his true identity as the Messiah and the Son of God, understanding the weight and significance of his confession.
