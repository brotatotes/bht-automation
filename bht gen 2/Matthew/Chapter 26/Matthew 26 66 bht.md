# Matthew 26:66 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The question was posed by the president of the court, and the unanimous response was, He is guilty of death. However, it is worth noting that one member of the Sanhedrin, Joseph of Arimathea, did not consent to their counsel and deed. While the sentence they passed may not have been valid according to Roman law, it is important to consider their accusation of blasphemy and whether it aligns with the claims Jesus made about himself.
