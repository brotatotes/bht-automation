# Matthew 26:68 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The officials who mocked Jesus prevented Him from seeing and ridiculed His claim to be the Messiah. They covered His face, asked Him to prophesy and identify His attackers, and struck Him in the face. Jesus chose not to respond to their mocking questions, but He will reveal the identities of those who struck Him in due time. Their cruel actions brought them a sense of spite and used Jesus as an object of amusement and entertainment.
