# Matthew 26:69 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter's denial of Jesus was a greater source of pain and grief for him than the ill treatment he endured from his enemies. The accusation made against Peter by the servant girl was not about his physical presence with Jesus during his arrest or in Jerusalem, but rather that Peter was a disciple of Jesus, someone who believed in him and embraced him as the Messiah. The denial of Peter was a betrayal of his allegiance and faith in Jesus.
