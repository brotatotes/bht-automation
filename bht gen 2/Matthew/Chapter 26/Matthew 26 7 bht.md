### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Lit., an alabaster, just as we call a drinking-vessel made of glass a glass."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "An alabaster cruse of exceeding precious ointment" - The flask was of alabaster, a carbonate of lime or sulphate of lime, white or yellow stone, named alabaster from the town in Egypt where it was chiefly found. It was used for a phial employed for precious ointments in ancient writers, inscriptions and papyri just as we speak of a glass for the vessel made of glass.
2. "It had a cylindrical form at the top, as a rule, like a closed rosebud (Pliny)." - Matthew does not say what the ointment was, only saying that it was "exceeding precious," of weighty value, selling at a great price.
3. "She poured it upon his head" - So Mark (Mark 14:3), while John (John 12:3) says that she "anointed the feet of Jesus." Why not both?

2. "Some there render it, 'pure nard'; unadulterated, unmixed, sincere and genuine." 
3. "The pouring of this ointment on the head of Christ was emblematical of his being anointed with the oil of gladness above his fellows."
