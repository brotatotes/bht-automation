# Matthew 26:70 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter, in his denial, did not question the divinity or the messiahship of Jesus, but rather distanced himself from being associated with Him as His disciple. His denial did not stem from insecurity or a lack of belief in his own worthiness, but rather from the fear of human judgement. It is striking to see how quickly Peter's courage faltered, as he was easily influenced by a maidservant into denying his relationship with Jesus, despite his earlier boasting of unwavering loyalty.
