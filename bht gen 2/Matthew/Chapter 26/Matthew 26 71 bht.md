# Matthew 26:71 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, Peter's denial of Jesus is vividly portrayed. Despite Jesus' warning, Peter persistently disassociates himself from Jesus. He moves to the porch in an attempt to distance himself, but he is recognized by another servant and spoken of contemptuously. The disdainful language used by the servants highlights their low opinion of Jesus and his followers. Peter's denial is not only a moment of fear and weakness, but also a rejection of his allegiance to Jesus.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "How clearly does it prove that our Lord was omniscient, that all these things were foreseen!"
2. "To this charge he might have been silent, thinking, perhaps, that he was concealed, and there was no need of denying Jesus then."
3. "This denial was in a stronger manner and with an oath."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Gone out. Through fear of being further questioned.

### John Calvin:
1. "Indeed, I have no doubt that, when Christ said to Peter, before the cock crow, he meant the cock-crowing, which includes many crowings; for cocks do not merely crow once, but repeat their crowings many times; and yet all the crowings of a single watch are called but one cock-crowing."
2. "Mark states more distinctly one circumstance, that within a short space of time Peter was brought even to the third denial, and that, though he had been warned by the first crowing, he did not repent."
3. "None of us will say that profane historians are inconsistent with each other, when some one of them relates what the others have not touched; and, therefore, though Markâ€™s narrative is different, still it does not contradict the others."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In his embarrassing position, he left the fire, going out to the arched gateway leading from the court to the street; probably no further." 
2. "As Peter himself probably informed Mark of this, it was not the cock-crow that brought him to repentance; nor does he conceal his forgetfulness of the signal."
3. "Again, a womanâ€™s weapon, of contempt and ridicule; potent enough, when human weakness is not supported by Divine grace."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Peter was not safe out here, for another maid recognized him and spoke of him as 'this fellow' with a gesture to those out there."


### John Gill:
1. "He chose rather to keep his ground, but was very uneasy; and therefore moved into the porch, where he sat very pensive, considering what was proper for him to do."
2. "She speaks of Christ in the same contemptuous manner, as her fellow servant had done; for this appellation of Christ was commonly, if not always used by way of contempt."
3. "This sorry fellow, that is sauntering and lurking about here, is certainly one of this man's disciples."
