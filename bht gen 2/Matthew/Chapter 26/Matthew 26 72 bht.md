# Matthew 26:72 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This incident reveals the depths of Peter's denial, as he goes so far as to swear and vehemently claim to not even know Jesus. It reflects not only his fear and weakness but also the extent to which sin can lead us astray. However, it also serves as a powerful reminder of the transformative power of God's grace. Despite Peter's great sin, he is eventually humbled and restored, a testament to the redemptive work of divine grace in our lives.

3. "The expression is even somewhat contemptuous; Peter was now ‚Äòa stone of stumbling,‚Äô not a ‚Äòrock.‚Äô"

### Archibald T. Robertson:

### John Gill:
1. "He swore by the God of truth; made a solemn appeal to the omniscient God, the searcher of hearts, that he was so far from being ever with Jesus of Nazareth, or a disciple of his, that, says he, I do not know the man."
2. "Those that would excuse Peter's sin, by supposing that he meant, that he knew Christ to be God, and did not know him as a mere man, have no foundation for such a supposition; and indeed, such an ambiguous expression, and mental reservation, is no other than dealing fallaciously."
3. "This instance of Peter's shows the wickedness and deceitfulness of man's heart; and what the best of men are, or would be, when left to themselves, and of God: they become like other men, even like the men of the world, whose mouths are full of cursing and bitterness."

### John Wesley:
1. He denied with an oath ‚Äî To which possibly he was not unaccustomed, before our Lord called him.
