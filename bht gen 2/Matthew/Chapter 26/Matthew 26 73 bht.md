# Matthew 26:73 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Surely, your speech betrays you as one of them, for your dialect clearly reveals your association with Jesus. This distinct way of speaking, said to be a peculiarity of the Galileans, was not well-pronounced and readily exposed Peter's connection to Jesus. Although this was not a solid proof of his affiliation, it was enough for those standing by to accuse him. It is interesting how even in the midst of their zeal, the world often seizes upon the weakest arguments against the children of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Galilæans could not pronounce properly the gutturals, confounding [180], ע and ח; and they used ת for שׁ."

3. "The internal character of the text agrees with the external, as the student may judge for himself from the readings given in the digest."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Thy speech bewrayeth thee - Your language makes it manifest that you are of his company."
2. "It is probable that the Galileans were distinguished for some peculiarity of pronunciation, perhaps some unique rusticity or coarseness in their manner of speaking, that distinguished them from the refinement of the capital, Jerusalem."
3. "This charge, John says John 18:26, was supported by the express affirmation of a kinsman of Malchus, the servant of the high priest, that he had seen him in the garden."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "Surely thou also art one of them, as if to offset his oath (Matthew 26:72): for even thy speech bewrayeth thee."
3. "The Galilean dialect was peculiar, not making a distinction between the guttural sounds, etc.; a ready means of detection."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The bystanders came up to Peter and bluntly assert that he was 'of a truth' (αληθως) one of the followers of Jesus for his speech betrayed him."
2. "His dialect (λαλια) clearly revealed that he was a Galilean."
3. "The Galileans had difficulty with the gutterals and Peter's second denial had exposed him to the tormenting raillery of the loungers who continued to nag him."

### John Gill:
1. "Here was time to reflect upon what he had been saying, and to guard against another temptation, should he be attacked; but, alas! as yet he was unmindful of his Lord's words."

3. "Surely thou also art one of them, for thy speech betrayeth thee: not his spiritual speech, for he had not been speaking in the language of a disciple of Christ, like one that had been with Jesus; nor his swearing neither, for this rather showed him to be one of them; but his country language, the brogue of his speech, the Galilean dialect which he spoke."

### John Wesley:
1. "Surely thou art also one of them, for thy speech discovereth thee." 
2. "Malchus might have brought a stronger proof than this."
