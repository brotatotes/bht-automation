# Matthew 26:74 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In his moment of intense fear and desperation, Peter's unfaithfulness reached its peak. He repeated his denial, but this time accompanied it with profanity and curses, as if trying to convince those around him that he was telling the truth. He even went so far as to call down imprecations upon himself, invoking divine judgment upon his own soul. Peter's actions and words reveal not just a momentary lapse in judgment, but a complete loss of self-control and a desperate attempt to distance himself from Jesus.
