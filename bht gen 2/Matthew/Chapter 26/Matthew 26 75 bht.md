# Matthew 26:75 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Forgetfulness of God's words and his law often leads to sin. In order to recover from a fall or backsliding, one must remember what they have fallen from, the love and kindness God has shown them, and the truth they have been indifferent to. God is merciful and brings awakening and restoration through repentance, just as he did with Peter.
