# Matthew 26:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples were filled with indignation at what they saw, with Judas Iscariot being particularly vocal about it. This response reveals the danger of allowing negative speeches to influence our judgments, even for those who are naturally reasonable and modest. It serves as a reminder to exercise caution and not to rush to pronounce judgments on matters that may not be fully understood. We must be wary of the influence of envenomed tongues, which can easily deceive and lead us to adopt false judgments.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Judas alone is mentioned." 
2. "If so, the independent origin of the two accounts is even more strikingly shewn."
3. "Bengel remarks, 'Immo tu, Juda, perditionis es ( ὁ υἱὸς τῆς ἀπωλείας , Joh 17:12 ).'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. To what purpose is this waste? Wyc., Where to this loss? Tynd., What needed this waste? See on John 12:3.

### John Calvin:
1. "But when he began, under a plausible pretext, to condemn the expense as superfluous, all of them easily caught the contagion. And this example shows what danger arises from malignant and envenomed tongues."
2. "Even those who are naturally reasonable, and candid, and modest, if they do not exercise prudence and caution, are easily deceived by unfavorable speeches, and led to adopt false judgments."
3. "We ought to draw from it another warning, not to pronounce rashly on a matter which is not sufficiently known. The disciples seize on what Judas said, and, as it has some show of plausibility, they are too harsh in forming a judgment."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The disciples formed a part; John mentions the author of the objection, and gives his motives."
2. "Sacrifices, made out of love to Christ, seem wasteful’ to the world, and even to the Church when under the influence of a mercantile spirit."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Dead loss (απωλεια) they considered it, nothing but sentimental aroma."
2. "It was a cruel shock to Mary of Bethany to hear this comment."
3. "Mark explains that they mentioned 'three hundred pence,' while Matthew (Matthew 26:9) only says 'for much' (πολλου)."

### John Gill:
1. "Their resentment was private, though it might be betrayed by their looks, and afterwards showed itself in words."
2. "This indignation was either at the woman, for acting such an imprudent part and being guilty of such extravagance, or at Christ himself, for suffering such an action to be done unto him."
3. "They call that waste, or loss, which was spent on Christ himself; whereas, whatever is laid out for the honour of Christ, or the good of his interest, ought not to be reckoned loss, for it will be returned with great increase and advantage."

### John Wesley:
1. His disciples seeing it, had indignation, saying — It seems several of them were angry, and spoke, though none so warmly as Judas Iscariot.
