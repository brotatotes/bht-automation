# Matthew 27:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After an all-night meeting, the Sanhedrin held a formal gathering at dawn to ratify the illegal trial of Jesus. The chief priests and elders, eager to shed blood, met together, even though they had previously assembled at Caiaphas's house. This urgent assembly was necessary, as they were seeking a way to condemn Jesus and put Him to death. In their haste and eagerness, they sought to carry out their wicked intentions, even if it meant bypassing proper legal procedures.
