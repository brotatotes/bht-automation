# Matthew 27:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Son of God was valued at a remarkably low price, as demonstrated by the thirty pieces of silver given in contempt for him and his office. This fulfilled God's providential plan, even down to the precise details of buying the potter's field. Despite the evil intentions behind their actions, Jesus' power turned their conduct into the execution of God's purpose. He worked through them to achieve his own plan and fulfilled the ancient prophecies. These events highlight the profound significance of the Son of God and his role in the divine plan.
