# Matthew 27:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus chose to remain silent when faced with false accusations because he knew that speaking up would not convince his accusers or further Pilate's desire to release Him. The charges against Jesus were well-known to be false, and He understood that even if He refuted them, His enemies would simply invent new accusations. Additionally, Jesus recognized that He had a greater purpose in His upcoming death - to take on the sins of His people and offer salvation. His silence before Pilate was a deliberate act of obedience to fulfill His mission.
