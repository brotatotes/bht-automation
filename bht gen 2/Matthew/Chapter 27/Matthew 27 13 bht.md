# Matthew 27:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As they hurled accusations at Him, the chief priests and elders were seeking to draw a response from Him. They questioned whether He could not hear or comprehend the weight of the charges being made against Him. The nature and frequency of the allegations were aimed at intimidating Him, as they came from individuals of high standing. Yet Jesus remained silent, refusing to engage in the mockery and deceit of those who sought to justify their murderous plans.
