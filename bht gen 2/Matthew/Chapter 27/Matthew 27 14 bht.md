# Matthew 27:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus maintained his silence in the face of the accusations brought against him by the Jews and the questioning of Pilate. Despite the friendly manner in which Pilate approached him, Jesus chose not to respond. The fact that he remained quiet, even in the presence of the Sanhedrin and the Roman governor, left Pilate greatly amazed. It was not common for those accused to remain silent, which made Jesus' demeanor all the more striking. His silence demonstrated his innocence and his willingness to endure whatever false accusations were thrown his way.
