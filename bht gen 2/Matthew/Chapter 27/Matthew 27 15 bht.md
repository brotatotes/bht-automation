# Matthew 27:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
At every feast, which occurred annually during the celebration of the passover, it was the custom for the Roman governor to release one prisoner chosen by the people. This practice was not a law commanded by Moses but rather a Roman tradition. Despite this, the wickedness of the people, driven by Satan, caused them to gravitate towards committing more sins without remorse. The Son of God, in His great humility, was treated even worse than a common criminal, demonstrating the depths of His sacrifice and the wickedness of mankind.
