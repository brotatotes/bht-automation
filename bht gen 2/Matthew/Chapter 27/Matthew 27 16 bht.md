### John Gill:
1. "This prisoner is called a 'notable' one; that is, a famous, or rather an infamous one: he was a thief, and a robber, and had been guilty of sedition; had made, or joined with others in an insurrection, and had committed murder in it; and so, on more accounts than one, was deserving of death."
2. "Nor could it be otherwise expected by himself, or others, but that he should die."
3. "This was a name common among the Jews."
