# Matthew 27:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As the trial unfolded, Pilate cunningly suggested the release of Barabbas alongside Jesus, hoping that the crowd's preference for Jesus would secure his freedom. Outside the Praetorium, a large crowd had gathered, adding pressure to the situation. Pilate's attempt to equate Jesus, an innocent man, with the criminal Barabbas displayed his weakness and desire to avoid responsibility. Unbeknownst to him, he unintentionally pitted two figures representing opposing forces against each other, giving the people the power to decide who would be set free.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In John‚Äôs narrative, the suggestion of liberating Barabbas seems to come from the Jews themselves; but not necessarily so: he may only be giving, as before, a general report of what passed."
2. "The œÉœÖŒΩŒ∑Œ≥Œº . Œø·ΩñŒΩ Œ±·ΩêœÑ . seems to imply that a great crowd had collected outside the Pr√¶torium while the trial was going on."
3. "It is possible that the addition œÑ·Ω∏ŒΩ ŒªŒµŒ≥œåŒºŒµŒΩŒøŒΩ œáœÅŒπœÉœÑœåŒΩ, which Pilate could hardly have heard from the Jews, may have been familiar to him by his wife‚Äôs mention of Jesus."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He [Pilate] chose this expedient, probably with the idea, that the popularity of Jesus would lead the multitude to call for His release."
2. "To put Jesus, as yet uncondemned, on a level with Barabbas, was a crime; a cowardly shirking of responsibility, and a blunder."
3. "Pilate was not ‚Äòweak and irresolute;‚Äô but baffled in his purpose by superior cunning."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Pilate was catching at straws or seeking any loophole to escape condemning a harmless lunatic or exponent of a superstitious cult such as he deemed Jesus to be." 
2. "The Jews interpreted 'Christ' for Pilate to be a claim to be King of the Jews in opposition to Caesar, 'a most unprincipled proceeding' (Bruce)." 
3. "Pilate unwittingly pitted against each other two prisoners who represented the antagonistic forces of all time."

### John Gill:
1. "Pilate on purpose proposed such an infamous person along with him, not doubting but they would have preferred him, whatever were their prejudices against him, before such a scandalous person as Barabbas." 
2. "His view was not to reproach Christ, by joining him with so wicked a man, but in order to save him."
3. "For it was at their option, who should be the person; for it was 'whom they would', as in Matthew 27:15."
