# Matthew 27:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The governor's wife, aware of the innocence and righteousness of Jesus, pleads with her husband, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man. Her dream and suffering had only intensified Pilate's fears and anxiety about condemning Jesus. Some suggest that her message was intended to dissuade Pilate from sentencing Jesus, while others speculate that it may have come from the Devil himself. However, regardless of the source, the wife's plea served as a reminder of Jesus' righteousness and the weight of the decision Pilate was about to make.

### Henry Alford:
1. "ἡ γυνὴ αὐτ  . ] It had become the custom in Augustus’s time for the governors of provinces to take their wives with them abroad; Cæcina attempted to pass a law forbidding it..."
2. "ὁ δίκαιος ἐκεῖνος is a term which shews that she knew the character for purity and sanctity which Jesus had."


### John Calvin:
1. "We ought to conclude, on the contrary, that God the Father took many methods of attesting the innocence of Christ, that it might evidently appear that he suffered death in the room of others."
2. "God intended that Pilate should so frequently acquit him with his own mouth before condemning him, that in his undeserved condemnation the true satisfaction for our sins might be the more brightly displayed."
3. "And, indeed, by the terrors which his wife, had suffered during the night, God compelled him to defend the innocence of his own Son; not to rescue him from death, but only to make it manifest, that in the room of others he endured that punishment which he had not deserved."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Probably while the people were considering the matter."
2. "She may have known something of Jesus and was satisfied of His innocence. Her request hints that Pilate might incur Divine vengeance by injuring Jesus."
3. "The dream may have been entirely natural. The governor’s wife knew something of the mission of Jesus; and the night before, the Sanhedrin had in all probability alarmed the procurator’s household, coming to demand a guard."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Poor Pilate was getting more entangled every moment as he hesitated to set Jesus free whom he knew to be free of any crime against Caesar."
2. "She calls Jesus 'that righteous man' and her psychical sufferings increased Pilate's superstitious fears."
3. "But it was enough to unnerve the weak Pilate as he sat on the judgment-seat up over the pavement."

### John Gill:
1. "Have thou nothing to do with that just man; meaning Jesus, whom she either knew to be so, or concluded from her dream that he was one."
2. "She might know that he had gone some lengths already against him... and she might be apprehensive that he was forward to condemn him to death, and therefore sends this cautionary message."
3. "Some have thought, that this dream was from the devil, willing to hinder the death of Christ, and so man's redemption and salvation by it; but had he had any such intention, the most effectual method would have been to have persuaded the chief priests and elders off of it."
