2. "The governor commonly resided at Caesarea; but he came up to Jerusalem usually at the great feasts, when great numbers of the Jews were assembled, to administer justice, and to suppress tumults if any should arise."
3. "The Jews did not, however, enter in themselves, lest they should be defiled, but that they might eat the Passover.
