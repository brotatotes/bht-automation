# Matthew 27:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The leaders cunningly and manipulatively swayed the people's opinion against Jesus by spreading false claims, stating that he had been condemned by the orthodox court as a blasphemer. They used fear tactics, warning the people that if Jesus was set free, the Romans might perceive him as a threat and take away their place and nation. Their ultimate goal was the destruction of Jesus, and they saw releasing Barabbas as a means to achieve this. Their deceptive efforts successfully turned the crowd against Jesus and led to his ultimate crucifixion.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The exciting of the crowd seems to have taken place while Pilate was receiving the message from his wife."
2. "ἵνα conveys a mixture of the purport with the purpose of the ἔπεισαν."


### John Calvin:
1. "They were not, of their own accord, hostile to Christ, but that, having sold themselves to gratify the priests, they forget all justice and modesty, as well as their own salvation."
2. "Hence we learn how pernicious is the influence of wicked men, who can easily turn in every direction, to all kind of wickedness, the giddy and changeful multitude."
3. "The death of Christ was so eagerly demanded by the voice of the people, not because he was universally hated, but because the greater part of them, ambitiously desirous to follow the inclination of their rulers, threw aside all regard to justice, and might be said to have sold and enslaved their tongue to the wicked conspiracy of a few."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The leaders ‘would say, Jesus had been condemned by the orthodox court. Barabbas was, on the contrary a champion of freedom; that Pilate wished to overthrow their right of choice, their civil rights, their spiritual authority, to persecute the friend of the people,’ etc."


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The chief priests and elders saw the peril of the situation and took no chances."
2. "They used all their arts to get the people to 'ask for themselves' and to choose Barabbas and not Jesus."
3. "Pilate wavered in pressing the question."

### John Gill:
1. "This they did not by haranguing them, or making a public oration to them; but by sending their servants, or proper persons among them, telling them that Jesus had been examined before the sanhedrim that morning, and was found to be a blasphemer."
2. "Should this man be set free, they might suggest to them, since he has given out that he is the king Messiah, the Romans hearing of it, will be jealous of such a person, and come and take away both our place and nation, or deprive us of the privileges we have remaining."
3. "They thirsted after his blood, and were bent upon his death: to release Barabbas, if Jesus was not destroyed, would not answer their end: they desired Barabbas's liberty for no other reason, but for the sake of the destruction of Jesus."
