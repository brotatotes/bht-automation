# Matthew 27:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage in question reveals the state of confusion and indecision that prevailed among the people at the time. The question posed to the crowd, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? demonstrates the choice being presented between Jesus and Barabbas. Sadly, the crowd, entrusting matters of justice to a mob, chose Barabbas instead. This decision speaks to the sinful nature of humanity, as Christ, who was without sin, was accounted worse than the worst of them. Even in the face of this injustice, Jesus willingly took on the punishment for all our sins.
