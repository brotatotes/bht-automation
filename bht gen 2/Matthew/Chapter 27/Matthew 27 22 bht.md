# Matthew 27:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The crowd, overcome by hatred towards Jesus, demanded His crucifixion, a punishment reserved for the most vile of criminals, such as thieves and cutthroats. This decision surprised Pilate, as their own law prescribed stoning for such offenses. In his attempt to appease the mob, Pilate unwittingly underscored their rejection of the Innocent One in favor of the guilty Barabbas. However, they were oblivious to the dangerous precedent they set by demanding the crucifixion of Jesus. Little did they know that their decision would eventually come back to haunt them.

### John Wesley:
