# Matthew 27:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Pilate's persistence in trying to release Jesus shows his genuine desire to find a reason for Jesus' crucifixion. The governor, representing the proud Roman power, was forced to engage with a mob driven by impassioned fervor for Jesus' blood. This unjust alliance of godless men was reminiscent of a gladiatorial show where even the slightest protest by Pilate was feeble in the face of their demands. Despite their accusations, no proof of Jesus' wrongdoing could be found, as he entered the world without sin and committed none throughout his life.
