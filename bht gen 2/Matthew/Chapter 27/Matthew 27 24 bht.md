# Matthew 27:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Pilate, feeling the weight of the situation, attempts to distance himself from the decision of crucifying Jesus by washing his hands - a custom symbolizing innocence. His desperation is evident as he realizes that the crowd's demand for crucifixion cannot be appeased by this act. Pilate's attempt to absolve himself from guilt through this symbolic gesture proves futile, as the blood of the righteous one cannot be cleansed by mere water. His actions serve as a reminder that external rituals and gestures hold no power to remove the stain of sin and guilt.
