# Matthew 27:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The guilt of shedding blood carries weight, extending beyond the individual responsible. The solemn imprecation spoken by the Jewish people, declaring that the blood of Christ be upon them and their descendants, had profound implications. This curse was tragically fulfilled through the destruction and suffering that befell the Jewish nation. Their own words sealed their fate, resulting in crucifixions and countless calamities. This serves as a solemn reminder of the consequences that come from rejecting and harming the Son of God. It stands as a powerful warning etched in history for all to behold and reflect upon.
