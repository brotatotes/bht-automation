# Matthew 27:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The crucifixion process entailed the brutal act of nailing the person to the cross, while it was still on the ground, through their outstretched hands and both feet. Then, the raised cross was forcefuly thrust into a prepared hole in the ground. Only the Romans employed this excruciating form of execution, and it was reserved for slaves and the most despicable criminals.

2. "For if the Son of God had not been free from all sin, we would have had no right to look for satisfaction from his death; and, on the other hand, if he had not become our surety, to endure the punishment which we had deserved, we would now have been involved in the condemnation of our sins."
