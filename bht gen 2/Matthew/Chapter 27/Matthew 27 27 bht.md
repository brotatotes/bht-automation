# Matthew 27:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The praetorium, known as the governor's palace, was where the soldiers took Jesus into the common hall. It was a place the Jews avoided to prevent defilement. The gathering of the whole troop, consisting of hundreds of soldiers, was not only to mock and make sport of Jesus, but also to display their disdain for the Jews and the condemned man. These circumstances shed light on the difficult and hostile environment that surrounded our dear Lord.
