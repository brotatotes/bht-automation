# Matthew 27:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They gave him a reed, as a symbol of mockery, and a substitute for a sceptre, signifying the lowliness of his kingdom. But little did they know that Christ had another sceptre, a sceptre of righteousness, with which he would rule over the wicked of the earth. Furthermore, the fact that Christ held a reed in his hand teaches us that he does not despise the weakest believer and will not crush or discourage them, but will gently guide and support them.
