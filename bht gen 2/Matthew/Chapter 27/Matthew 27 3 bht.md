## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Observe it was œÑ·Ω∞ œÑœÅ. ·ºÄœÅŒ≥., which he brought back clearly the price of the Lord's betrayal, not earnest-money merely."
2. "Observe also ·ΩÅ œÄŒ±œÅŒ±Œ¥ŒπŒ¥Œø·Ω∫œÇ Œ±·ΩêœÑœåŒΩ, His betrayer, the part. pres. being used as a designation."


### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The condemnation, even though not unexpected, might well fill him with horror."
2. "A remarkable illustration of the power of an awakened conscience."
3. "Now, the possession of it so lashes him that he cannot use it, cannot even keep it!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "When he saw him taken, bound, tried, and condemned - when he saw that all probability that he would deliver himself was taken away - he was overwhelmed with disappointment, sorrow, and remorse."
2. "The word rendered 'repented himself,' it has been observed, does not of necessity denote a change 'for the better,' but 'any' change of views and feelings."
3. "It was not saving repentance. That leads to a holy life this led to an increase of crime in his own death."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "They ignore the question of Christ's innocence."
2. "Thou wilt see to that."

### John Calvin:
1. "He says that Judas repented; not that he reformed, but that the crime which he had committed gave him uneasiness...which is a true conversion of the soul to God."
2. "Wicked men are far from such a feeling...they are tormented with blind horror by their conscience."
3. "If Judas had listened to the warning of Christ, there would still have been place for repentance; but since he despised so gracious an offer of salvation, he is given up to the dominion of Satan, that he may throw him into despair."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Repented himself, felt sorrow or remorse; not the word usually translated ‚Äòrepent.‚Äô Remorse is caused by the consequences of sin; repentance is only occasioned by them; in remorse the sorrow is for the consequences, in repentance for the cause, and the sin itself."
2. "A terrible prophecy respecting the fate of the betrayer (chap. Matthew 26:24) had been joined with the prediction of this effect of the treachery. As the latter had been fulfilled, Judas must have felt the terrors springing from the former."
3. "The bringing back of the money really supports the view that his one great motive was avarice. Remorse, calling for rectification before men, would point to the moving cause of his crime."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Repented himself (ŒºŒµœÑŒ±ŒºŒµŒªŒ∑Œ∏ŒµŒπœÇ). Probably Judas saw Jesus led away to Pilate and thus knew that the condemnation had taken place. This verb (first aorist passive participle of ŒºŒµœÑŒ±ŒºŒµŒªŒøŒºŒ±) really means to be sorry afterwards like the English word repent from the Latin repoenitet, to have pain again or afterwards."
2. "The word does not have an evil sense in itself. Paul uses it of his sorrow for his sharp letter to the Corinthians, a sorrow that ceased when good came of the letter (2 Corinthians 7:8)."
3. "But mere sorrow avails nothing unless it leads to change of mind and life (ŒºŒµœÑŒ±ŒΩŒøŒπŒ±), the sorrow according to God (2 Corinthians 7:9). This sorrow Peter had when he wept bitterly. It led Peter back to Christ. But Judas had only remorse that led to suicide."

### John Gill:
1. "It was not such a repentance by which he became wiser and better; but an excruciating, tormenting pain in his mind, by which he became worse."
2. "Judas's repentance was without hope of forgiveness, and was nothing else but horror and black despair, like that of Cain's, like the trembling of devils, and the anguish of damned souls."
3. "But he being filled with remorse of conscience for what he had done, feels no quietness in his mind; nor could he save of what he had desired, but is obliged to return it; not from an honest principle, as in the case of true repentance, but on account of a racking and torturing conscience."

### John Wesley:
1. Then Judas seeing that he was condemned ‚Äî Which probably he thought Christ would have prevented by a miracle.
