# Matthew 27:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The suffering endured by Jesus during his crucifixion was unparalleled, as Isaiah 52:14 describes how his visage was more marred than any man's, and his form than the sons of men. The cruelty inflicted upon Jesus continued as his tormentors drove the sharp points of the thorns into it, which must give him inexpressible pain and torture. This physical pain and humiliation signify the extent to which Jesus willingly suffered for the sake of humanity, demonstrating his unwavering love and sacrifice.
