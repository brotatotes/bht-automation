# Matthew 27:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After subjecting him to mockery, they took off the robe they had put on him and dressed him back in his own clothes. This not only served the practical purpose of ensuring that the soldiers could identify him as the condemned man, but also allowed them to claim his clothes as their spoil. This swift execution was in accordance with the Roman custom of executing condemned individuals on the same day as their sentencing. Such a course of events, characterized by mockery and expediency, further underscores the shamefulness and ignominy of his crucifixion.
