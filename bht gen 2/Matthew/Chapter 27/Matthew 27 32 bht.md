# Matthew 27:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus had initially borne his own cross, but he eventually became too weak, which is why the soldiers compelled someone else to bear it for him. The man they chose, Simon of Cyrene, was possibly a believer in Jesus since his sons were known among the early Christians. Bearing the cross was not a task that anyone would willingly choose, but in this case, Simon was forced to take up the cross for Jesus.

### Henry Alford:
1. "Previously, Jesus had borne his own cross: John 19:17. So Plutarch, de sera numinis vindicta, ἕκαστος τῶν κακούργων ἐκφέρει τὸν αὑτοῦ σταυρόν, c. ix."
2. "We have no data to ascertain any further particulars about this Simon of Cyrene. The only assumption which we are perhaps justified in making, is that he was afterwards known in the Church as a convert: see note on Mark 15:21."
3. "Meyer suggests, to account for the selection of one out of the multitude present, that possibly he was a slave; the indignity of the service to be rendered preventing their taking any other person."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Compelled to go [ηγγαρευσαν] . See on Matthew 5:41. Rev., has impressed in margin.

### John Calvin:
1. "Perhaps, too, in consequence of having been mangled by scourging, and broken down by many acts of outrage, he bent under the weight of the cross."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Came out. From the city. Executions took place outside of the camp, here outside of the holy city." 
2. "A man of Cyrene, Simon by name. Probably a Jew who had come to attend the Passover, as many of them lived in Cyrene (in African Libya), frequently coming to Jerusalem."
3. "Him they compelled, or 'impressed' (comp. chap. Matthew 5:41), etc. Jesus at first bore His own cross (John 19:17), as was customary."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The soldiers treat Simon of Cyrene as a Persian courier and impress him into service, probably because Jesus was showing signs of physical weakness in bearing his own Cross as the victims had to do." 
2. "Jesus had long foreseen and foretold this horrible form of death for himself...he was on the way to the Cross."

1. "So Jesus went without the camp, and suffered without the gate, as the antitype of the red heifer."
2. "And it is very likely that this man was a favourer of Christ, which might be one reason why they laid hold on him, and obliged him to bear the cross of Christ; since he was the father of Alexander and Rufus, who were men of note among the first Christians."
