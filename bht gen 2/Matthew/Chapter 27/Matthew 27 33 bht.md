# Matthew 27:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Golgotha, the place of execution and burial for criminals, was likely named after its appearance, resembling a skull or head. It was situated on an elevated part of Mount Calvary, near the king's gardens, and held great infamy and disgrace. Despite its ignominy, Jesus willingly bore the shame and disgrace of being crucified there, a testament to His love and sacrifice for us.
