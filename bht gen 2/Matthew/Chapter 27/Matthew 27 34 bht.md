# Matthew 27:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus was offered a bitter drink, vinegar mingled with gall, which was often given to criminals to stupefy them and lessen their pain. He tasted it, demonstrating his awareness of its purpose, but refused to drink it. This act reflected his willingness to endure the full extent of his suffering, as well as his steadfast commitment to fulfill his sacrificial role. Another mixture, wine mingled with myrrh, was also offered to Jesus, intended to numb the pain. However, he chose not to partake, knowing that his agony was necessary for the completion of his redemptive work.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It was customary to give a stupefying drink to criminals on their way to execution: of which our Lord would not partake, having shewn by tasting it, that he was aware of its purpose."
2. "We may observe here (and if the remark be applied with caution and reverence, it is a most useful one), how Matt. often adopts in his narrative the very words of prophecy, where one or more of the other Evangelists give the matter of fact detail: see above on ch. Matthew 26:15, and compare with this verse, Psalms 69:21."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The effect of this, it is said, was to stupefy the senses. It was often given to those who were crucified, to render them insensible to the pains of death." 
2. "He was unwilling to blunt the pains of dying. The 'cup' which his 'Father' gave him he rather chose to drink. He came to suffer. His sorrows were necessary for the work of the atonement, and he gave himself up to the unmitigated sufferings of the cross."
3. "When Matthew and Mark say that he 'would not drink,' they refer to a different thing and a different time from John, and there is no contradiction."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Wine [Î¿Î¹Î½Î¿Î½] . The older texts read oxov, vinegar. The compound of wine and gall was intended as a stupefying draught.

### John Calvin:
1. "It is not unreasonable to suppose that, after he had refused that bitter mixture, it was frequently in derision presented to his lips."
2. "He patiently bore his torments, so that the lingering pain did not lead him to desire that his death should be hastened; for even this was a part of his sacrifice and obedience, to endure to the very last the lingering exhaustion."
3. "Nor is this inconsistent with what John says, that the Scripture was fulfilled, In my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink. For the two accounts perfectly agree with each other; that a remedy was given to him in order to put an end to the torments of a lingering death, and yet that Christ was in every respect treated with harshness, so that the very alleviation was a part, or rather was an augmentation, of his pain."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The term â€˜gallâ€™ was applied to many bitter substances, including â€˜myrrh.â€™ It was a stupefying draught, such as was commonly given before execution." 
2. "He tastes this mixture, to show that He was aware of its purpose, and refuses it." 
3. "The early martyrs felt justified in thus mitigating their pains; but His vicarious sufferings must be borne to the fullest extent."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The myrrh gave the sour wine a better flavour and like the bitter gall had a narcotic and stupefying effect."
2. "Both elements may have been in the drink which Jesus tasted and refused to drink."
3. "Jesus desired to drink to the full the cup from his Father's hand."

### John Gill:
1. "The design of it was to cheer their spirits, and intoxicate their heads, that they might not be sensible of their pain and misery."
2. "The potion of vinegar with gall, was an aggravating circumstance in our Lord's sufferings, being given to him when he had a violent thirst upon him; and was an emblem of the bitter cup of God's wrath, he had already tasted of in the garden, and was about to drink up."
3. "He would make use of no means either to prolong his life, or discompose his mind; and that it might appear he knew what he did, and that he was not afraid nor unwilling to die."

### John Wesley:
1. "They gave him vinegar mingled with gall â€” Out of derision: which, however nauseous, he received and tasted of." 
2. "St. Mark mentions also a different mixture which was given him, Wine mingled with myrrh: such as it was customary to give to dying criminals, to make them less sensible of their sufferings." 
3. "But this our Lord refused to taste, determining to bear the full force of his pains."
