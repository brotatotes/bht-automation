# Matthew 27:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The crucifixion of Jesus involved immense physical suffering, with Jesus being stripped of His clothes and crucified naked in a shameful and ignominious manner. The soldiers, who served as executioners, divided His garments among themselves in accordance with Roman customs. Yet, even in this act of dividing His clothes, there is significance to be found. The seamless vesture or inner garment of Jesus was not torn, but instead, the soldiers cast lots for it. This attention to detail in the Gospel narrative serves as a reminder of the depths of Jesus' suffering and the fulfillment of prophetic writings.
