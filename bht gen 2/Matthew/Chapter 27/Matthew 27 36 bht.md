# Matthew 27:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The soldiers stationed themselves on the ground by the cross, faithfully watching him to prevent any attempts of his disciples to take him down. The Romans had the custom of having soldiers guard those who were crucified, not only to ensure they would die but also to ensure they would not be removed and receive a proper burial. This makes it likely that this is the same watch Pilate mentioned, as there was even a centurion in charge of it.
