# Matthew 27:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The title affixed to Jesus on the cross, written in three languages, served to both mock the Jews and fulfill a higher purpose in God's providence. It accurately summarized the accusation and condemnation against Jesus, stating, This is Jesus of Nazareth the King of the Jews. Pilate unintentionally foreshadowed the future preaching of the Gospel through this act. The inscription carried by the crucified person was customary and in Jesus' case, it carried the weight of the profound truth that He is the true King of the Jews.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The â€˜titleâ€™ appears to have been written by Pilate and sent to be affixed on the cross."
2. "On the difference in the four Gospels as to the words of the inscription itself it is hardly worth while to comment, except to remark, that the advocates for the verbal and literal exactness of each Gospel may here find an undoubted example of the absurdity of their view."
3. "A title was written, containing certain words; not four titles, all different, but one, differing probably from all of these four, but certainly from three of them."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A man is often said to do what he directs others to do."
2. "It was customary to set up over the heads of persons crucified the crime for which they suffered, and the name of the sufferer."
3. "The difficulty may be easily removed. [...] One evangelist may have translated it from the Hebrew, another from the Greek, a third from the Latin, and a fourth may have translated one of the inscriptions a little differently from another."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:

3. "This was not, indeed, the lawful preaching of the Gospel, for Pilate was unworthy to be employed by God as a witness for his Son; but what was afterwards to be accomplished by the true ministers was prefigured in Pilate."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It was customary for the person to be crucified to carry â€˜a title,â€™ suspended from his neck, to the place of execution."

3. "Thus He died, with His proper title over His head."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "The three languages are mentioned only by John (John 19:20), Latin for law, Hebrew (Aramaic) for the Jews, Greek for everybody."
3. "The accusation (charge, cause, Î±Î¹Ï„Î¹Î±) correctly told the facts of the condemnation."

### John Gill:
1. "It was what contained the sum and substance of what he was accused, and for which he was condemned, and suffered."
