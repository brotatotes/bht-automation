# Matthew 27:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On the day of Jesus' crucifixion, he was executed alongside two robbers. While their crimes may have differed, they shared the same fate of death on the cross. This arrangement held significant meaning, as it symbolized that though Jesus himself was without sin, he willingly took on the role of a transgressor and stood in the place of sinners. His inclusion with the robbers demonstrated how divine justice was carried out, leading to his ultimate sacrifice for all humanity.
