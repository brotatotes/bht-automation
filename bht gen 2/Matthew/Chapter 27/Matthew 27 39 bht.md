# Matthew 27:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The bystanders, showing a heartless disregard for the suffering Jesus, engaged in a barrage of insults and malicious taunts against him, spewing all kinds of evil against him. Despite their venomous words, Jesus remained silent, illustrating the virtue of patience in the face of reviling. These onlookers, reveling in his misery, wagged their heads in arrogance and contempt, their actions fulfilling the prophecies spoken of in the Psalms and Isaiah. It is both astounding and tragic that even in the midst of his agonizing crucifixion, Jesus became the object of such brutal and heartless ridicule.
