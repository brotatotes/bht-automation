# Matthew 27:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
How easily they justified their actions, even though they were guilty of shedding innocent blood! They had the audacity to claim that they couldn't accept the blood money into the treasury, while having no qualms about the murder of an innocent man. Their hypocrisy knows no bounds.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Judas had been with Him in all circumstances for three years; his post, as treasurer to Him and the Twelve, gave him peculiar opportunity of watching the spirit, disposition, and habits of his Master."
2. "While his covetous nature and thievish practices would incline him to dark and suspicious, rather than frank and generous, interpretations of all that He said and did."
3. "If, then, he could have fastened on one questionable feature in all that he had so long witnessed, we may be sure that no such speech as this would ever have escaped his lips, nor would he have been so stung with remorse as not to be able to keep the money and survive his crime."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I have sinned - I have been guilty. I have done wrong."
2. "His testimony, being a disciple of Jesus, would have been to the chief priests far more valuable than that of any other man; and he might not only have escaped the horrors of a troubled conscience and an awful death, but have looked for an ample reward."
3. "They had secured what they wanted - the person of Jesus - and they cared little now for the feelings of the traitor. So all wicked men who make use of the agency of others for the accomplishment of crime or the gratification of passion care little for the effect on the instrument."

### John Calvin:
1. "Here is described the stupidity and madness of the priests, since even after having been warned by the dreadful example of Judas, still they do not think about themselves."
2. "Let us therefore learn, that when we see wicked persons, with whom we have anything in common, filled with alarm, those are so many excitements to repentance, and that they who neglect such excitements aggravate their criminality."
3. "We ought also to believe that the crime of one man can have no effect in acquitting all those who are in any way involved in it; and still more, that the leading perpetrators of a crime can gain no advantage by distinguishing between themselves and their agents, that they may not suffer the same punishment."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Although Judas had no real conception of the sinfulness of sin, his feeling was intense."
2. "Fearful sorrow for the consequences of sin may coexist with entire sinfulness."
3. "The rulers have no remorse. Was Judas then worse than his employers?"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Judas made a belated confession of his sin in betraying innocent blood to the Sanhedrin, but not to God, nor to Jesus."
2. "The Sanhedrin ignore the innocent or righteous blood (αιμα αθωιον or δικαιον) and tell Judas to look after his own guilt himself."
3. "The use of συ οψη as a volitive future, an equivalent of the imperative, is commoner in Latin (tu videris) than in Greek, though the Koine shows it also."

### John Gill:
1. "he confessed, but not to the right persons; not to God, nor Christ, but to the chief priests and elders" 
2. "he knew, and believed in his own conscience, that he was a good man, and a righteous and innocent one" 
3. "they said, what is that to us? see thou to that: signifying, that if he had sinned, he must answer for it himself; it was no concern of theirs"

### John Wesley:
1. "How easily could they digest innocent blood!"
2. "And yet they had a conscience!"
3. "It is not lawful (say they) to put it into the treasury - But very lawful to slay the innocent!"
