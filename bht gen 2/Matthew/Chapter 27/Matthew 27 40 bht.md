# Matthew 27:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The spectators at Jesus' crucifixion taunt him with the charge of destroying the temple. This accusation was based on false witnesses, who twisted Jesus' words about his ability to rebuild the temple in three days. They mockingly suggest that if he truly had such power, he would not be hanging on the cross. However, Jesus' true sonship is not proven by coming down from the cross, but rather through his resurrection, which would display even greater power. This scene highlights the depravity of humanity and their failure to recognize the divine sacrifice unfolding before them.
