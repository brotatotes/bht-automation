# Matthew 27:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On this particular occasion, various members of the Sanhedrin, representing different classes, gathered in large numbers to publicly taunt and ridicule Jesus. Their actions resembled that of foolish children who delighted in mocking one another. This mockery, displayed during a significant religious festival, was perpetuated by the very authorities who had previously condemned Jesus. Not only did they fail to intervene or disapprove of the ill treatment Jesus was subjected to, they themselves joined in the jeering and insulted him. The mocking likely continued for a considerable time, with varying forms of derision and gibes aimed at him.
