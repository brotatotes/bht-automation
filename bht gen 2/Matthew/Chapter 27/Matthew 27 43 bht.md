# Matthew 27:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The statement He trusted in God refers to the claim of Christ to have an interest in God, to be held in high favor, and to possess great faith and confidence. It suggests that Christ pretended to have a special relationship with God. The phrase if he is well pleased with him as his own Son indicates that Christ believed God delighted in Him and would extend favor and goodwill towards Him. These assertions serve as a powerful affirmation of the truth of the specific Psalm and prophecy associated with Him, countering the sneering accusations against Christ's divine sonship.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "See Psalms 22:7-8. This is not according to the LXX, which has ἤλπισεν ἐπὶ κύριον · ῥυσάσθω αὐτόν , σωσάτω αὐτόν , ὅτι θέλει αὐτόν. This is omitted by Mark and Luke." 
2. "θέλειν τινά for amare aliquem, occurs in reff. Ps. We have θέλειν with an accus. of the thing in reff. and Ezekiel 18:23; Ezekiel 18:32." 
3. "θέλειν followed by ἐν with a person, 1 Kings 18:22; 1 Chronicles 28:4 (not Colossians 2:18; see note there)."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "If he will have him [ει θελει αυτον] . Rev., correctly, If he desireth him: i.e., If he likes him."
2. "Compare Ps. xviii. (Sept. 17) 19; because he delighted in me [ηθελησε με], Ps. xli. (Sept. 40) 11 [τεθεληκας με]."

### John Calvin:
1. "Satan attempts to drive us to despair by this logic, that it is in vain for us to feel assured of the love of God, when we do not clearly perceive his aid."
2. "It is contrary to the nature of faith that the word 'now' should be insisted on by those whom God is training by the cross and by adversity to obedience."
3. "Christ was not delivered from death until he had endured the punishment which we deserved; because that was the price by which our salvation was purchased."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Their Pharisaical scrupulousness made them substitute 'God' for 'Jehovah,' which occurs in the Psalm, and which the Jews would not utter."
2. "That Psalm was now finding its fulfilment, and the verse they echo is preceded by a description (Matthew 27:7) of their very gestures."
3. "See Matthew 27:46."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Let him deliver him now (ρυσασθω νυν). They add the word 'now' to Matthew 27:21; Matthew 22:8. That is the point of the sneer at Christ's claim to be God's son thrown in his teeth again and at the willingness and power of God to help his 'son.'"

### John Gill:
1. "He trusted in God,.... That is, he pretended to claim an interest in him, to be high in his favour and esteem, and to have great faith and confidence in him..."
2. "if he is well pleased with him as his own Son, or delights in him as such, and will show him any favour and good will..."
3. "are a wonderful confirmation of the truth of that Psalm and prophecy belonging to him..."
