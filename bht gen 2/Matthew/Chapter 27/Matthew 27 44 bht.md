# Matthew 27:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The robbers who were crucified alongside Jesus joined in the mockery and insults against him, despite the fact that they too were facing death. Instead of repenting and seeking forgiveness, they chose to add to their sins and further condemn themselves. One of the robbers, however, had a change of heart and rebuked his fellow criminal, acknowledging his own guilt and declaring Jesus' innocence. He humbly asked Jesus to remember him when he entered his kingdom.
