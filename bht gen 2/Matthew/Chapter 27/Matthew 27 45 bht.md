# Matthew 27:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The darkness that covered the earth from the sixth hour to the ninth hour during Christ's sufferings was a powerful testimony to the magnitude of the event. Even a heathen philosopher, witnessing the darkness and recognizing that it could not be a natural eclipse, exclaimed that either the God of nature suffers or the world is falling apart. This supernatural darkness served as an indication both of God's abhorrence of the wickedness being committed and of Christ's intense struggles against Divine justice and the forces of darkness.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The only cause of this was the interposing power of God - furnishing testimony to the dignity of the sufferer, and causing the elements to sympathize with the pains of his dying Son."
2. "A thick darkness, shutting out the light of day, and clothing every object with the gloom of midnight, was the appropriate drapery with which the world should be clad when the Son of God expired."
3. "This darkness was noticed by one at least of the pagan writers. Phlegon, a Roman astronomer, speaking of the 14th year of the reign of Tiberius, which is supposed to be that in which our Saviour died, says 'that the greatest eclipse of the sun that was ever known happened then, for the day was so turned into night that the stars appeared.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "Although in the death of Christ the weakness of the flesh concealed for a short time the glory of the Godhead...yet the heavenly Father did not cease to distinguish him by some marks, and during his lowest humiliation prepared some indications of his future glory."
2. "Thus the majesty of Christ was attested by the obscuration of the sun, by the earthquake, by the splitting of the rocks, and the rending of the veil, as if heaven and earth were rendering the homage which they owed to their Creator."
3. "But we inquire, in the first place, what was the design of the eclipse of the sun?...For if they were not altogether hardened, an unusual change of the order of nature must have made a deep impression on their senses, so as to look forward to an approaching renewal of the world."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "From midday to three o’clock in the afternoon, usually the brightest part of the day, there was a darkness."
2. "It was a miraculous occurrence designed to exhibit the amazement of nature and or the God of nature at the wickedness of the crucifixion."
3. "If Jesus of Nazareth is what the Gospels represent Him to be, the needs of humanity ask Him to be, and the faith of the Christian finds Him to be, the supernatural here seems natural."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It was six o'clock in the morning Roman time when the trial occurred before Pilate."
2. "The darkness began at noon, the sixth hour Jewish time and lasted till 3 P.M. Roman time."
3. "One need not be disturbed if nature showed its sympathy with the tragedy of the dying of the Creator on the Cross."

"From the sixth hour, there was darkness over all the earth unto the ninth hour — Insomuch, that even a heathen philosopher seeing it, and knowing it could not be a natural eclipse, because it was at the time of the full moon, and continued three hours together, cried out, 'Either the God of nature suffers, or the frame of the world is dissolved.'"
2. "By this darkness God testified his abhorrence of the wickedness which was then committing."
3. "It likewise intimated Christ's sore conflicts with the Divine justice, and with all the powers of darkness."
