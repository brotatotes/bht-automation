# Matthew 27:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of his suffering, Jesus cried out, expressing his deep agony and the sense of abandonment he felt from God Himself. This cry reveals his unwavering trust in God, while also conveying the immense distress he experienced as the forces of darkness assailed him. It is a poignant moment where the comforting presence of God was withdrawn, leaving Jesus with a harrowing realization of the wrath that our sins deserved, and which he willingly bore on our behalf.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "His inner consciousness of union with God must have been complete and indestructible but, like His higher and holy Will, liable to be obscured by human weakness and pain."
2. "In the words however, 'My God' there speaks the same union with the Divine Will, and abiding in the everlasting covenant purpose, as in those, 'Not my will, but thine.'"
3. "These are the only words on the Cross related by Matt. and Mark and they are related by none besides."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "My God, my God ... - This expression is one denoting intense suffering."
2. "His great bodily sufferings on the cross, greatly aggravated by his previous scourging, and by the want of sympathy, and by the revilings of his enemies on the cross."
3. "It was the manifestation of God’s hatred of sin, in some way which he has not explained, that he experienced in that dread hour."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The approach of the Sabbath, and then its actual commencement, were announced by threefold blasts from the priests' trumpets."
2. "The first three blasts were blown when one-third of the evening-sacrifice service was over, or about the ninth hour."
3. "Early on Friday afternoon the new course of priests, of Levites, and of the 'stationary men' who were to be the representatives of all Israel, arrived Jerusalem."

### John Calvin:
1. "Though in the cry which Christ uttered a power more than human was manifested, yet it was unquestionably drawn from him by intensity of sorrow."
2. "Those interpreters are widely mistaken who, laying aside this part of redemption, attended solely to the outward punishment of the flesh; for in order that Christ might satisfy for us, it was necessary that he should be placed as a guilty person at the judgment-seat of God."
3. "No one who considers that Christ undertook the office of Mediator on the condition of suffering our condemnation, both in his body and in his soul, will think it strange that he maintained a struggle with the sorrows of death, as if an offended God had thrown him into a whirlpool of afflictions."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The agony resembles that in Gethsemane, but seems even more intense."
2. "But it is better to admit a primary reference to David, or to an ideal person representing the righteous. It is then typical of the life, sufferings, and victory of Christ, necessarily finding its highest and most striking fulfilment in Him."
3. "But His soul was capable of unusual sufferings. This was an experience of sin and death in their inner connection and universal significance for the race, by One who was perfectly pure and holy, a mysterious and indescribable anguish of the body and the soul in immediate prospect of, and in actual wrestling with, death as the wages of sin and the culmination of all misery of man, of which the Saviour was free, but which He voluntarily assumed from infinite love in behalf of the race."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken me?" - Matthew first transliterates the Aramaic, according to the Vatican manuscript (B), the words used by Jesus: Eloi, eloi, lema sabachthanei.
2. "This is the only sentence of any length in Aramaic preserved in Matthew, though he has Aramaic words like amen, corban, mammon, pascha, raca, Satan, Golgotha."
3. "Nothing from Jesus so well illustrates the depth of his suffering of soul as he felt himself regarded as sin though sinless (2 Corinthians 5:21). John 3:16 comes to our relief here as we see the Son of God bearing the sin of the world. This cry of desolation comes at the close of the three hours of darkness."

### John Gill:
1. "The Jews say that every day the daily sacrifice was slain at eight and a half, and was offered up at nine and a half."
2. "He calls him his God, not as he was God, but as he was man; who, as such, was chosen by him to the grace of union to the Son of God."
3. "The whole of it evinces the truth of Christ's human nature, that he was in all things made like unto his brethren; that he had an human soul, and endured sorrows and sufferings in it, of which this of desertion was not the least."

### John Wesley:
1. "Jesus cried out, while he suffered from God himself what was unutterable."
