# Matthew 27:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The mocking words of calling upon Elias were not likely spoken by the Roman soldiers or the Jewish spectators who would have understood His words correctly. Instead, it is probable that the Hellenistic Jews, who may not have fully grasped the Hebrew language, misunderstood His call and thought He was asking for the prophet Elias. Alternatively, some Jews deliberately misinterpreted Him in order to taunt and ridicule Jesus.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This was not said by the Roman soldiers, who could know nothing of Elias; nor was it a misunderstanding of the Jewish spectators, who must have well understood the import of ἡλί: nor again was it said in any apprehension, from the supernatural darkness, that Elias might really come." 
2. "It was replied in intended mockery, as οὗτος, ‘this one among the three,’ clearly indicates." 
3. "This is one of the cases where those who advocate an original Hebrew Gospel of Matthew are obliged to suppose that the Greek translator has retained the original words, in order to make the reason of the reply clear."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The taunt would be more cutting, because it was the universal belief of the Jews, as well as the doctrine of Christ, that 'Elias' would come before the Messiah."
2. "They derided him now, as calling upon 'Elias' when God would not help him; still keeping up the pretensions to being the Messiah, and invoking 'Elijah' to come from the dead to aid him."
3. "Or it is possible that this might have been said by some bystanders who did not understand the language in which he spoke, or who might not have been near enough to hear him distinctly."

### John Calvin:
1. "For Satan has no method more effectual for ruining the salvation of the godly, than by dissuading them from calling on God."
2. "Thus we see that he was tortured on every hand, in order that, overwhelmed with despair, he might abstain from calling on God, which was, to abandon salvation."
3. "Yet though they may change God into Elijah, when they have ridiculed us to their heart’s content, God will at length listen to our groanings, and will show that he vindicates his glory, and punishes base falsehood."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The resemblance between the word 'Eli' and the name Elijah is very close in the original."
2. "There is here an allusion to the belief that Elijah would come before the Messiah, and hence a sarcastic denial of His Messiahship."
3. "A real misapprehension of His language, and a fear that Elijah might come, seem improbable."

### John Gill:
1. "These could not be the Roman soldiers that said so, who had no notion of Elias; rather the Hellenistic Jews, who not so well understanding the Hebrew language, hearing the above words, and having some notion of the prophet Elias, fancied he was calling for him."
2. "Though it seems most likely to be the Jews, who either through the nearness of the sound of the words, and mistake of them, and not near enough to hear and distinguish them, really thought he called for that prophet."
3. "Or rather wilfully mistook him, with an intent to banter and ridicule him."
