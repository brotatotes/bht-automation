# Matthew 27:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As one of the soldiers ran, he took a sponge and filled it with vinegar, which was the common drink of Roman soldiers. The sponge was put on a reed, possibly with a leathern handle, and given to Jesus to drink. Though it may seem like an act of derision, it is likely that the intent was not malicious but rather a friendly gesture. The bystanders, however, wanted to keep watch in anticipation of Elijah's arrival before Jesus died.
