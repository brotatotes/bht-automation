# Matthew 27:49 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The bystanders mockingly called upon Elijah to come and save him, completely unaware of the significance of Jesus' suffering. There was a misconception among the Jews that Elijah was the forerunner of the Messiah, so they scoffed at the idea of Jesus being saved by anyone. This scene reveals their lack of understanding and their misguided expectations. It is worth noting that the mention of piercing Jesus' side with a spear and the flow of blood and water is likely an interpolation, added later.
