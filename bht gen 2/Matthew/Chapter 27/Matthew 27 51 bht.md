# Matthew 27:51 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The temple veil, thick and richly woven, was torn in two from top to bottom, displaying a remarkable sight. It signified the immediate removal of the separation between God and the people, symbolizing the end of the ceremonial law that found fulfillment in the death of Christ. Additionally, the earthquake that accompanied His death was not only a testimony to God's wrath against the Jewish nation, but also a sign of the profound significance of Christ's sacrifice and its impact on the destiny of the earth.

3. "Rocks are still seen at Mount Calvary thus rent asunder, which are said to be the ones that were convulsed when the Saviour died."

2. "Thus the rending of the veil was not only an abrogation of the ceremonies which existed under the law, but was, in some respects, an opening of heaven, that God may now invite the members of his Son to approach him with familiarity."
3. "In this way not only did the earth bear the testimony to its Creator, but it was even called as a witness against the hard-heartedness of a perverse nation; for it showed how monstrous that obstinacy must have been on which neither the earthquake nor the splitting of the rocks made any impression."
