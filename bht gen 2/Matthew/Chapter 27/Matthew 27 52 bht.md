## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The whole transaction was supernatural and symbolic: no other interpretation of it will satisfy even ordinary common sense."
2. "The graves were opened at the moment of the death of the Lord; but inasmuch as He is the first-fruits from the dead the Resurrection and the Life the bodies of the saints in them did not arise till He rose."
3. "These following clauses...require only this explanation to be fully understood. The graves were opened at the moment of the death of the Lord; but inasmuch as He is the first-fruits from the dead the Resurrection and the Life the bodies of the saints in them did not arise till He rose."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Thus, in the opening of the graves at the moment of the Redeemer's expiring, there was a glorious symbolical proclamation that the death which had just taken place had 'swallowed up death in victory'."
2. "It must be observed, however, that the resurrection of these sleeping saints was not like those of the widow of Nain's son, of Jairus' daughter, of Lazarus, and of the man who 'revived and stood upon his feet,' on his dead body touching the bones of Elisha—which were mere temporary recallings of the departed spirit to the mortal body, to be followed by a final departure of it 'till the trumpet shall sound.' But this was a resurrection once for all, to life everlasting."
3. "There is no room to doubt that they went to glory with their Lord, as bright trophies of His victory over death."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Graves" or sepulchres were most commonly made, among the Jews, in solid rocks or in caves of rocks. The rending of the rocks, therefore, would lay them open.
2. It is probable that they were persons who had recently died, and they appear to have been known in Jerusalem; at least, had the ancient saints risen, they would not have been known, and would not so soon have been credited as those who had recently died.
3. The death of saints is often called "sleep."

### John Calvin:
1. "This was also a striking miracle, by which God declared that his Son entered into the prison of death, not to continue to be shut up there, but to bring out all who were held captive."
2. "But in order that the minds of believers might be more quickly raised to hope, it was advantageous that the resurrection, which was to be common to all of them, should be tasted by a few."
3. "As God intended, by their persons, to confirm the hope of the heavenly life among those who were then alive, there would be no absurdity in saying that, after having performed this office, they again rested in their graves."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The splitting of the rocks by the earthquake and the opening of tombs can be due to the earthquake."
2. "The raising of the bodies of the dead after the resurrection of Jesus which appeared to many in the holy city puzzles many today who admit the actual bodily resurrection of Jesus."
3. "We come back to miracles connected with the birth of Jesus, God's Son coming into the world. If we grant the possibility of such manifestations of God's power, there is little to disturb one here in the story of the death of God's Son."

### John Gill:
1. "This was a proof of Christ's power over death and the grave, by dying; when he through death, destroyed him that had the power of it, and abolished death itself; and became the plague of death and the destruction of the grave, taking into his hands the keys of hell and death."
2. "And they rose in the same bodies in which they before lived, otherwise they could not be called their bodies, or known by those to whom they appeared."
3. "But who they were is not to be known; some have thought them to be the ancient patriarchs, as Adam, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, c. In the Septuagint on Job 42:17, Job is said to be one of them, and a tradition is there recorded, which runs thus: 'it is written, that he rose with whom the Lord rose.'"

### John Wesley:
