# Matthew 27:53 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The city of Jerusalem, referred to as the holy city by Matthew, was chosen by God and its holiness remains intact despite the corruption of its inhabitants. It is possible that the reason for raising the saints at the time of Jesus' death was to provide evidence to the Jews that he was indeed the Messiah. These resurrected individuals, perhaps even his close friends, became living testimonies of Jesus' power over sin and death, ultimately ascending to heaven as a victorious testament to his triumph over all.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "The narrative of Matthew does not determine whether they came to life before Jesus rose, and remained in the tombs, or came to life after he died."
2. "There is nothing said of the reason why they were raised. It is not improbable to suppose that it was, amid the other wonders attending the death of Jesus, to convince the Jews that he was the Messiah."
3. "Perhaps some who had been his open friends were raised up now as an attestation that he in whom they had believed was the Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "When Matthew bestows on Jerusalem the honorable designation of the holy city, he does not intend to applaud the character of its inhabitants... But as it had been chosen by God, its holiness, which was founded on God’s adoption, could not be effaced by any corruptions of men."
2. "On the part of man it was profane, and on the part of God it was holy, till the destruction or pollution of the temple."


### John Gill:
1. "He rose as the first fruits, as the first begotten of the dead, and the firstborn from the dead."
2. "These saints, I apprehend, continued on earth until our Lord's ascension, and then joining the retinue of angels, went triumphantly with him to heaven, as trophies of his victory over sin, Satan, death, and the grave."
