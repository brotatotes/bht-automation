# Matthew 27:54 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The centurion, who witnessed the earthquake and heard the strong voice of Christ before His death, was filled with great fear. In his declaration, Truly this was the Son of God, he recognized the divine power and authority of Jesus. This centurion, although not a Jew and unfamiliar with the Jewish concept of the Son of God, acknowledged that what he saw and heard proved that Jesus was indeed a divine figure. His confession stands as a testament to the truth of Christ's identity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The circumstances of our Matthew 27:51-53, except the rending of the veil, are not in the possession of Mark, of the minute accuracy of whose account I have no doubt."
2. "His report is that of one man and that man, more than probably, a convert. Matthew’s is of many, and represents their general impression. Luke’s is also general."
3. "It cannot be doubtful, I think, that he used these words in the Jewish sense and with some idea of that which they implied."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Truly this was the Son of God—There cannot be a reasonable doubt that this expression was used in the Jewish sense, and that it points to the claim which Jesus made to be the Son of God, and on which His condemnation expressly turned. The meaning, then, clearly is that He must have been what He professed to be; in other words, that He was no impostor."
2. "There was no medium between those two."
3. "See, on the similar testimony of the penitent thief—'This man hath done nothing amiss.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They feared greatly - They regarded these things as proof that God was angry, and they were terrified at the prospect that vengeance was coming on them."
2. "Truly this was the Son of God - They had heard, probably, that Jesus professed to be the Son of God. Seeing these wonders, they believed that God was now attesting the truth of his professions."
3. "The centurion was a pagan, and had probably no very distinct notions of the phrase 'the Son of God' - perhaps understanding by it only that he was like the pagan heroes who had been deified; but he certainly regarded these wonders as proof that he was 'what he professed to be.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The words must not be construed as a recognition of Christ's divine sonship."
2. "They were uttered by a pagan soldier in his own sense of a demigod or hero."
3. "Yet they may have taken color from the fact that the soldiers had heard from the chief priests and others that Christ had claimed to be God's son."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is wonderful that an irreligious man, who had not been instructed in the Law, and was ignorant of true religion, should form so correct a judgment from the signs which he beheld."
2. "This comparison tends powerfully to condemn the stupidity of the city; for it was an evidence of shocking madness, that when the fabric of the world shook and trembled, none of the Jews were affected by it except the despised rabble."
3. "Let us learn by this example, that it is of little importance, or of no importance at all, if a man is struck with terror, when he sees before his eyes the power of God, until, after the astonishment has been abated, the fear of God remains calmly in his heart."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Truly this was the Son of God, or, 'God's Son.' The heathen officer may have used these words in the heathen sense: hero or demigod; but this is not probable."
2. "Heathen became Christians through the preaching of the cross, why not through the sight of the dying Redeemer. Such a conversion would be thus indicated."
3. "Only the centurion thus spoke, but as the soldiers 'feared, some decided spiritual effect may have been produced on them also."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Truly this was the Son of God." 
2. "There is no way to tell. Evidently the centurion... was deeply moved by the portents which he had witnessed."
3. "If he was won now to trust in Christ, he came as a pagan and, like the robber who believed, was saved as Jesus hung upon the Cross."

### John Gill:
1. "Saw the earthquake, and those things that were done;... heard with what a loud voice Christ spoke, and then at once expired: they feared greatly; not with a true godly fear, but with a fear of punishment."
2. "they concluded... from effects of divine power; and which to them showed him to be a divine person, what he said he was."
3. "the Jews charged him with blasphemy, on account of, and condemned him for, as these soldiers might have seen and heard."

### John Wesley:
1. "The centurion...feared, saying, Truly this was the Son of God."
