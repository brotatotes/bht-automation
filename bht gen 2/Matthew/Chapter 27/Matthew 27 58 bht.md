# Matthew 27:58 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Joseph boldly approached Pilate to ask for permission to take Jesus' body, undeterred by the shame associated with Christ's crucifixion. He sought to prevent the Jews from dishonoring Jesus further in His burial. To Joseph's surprise, Pilate readily granted his request, allowing him to respectfully lay Jesus to rest. This willingness may have been influenced by Joseph's social standing and character.
