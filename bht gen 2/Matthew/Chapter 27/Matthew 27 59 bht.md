# Matthew 27:59 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The body of Christ was honorably buried, wrapped in linen, as was customary for the Jews. Even in death, Jesus was treated with respect and dignity. The use of linen symbolizes His purity and innocence, as He was the sinless Lamb of God who died for the sins of others. It also represents His righteous life and the perfect righteousness that He offers to all who believe in Him. The anointing and preparation of His body by Joseph and the women demonstrate the care and devotion they had for Jesus, even in the midst of great sorrow and urgency.
