# Matthew 27:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The chief priests took the silver pieces, but they deemed it unlawful to put them into the treasury or Corban because it was the price of blood. They strained at a gnat by refusing to put the money in the treasury, yet they swallowed a camel by shedding innocent blood without hesitation. Their scruples about the money reveal their hypocrisy, pretending to have great religious reverence while committing heinous crimes. It is ironic how they were meticulous in their observance of religious laws regarding offerings, yet they showed no remorse for their actions.
