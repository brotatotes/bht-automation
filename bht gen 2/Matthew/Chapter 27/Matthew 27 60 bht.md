# Matthew 27:60 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ, who had no place to lay his head in life, was laid in another's tomb in death. The stone rolled to the door of the sepulchre was large and broad, as the Jews describe it, and served as a means to block the entrance. The tomb itself had been hewn out of a rock before and did not require additional measures for closure. Instead, Christ's body was wrapped in a clean linen cloth, along with myrrh and aloes, for preservation before being interred in the tomb.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "John does not mention that it belonged to Joseph but the expression ἐν ᾧ οὐδέπω οὐδεὶς ἐτέθη looks as if he knew more than he has thought it necessary to state."
2. "All that we can determine respecting the sepulchre from the data here furnished is, (1) That it was not a natural cave, but an artificial excavation in the rock. (2) That it was not cut downwards, after the manner of a grave with us, but horizontally, or nearly so, into the face of the rock."
3. "That it was in the spot where the crucifixion took place. Cyr-jer. speaks of τὸ μνῆμα τὸ πλησίον, ὅπου ἐτέθη, κ. ὁ ἐπιτεθεὶς τῇ θύρᾳ λίθος, ὁ μέχρι σήμερον παρὰ τῷ μνημείῳ κείμενος."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In this tomb...no man had been laid...that there might be no suspicion about his identity when he rose." 
2. "By being buried here an important prophecy was remarkably fulfilled... 'He made his grave - with the rich in his death.'"
3. "Being cut out of a rock, there was no way by which the disciples could have access to it but by the entrance...thus...all possible precautions...against imposition and deceit."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "New tomb [καινω] . See on Matthew 26:29. Not newly hewn, but fresh, undefiled by anybody."
2. "A great stone. Though in the Jews ' sepulchres in general there were doors hung on hinges, the grooves and perforations for which may still be seen."
3. "Joseph 's tomb may have been differently constructed, or else was in an unfinished state."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The fact that it was ‘new’ seems designed to overcome any suspicion as to the identity of Him who rose."
2. "The location was in a ‘garden’, near the spot of the crucifixion and hence well adapted for the hurried burial."
3. "He rolled a great stone. The common method of closing sepulchres."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ was laid not in his own, but in another's tomb; for as in his lifetime he had not where to lay his head; so when he was dead, he had no sepulchre of his own to put his body in."
2. "The stone rolled to the door, was what the Jews call, גולל, from its being rolled to, and from the door of the sepulchre; and which, they say, was a large and broad stone, with which the mouth of the sepulchre was stopped above."
3. "In this case, there was no need for the latter, because the sepulchre in which the body of Christ was laid, had been hewn out of a rock before; but the body was wrapped in a clean linen cloth, and wound up in it with myrrh and aloes to preserve it, and was interred."
