# Matthew 27:61 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The women, including Mary Magdalene and the mother of James and Joses, carefully observed where Jesus' body was laid and how it was placed, as noted by Matthew. In Luke's account, they went back to the city to prepare spices and ointments to anoint the body, following the Sabbath commandment. Their intention was to honor Jesus' burial with the aromatic and precious substances. Sitting over against the sepulchre, they mourned in this posture, transformed from their previous standing position, following the crucifixion of Jesus.
