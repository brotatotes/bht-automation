# Matthew 27:62 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On the day following the preparation day, which was the day the Jews prepared for the Sabbath, the next day was the Sabbath according to Jewish tradition. This circumlocution in the text seems to indicate that the Jewish Sabbath had been abolished, highlighting the shift from the old covenant to the new covenant. It is noteworthy that while the chief priests and Pharisees accused the disciples of violating the Sabbath, they themselves did not hesitate to consult and conspire in order to discredit the truth of Christ's resurrection.
