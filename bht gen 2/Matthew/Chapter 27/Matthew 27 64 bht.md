# Matthew 27:64 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To prevent any deception, they requested that the tomb be secured with a Roman guard, fearing that Jesus' disciples might steal his body. However, they greatly underestimated the disciples' fearfulness and timidity, for they would never have dared such an act. The people's initial error was their belief in Jesus as the Messiah, and the false claim of his resurrection would only enhance and expand this belief among a larger audience, making it an even greater deception.
