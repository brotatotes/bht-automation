# Matthew 27:65 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Ye have a guard, Pilate declared to the chief priests. This guard was not a Roman detachment, but rather their own watch stationed at the tower of Antonia for the protection of the temple. He further instructed them to make it as sure as you can, indicating that they should take all necessary measures to safeguard the tomb, utilizing their own guards and resources.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Perhaps we must understand some detachment placed at their disposal during the feast but there does not seem to be any record of such a practice."
2. "That the guards were under the Sanhedrim is plain from ch. Matthew 28:11, where they make their report (â€˜ut mos militiÃ¦, factum esse quod imperasset,â€™ Tacitus, Ann. i. 6), not to Pilate, but to the chief priests."
3. "á½¡Ï‚ Î¿á¼´Î´Î±Ï„Îµ as you know how: in the best manner you can. There is no irony in the words, as has been supposed."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Ye have a watchâ€”The guards had already acted under orders of the Sanhedrim, with Pilate's consent; but probably they were not clear about employing them as a night watch without Pilate's express authority." 
2. "Go your way, make it as sure as ye canâ€”as ye know how, or in the way ye deem securest." 
3. "Though there may be no irony in this speech, it evidently insinuated that if the event should be contrary to their wish, it would not be for want of sufficient human appliances to prevent it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Jews had a guard of Roman soldiers, who kept watch in the tower of Antonia, on the northwest of the temple."
2. "Pilate either referred to these, or to the 'watch' that attended the crucifixion - the whole 'band' that had been appointed for that."
3. "As the torments of crucifixion sometimes lasted many days, the band had been probably granted to them during that time, and they were therefore still at the direction of the chief priests."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Ye have [ÎµÏ‡ÎµÏ„Îµ] . Or, as some render, imperatively : Have a guard ! Rev., in margin, take.

### John Calvin:
1. "By these words, Pilate means that he grants their request by permitting them to post soldiers to keep watch."
2. "This permission bound them more firmly, so that they could not escape by any evasion."
3. "With Pilateâ€™s signet they as truly shut their own mouths as they shut up the sepulcher."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Ye have a guard, or, â€˜have a guard,â€™ i.e., I permit you to take one." 
2. "Make it sure as ye know how. Not â€˜as sure as ye can,â€™ nor is it at all ironical. He gives them the guard, and they are to use the means as they think best." 
3. "Pilate shirks the responsibility, but again gives way. Yet this was overruled for good."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Make it as sure as you can (Î±ÏƒÏ†Î±Î»Î¹ÏƒÎ±ÏƒÎ¸Îµ Ï‰Ï‚ Î¿Î¹Î´Î±Ï„Îµ)."
2. "Have a guard (ÎµÏ‡ÎµÏ„Îµ ÎºÎ¿Ï…ÏƒÏ„Ï‰Î´Î¹Î±Î½), present imperative, a guard of Roman soldiers, not mere temple police."
3. "The curt permission to the Jews whom he despised is suitable in the mouth of the Roman official."

### John Gill:
1. "Pilate said unto them, ye have a watch... the soldiers that had had the care of the crucifixion of Christ, and watched him on the cross, are designed."
2. "The words may be read imperatively, 'have yea watch', or 'take a watch'... and which seems best; for if they had a watch already, what occasion had they to have applied to Pilate for one?"
3. "Make [it] as sure as you can; or, as you know how to do it, and what will be proper and necessary."

### John Wesley:
1. Ye have a guard â€” Of your own, in the tower of Antonia, which was stationed there for the service of the temple.
