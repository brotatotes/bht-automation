# Matthew 27:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples consulted and used the money to buy a well-known potter's field. This field was likely of little value, possibly because it had been dug up for clay by potters. Judas, who had obtained the money through his betrayal, was associated with the purchase. The disciples' act of buying the field served as an act of humanity, offering a burial place for strangers, potentially foreigners visiting Jerusalem for the feasts. Ultimately, the field became a lasting memorial, reminding others of the disciples' sinful and infamous actions.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

1. "The field of some well-known potter purchased at so small a price probably from having been rendered useless for tillage by excavations for clay."
2. "Not for Gentiles, but for stranger Jews who came up to the feasts."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They consulted among themselves about the proper way to dispose of this money."
2. "It is not of necessity implied that Judas actually made the contract and paid down the money to buy a field... but that it was 'by his means' that the field was purchased."
3. "The price paid for a field so near Jerusalem may appear to be very small; but it is not improbable that it had been worked until the clay was exhausted, and was therefore considered as of little value."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The potter's field. Some well known spot, of little value, because unfit for tillage."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Grotius suggests that it was a small field where potter's clay was obtained, like a brickyard (Broadus). Otherwise we do not know why the name exists."
2. "In Acts 1:18 we have another account of the death of Judas by bursting open (possibly falling after hanging himself) after he obtained the field by the wages of iniquity."
3. "But it is possible that ÎµÎºÏ„Î·ÏƒÎ±Ï„Î¿ there refers to the rabbinical use of Korban, that the money was still that of Judas though he was dead and so he really 'acquired' the field by his blood-money."

### John Gill:
1. "A field of no great value, or it could not have been bought so near Jerusalem for so small a sum as thirty pieces of silver."

3. "It was so ordered by divine providence, that this became a public and lasting memorial of their sin and infamy."

### John Wesley:
1. "They bought with them the potter's field - Well known, it seems, by that name."
2. "But the earth had probably been digged for potters' vessels, so that it was now neither fit for tillage nor pasture, and consequently of small value."
3. "Foreigners - Heathens especially, of whom there were then great numbers in Jerusalem."
