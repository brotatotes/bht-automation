# Matthew 27:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The field mentioned in this passage is referred to as the field of blood because it was purchased with the price of blood, specifically the money that Judas received for betraying Jesus. Rather than being called the field of the priests or the field of the strangers, it is called the field of blood to signify that it was bought with the very blood money that was responsible for Jesus' betrayal. This name remained for many years, even until the time when Matthew wrote his Gospel, serving as a reminder of the treachery involved.
