# Matthew 27:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The prophecy spoken by Matthew in this passage, which was initially believed to be from Jeremiah, is actually from Zechariah. The inclusion of Jeremiah's name was a mistake made in later copies and translations. This passage is a fulfillment of what was figuratively represented in the past, now being truly accomplished. The prophecy from Zechariah refers to the Messiah, emphasizing his immense value and preciousness, even though he was sold for a sum of money. The significance of this fulfilled prophecy highlights the unity and truth of God's word.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The citation is not from Jeremiah (see ref.), and is probably quoted from memory and unprecisely."
2. "I put it to any faithful Christian to say, whether of the two presents the greater obstacle to his faith, the solution given above, or that in Wordsw.'s note, that the name of one prophet is here substituted for that of another, to teach us not to regard the prophets as the authors of their prophecies, but to trace them to divine Inspiration."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Never was a complicated prophecy, otherwise hopelessly dark, more marvellously fulfilled."
2. "Jeremiah of old had the first place among the prophets, and hereby he comes to be mentioned above all the rest in Matthew 21:5; because he stood first in the volume of the prophets."
3. "When, therefore, Matthew produceth a text of Zechariah under the name of Jeremy, he only cites the words of the volume of the prophets under his name who stood first in the volume of the prophets."

2. "Others have thought that there was a mistake made by ancient transcribers, writing the name Jeremiah instead of Zechariah."
3. "The price of him that was valued - That is, the price of him on whom a value was set. The word rendered 'valued,' here, does not, as often in our language, mean to 'esteem,' but to 'estimate;' not to love, approve, or regard, but to fix a price on, to estimate the value of."

### John Calvin:
1. "The passage itself plainly shows that the name of Jeremiah has been put down by mistake, instead of Zechariah, (Zechariah 11:13;) for in Jeremiah we find nothing of this sort, nor anything that even approaches to it."
2. "For the ceremonies and vain pretenses, by which the Jews recompensed his acts of kindness, are compared by him to thirty pieces of silver, as if they had been the unworthy and despicable hire of a cowherd or a day-laborer."

3. "Matthew has here (Matthew 27:10) 'the field of the potter' (εις τον αγρον του κεραμεως) for 'the potter the house of the Lord' in Zechariah 11:13."

### John Gill:
