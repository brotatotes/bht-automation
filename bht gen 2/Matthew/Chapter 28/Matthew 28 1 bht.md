# Matthew 28:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On the day after the Sabbath, when the sun had set and stars had appeared, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the sepulchre at sunrise. It is clear from all accounts that Jesus lay in the grave throughout the Sabbath day and rose early on the first day of the week. The timing of their visit and the mention of different points of the day - the end of the Sabbath, the setting sun, the appearance of stars, and the dawn - all contribute to understanding the sequence of events surrounding Jesus' resurrection.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The words σαββάτων and μίαν σαβ . are opposed, both being days."
2. "It is best to interpret a doubtful expression in unison with the other testimonies, and to suppose that here both the day and the breaking of the day are taken in their natural, not their Jewish sense."
3. "In Mark, Salome also. John speaks of Mary Magdalene alone."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Not an hour, it would seem, was lost by those dear lovers of the Lord Jesus." 
2. "Some judicious critics think all this was transacted while the women were approaching but the view we have given, which is the prevalent one, seems the more natural." 
3. "All this august preparation—recorded by Matthew alone—bespoke the grandeur of the exit which was to follow."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In the end of the sabbath...may be expressed in this manner: 'In the night following the Sabbath, for the Sabbath closed at sunset, as it began to dawn,' etc."
2. "The time when they came, therefore, was at the break of day, when the sun was about to rise, but while it was yet so dark as to render objects obscure, or not distinctly visible."
3. "These four women...came to anoint him. They had prepared a part of them on the evening before the Sabbath...They now, according to Mark, completed the preparation and bought more; or the meaning in Mark may be merely that, 'having bought' sweet spices, without specifying the time when, they came now to embalm him."

### John Calvin:
1. "For the lively assurance of our reconciliation with God arises from Christ having come from hell as the conqueror of death, in order to show that he had the power of a new life at his disposal."
2. "Justly, therefore, does Paul say that there will be no gospel, and that the hope of salvation will be vain and fruitless, unless we believe that Christ is risen from the dead."
3. "Thus he gradually brought his followers, according to their capacity, to a larger measure of knowledge. He began with the women, and not only presented himself to be seen by them, but even gave them a commission to announce the gospel to the apostles, so as to become their instructors."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Literally ‘at the dawning into.’ Mark says: ‘at the rising of the sun;’ Luke: ‘very early in the morning’ (literally ‘deep dawn’); John: ‘while it was yet dark.’" 
2. "The purpose of anointing or embalming the body is omitted by Matthew (see accounts of Mark and Luke), These two women did not bear the spices." 
3. "Another motive was present, an unconscious hope of the resurrection which hurried these women, who had watched by the sepulchre, in advance of the others."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This careful chronological statement according to Jewish days clearly means that before the sabbath was over, that is before six P.M., this visit by the women was made 'to see the sepulchre' (θεορησα τον ταφον)."
2. "They had rested on the sabbath after preparing spices and ointments for the body of Jesus (Luke 23:56), a sabbath of unutterable sorrow and woe."
