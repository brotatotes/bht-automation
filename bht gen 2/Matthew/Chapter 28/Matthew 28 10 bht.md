## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The repetition of this injunction by the Lord has been thought to indicate that this is a portion of another narrative inwoven here, and may possibly belong to the same incident as that in Matthew 28:7."
2. "There is perhaps more probability that this may be the same appearance as that in John 20:11-18, on account of μή μου ἅπτου there and τοὺς ἀδελφ . μου, but in our present imperfect state of information, this must remain a mere probability."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Be not afraid—What dear associations would these familiar words—now uttered in a higher style, but by the same Lips—bring rushing back to their recollection!" 
2. "Go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me—The brethren here meant must have been His brethren after the flesh... for His brethren in the higher sense had several meetings with Him at Jerusalem before He went to Galilee." 
3. "The Guards Bribed. The whole of this important portion is peculiar to Matthew."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Be not afraid - The ancients, when in the presence of a heavenly being - an angel, or one who was supposed to be possessed of divine power were commonly struck with great 'fear,' as well as a great sense of their unworthiness."
2. "Jesus comforted them...and they had no reason now to fear him."
3. "There is something exceedingly tender in the appellation used here - 'my brethren.' Though he was risen from the dead, though about to be exalted to heaven, yet he did not disdain to call his disciples his brethren."

### John Calvin:
1. "That they may raise themselves to Christ, the Conqueror of death, they are commanded to be cheerful."
2. "For as it is chiefly by the faith of the resurrection that we are now quickened, so at that time it was proper that the disciples should have that life restored to them from which they had fallen."
3. "And, therefore, we ought not to listen with indifference to the narrative of the resurrection, when Christ, with his own mouth, kindly invites us to receive the fruit of it on the ground of our being related to him as brethren."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Go, tell my brethren. A touching term coming from the Risen One, and applied to those who had forsaken Him. It indicates His continued affection and their fellowship with Him in His glory."
2. "Frequent appearances, repeated commands were called for; the first to convince them, the second to direct them. Our own experience shows the same need. Hence we are prepared to expect that there were other appearances than those recorded here."
3. "All attempts to deny the historical character of the resurrection and the subsequent manifestations of Christ have failed. To suppose that the Apostles lied, as did the Sanhedrin (chap. Matthew 28:13), is a moral impossibility; that the resurrection was a mere reviving from apparent death is a physical impossibility; that the appearances were mere visions, ecstasies, having no reality outside the minds of the persons, is psychologically impossible."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus calms their excitement by the repetition of the charge from the angel for the disciples to meet him in Galilee."
2. "There is no special mention of Peter ('and Peter') as in Mark 16:7, but we may be sure that the special message to Peter was delivered."

### John Gill:
1. "In other respects the saints are subject to fears; as lest they should have no share in the love of God, nor interest in Christ, or the work of God is not begun in their hearts; and by reason of sin, lest that should get the ascendant over them, and they perish by it, and so fall short of eternal glory."
2. "A very considerable relation this is, that the disciples stood in to Christ, who is the eternal Son of God, and heir of all things; and wonderful grace and condescension it was in Christ to own the relation, when they had so lately forsaken him; and now he was raised from the dead, and had glory given him."
3. "Moreover, it may be remarked, that wherever Christ has appointed to meet his people, they may expect, and be sure to see him at one time or another."

### John Wesley:
1. Go tell my brethren — I still own them as such, though they so lately disowned and forsook me.
