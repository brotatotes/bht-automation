# Matthew 28:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The soldiers who were appointed to guard the tomb were the ones to share the news of Jesus' resurrection with the chief priests and elders. They recounted that they had examined the sepulchre and found it empty, with no indication that the body had been taken by anyone. Their motive in reporting these facts was two-fold: to exonerate themselves from any accusations and to prompt the religious leaders to consider how to respond to this significant turn of events. This unexpected development raises the question of whether the chief priests truly believed in the reality of the resurrection.
