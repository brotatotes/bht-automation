# Matthew 28:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a secret meeting of the Sanhedrin, the religious leaders conspired to bribe the soldiers who were guarding the tomb of Jesus, offering them a sufficient amount of money in exchange for a false account of what had happened. This plot revealed both the contempt they had for Jesus and their awareness of the power of bribery. Despite the evidence of Jesus' resurrection, they stubbornly clung to their disbelief, showing no willingness to be convinced.
