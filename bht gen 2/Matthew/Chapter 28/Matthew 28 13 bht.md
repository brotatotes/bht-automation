# Matthew 28:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The claim that the disciples stole him away while we slept seems highly improbable. If the soldiers were truly asleep, they would be unaware of any theft taking place. Additionally, it would be foolish for a large group of men to attempt such a scheme. Furthermore, even if they were able to steal the body without detection, it does not make sense for them to then spread a lie about Jesus rising from the dead. The whole story lacks credibility and raises doubts about the soldiers' testimony.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept—which, as we have observed, was a capital offense for soldiers on guard."


### Philip Schaff:
1. "If all the soldiers were asleep, they could not discover the thieves, nor would they have proclaimed their negligence, the punishment for which was death."
2. "If even a few of them were awake, they might and would have prevented the theft."
3. "But men in the infatuation of unbelief, will believe any story however improbable."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Stole him away while we slept." - An Irish bull on the face of it. If they were asleep they would not know anything about it.

### John Gill:
1. "The disciples of Christ came in the dead of the night and stole him away while we slept: which was a very unlikely thing, and a foolish scheme this, for such a body of men to form."
2. "Moreover, had they took it away by stealth, it is not reasonable to think that they would afterwards have reported such a lie everywhere, that he was risen from the dead."
3. "It can hardly be thought that they should be all of them asleep at once; and if they were, it is much they were not awaked by the coming up of the disciples, and the rolling away of the stone, and the bustle there must be in taking up the body, and carrying it away."

### John Wesley:
1. "Is it possible, that any man of sense should digest this poor, shallow inconsistency?"
2. "If ye were awake, why did you let the disciples steal him?"
3. "If asleep, how do you know they did?"
