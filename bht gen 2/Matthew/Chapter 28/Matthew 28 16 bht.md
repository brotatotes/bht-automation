# Matthew 28:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Matthew mentions that the disciples were appointed to a specific mountain where Jesus had instructed them to go. This particular gathering of the disciples is believed to be the one mentioned in 1 Corinthians 15:6, where Jesus appeared to over five hundred brethren at once. The exact location of this mountain is uncertain, as it could possibly be Mount Tabor or another mountain near Capernaum or the Sea of Galilee. The choice of a mountain for this meeting held significance for its solitude and visibility to such a large number of people.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The interview here recorded was the same as that referred to in one place only—1 Corinthians 15:6—when 'He was seen of above five hundred brethren at once of whom the greater part remained unto that day, though some were fallen asleep.'" 
2. "Nothing can account for such a number as five hundred assembling at one spot but the expectation of some promised manifestation of their risen Lord: and the promise before His resurrection, twice repeated after it, best explains this immense gathering."
3. "That the interview here recorded was the same as that referred to in one place only—1 Corinthians 15:6—when 'He was seen of above five hundred brethren at once of whom the greater part remained unto that day, though some were fallen asleep,' is now the opinion of the ablest students of the evangelical history."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Judas was dead, leaving but eleven of the original number of the apostles."
2. "On what particular mountain this was is not known. It is probable that Jesus, when he made the appointment, specified the place, which has been omitted by the evangelists."
3. "Matthew has omitted many appearances which Jesus made to his disciples which have been recorded by Luke, John, and Paul."

### John Calvin:
1. "Matthew, passing by those occurrences which we have taken out of the other three Evangelists, mentions only in what place the eleven disciples were appointed to the apostolic office."
2. "Matthew has therefore selected what was of the greatest importance to us, namely, that when Christ appeared to the disciples, he likewise commissioned them to be apostles, to convey into every part of the world the message of eternal life."
3. "Though the mountain is not mentioned any where else, yet we con-elude that this spot in Galilee was known to Mary."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We infer that all the disciples who could be brought together were assembled on this occasion, identifying it with the appearance mentioned in 1 Corinthians 15:6 (‘five hundred brethren at once’)."
2. "An apocryphal tradition of a late date (13th century) says that the mountain was the northern peak of the Mount of Olives, which it is asserted, was called Galilea. But this is a useless attempt at harmonizing the accounts."
3. "There was a good reason for the withdrawal into the district of Galilee, remote from Jerusalem."

### John Gill:
1. "Not directly, as soon as the women had delivered their message; for Christ appeared to them the same day at Jerusalem; and so he did at the same place that week." 
2. "This is generally thought to be Mount Tabor; but of this there is no proof, nor certainty: it might be the mountain near Capernaum, on which he taught, Matthew 5:1, or that, if not the same with the other, near the sea of Galilee, where Christ fed four thousand with seven loaves, and a few fishes, Matthew 15:29." 
3. "A mountain was appointed for this meeting, both for solitariness and for sight; for here it was he was seen by above five hundred brethren at once, 1 Corinthians 15:6."

### John Wesley:
