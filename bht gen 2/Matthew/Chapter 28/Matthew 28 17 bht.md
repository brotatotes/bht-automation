# Matthew 28:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When they saw him, some of the disciples expressed doubt, unsure if the figure before them was truly the Risen Lord or perhaps a spirit. However, upon realizing that it was indeed Jesus, they worshiped him with divine adoration, acknowledging him as the eternal Son of God. This moment highlights the disciples' human nature - even after witnessing the resurrection of Christ, they still grappled with uncertainty. Yet, their doubt only serves to strengthen our own belief, reaffirming the reality of Jesus' resurrection.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But some doubted—certainly none of 'the Eleven,' after what took place at previous interviews in Jerusalem."
2. "If the five hundred were now present, we may well believe this of some of them."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The disciples had not expected his resurrection; they were therefore slow to believe."
2. "The mention of their doubting shows that they were honest men that they were not easily imposed on that they had not previously agreed to affirm that he had risen - that they were convinced only by the strength of the evidence."
3. "Their caution in examining the evidence; their slowness to believe; their firm conviction after all their doubts; and their willingness to show their conviction even by their 'death,' is most conclusive proof that they were 'not' deceived in regard to the fact of his resurrection."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Worshipped [προσεκυνησαν] . As in ver. 9. Prostrated themselves. The first time that the disciples are described as doing so.

### John Calvin:
1. "It is wonderful that, after they had twice seen Christ, still some doubted."
2. "The meaning, therefore, appears to me to be, that some at first hesitated, until Christ made a nearer and more familiar approach to them; but that when they certainly and absolutely recognized him, then they worshipped."
3. "...he had laid aside the form of a servant, and had nothing in his appearance but what was heavenly."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They worshipped him... The word might mean something less than religious worship, but it does mean that in many cases; the matter could scarcely be mentioned, if it meant less here."
2. "But some doubted... The doubt was probably whether it was proper to worship Him, especially as the following words of our Lord apply so directly to such a doubt."
3. "So now 'some,' attached to our Lord, have a speculative doubt as to the propriety of according Him Divine honors. When it becomes a positive denial of the power He claims in the next verse, genuine faith in Him is scarcely possible."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The reference is not to the eleven who were all now convinced after some doubt, but to the others present."
2. "Their very doubt makes it easier for us to believe."
3. "He is now their Risen Lord and Saviour."

### John Gill:
1. "And when, they saw him, they worshipped him,... With divine adoration, as the eternal Son of God." 
2. "They doubted whether what they then saw on the mountain was he, or whether it was not a spirit, or a mere phantom."
3. "Some of them, though they believed Christ was risen from the dead, of which they had had the strongest assurance; yet they doubted whether what they then saw on the mountain was he."
