# Matthew 28:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus declares, All power is given unto me, emphasizing that this power is not inherent to his divine nature, but granted to him as a mediator by the Father. This authority enables Jesus to fulfill his role in the redemption of humanity and the establishment of his kingdom. Through this divine authority, Jesus can appoint offices, bestow gifts, and institute ordinances for his church until his second coming. It is a demonstration of his triumph and the confidence he instills in his followers to carry out the mission of spreading the gospel to the world.

2. "The 'Son of God,' as 'Creator,' had an original right to all things, to control them and dispose of them.

2. "The verb lalein is used of speaking, in contrast with or as a breaking of silence, voluntary or imposed."

1. "For no ordinary authority would here have been enough, but sovereign and truly divine government ought to be possessed by him who commands them to promise eternal life in his name, to reduce the whole world under his sway, and to publish a doctrine which subdues all pride, and lays prostrate the whole of the human race."
2. "And by this preface Christ not only encouraged the Apostles to full confidence in the discharge of their office, but confirmed the faith of his gospel in all ages."
3.

3. "It is the sublimist of all spectacles to see the Risen Christ without money or army or state charging this band of five hundred men and women with world conquest and bringing them to believe it possible and to undertake it with serious passion and power."

### John Gill:
1. "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth; which is to be understood of him, not as God, who has the same original and underived power and authority over all creatures, and things in heaven and earth, as the Father has; but as mediator, to whom all things are delivered by the Father."
