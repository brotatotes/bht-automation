# Matthew 28:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them into the name of the Holy Trinity. This commission from Christ is not merely an empty title, but a laborious office. It is through baptism and subsequent instruction that individuals are brought into the fold of the Church. The name of the Holy Trinity signifies a spiritual union with God, acknowledging and appropriating all that God is and does for humanity. Baptism is not to be taken lightly or claimed by hypocrites, but to be administered to those who earnestly seek to be disciples and learn from the teachings of Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is the glorification of the Son by the Father through the Spirit, which is the foundation of the Church of Christ in all the world." 
2. "And therefore it is not ‘subdue,’ but make disciples of." 
3. "Baptism is the contract of espousal ( Eph 5:26 ) between Christ and his Church."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Go ye therefore, and teach all nations... 'make disciples of all nations'... 'teaching,' in the more usual sense of that word, comes in afterwards."
2. "Baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost—It should be, 'into the name'... 'And were all baptized unto (or rather 'into') Moses'; and Galatians 3:27, 'For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Because all power is mine, go! I can defend you. The world is placed under my control. It is redeemed. Though you are weak, yet I am strong! Though you will encounter many troubles and dangers, yet I can defend you!"
2. "This gracious commission was the foundation of their authority to go to the Gentiles. Jesus broke down the partition wall, and commissioned his disciples to go everywhere, and bring the 'world' to the knowledge of himself."
3. "The union of these three names in the form of baptism proves that the Son and Holy Spirit are equal with the Father. The form of baptism has been always regarded as an unbreakable argument for the doctrine of the Trinity, or that the Son and Holy Spirit are equal with the Father." (136 words)

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Baptizing into the name of the Holy Trinity implies a spiritual and mystical union with him."
2. "The name, as in the Lord's Prayer ('Hallowed be thy name'), is the expression of the sum total of the divine Being: not his designation as God or Lord, but the formula in which all his attributes and characteristics are summed up."
3. "When one is baptized into the name of the Trinity, he professes to acknowledge and appropriate God in all that he is and in all that he does for man."

### John Calvin:
1. "Let us learn from this passage, that the apostleship is not an empty title, but a laborious office...nothing is more absurd or intolerable than that this honor should be claimed by hypocrites, who live like kings at their ease, and disdainfully throw away from themselves the office of teaching."
2. "Here Christ, by removing the distinction, makes the Gentiles equal to the Jews, and admits both, indiscriminately to a participation in the covenant."
3. "I maintain, therefore, that it is not rash to administer baptism to infants, to which God invites them, when he promises that he will be their God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The ‘discipling’ consists of two parts: baptism, the rite of admission, and the subsequent instruction. This is the ordinary process in the Christian Church."
2. "But even in the case of adult converts, a full instruction in the Christian religion does not, as a rule, precede, but succeed baptism, which is an initiatory rite, the sacramental sign and seal of regeneration."
3. "It is into one name, of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. It is impossible that this means, the one name of God, of a mere man, and of an attribute of God. It is the one name of One God, existing (as well as manifested), as Father, Son, and Holy Ghost."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Here is the world program of the Risen Christ and it should not be forgotten by those who seek to foreshorten it all by saying that Jesus expected his second coming to be very soon, even within the lifetime of those who heard."
2. "Meanwhile we are to be ready for his coming at any time and to look for it joyfully. But we are to leave that to the Father and push on the campaign for world conquest."
3. "The name of Jesus is the essential part of it as is shown in the Acts. Trine immersion is not taught as the Greek Church holds and practices, baptism in the name of the Father, then of the Son, then of the Holy Spirit."

### John Gill:
1. "Go ye therefore,.... Into all the world; some into one place, and some into another; since his power and authority, and so now the commission he gave them, reached every where."
2. "Not that they were able to do this of themselves, but they were to teach men externally, or outwardly minister the word, whilst the Spirit of God internally applied it, and taught, and made men true disciples of Christ."
3. "Hence a confirmation of the doctrine of the Trinity, there are three persons, but one name, but one God, into which believers are baptized; and a proof of the true deity both of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; and that Christ, as the Son of God, is God; since baptism is administered equally in the name of all three, as a religious ordinance, a part of divine instituted worship." (116 words)

### John Wesley:
1. "Disciple all nations — Make them my disciples. This includes the whole design of Christ's commission."
2. "Baptizing and teaching are the two great branches of that general design."
3. "And these were to be determined by the circumstances of things; which made it necessary in baptizing adult Jews or heathens, to teach them before they were baptized; in discipling their children, to baptize them before they were taught."
