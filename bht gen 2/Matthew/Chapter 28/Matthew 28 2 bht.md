# Matthew 28:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The stone was rolled away by an angel of the Lord, who then sat upon it, indicating divine authority and power. While there are some variations in the accounts, it is clear that at least one angel appeared and entered the tomb, where another angel was seen sitting. These angelic appearances served to remove any doubt or fear from the hearts of the women, as they witnessed the evidence of the empty tomb and the power of God at work.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "That the women were witnesses of the earthquake and that which happened."
2. "The rolling away was not done naturally, but by a shock, which = σεισμός."
3. "It was not for Him, to whom the stone was no hindrance, but for the women and His disciples, that it was rolled away."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There was a great earthquake - Rather there 'had been.' It does not mean that this was while they were there, or while they were going, but that there 'had been' so violent a commotion as to remove the stone."
2. "The word rendered here as 'earthquake' does not of necessity mean that the convulsion extended to the earth, but only that there had been such a concussion as to remove the stone."
3. "And sat upon it - Sat upon it when the keepers saw him, Matthew 28:4. It is not said that he was sitting when he appeared to the women. From Luke it would rather appear that he was standing."

### John Calvin:
1. "For since it was not a matter of little consequence to know that the Son of God had obtained a victory over death, (on which the principal point of our salvation is founded,) it was necessary to remove all doubts, that the divine majesty might be openly and manifestly presented to the eyes of the women."
2. "The raiment and the countenance of the angel, too, might be said to be rays by which the splendor of Godhead was diffused, so as to enable them to perceive that it was not a mortal man that stood near them, having the face of a man."
3. "Yet it cannot be doubted that, together with outward signs, there was an inward power, which engraved on the hearts of the women an impression of Deity."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The earthquake is connected with the sudden rolling away of the great stone by the angel."
2. "The tomb was opened for the sake of the women and the disciples, not to allow the Lord to pass out."
3. "Mary Magdalene probably started back about this time, and left the other Mary and Salome to see and hear the angel."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The earth, which trembled with sorrow at the Death of Christ as it were leaped for joy at His Resurrection."
2. "There are apparent inconsistencies in the various narratives of the Resurrection and the appearances of the Risen Christ. We do not know enough of the details to be able to reconcile them. But the very variations strengthen the independent witness to the essential fact that Jesus rose from the grave."
3. "The stone was rolled away not to let the Lord out, but to let the women in to prove the fact of the empty tomb."

### John Gill:
1. "It was an emblem of the shaking of the earth by the preaching of the Gospel, the sound of which was now to go after Christ's resurrection to the ends of the world; and a prelude of the general resurrection..."
2. "This might be done, that way might be made for the risen body of Christ to pass out of the sepulcher; for to suppose, as some do, that he penetrated through this stone with his risen body, is not to be credited."
3. "It is added, and sat upon it; thereby showing who it was that rolled it away; that it was done by him, not by the earthquake, nor by any human power."

### John Wesley:
1. "An angel of the Lord had rolled away the stone and sat upon it."
2. "St. Luke and St. John speak of two angels that appeared."
3. "It seems as if only one of them had appeared sitting on the stone without the sepulchre, and then going into it, was seen with another angel, sitting, one where the head, the other where the feet of the body had lain."
