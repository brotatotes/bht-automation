# Matthew 28:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ's commission goes beyond mere belief; it encompasses the task of discipleship and obedience. This task involves proclaiming His teachings to all nations, embracing both the positive institutions and moral responsibilities that He has commanded. The promise of Christ's abiding presence is not limited to the apostles alone, but extends to all who would follow Him in the future. This presence is not physical, but spiritual, granting guidance and protection until His glorious return. May we faithfully teach and observe all that He has commanded, relying on His enduring presence and ever-abounding grace.
