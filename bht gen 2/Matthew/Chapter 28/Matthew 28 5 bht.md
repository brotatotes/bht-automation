# Matthew 28:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Fear not, for even though the soldiers may tremble in the presence of the angel, you should not. The angel knew about these faithful women, not through any special revelation, but through his observations of them. They sought Jesus the crucified, the one who completed his redemptive work on the cross, and they had nothing to fear because they sought him in the Scriptures, the Gospel, the ordinances, and in his exalted position at the right hand of the Father.
