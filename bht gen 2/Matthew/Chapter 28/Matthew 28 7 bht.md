# Matthew 28:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee, the angel instructed the women. This message held significance not only because it was entrusted to women, but also because it would bring comfort and encouragement to the mourning and despairing disciples. Jesus, in His wisdom, appointed a meeting in Galilee to reaffirm His resurrection and restore their faith. The angel's command carried weight and validity, serving as a solemn confirmation of the glorious news to be shared with the apostles.
