# Matthew 3:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
John, whose name means gracious or the grace of the Lord, was not only a good man who received much grace from the Lord, but also a preacher whose mission was to proclaim the grace of God in Christ. He became known as John the Baptist because he was the first to administer baptism, and this became his well-known title and character. He fulfilled his role as a preacher, declaring the doctrines of repentance and baptism, and urging the people to believe in the coming Messiah who would be revealed after him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The baptism of John was of a deeper significance than that usual among the Jews in the case of proselytes, and formed an integral part of his divinely appointed office."
2. "His whole mission, as Olsh. well observes, was calculated, in accordance with the office of the law which gives the knowledge of sin, to bring men’s minds into that state in which the Redeemer invites them as weary and heavy laden, to come to him."
3. "This tract was not strictly a desert, but thinly peopled, and abounding in pastures for flocks."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In those days—of Christ's secluded life at Nazareth, where the last chapter left Him."
2. "came John the Baptist, preaching—about six months before his Master."
3. "in the wilderness of Judea—the desert valley of the Jordan, thinly peopled and bare in pasture, a little north of Jerusalem."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Perhaps Matthew intended to embrace in his narrative the whole time that Jesus lived at Nazareth."
2. "The discourses recorded in the New Testament are mostly brief, sometimes consisting only of a single sentence."
3. "The word translated 'wilderness' does not denote, as with us, a place of boundless forests, entirely destitute of inhabitants; but a mountainous, rough, and thinly settled country."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In those days," i.e., some time during the nearly thirty years since that settlement.
2. "In those days appears John the Baptist."
3. "Not suggesting absolute barrenness but unappropriated territory affording free range for shepherds and their flocks."

### John Calvin:
1. "The ancient writers of the Church are almost unanimously agreed, that he [John] was born fifteen years before the death of Augustus."
2. "Hence it follows, that he did not long discharge the office of teacher, but, in a short time, gave way to Christ."
3. "Now as John, the morning-star, or dawn, was immediately followed by Christ, 'the Sun of Righteousness,' there is no reason to wonder, that John disappeared, in order that Christ might shine alone in greater brightness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This silence of Scripture suggests lessons of obedience and reverence to parents, of patience and perseverance in the long processes of education for our life-work."
2. "Preaching should still be thus distinguished from lecturing, catechising, etc. John was emphatically a herald (comp. Matthew 3:2-3), and in the truest sense a prophet."
3. "This appearance in the wilderness was not only a fulfilment of prophecy, but characteristic of the mission of John: whom men should go out to see (Matthew 11:7-9), and symbolical of the isolation of the Jews under the old covenant."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Matthew does not indicate the date when John appeared as Luke does in ch. 3 (the fifteenth year of Tiberius's reign)."
2. "His name John means 'Gift of Jehovah' and is a shortened form of Johanan."
3. "He was the Baptizer, but he was also the Preacher, heralding his message out in the barren hills at first where few people were, but soon his startling message drew crowds from far and near."

### John Gill:
1. "He describes him by his name John, in Hebrew יוחנן, 'Jochanan', which signifies 'gracious', or 'the grace of the Lord', or 'the Lord has given grace'; which agrees with him, both as a good man, on whom the Lord had bestowed much grace, and as a preacher, whose business it was to publish the grace of God in Christ." 
2. "From his being the first administrator of the ordinance of baptism, he is called John the Baptist; and this was a well-known title and character of him."
3. "He is described by his work and office as a preacher, he 'came' or 'was preaching' the doctrines of repentance and baptism; he published and declared that the kingdom of the Messiah was at hand, that he would quickly be revealed; and exhorted the people to believe on him, which should come after him."
