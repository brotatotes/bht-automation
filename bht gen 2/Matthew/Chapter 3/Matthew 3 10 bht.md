# Matthew 3:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The axe of God's judgment and vengeance is now laid at the root of every tree, every individual person, regardless of their lineage or outward appearance. Those who do not bring forth good fruit, who do not perform good works from a genuine and repentant heart, are under the imminent threat of the coming wrath. There is no room for idle pretenses or delaying repentance as the execution of God's judgment is determined to be swift.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
