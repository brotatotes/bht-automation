# Matthew 3:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire, signifying the filling of believers with the Holy Spirit and igniting their hearts with the fire of love that cannot be extinguished. This baptism is not merely external, but a spiritual reality that brings about a profound transformation. We witness the fulfillment of this promise on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit descended upon the disciples, appearing as tongues of fire.

2. "The expressions therefore in all the Gospels amount to the same."
3. "The double symbolic reference of fire, elsewhere found, e.g. Mark 9:50, as purifying the good and consuming the evil, though illustrated by these verses, is hardly to be pressed into the interpretation of πυρί in this verse, the prophecy here being solely of that higher and more perfect baptism to which that of John was a mere introduction."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But there cometh the Mightier than I" 
2. "His it is, as His sole prerogative, to dispense the inward reality."
