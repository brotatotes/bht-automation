# Matthew 3:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The fan mentioned represents the preaching of the Gospel, which separates the solid truth from the spiritually worthless. The floor symbolizes the visible Church, while the wheat represents the righteous or the people of God. On the other hand, the chaff represents the empty, worthless professors of religion. The unquenchable fire signifies the eternal suffering of the wicked in hell. In this metaphor, the Messiah separates the evil from the good, receiving the worthy into his kingdom and consigning the unworthy to destruction.
