# Matthew 3:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, the sinless Son of God, willingly came from Galilee to be baptized by John. His baptism was not for repentance, as He had no sin, but to fulfill the law and set an example for His followers. This act marked the transition from His private life to His public ministry, as He was anointed and inaugurated for His role as the Messiah. It also symbolized His identification with humanity and His willingness to be separate from sinners. In being baptized, Jesus affirmed the importance of baptism as a sign of obedience and a means of union with Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Why should our Lord, who was without sin, have come to a baptism of repentance? Because He was made sin for us: for which reason also He suffered the curse of the law."
2. "It became Him, being in the likeness of sinful flesh, to go through those appointed rites and purifications which belonged to that flesh."
3. "His baptism, as it was our Lord's closing act of obedience under the Law, in His hitherto concealed life of legal submission, His πληρῶσαι πᾶσ. δικ., so was His solemn inauguration and anointing for the higher official life of mediatorial satisfaction which was now opening upon Him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Not so this greater than Moses. All but thirty years had He now spent in privacy at Nazareth, gradually ripening for His public work, and calmly awaiting the time appointed of the Father."
2. "This movement from Galilee to Jordan is the step, doubtless, of deepest interest to all heaven since that first one which brought Him into the world."
3. "Thus, as He rode into Jerusalem upon an ass 'whereon yet never man sat' and lay in a sepulchre 'wherein was never man yet laid', so in His baptism, too. He would be 'separate from sinners'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The expression 'cometh' implies that the act was voluntary on his part; that he went for that purpose and for no other."
2. "Baptism was not in his case a symbol of personal reformation and repentance, for he was sinless; but it was a solemn rite by which he was set apart to his great office."
3. "Even in his case the great idea always implied in the ordinance of baptism had a place; for it was a symbol of holiness or purity in that great system of religion which he was about to set up in the world."

### John Calvin:
1. "He received the same baptism with us, in order to assure believers, that they are ingrafted into his body, and that they are 'buried with him in baptism,' that they may rise to 'newness of life.'" 
2. "The general reason why Christ received baptism was, that he might render full obedience to the Father; and the special reason was, that he might consecrate baptism in his own body, that we might have it in common with him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Jesus who was sinless, came to a baptism ‘unto repentance.’ This condescension formed a part of the obedience to the Divine law (see Matthew 3:15), rendered by Him as a member of the Jewish nation."
2. "The Jews were baptized in token of uncleanness, so He, ‘numbered with the transgressors,’ must needs go through the rites and purifications prescribed for them."
3. "This act closes the concealed life of quiet subjection and legal submission, opening the public life of mediatorial satisfaction."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He comes all the way from Galilee to Jordan 'to be baptized by him'."

### John Gill:
1. "When John had given notice of the Messiah's coming, and so had prepared his way... then cometh Jesus from Galilee; from Nazareth of Galilee... his cheerful and voluntary subjection to the ordinance of baptism" 
2. "It was to show his approbation of John's baptism, and to bear a testimony of it, that it was from heaven; and also that he himself might receive a testimony both from heaven, and from John, that he was the Son of God and true Messiah" 
3. "to set an example to his followers, and thereby engage their attention and subjection to this ordinance"

### John Wesley:
1. Mark 1:9; Luke 3:21
