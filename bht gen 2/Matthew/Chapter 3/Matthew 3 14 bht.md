# Matthew 3:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
John initially tried to prevent Jesus from being baptized, questioning the need for someone sinless like Jesus to undergo a baptism meant for sinners. However, his objection stemmed from a misconception. He did not realize that Jesus requested baptism not for His own purification but to fulfill righteousness and to establish the significance of baptism for future believers. John's reluctance reveals his deep reverence and recognition of Jesus' superior status as the Messiah. Ultimately, his understanding was clarified, and he humbly recognized his need for Christ's grace and the great privilege of baptizing the Son of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The imperfect tense conveys, not that he endeavored merely to hinder Him, but began to hinder Him, was hindering Him."
2. "From the nature of his relationship to our Lord, he could not but know those events which had accompanied his birth, and his subsequent life of holy and unblameable purity and sanctity."
3. "My impression from the words of this verse certainly is, that he regarded Him as the Messiah."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "What! Shall the Master come for baptism to the servant—the sinless Saviour to a sinner?"
2. "That thus much is in the Baptist's words will be clearly seen if it be observed that he evidently regarded Jesus as Himself needing no purification but rather qualified to impart it to those who did."
3. "But it were a pity if, in the glory of this testimony to Christ, we should miss the beautiful spirit in which it was borne—"Lord, must I baptize Thee? Can I bring myself to do such a thing?"—reminding us of Peter's exclamation at the supper table, 'Lord, dost Thou wash my feet?'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "John forbade him - Refused him."
2. "I have need - It is more suitable that I should be baptized with thy baptism, the Holy Spirit, than that thou shouldest be baptized in water by me."
3. "I am a sinner, and unworthy to administer this to the Messiah."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "As in so many instances, it overlooks the force of the imperfect tense, which expresses past action, either in progress or in process of conception, in the agent's mind."
2. "John did not forbid Jesus, but had it in mind to prevent him: was for hindering him."
3. "Again, the preposition [δια] intensifies the verb, and represents strong feeling on John's part. He was moved to strenuous protest against Jesus' baptism by him."

### John Calvin:
1. "There was, no doubt, plausibility in this ground of refusal, that Christ had no need of his baptism: but John was mistaken in not considering, that it was for the sake of others that baptism was asked."
2. "And so Christ bids him consider, what was suitable to the character of a servant, (Philippians 2:7,) which he had undertaken; for a voluntary subjection takes nothing from his glory."
3. "This example shows, that we do not act rashly, in undertaking the commission which the Lord has given us, according to the light we enjoy, though we do not immediately comprehend all that belongs to our calling, or that depends upon it."
