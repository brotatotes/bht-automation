# Matthew 3:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is necessary for us to fulfill all righteousness, as it is the proper time for it. Although some may find it peculiar, this relation between John and Jesus is only temporary. John, as the minister of the law, baptizes Jesus to fulfill the ministry he has received. It is fitting for John to administer the ordinance to Christ as his forerunner, and it is equally fitting for us to submit to this ordinance, as it is a part of the righteousness Christ came to fulfill.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Though what has been said is true, yet the time is not come for that: as yet, ἄρτι, now, are we in another relation (viz. our Lord as the fulfiller of the law, John as a minister of it), therefore suffer it." 
2. "This ἄρτι is spoken from the Lord’s foreknowledge, that this relation of subjection to John was only temporary, and that hereafter their relative situations would be inverted."
3. "ἡμῖν: not for μοί, but for μοὶ καὶ σοί. I cannot help thinking that this word glances at the relationship and previous acknowledged destinations of the speakers. It has however a wider sense, as spoken by Him who is now first coming forth officially as the Son of Man, extending over all those whose baptism plants them in his likeness."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Thou recoilest, and no wonder, for the seeming incongruity is startling; but in the present case do as thou art bidden."
2. "The import of circumcision and of baptism seems to be radically the same. And if our remarks on the circumcision of our Lord (see on John 3:11- :) are well founded, He would seem to have said, 'Thus do I impledge Myself to the whole righteousness of the Law—thus symbolically do enter on and engage to fulfil it all.' Let the thoughtful reader weigh this."
3. "With true humility, yielding to higher authority than his own impressions of propriety."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Thus it becometh us - It is suitable and proper... And though you may feel yourself unworthy, yet it is proper it should be done."
2. "All righteousness - There was no particular precept in the Old Testament requiring this, but he chose to give the sanction of his example to the baptism of John, as to a divine ordinance."
3. "Jesus had no sin. But he was about to enter on his great work. It was proper that he should be set apart by his forerunner, and show his connection with him, and give his approbation to what John had done."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The propriety of John’s scruples is recognized; but he was 'now' or 'as yet' the minister of the law, which Jesus must fulfil. The relation between them would soon be changed."
2. "Both John in his office and Jesus in His [office]."
3. "Jesus was really the active person, since the rite was administered at His command and by His authority."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "To fulfil all righteousness (πληρωσα πασαν δικαιοσυνην)." 
2. "The explanation of Jesus satisfies John and he baptizes the Messiah though he has no sins to confess."
3. "It was proper (πρεπον) to do so else the Messiah would seem to hold aloof from the Forerunner. Thus the ministries of the two are linked together."

### John Gill:
1. "Let it be done now, immediately, directly, at this present time; do not put me off with any excuse; it is a proper season for it, even 'now', since the time is not yet come that I am to baptize with the Holy Ghost."
2. "It became John to administer the ordinance of baptism to Christ, as he was his forerunner, and the only administrator of it, and that he might fulfil the ministry which he had received."
3. "And since it became Christ, it cannot be unbecoming us to submit to this ordinance; and since he looked upon it as a part of righteousness to be fulfilled by him, it ought to be attended to by all those who would be accounted followers of him."

### John Wesley:
1. "It becometh us to fulfil all righteousness"
2. "It becometh every messenger of God to observe all his righteous ordinances."
3. "It becometh us to do... in order to fulfill... every part of the righteous law of God."
