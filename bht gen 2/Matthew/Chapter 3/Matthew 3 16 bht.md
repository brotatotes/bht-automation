# Matthew 3:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Out of the water, he went up directly from the water, symbolizing his descent into the river for baptism. The heavens were opened, appearing like clouds parting to reveal something beyond the planets and stars. The Spirit of God descended upon Jesus, either taking the form of a dove or coming upon him as a dove would descend. This dove symbolizes perfect gentleness, purity, and the power to communicate life. The Holy Spirit's descent with the visible appearance of a dove signifies Jesus as the ideal representative of his people, the ultimate Israelite.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Holy Spirit descended not only in the manner of a dove, but σωματικῷ εἴδει (Luke): which I cannot understand in any but the literal sense, as THE BODILY SHAPE OF A DOVE, seen by the Baptist." 
2. "The whole narrative is in remarkable parallelism with that of the Transfiguration. There we have our Lord supernaturally glorified in the presence of two great prophetic personages, Moses and Elias, who speak of His decease, on the journey to which He forthwith sets out."

2. "The blessed Spirit, assuming the corporeal form of a dove, descended thus upon His sacred head. But why in this form? The Scripture use of this emblem will be our best guide here. 'My dove, my undefiled is one,' says the Song of Solomon. This is chaste purity."
3. "But the fourth Gospel gives us one more piece of information here, on the authority of one who saw and testified of it: 'John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and IT ABODE UPON HIM'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Out of the water - This shows that he had descended to the river. It literally means, 'he went up directly from the water.'"
2. "The expression, 'the heavens were opened,' is one that commonly denotes the appearance of the clouds when it lightens. The heavens appear to open or give way. Something of this kind probably appeared to John at this time."
3. "The dove, among the Jews, was the symbol of purity of heart, harmlessness, and gentleness. The form chosen here was doubtless an emblem of the innocence, meekness, and tenderness of the Saviour. The gift of the Holy Spirit, in this manner, was the public approbation of Jesus."

### Marvin Vincent:

3. "If, therefore, rabbinic illustration of the descent of the Holy Spirit with the visible appearance of a dove must be sought for, it would lie in the acknowledgement of Jesus as the ideal typical Israelite, the representative of his people."

### John Calvin:
1. "The opening of the heavens...means also a cleft, or opening, of the visible heaven, so that John could see something beyond the planets and stars."
2. "As the Evangelists say that John saw the Holy Spirit, it is probable that the opening of the heavens was chiefly on his account."
3. "Christ...received from it additional certainty as to his heavenly calling...he needed to be armed with a remarkable power of the Spirit."

3. "The dove in Christian art has been considered the symbol of the Holy Spirit."

### John Gill:
1. "However, we learn this from it, that since it is said, that he came up out of the water, he must first have gone down into it; must have been in it, and was baptized in it; a circumstance strongly in favour of baptism by immersion."
2. "A difficulty arises here, whether the words, 'to him', are to be referred to Christ, or to John; no doubt but the opening of the heavens was seen by them both: but to me it seems that John is particularly designed, since this vision was upon his account, and for his sake."
3. "The Spirit of God, here said to descend and light on Christ, is the same, which in the first creation moved upon the face of the waters; and now comes down on Christ, just as he was coming up out of the waters of Jordan, where he had been baptized."

2. "Jesus had no sin to wash away. And yet he was baptized. And God owned his ordinance, so as to make it the season of pouring forth the Holy Spirit upon him."
3. "Lo, the heavens were opened, and he saw the Spirit of God - St. Luke adds, in a bodily form - Probably in a glorious appearance of fire, perhaps in the shape of a dove, descending with a hovering motion, till it rested upon him."
