# Matthew 3:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
John preached the need for repentance, a change of mind and principles, leading to a virtuous alteration in life and practice. The kingdom of heaven that he proclaimed was not merely a future state in heaven, but a state to be enjoyed on earth, requiring the proper disposition for heavenly glory. This kingdom, which was about to be established by God, demanded repentance as a sign of readiness and showed that it was a spiritual kingdom, not attainable by the wicked.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Used by the Baptist in the O.T. sense of turning to God as His people, from the spiritual idolatry and typical adultery in which the faithless among the Jews were involved." 
2. "The more usual one is ἡ βασ . τοῦ θεοῦ: but ἡ β . τῶν οὐρ . is common in the Rabbinical writers, who do not however, except in one or two places, mean by it the reign of the Messiah, but the Jewish religion the theocracy."
3. "Wherever the term βασ. τ. οὐρ. (or its equivalent) is used in the N.T., it signifies, not the Church, nor the Christian religion, but strictly the kingdom of the Messiah which is to be revealed hereafter."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Repent ye... primarily to that sense of sin which leads the sinner to flee from the wrath to come, to look for relief only from above, and eagerly to fall in with the provided remedy."
2. "For the kingdom of heaven is at hand... fitted at once both to meet the national expectations and to turn them into the right channel. A kingdom for which repentance was the proper preparation behooved to be essentially spiritual."
3. "Deliverance from sin, the great blessing of Christ's kingdom, can be valued by those only to whom sin is a burden. John's great work, accordingly, was to awaken this feeling and hold out the hope of a speedy and precious remedy."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Repentance implies sorrow for past offences...a full purpose to turn from transgression and to lead a holy life."
2. "A true penitent has sorrow for sin, not only because it is ruinous to his soul, but chiefly because it is an offence against God."
3. "The reign of God draws near...the time when Christ should reign, or set up his kingdom, or begin his dominion on earth, under the Christian economy, was about to commence."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Repentance, then, has been rightly defined as 'Such a virtuous alteration of the mind and purpose as begets a like virtuous change in the life and practice.'" 
2. "The kingdom of heaven...is a kingdom of heaven because its origin, its end, its king, the character and destiny of its subjects, its laws, institutions, and privileges - all are heavenly."
3. "John's personality is thrown into shadow behind Christ. Such a teacher would represent himself as a mere 'voice', crying aloud in the moral wilderness around him, and anxious, beyond aught else, to shroud his own significant person beneath the majesty of his message."

### John Calvin:
1. "The kingdom of God among men is nothing else than a restoration to a happy life; or, in other words, it is true and everlasting happiness."
2. "Repentance is not placed first, as some ignorantly suppose, as if it were the ground of the forgiveness of sins, or as if it induced God to begin to be gracious to us; but men are commanded to repent, that they may receive the reconciliation which is offered to them."
3. "The sum of the Gospel is, that God, through his Son, takes away our sins, and admits us to fellowship with him, that we, 'denying ourselves' and our own nature, may 'live soberly, righteously, and godly,' and thus may exercise ourselves on earth in meditating on the heavenly life."

### Philip Schaff:

3. "It includes the Old Testament theocracy as a preparation."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "John did not call on the people to be sorry, but to change (think afterwards) their mental attitudes and conduct."
2. "The tragedy of it is that we have no one English word that reproduces exactly the meaning and atmosphere of the Greek word."
3. "John proclaims as the herald of the new day that it has come, has drawn near. How near he does not say, but he evidently means very near, so near that one could see the signs and the proof."

### John Gill:
1. "The doctrine which John preached was the doctrine of repentance...a change of mind, and principles."
2. "The kingdom of heaven is at hand: by which is meant not the kingdom of glory to be expected in another world...but the kingdom of the Messiah."
3. "Very pertinently does John make use of this argument to engage to repentance; since there cannot be a greater motive to it...than the grace of God through Christ, which is exhibited in the Gospel dispensation."

### John Wesley:
1. "The kingdom of heaven, and the kingdom of God, are but two phrases for the same thing.... They mean, not barely a future happy state, in heaven, but a state to be enjoyed on earth: the proper disposition for the glory of heaven, rather than the possession of it."
2. "Is at hand — As if he had said, God is about to erect that kingdom..."
3. "The very demand of repentance, as previous to it, showed it was a spiritual kingdom, and that no wicked man, how politic, brave, or learned soever, could possibly be a subject of it."
