# Matthew 3:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
John the Baptist was sent to fulfill the prophecy in Isaiah 40:3, preparing the way for the king Messiah. He preached a message of repentance, calling people to remove obstacles and make straight paths for the coming of the Lord. This aligns with the Eastern custom of clearing the way before a royal personage. The consolations mentioned in Isaiah 40:3 were fulfilled in the days of Christ, who appeared to the joy of his people with a strong hand.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Not the words of the Baptist, meaning ἐγὼ γάρ εἰμι, but of the Evangelist."
2. "ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ belong in the Hebrew to ἑτοιμάσατε, but in the LXX and here to βοῶντος."
3. "The primary and literal application of this prophecy to the return from captivity is very doubtful."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight—This prediction is quoted in all the four Gospels, showing that it was regarded as a great outstanding one, and the predicted forerunner as the connecting link between the old and the new economies."
2. "The call here—taking it generally—is a call to put out of the way whatever would obstruct His progress and hinder His complete triumph, whether those hindrances were public or personal, outward or inward."
3. "Levelling and smoothing are here the obvious figures whose sense is conveyed in the first words of the proclamation—"Prepare ye the way of the Lord." The idea is that every obstruction shall be so removed as to reveal to the whole world the salvation of God in Him whose name is the 'Saviour'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The language is such as was familiar to the Jews and such as they would understand."
2. "A crier, or herald, is introduced. In the vast deserts that lay between Babylon and Judea he is represented as lifting up his voice, and, with authority, commanding a public road to be made for the return of the captive Jews, with the Lord as their deliverer."
3. "As applied to John, the passage means that he was sent to remove obstructions, and to prepare the people for the coming of the Messiah, like a herald going before an army on the march, to make preparations for its coming."

### John Calvin:
1. "That pious minds may not be cast down during this melancholy silence, the prophet announces, that other preachers of grace will yet arise, to awaken in the people a hope of salvation."
2. "The word wilderness is here used metaphorically for desolation, or the frightful ruin of the nation, such as existed in the time of the captivity. It was so dismally shattered, that it might well be compared to a wilderness."
3. "We now see, that this prediction actually relates to John, and is most properly applied to him. Prepare the way of the Lord... that we may prepare the way of the Lord: that is, that we may take out of the way those sins which obstruct the kingdom of Christ, and thus may give access to his grace."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He thus preached, because he was sent to fulfill this prophecy."
2. "The sense remains the same. 'The wilderness' here (and probably in the original prophecy) refers to the spiritually desolate condition of God’s people."
