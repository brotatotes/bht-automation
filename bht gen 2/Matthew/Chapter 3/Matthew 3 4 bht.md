# Matthew 3:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
John the Baptist, in his appearance and lifestyle, resembled the prophet Elijah. Just as Elijah wore a garment made of camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist, John donned the same attire. This clothing represented his ruggedness and simplicity, aligning with his message of repentance. Even his choice of food, locusts and wild honey, reflected his humble and frugal life. By adopting this manner of dress and diet, John aimed to capture the attention and reverence of the Jewish people, as he preached the need for purification and repentance.
