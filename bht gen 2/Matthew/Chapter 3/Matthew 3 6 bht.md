# Matthew 3:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people who were baptized by John were freely and openly confessing their sins. This act of confession was a significant part of the baptism, as it symbolized their readiness to be cleansed and purified. It represented their desire to receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit from Christ, which John had spoken of. This baptism with the Holy Spirit and fire was ultimately fulfilled when the Holy Spirit descended upon the disciples with flames of fire, as it had been prefigured by John's baptism with water.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The baptism was administered in the day-time, by immersion of the whole person; and while standing in the water the proselyte was instructed in certain portions of the law. The whole families of proselytes, including infants, were baptized."
2. "Indeed the baptism or lustration of a proselyte on admission would follow as a matter of course, by analogy from the constant legal practice of lustration after all uncleannesses: and it is difficult to imagine a time when it would not be in use."
3. "From the form and expression this does not seem to have been merely ‘shewing a contrite spirit,’ ‘confessing themselves sinners,’ but a particular and individual confession; not, however, made privately to John, but before the people."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This baptism was at once a public seal of their felt need of deliverance from sin, of their expectation of the coming Deliverer, and of their readiness to welcome Him when He appeared."
2. "The baptism itself startled, and was intended to startle, them."
3. "They were familiar enough with the baptism of proselytes from heathenism; but this baptism of Jews themselves was quite new and strange to them."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was a solemn rite of washing, significant of cleansing from their former sins, and purifying them for the special service of Yahweh."
2. "John found this custom in use; and as he was calling the Jews to a new dispensation - to a change in their form of religion - he administered this rite of baptism (washing), to signify the cleansing from sin, the adopting of the new dispensation, or the fitness for the pure reign of the Messiah."
3. "In none of these cases can it be shown that the meaning of the word is to immerse entirely. But in nearly all the cases the notion of applying the water to a part only of the person or object, though it was by dipping, is necessarily to be supposed."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "They were baptized while in the act of confessing."
2. "An open confession, not a private one to John."
3. "An individual confession; possibly a specific one."

### John Calvin:
1. "In Baptism, he declares that our sins are forgiven, and calls us to repentance. That men may come forward, in a right manner, to be baptized, confession of sins is demanded from them: otherwise the whole performance would be nothing but an idle mockery."
2. "Let it be observed, that we are here speaking of adults, who ought not, we are aware, to be admitted indiscriminately into the Church, or introduced by Baptism into the body of Christ, till an examination has been previously made."
3. "Even granting to Papists all that they ask, confession will belong to Catechumens alone, and will have no place after Baptism."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Baptism was essentially a symbolical or ceremonial washing, prescribed at first by the Mosaic law, as a sign of moral renovation, joined with sacrifice." 
2. "Those who had received John’s baptism were rebaptized (Acts 19:4); Christ himself was the subject of the rite, as a Jew (see next section), while it had a more profound significance than the ceremonial lustration, yet it was not a baptism ‘unto his death’ (Romans 6:3), but ‘unto repentance’ (comp. Matthew 3:11)." 
3. "The subjects went into the river and were either immersed by John, or water was poured on them. The Greek verb baptize (from the root bapto, to dip) is a technical term for a symbolical washing, with a view to spiritual purification."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The movement of course was gradual. It began on a small scale and steadily grew till it reached colossal proportions."
 2. "Let Plummer, the great Church of England commentator on Matthew, speak here of John's baptising these people who came in throngs: 'It is his office to bind them to a new life, symbolized by immersion in water.'"
 3. "They came 'confessing their sins', probably each one confessing just before he was baptized, 'making open confession'."

### John Gill:
1. "The place where they were baptized of him was, 'in Jordan'; some copies read, 'in the river Jordan', as in Mark 1:5."
2. "The manner in which they were baptized by him was by immersion or plunging them in the water."
3. "Even in baptism itself there is a tacit confession and acknowledgment of sin, for it represents the sufferings and death of Christ which were for sin, into which persons are baptized, and profess to be dead to sin thereby."

### John Wesley:
1. "Confessing their sins — Of their own accord; freely and openly."
2. "And this way most naturally signified Christ's baptizing them with the Holy Ghost and with fire, which John spoke of, as prefigured by his baptizing with water."
3. "which was eminently fulfilled, when the Holy Ghost sat upon the disciples in the appearance of tongues, or flames of fire."
