# Matthew 3:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Pharisees and Sadducees, two opposing groups, are chastised together for their religious errors. The Pharisees were outwardly strict but internally full of pride and hypocrisy. They were renowned among the people for their observance of the law, prayer, and tithing, but their hearts were far from righteous. On the other hand, the Sadducees denied crucial doctrines such as the existence of angels, the immortality of the soul, and the resurrection of the dead. Both groups were in need of caution and warning, as they were leading the people astray with their false teachings.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Pharisees, deriving their name probably from פָּרַשׁ , ‘he separated’, took for their distinctive practice the strict observance of the law and all its requirements, written and oral."
2. "The Sadducees...rejected all tradition, but did not...confine their canon of Scripture to the Pentateuch."
3. "The two sects, mutually hostile, are found frequently in the Gospels united in opposition to our Lord; the Pharisees representing hypocritical superstition; the Sadducees, carnal unbelief."

2. "God's 'wrath,' in Scripture, is His righteous displeasure against sin, and consequently against all in whose skirts sin is found, arising out of the essential and eternal opposition of His nature to all moral evil."
3. "Fleeing from it—as of one who, beholding a tide of fiery wrath rolling rapidly towards him, sees in instant flight his only escape!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Pharisees were the most numerous and wealthy sect of the Jews...They were proud, haughty, self-righteous, and held the common people in great disrespect."
2. "The Sadducees...taught the duty of serving God disinterestedly, without the hope of reward or the fear of punishment...They denied the doctrine of a future state of rewards or punishments."
3. "The Essenes...were Jewish monks or hermits...They were generally more pure than the rest of the Jews, and appear to have been an unambitious, modest, and retiring sort of people."

### John Calvin:
1. "Nothing can be more unequal, in this respect, than a constant equality. For this reason John, we are told, addressed the Pharisees and Sadducees with greater severity: because he saw that their hypocrisy, and swelling pride, rendered them liable to be more severely censured than the common people."
2. "To comprehend more fully his design, we must understand, that none are more stupid than hypocrites, who deceive themselves and others by the outward mask of holiness."
3. "Those whose habits of uttering falsehood to God, and of deceiving themselves, lead them to hold out hypocrisy and pretension, instead of the reality, ought to be urged, with greater sharpness than other men, to true repentance."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Pharisees and Sadducees. Two opposing parties, here classed together in the same unworthy category...they represented one great form of religious error, that of outward legalism and traditionalism, hence of superstition, of self-righteousness, of hypocrisy, of lifeless orthodoxy."
2. "The Sadducees... represent the opposite tendency of skepticism, rationalism, and unbelief. They rejected tradition...and conformed greatly to heathen customs."
3. "The phrase characterizes them as both deceitful and malicious...in spite of their descent from Abraham, he thus classes them among those over whom the seed of the woman should obtain the victory."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "John clearly grasped the significance of this movement on the part of the Pharisees and Sadducees who had followed the crowds to the Jordan."
2. "He had welcomed the multitudes, but right in the presence of the crowds he exposes the hypocrisy of the ecclesiastics."
3. "The coming wrath" was not just for Gentiles as the Jews supposed, but for all who were not prepared for the kingdom of heaven.

### John Gill:
1. "The Pharisees, who separated themselves from the people as righteous persons, were called 'divisi, the divided.'"
2. "Or rather they have their name from פרס, which signifies 'a reward'; they being stiff defenders of the doctrine of rewards and punishments in a future state, which the Sadducees denied."
3. "John proceeds and asks, saying, 'Who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?' who has suggested this to you? from whom have ye received this hint?"

### John Wesley:
1. "They were outwardly strict observers of the law, fasted often, made long prayers, rigorously kept the Sabbath, and paid all tithe, even of mint, anise, and cummin. Hence they were in high esteem among the people. But inwardly, they were full of pride and hypocrisy."
2. "The Sadducees denied the existence of angels, and the immortality of the soul, and by consequence the resurrection of the dead."
3. "For it was fitting such men should be marked out, either for a caution to others, or a warning to themselves."
