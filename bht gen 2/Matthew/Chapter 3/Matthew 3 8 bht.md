# Matthew 3:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Repentance can be seen in two ways: legal repentance and evangelical repentance. Legal repentance involves a deep awareness and conviction of one's sin. On the other hand, evangelical repentance entails a transformation of the heart and a complete turning away from sin towards a life of holiness. When John the Baptist speaks of fruits meet for repentance, he is referring to the evidence of this genuine change of heart and life that accompanies true repentance.
