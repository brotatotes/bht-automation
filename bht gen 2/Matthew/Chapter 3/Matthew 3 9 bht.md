# Matthew 3:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The phrase think not should not be taken lightly, as it serves as a warning that mere lineage to Abraham does not grant entitlement to baptism. The Jews' excessive pride in their ancestral connection to Abraham was truly remarkable. Furthermore, when Jesus prefaces His words with I say unto you, it indicates the utmost importance and significance of the forthcoming message.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Do not fancy you may say, &c."
2. "The expression λέγειν ἐν ἑαυτοῖς, as similar expressions in Scripture, is used to signify the act by which outward circumstances are turned into thoughts of the mind."
3. "οὐκ ἔστι τοῦτο, οὐκ ἔστι. τῷ γὰρ θεῷ δυνατὸν καὶ ἀπὸ λίθωι ἀνθρώπους αὐτῷ δοῦναι, καὶ εἰς συγγένειαν αὐτοῦ ἀγαγεῖν, ἐπεὶ καὶ ἐξ ἀρχῆς οὕτως ἐγένετο."
 

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Flatter not yourselves with the fond delusion that God stands in need of you, to make good His promise of a seed to Abraham."
2. "Though the stern speaker may have pointed as he spoke to the pebbles of the bare clay hills that lay around, it was clearly the calling of the Gentiles... into the room of unbelieving and disinherited Israel that he meant thus to indicate."
3. "God is as able to raise up a seed to Abraham out of those stones as He was to take Abraham himself out of the rock whence he was hewn."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They regarded it as sufficient righteousness that they were descended from so holy a man as Abraham."
2. "The meaning seems to be this: God, from these stones, could more easily raise up those who should be worthy children of Abraham, or be like him, than simply, because you are descendants of Abraham, make you, who are proud and hypocritical, subjects of the Messiah’s kingdom."
3. "Mere nativity, or the privileges of birth, avail nothing where there is not righteousness of life."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. These stones. Pointing, as he spoke, to the pebbles on the beach of the Jordan.

### John Calvin:
1. "John’s address to the Pharisees and Sadducees amounts to this: 'Now that I have sharply upbraided you, do not, as persons of your stamp are wont to do, endeavor to find a remedy in an empty and deceitful title.'"
2. "He thus tears from them the wicked confidence, by which they had been bewitched."
3. "This arrogance was chiefly displayed by the high priests and by others who had any share of government or authority. The common people were treated by them as profane and 'accursed,' and they looked upon themselves as the holy first-fruits."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Think not to say, or, ‘that you may say.’ Do not say, nay, do not think that this is a plausible defence, even within yourselves, in your own hearts: We have Abraham to our father, or ‘for a father,’ i.e., we shall escape, or be saved, because we are natural heirs to the promise made to him."
2. "God is able of (or, ‘out of’) these stones, i.e., lying loose on the banks of Jordan, where the words were uttered sarcastic. No figurative reference to heathen, or to monuments."
3. "God could create others to take their place as heirs of the promise. Probably a reference to the spiritual offspring of the patriarch (Romans 4:16; Galatians 3:7). John, either consciously or unconsciously, predicts the calling of the Gentiles. Spiritual succession not dependent on natural or ecclesiastical (even ‘apostolic’) succession."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "John touched the tender spot, their ecclesiastical pride."
2. "John made clear that, reformer as he was, a breach existed between him and the religious leaders of the time."
3. "Pointing, as he spoke to the pebbles on the beach of the Jordan."

### John Gill:
1. "It is not a person's being born of believing parents that can entitle him to water baptism; or be a reason why it ought to be administered to him: if nothing more than this can be said in his favour, it is a plain case from hence, he ought to be debarred from it."
2. "God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham."
3. "What is it that the omnipotent God cannot do? He could as easily of stones make men, as make Adam out of the dust of the earth, and then make these men, in a spiritual sense, children of Abraham."

### John Wesley:
1. "Think not, seems here, and in many places, not to diminish, but rather add to the force of the word with which it is joined."
2. "It is almost incredible, how great the presumption of the Jews was on this their relation to Abraham."
3. "I say unto you - This preface always denotes the importance of what follows."
