# Matthew 4:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Spirit, who had descended on Jesus during his baptism, led Him into the wilderness. This divine guidance was a powerful force that compelled Him to go. The purpose of this journey was to face temptation from the devil. Through this experience, Jesus could fully identify with humanity, being tempted just as we are. Additionally, it allowed Him to develop empathy and the ability to provide support for those who face temptation. Satan, fully aware of Jesus' power, couldn't resist trying to undermine His mission and power, but ultimately, his attempts would lead to his own downfall.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Spirit carried Him away, (see Acts 8:39,) αὐτὸν ἐκβάλλει, Mark 1:12; compare Chrysostom’s excellent remarks on this agency of the Holy Spirit, in the opening of his 13th homily, p. 167."
2. "Had St. Luke’s ἤγετο ἐν τῷ πν. been our only account, we might have supposed what took place to have been done in a vision: but the expressions in the two other Evangelists, entirely preclude this."
3. "No other rendering is even grammatical. Hence it is evident that our Lord at this time was not ‘led up’ of his own will and design, but as a part of the conflict with the Power of Darkness, He was brought to the Temptation."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The thought thus strongly expressed is the mighty constraining impulse of the Spirit under which He went."
2. "The Spirit conducted Him into the wilderness simply to have His faith tried; but as the agent in this trial was to be the wicked one, whose whole object would be to seduce Him from His allegiance to God, it was a temptation in the bad sense of the term."
3. "What was the high design of this? First, as we judge, to give our Lord a taste of what lay before Him in the work He had undertaken; next, to make trial of the glorious equipment for it which He had just received; finally, that He might acquire experimental ability 'to succor them that are tempted'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was evidently that it might be seen that his holiness was such that he could not be seduced from allegiance to God."
2. "When the first Adam was created he was subjected to the temptation of the devil, and he fell and involved the race in ruin."
3. "In the clearest manifestations of the divine favor to us we may not be far from most powerful temptations, and then may be the time when it is necessary to be most carefully on our guard."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Devil, Satan, the God of this world, is always with the article and never plural."
2. "The Son of God. By its position in the sentence Son is emphatic. 'If thou standest to God in the relation of Son.'"
3. "These stones were perhaps those 'silicious accretions,' which assume the exact shape of little loaves of bread...The very appearance of these stones, like the bread for which the faint body hungered, may have added force to the temptation."

### John Calvin:
1. "By the guidance of the Spirit, Christ withdrew from the crowd of men, in order that he might come forth as the highest teacher of the church, as the ambassador of God, — rather as sent from heaven, than as taken from some town, and from among the common people."
2. "God intended, I have no doubt, to exhibit in the person of his Son, as in a very bright mirror, how obstinately and perseveringly Satan opposes the salvation of men."
3. "Whenever we are called to encounter Satan, let us remember, that his attacks can, in no other way, be sustained and repelled, than by holding out this shield: for the Son of God undoubtedly allowed himself to be tempted, that he may be constantly before our minds, when Satan excites within us any contest of temptations."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "After marked evidence of Divine favor, the most trying conflicts."
2. "The personal representatives of the two kingdoms here met."
3. "The suggestion of Matthew 4:9 could not be made with any power by a Jew; Matthew 4:10 speaks of Satan by name."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is not surprising that Jesus was tempted by the devil immediately after his baptism which signified the formal entrance upon the Messianic work."
2. "That is a common experience with ministers who step out into the open for Christ."
3. "Certainly Jesus did not discount or deny the reality of the devil's presence."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'the Spirit' is meant the same spirit of God, which had descended and lighted on him in a bodily shape, with the gifts and graces of which he was anointed, in an extraordinary manner, for public service." 
2. "Being 'led' by him denotes an internal impulse of the Spirit in him, stirring him up, and putting him upon going into the wilderness."
3. "The end of his being led there was to be tempted of the devil: ... that he might be in all things like unto his brethren; that he might have a heart as man... to succour them that are tempted; and that Satan... might have a specimen of his power, and expect, in a short time, the ruin of his kingdom by him."
