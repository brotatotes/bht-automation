# Matthew 4:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When faced with the audacious temptation from Satan, Jesus powerfully repels his advances. This encounter demonstrates a clear distinction between Satan's deceitful tactics and Jesus' unwavering devotion to God. By firmly commanding Satan to leave, Jesus asserts His authority and refuses to entertain any suggestion that strays from the worship and reverence due to the Lord God alone, as stated in Deuteronomy 6:13. This passage emphasizes the importance of our unwavering commitment to honoring and adoring God, while cautioning against the dangers of succumbing to the devil's enticements.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Our Lord at once repels him openly; not that He did not know him before, but because he had thus openly tempted Him; but not even this of His own power or will; He adds, for it is written, again, as Man, appealing to the Word of God."
2. "There does not appear to be sufficient ground for the distinction sometimes set up between the meanings of προσκυνεῖν with the dative and the same verb with the accusative."
3. "From this time, our Lord is known by the devils, and casts them out by a word."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Since the tempter has now thrown off the mask, and stands forth in his true character, our Lord no longer deals with him as a pretended friend and pious counsellor."
2. "Our Lord part with Satan on the rock of Scripture."
3. "The word 'only,' in the second clause—not expressed in the Hebrew and the Septuagint—is here added to bring out emphatically the negative and prohibitory feature of the command."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This was a bolder attack than any which had been made before... a more decided and deadly thrust at the piety of the Saviour."
2. "It was a proposition that the Son of God should worship the devil, instead of honoring and adoring Him who made heaven and earth."
3. "Satan asked him to worship him. This was expressly forbidden, and Jesus therefore drove him from his presence."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ simply bids him go away; and now proceeds with the same kind of defense as before, employing Scripture as a shield, not of reeds, but of brass."
2. "Papists deny that God only ought to be adored; and evade this and similar passages by sophistical arguments."
3. "But Christ rejects this frivolous distinction, and claims for God alone worship; by which he warns us to attend more to the matter than to expressions when we have to do with the worship of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Get thee hence. A single word, ‘begone,’ ‘avaunt,’ expressing abhorrence of both person and proposal."
2. "The two clauses taken together forbid every kind of religious homage to any other than Jehovah God."
3. "When Jesus of Nazareth permitted religious adoration of himself, he virtually declared that He was Jehovah our God. Tempted yet sinless, hungry yet Divine, He is ready to sympathize with us and able to succor us."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Begone" Christ says to Satan. This temptation is the limit of diabolical suggestion and argues for the logical order in Matthew.
2. The devil as the lord of the evil world constantly tries to win men to the service of the world and God. This is his chief camouflage for destroying a preacher's power for God.
3. Jesus will warn men against trying to serve God and mammon (Matthew 6:24). The devil as the lord of the evil world constantly tries to win men to the service of the world and God.

### John Gill:
1. "he had borne his insults and temptations with great patience; he had answered him with mildness and gentleness; but now his behaviour to him was intolerable, which obliged him to show his resentment, exert his power and authority, and rid himself at once of so vile a creature" 
2. "The meaning of our Lord in citing it is; that since the Lord God is the alone object of worship, it was horrid blasphemy in Satan to desire it might be given to him, and which could not be done without the greatest impiety."

### John Wesley:
1. "Get thee hence, Satan — Not, get thee behind me, that is, into thy proper place."
2. "...he said on a quite different occasion to Peter, speaking what was not expedient."
3. "Deuteronomy 6:13."
