# Matthew 4:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After hearing that John was cast into prison, Jesus did not immediately return but rather retired and withdrew into Galilee. This journey, however, was not immediate after His temptation. Before going to Galilee, Jesus had already traveled into Galilee before going into Judea again and celebrating the Passover at Jerusalem. During this time, John was still at liberty and baptizing in Judea. It was only after the Pharisees were offended and John was put in prison that Jesus decided to take this journey into Galilee.
