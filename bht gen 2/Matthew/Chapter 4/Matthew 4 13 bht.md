# Matthew 4:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Leaving their rejection and hostility behind, Jesus moved on from Nazareth, where his own townspeople had even tried to kill him, and found a new home in Capernaum, a vibrant and bustling city at the heart of Galilee. This move allowed Jesus to bring the message of the kingdom to a wider audience, away from the prejudices and jealousies that existed in Jerusalem and Nazareth. The significance of Capernaum as Jesus' chosen city was not lost on the Jews, who spoke ill of it precisely because it was the place where Christ had made his home.
