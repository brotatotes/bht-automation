# Matthew 4:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Galilee of the Gentiles, mentioned in Isaiah 9:1-2, refers to the region of Galilee that was inhabited by Gentiles or heathens. This distinction is significant because it highlights the diverse population and cultural influences in the area. The prophecy in Isaiah is directly related to the coming of the Messiah and speaks to the specific context of Galilee as a frontier between the Holy Land and the external world. The significance of Galilee as a Gentile-inhabited region adds to our understanding of the fulfillment of biblical prophecy in the life and ministry of Jesus.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This prophecy is spoken with direct reference to the days of the Messiah."
2. "The later meaning of מֵעֵבֶר לַיַּרְדֵּן, as signifying the tract to the west of the Jordan, and which naturally sprung up during the captivity, is not to be thought of in Isaiah, who wrote before that event."
3. "Galilee superior, near to Tyre and Sidon, which was inhabited by a variety of nations."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "While Ephraim and Judah, as STANLEY says, were separated from the world by the Jordan valley on one side and the hostile Philistines on another, the northern tribes were in the direct highway of all the invaders from the north."
3. "In the time of the Christian era this original disadvantage of their position was still felt; the speech of the Galileans 'bewrayed them' by its uncouth pronunciation, and their distance from the seats of government and civilization at Jerusalem and Cæsarea gave them their character for turbulence or independence."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Either an apostrophe to these regions or equivalent to: as to the land of Zebulun, etc. The sense is the same."
2. "The sea (or lake) of Galilee, not the Mediterranean. The latter view would indicate that the region was profane, being the way of the sea for all the world. But this seems forced."
3. "Galilee of the Gentiles. Upper Galilee, already spoken of by other names. It was near Gentile territory and probably had a large Gentile population."
