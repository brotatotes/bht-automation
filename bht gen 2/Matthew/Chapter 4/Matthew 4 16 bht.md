# Matthew 4:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The prophetic strain of these words originates during the reign of Ahaz, amidst the hostile efforts of nearby kingdoms to crush Judah. The people of Judah, dwelling in darkness, faced impending destruction. Yet there was hope, for from their lineage, Immanuel, the Virgin's Son, would emerge. He would bring light to those entrenched in the shadow of death, fulfilling the prophecy. Through His arrival, the land of Galilee, immersed in spiritual darkness and death, would see the fulfillment and fulfillment of the prediction. The light of the Messiah would illuminate these regions, delivering truth, knowledge, purity, and happiness.

3. "By Messiah's taking up His abode in those very regions of Galilee, and shedding His glorious light upon them, this prediction, He says, of the Evangelical prophet was now fulfilled; and if it was not thus fulfilled, we may confidently affirm it was not fulfilled in any age of the Jewish ceremony, and has received no fulfilment at all."
