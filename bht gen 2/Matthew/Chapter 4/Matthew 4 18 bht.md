# Matthew 4:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, purposefully called some of the first disciples, who were despicable and contemptible, out of their mean employment as fishermen. This was to demonstrate that their qualifications and gifts were not of their own doing but were given by Jesus himself. It was a display of his power and a way to humble the wise, reminding everyone that no one should boast in themselves, but only in him. (Mark 1:16; Luke 5:1)
