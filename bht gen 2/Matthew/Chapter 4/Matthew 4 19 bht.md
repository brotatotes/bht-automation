# Matthew 4:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus' invitation to Follow me goes beyond a simple call to discipleship. It encompasses a demand for complete self-renunciation and opens up a new sphere of activity under Him. By becoming fishers of men, Andrew and Simon leave behind their trade as fishermen to become ministers of the gospel, responsible for winning souls for Christ. Their role now involves spreading the net of the Gospel to catch the souls of both Jews and Gentiles. Their ability to accomplish this mission is not based on their own power, but on the transformative work of Jesus Himself.
