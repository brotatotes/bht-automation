# Matthew 4:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus fasted for forty days and nights, completely abstaining from food, just as Moses and Elijah did. During this time, Jesus was spiritually strengthened by God. It is important to note that Jesus' fasting was not meant to encourage asceticism or prescribe fasts to others, but rather to show his victory over temptation in our human nature. Despite not feeling hunger throughout the fast, Jesus eventually became hungry, setting the stage for the first temptation he would face.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Not in the wider ecclesiastical sense of the word, but its strict meaning, of abstaining from all food whatever." 
2. "The period of the fast, as in the case of Moses, was spent in a spiritual ecstasy, during which the wants of the natural body were suspended."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It has been questioned by some whether Christ abstained wholly from food, or only from the food to which he was accustomed."
2. "Luke says Luke 4:2 that he ate nothing. This settles the question."
3. "There are other instances of persons fasting 40 days recorded in the Scriptures. Thus, Moses fasted 40 days, Exodus 34:28. Elijah also fasted the same length of time, 1 Kings 19:8."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The length of the fast is not incredible. Comp. the fasts of Moses (Exodus 34:28) and Elijah (1 Kings 19:8), Absorption in intellectual pursuits, but especially in spiritual contemplation, will render any one for a time independent of ordinary food or nourishment."
2. "There is nothing here to encourage asceticism, however. Our Lord was enduring for us, not prescribing fasts to us. He neither practised nor enjoined monastic habits."
3. "Even when weakest physically, when the temptation would be strongest, He overcame in our nature what enslaves our unaided nature."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Had fasted (νηστευσας). No perfunctory ceremonial fast, but of communion with the Father in complete abstention from food as in the case of Moses during forty days and forty nights."
2. "The period of the fast, as in the case of Moses was spent in a spiritual ecstasy, during which the wants of the natural body were suspended."
3. "He afterward hungered" and so at the close of the period of forty days.

### John Gill:
1. "Forty nights" as well as days, are mentioned; partly to show that these were whole entire days, consisting of twenty four hours; and partly to distinguish this fast of Christ from the common fastings of the Jews, who used to eat in the night, though they fasted in the day. 
2. What is very surprising in this fasting of our Lord, which was made and recorded, not for our imitation, is, that during the whole time he should not be attended with hunger.
3. it is added,he was afterwards an hungered; that is, as Luke says, "when" the "forty" days "were ended", Luke 4:2 which seized upon him, and is related, both to express the reality of his human nature, which though miraculously supported for so long a time without food, and insensible of hunger, yet at length had appetite for food.

### John Wesley:
1. "Having fasted — Whereby doubtless he received more abundant spiritual strength from God."
2. "Forty days and forty nights — As did Moses, the giver of the law, and Elijah, the great restorer of it."
3. "He was afterward hungry — And so prepared for the first temptation."
