# Matthew 4:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These two brothers, James and John, were diligently mending their nets, preparing them for use. Their industry and diligence in their work is commendable and serves as an example for us to closely attend to the business of our calling. The fact that common names like James and John were not masters or doctors in Israel is significant, as Christ chose ordinary men to be his apostles. It is worth noting that the mention of R. James in Jewish writings might refer to the same person mentioned in this passage.

### John Gill:
1. "The Jews make mention in their writings of one R. James, the son of Zebedee, which Capellus conjectures is the very same person here mentioned."
2. "Men of this name, and sons of men of this name, were very common among the Jewish Rabbins; but neither this man, nor his sons, were masters or doctors in Israel; for such Christ chose not for his apostles."
3. "This shows their industry and diligence, and may be a pattern and example to persons, closely to attend the business of their calling, whilst the providence of God continues them in it."
