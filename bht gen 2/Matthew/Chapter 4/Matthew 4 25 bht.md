# Matthew 4:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Great multitudes of people followed him, coming from various places including Decapolis. The Decapolis was a region on the eastern side of the Sea of Galilee that consisted of ten cities grouped closely together. These cities were significant because they were inhabited mainly by foreigners, specifically Greeks, rather than Jews. The inclusion of Decapolis in the list of places from which the people came emphasizes the wide reach and diverse background of those who followed Jesus.
