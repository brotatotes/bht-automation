# Matthew 4:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The devil, known as the tempter, challenged Jesus to prove himself as the Son of God by performing a miracle and turning stones into bread. It was a plausible temptation, as Jesus had just been declared the Son of God and had the power to perform such a feat. However, Jesus, skilled and experienced in his role as the Son of God, was not fooled. Instead, he quoted scripture to repel the devil's cunning tactics. This interaction serves as a reminder to believers to be watchful and guard themselves against the temptations of the enemy.

3. "At the bidding of 'the Son of God' surely those stones shall all be turned into loaves, and in a moment present an abundant repast."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The devil is alluding to the words of the Father to Jesus at the baptism: 'This is my Son the Beloved.'
