# Matthew 4:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus willingly allowed Himself to be led by the devil to different locations. One of these locations was the pinnacle of the temple, which could refer to the highest summit with its golden spikes or another peak on Herod's royal portico. This temptation was not about ambition, but rather about presumption, as Satan wanted Jesus to test His divinity and foolishly rise up against God. Jesus faced this temptation with humility and grace, displaying His power to conquer the schemes of the devil. Throughout these temptations, Jesus demonstrated His willingness to undergo great humiliation for the sake of humanity.
