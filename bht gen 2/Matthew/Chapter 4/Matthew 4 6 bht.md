# Matthew 4:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The devil here tries to misapply scripture to render life dangerous to Christ and turn bread into poison. Satan distorts God's word to bring about our destruction, but God's word is meant for our salvation. Let us always rely on scripture to protect our faith, especially when Satan attempts to deceive us with his own twisted interpretation of the word of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "cited (nearly verbatim from the LXX, as almost all the texts in this narrative) as applying to all servants of God in general" 
2. "à fortiori to the Son of God: not as a prophecy of the Messiah."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Satan himself with a Bible under his arm and a text in his mouth!"
2. "The quotation is, precisely as it stands in the Hebrew and the Septuagint."
3. "The sense of it is precisely the same whether the clause in question be inserted or not."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The temptation here was, that he should at once avail himself of the protection of a promise of safety made to him, and thus demonstrate that he was the Messiah."
2. "The temptation, therefore, in this case was, that by thus establishing his claim he would avoid all the obloquy, persecution, and suffering which he must otherwise endure if he attempted to prove that he was the Son of God by a life of toil and privation."
3. "The promise, as Satan applied it, was that he should not be injured by the stones lying at the bottom of the wall or in the valley below."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. In their hands [επι] . On their hands (so Rev.) is more correct, and gives a different picture from the A. V. in : lifted on their hands, as on a litter or platform.

### John Calvin:
1. "We must observe this malice of Satan, in misapplying a quotation of Scripture, for the purpose of rendering life deadly to Christ, and of converting bread into poison."
2. "Satan profanes the Word of God, and endeavors to torture it for our destruction. But it has been ordained by God for our salvation; and shall the purpose of God be frustrated, unless our indolence deprive his word of its saving effect?"
3. "Whenever Satan shall cover his deception by Scripture, and ungodly men shall labor to subvert our faith by the same means, let us borrow our armor exclusively from Scripture for the protection of our faith."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The devil takes the weapon with which he had been already overcome."
2. "He too, 'can cite Scripture for his purpose.' But the result proves that Satan was but a surface reader, or rather a wilful perverter of the Scriptures."
3. "Satan uses it [the Scripture] literally, tempting to a rash confidence, as in the first instance to distrust. It was also a temptation to avoid the appointed endurance, and by one striking exercise of power prove himself the Messiah."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The devil urged presumptuous reliance on God and quotes Scripture to support his view."
2. "The devil quotes the Word of God, misinterprets it, omits a clause, and tries to trip the Son of God by the Word of God."
3. "This would be a sign from heaven in accord with popular Messianic expectation."

### John Gill:
1. "Satan not only argues from his divine power, as the Son of God, that he would be safe in casting himself down; but observing the advantageous use Christ made of the scriptures, transforms himself into an angel of light, and cites scripture too, to encourage him to this action; assuring him of the protection of angels."
2. "It does not appear that Satan was wrong in the application of this passage to Christ; for since it respects all the righteous in general, why not Christ as man? the head, as well as the members?"
3. "Satan before tempted Christ to distrust the providence of God, and now he tempts him to presume upon it: in like manner he deals with men, when he argues from the doctrines of predestination and providence to the disuse of means, for their good, either for this life, or that which is to come."

### John Wesley:
1. In their hands — That is, with great care. Psalm 91:11,12.
