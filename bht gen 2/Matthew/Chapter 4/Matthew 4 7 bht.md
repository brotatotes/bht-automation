# Matthew 4:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To tempt the Lord thy God is to doubt or question his promises, seeking additional proof beyond what he has already provided. This caution, quoting from Deuteronomy 6:16, reminds us not to put God's faithfulness to the test or demand further signs. We are called to trust in his word and not waver in our belief, for he has already made himself abundantly clear.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "πάλιν] not ‘contra,’ which it never simply means, not even in Galatians 5:3; 1 John 2:8; but ‘rursus’ or ‘iterum,’ as the versions rightly render it." 
2. "The addition of a second Scripture qualifies and interprets the first; but does not refute it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "True, it is so written, and on that promise I implicitly rely; but in using it there is another Scripture which must not be forgotten."
2. "Preservation in danger is divinely pledged: shall I then create danger, either to put the promised security skeptically to the proof, or wantonly to demand a display of it?"
3. "That were 'to tempt the Lord my God,' which, being expressly forbidden, would forfeit the right to expect preservation."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Thou shall not tempt the Lord thy God - This is quoted literally from Deuteronomy 6:16. The meaning is, thou shalt not try him; or, thou shalt not, by throwing thyself into voluntary and uncommanded dangers, appeal to God for protection, or trifle with the promises made to those who are thrown into danger by his providence."
2. "It is true, indeed, that God aids those of his people who are placed by him in trial or danger; but it is not true that the promise was meant to extend to those who wantonly provoke him and trifle with the promised help."
3. "Thus, Satan, artfully using and perverting Scripture, was met and repelled by Scripture rightly applied."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In that 'It is written again' of Christ, lies a great lesson, quite independent of that particular scripture which, on this occasion, he quotes, or of the use to which he turns it."
2. "There lies in it the secret of our safety and defence against all distorted use of isolated passages in holy scripture."
3. "Only as we enter into the unity of scripture, as it balances, completes, and explains itself, are we warned against error and delusion, excess or defect on this side or the other."

### John Calvin:
1. "There is no other way, in which we have a right to expect the assistance promised in that passage, than when believers humbly submit themselves to his guidance."
2. "God is tempted in many ways: but in this passage, the word tempt denotes the neglect of those means which he puts into our hands."
3. "Whoever desires to make an experiment of the divine power, when there is no necessity for it, tempts God by subjecting his promises to an unfair trial."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Our Lord corrects the misinterpretation of poetic Scripture by citing a plain statement of the law."
2. "For every tempting of God is caused by Satan."
3. "Religious fanaticism is a tempting of God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Thou shall not tempt  (ουκ εκπειρασεις). Jesus quotes Deuteronomy again (Deuteronomy 6:16) and shows that the devil has wholly misapplied God's promise of protection. 

### John Gill:
1. "Christ takes no notice of the false and wrong citation of scripture made by the devil, nor of any misapplication of it" (Commentary).
2. "To neglect the ordinary means of safety, and to expect, that as God can, so he will, preserve without the use of such means, is a tempting him" (Commentary).
3. "Perhaps he hereby intimates too, that he himself was God; and therefore as it was not right in him to tempt God the Father, by taking such a step as Satan solicited him to; nor would it be right in any other; so it was iniquitous in the devil to tempt him who was God over all, blessed for ever" (Commentary).

### John Wesley:
1. Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God — By requiring farther evidence of what he hath already made sufficiently plain. Deuteronomy 6:16.
