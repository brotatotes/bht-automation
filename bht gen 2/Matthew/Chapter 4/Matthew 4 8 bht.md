# Matthew 4:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through a supernatural vision, the devil shows Christ all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. This includes kingdoms within and independent of the Roman empire, representing their riches, power, and grandeur. Rather than a representation on a map or picture, this display is a fictitious and delusive presentation granted to Satan. The brevity of the vision, described as a moment of time, highlights the swiftness with which the devil deceivingly reveals this image to Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The additional words in Luke, ·ºêŒΩ œÉœÑŒπŒ≥Œº·øá œáœÅœåŒΩŒøœÖ, are valuable as pointing out to us clearly the supernatural character of this vision."
2. "If it be objected, that in that case there was no need for the ascent of the mountain, I answer, that such natural accessories are made use of frequently in supernatural revelations."
3. "In this last temptation the enemy reveals himself openly, as the ·ºÑœÅœáœâŒΩ œÑŒø·ø¶ Œ∫œåœÉŒºŒøœÖ œÑŒøœçœÑŒøœÖ, and as the father of lies."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Luke adds the important clause, 'in a moment of time', a clause which seems to furnish a key to the true meaning."
2. "The expression 'in a moment of time'...intended to intimate some supernatural operation."
3. "In this case, the 'exceeding height' of the 'mountain' from which this sight was beheld would favor the effect to be produced."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This shows that there were mountains from which no small part of the land of Canaan could be seen; and we need not suppose that there was any miracle when they were shown to the Saviour."
2. "It is not probable that anything more is intended here than the kingdoms of Palestine, or of the land of Canaan, and those in the immediate vicinity."
3. "The term 'world' is often used in this limited sense to denote a part or a large part of the world, particularly the land of Canaan."

### John Calvin:
1. "We have to contend every day with the same imposture: for every believer feels it in himself and it is still more clearly seen in the whole life of the ungodly."
2. "Though we are convinced, that all our support, and aid, and comfort, depend on the blessing of God, yet our senses allure and draw us away, to seek assistance from Satan, as if God alone were not enough."
3. "A considerable portion of mankind disbelieve the power and authority of God over the world, and imagine that every thing good is bestowed by Satan."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "An exceeding high mountain... Its situation can only be conjectured; the Mount of Olives, which was relatively high; others, the mountain in the wilderness (Quarantania), Nebo, Tabor."
2. "Sheweth him... Luke adds, ‚Äòin a moment of time,‚Äô this may imply some supernatural extension of vision. Magical influence on the part of Satan is less probable than an actual pointing out of the regions in sight, and a vivid description of the adjoining realms."
3. "All the kingdoms of the world; not to be restricted to Palestine, a narrower meaning which ‚Äòworld‚Äô occasionally has, but never in such a phrase. It becomes intelligible on the theory suggested: actual vision with added rhetorical description."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This wonderful panorama had to be partially mental and imaginative, since the devil caused to pass in review 'all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them.' But this fact does not prove that all phases of the temptations were subjective without any objective presence of the devil. Both could be true."
2. "Here again we have the vivid historical present."
3. "The devil now has Christ upon a very high mountain whether the traditional Quarantania or not. It was from Nebo's summit that Moses caught the vision of the land of Canaan (Deuteronomy 34:1-3)."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'all the kingdoms of the world' are meant... all the kingdoms in the whole world, which subsisted in any form, whether within, or independent of the Roman empire; or whether greater or lesser; and by 'the glory of them,' is meant, the riches, pomp, power, and grandeur of them."
2. "Now the view which Satan gave Christ of all this, was not by a representation of them in a picture, or in a map, or in any geographical tables, as some have thought; since to do this there was no need to take him up into a mountain... this was a fictitious, delusive representation, which Satan was permitted to make."
3. "The word œÉœÑŒπŒ≥ŒºŒ∑, used by Luke 4:5... designs the smallest part of time that can be conceived of... a very short space of time indeed, in which the devil showed to Christ the kingdoms of this world, and their glory."

### John Wesley:
1. Showeth him all the kingdoms of the world ‚Äî In a kind of visionary representation.
