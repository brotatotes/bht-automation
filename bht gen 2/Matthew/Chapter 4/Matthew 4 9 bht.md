# Matthew 4:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The devil, referred to as the prince and god of this world, tried to tempt Jesus by offering Him the kingdoms of the world. He claimed to have the authority to give power and control over all these things. However, Jesus rejected this offer and refused to subject Himself to the sinful dominion of the devil. The devil's temptations are cunning and deceptive, even when they involve blasphemous thoughts. Jesus recognizes the devil's true identity and firmly rebukes him, acknowledging his deceitful nature.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Is not Satan thrice called by our Lord Himself, 'the prince of this world'? Does not the apostle call him 'the god of this world'? And still further, is it not said that Christ came to destroy by His death 'him that hath the power of death, that is, the devil'?"
2. "No doubt these passages only express men's voluntary subjection to the rule of the wicked one while they live, and his power to surround death to them, when it comes, with all the terrors of the wages of sin."
3. "In this case, his offer to our Lord was that of a deputed supremacy commensurate with his own, though as his gift and for his ends."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "All these kingdoms...Satan claimed a right to bestow on whom he pleased, and with considerable justice."
2. "Satan proposed to put him in possession of it at once, without any difficulty, if he would acknowledge him as the proper lord and disposer of that country; if he would trust to him rather than to God."
3. "So plausible are Satanâ€™s temptations, even when they are blasphemous; and so artfully does he present his allurements to the mind."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "All these things, i.e., â€˜all that renders them attractive to the love of power, pleasure, wealth, honorâ€™ (J. A. Alexander)."
2. "His greatest weapons are his half-truths, his perversions of the truth."
3. "His price is always exorbitant. The proposal was bold, but in the contest between them it must come to this."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus does not deny the grip of the devil on the world of men, but the condition was spurned by Jesus."
2. "The temptation was threefold: to gain a temporal, not a spiritual, dominion; to gain it at once; and to gain it by an act of homage to the ruler of this world, which would make the self-constituted Messiah the vice-regent of the devil and not of God."

### John Gill:
1. "In which words he sets up himself to be the God of this world, and the sovereign disposer of it: he pretends it was delivered to him by the true God, who had left it to his arbitrary disposal."
2. "Never was such monstrous arrogance expressed as this; when this poor, proud, wretched creature, has not the disposal, at his pleasure, of anyone single thing; no not the least in the whole universe."
3. "The devil is not content to be worshipped by men, but seeks for adoration from the Son of God: this opens at once his proud, ambitious, and aspiring views, to be as God himself; for with nothing less can he be satisfied."

### John Wesley:
1. "Here Satan clearly shows who he was."
2. "Accordingly Christ answering this suggestion, calls him by his own name, which he had not done before."
