# Matthew 5:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus went up to the mountain, finding a suitable place to gather a willing audience. This discourse was not only for the twelve disciples, but for all who desired to learn from Jesus. The master would sit in a chief place with the disciples before him, forming a circle so that they could all see and hear him. By gathering on the mountain, Jesus provided a space where he could teach and minister to the multitudes who were coming to him from various directions.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The view that they are identical is generally taken by ordinary readers of Scripture, from their similarity in many points."

2. "So charming is the whole landscape that the descriptions of it, from JOSEPHUS downwards [Wars of the Jews, 4.10,8], are apt to be thought a little colored."
3. "Though the latter only answered to the subjects of His kingdom, described in this discourse, there were drawn from time to time into this inner circle souls from the outer one, who, by the power of His matchless word, were constrained to forsake their all for the Lord Jesus."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is not improbable that it was repeated, in substance, on different occasions, and to different people."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The mountain [œÑŒø ŒøœÅŒøœÇ] . The Rev. recognized the force of the definite article, and renders "the mountain," that particular mountain in the place where Jesus saw the multitudes."
2. "Delitzsch calls the Mount of Beatitudes 'The Sinai of the New Testament.'"
3. "When he was set [Œ∫Œ±Œ∏ŒπœÉŒ±ŒΩœÑŒøœÇ], following Tyndale. Rev., more literally, when he had sat down (compare Wyc., when he had set). After the manner of the rabbis, he seated himself ere he began to teach."

### John Calvin:
1. "Matthew states, that Christ spoke to his disciples on a mountain, while Luke seems to say, that the discourse was delivered on a plain."
2. "But it is a mistake to read the words of Luke, he went down with them, and stood in the plain, as immediately connected with the statement that, lifting up his eyes on the disciples, he spoke thus."
3. "Pious and modest readers ought to be satisfied with having a brief summary of the doctrine of Christ placed before their eyes, collected out of his many and various discourses, the first of which was that in which he spoke to his disciples about true happiness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He went up...to gather from them a willing audience."

3. "There is no real difficulty in considering the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew and the Sermon on the Plain in Luke as one and the same."
