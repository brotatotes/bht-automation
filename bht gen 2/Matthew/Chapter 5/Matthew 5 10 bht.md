# Matthew 5:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake. The saints, who live godly in Christ Jesus, expose themselves to the hostility and persecution of the world. Their righteous conduct, their godly conversation, and their defense of Christ and His truths provoke the rage of men. The world despises and rejects them for they are different, reproving their thoughts and challenging their ways. Yet, in the midst of this opposition, they are truly blessed, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to them.
