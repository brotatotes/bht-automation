3. "ψευδόμενοι does not belong to ἕνεκεν ἐμοῦ, as some recent Commentators have supposed (Tholuck, Meyer), but to εἴπωσιν."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He identifies Himself and His cause with that of righteousness, binding up the cause of righteousness in the world with the reception of Himself."
2. "But to have called this 'their sake,' would, as every one feels, have been very unbecoming. Whereas He that speaks, being Righteousness incarnate, when He so speaks, speaks only like Himself."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "But, being reviled, he reviled not again...and thus, though the contempt of the world is not in itself desirable, yet it is blessed to tread in the footsteps of Jesus, to imitate his example, and even to suffer for his sake." 
2. "It is not blessed to have evil spoken of us if we deserve it; but if we deserve it not, then we should not consider it as a calamity. We should take it patiently, and show how much the Christian, under the consciousness of innocence, can bear." 
3. "When thus reviled or persecuted, we are to be meek, patient, humble; not angry; not reviling again; but endeavoring to do good to our persecutors and slanderers... they have seen that nothing else but Christianity could impart such patience and meekness to the persecuted; and have, by this means, been constrained to submit themselves to the gospel of Jesus."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ intended to comfort those who believe in him; that they may not lose courage, even though they see themselves to be detestable in the eyes of the world."

3. "It was therefore his will to furnish them with a sure defense, that they might not give way, though an immense mass of reproaches were ready to overwhelm them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "When men shall revile you... implies that this will happen. The first revilers and persecutors were the unbelieving Jews, here referred to indefinitely."
2. "Persecute refers to acts and the last phrase to backbiting."
3. "Those only suffer for righteousness’ sake, who suffer for Christ’s sake; elsewhere we learn more distinctly; those only are blessed with righteousness who are blessed for Christ’s sake."

2. "they were 'falsely' laid; there was not a word of truth in them; wherefore their own hearts would not reproach them; but all were the malicious lies of men, invented on purpose to bring them and Christianity into disgrace."
3. "the treatment they meet with is on his account, and the same that he himself met with; the like reproaches fell on him, which will be all wiped off from him and them another day."
