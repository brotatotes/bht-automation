# Matthew 5:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Rejoice and be exceeding glad for the honor and glory they bring to Christ and his cause by cheerfully suffering for it. The reward in heaven is not of debt but of grace, and it is far greater than the sufferings endured on earth. The saints must take comfort in knowing that they follow in the footsteps of the prophets who were also persecuted for their faith. Their reward, like that of the faithful who came before them, will be great and eternal.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "A reward, not of debt, but of grace, as the parable in ch. Matthew 20:1 ff. clearly represents it."
2. "In which however we must remember, that the principal reference is to God as the giver, and not to us as the deservers."
3. "These words, ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς, must not be taken as having any bearing on the question as to the future habitation of the glorified saints. Their use in this and similar expressions is not local, but spiritual, indicating the blessed state when ἡ βασιλεία τῶν οὐρανῶν shall have fully come."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Exult." In the corresponding passage of Luke (Luke 6:22; Luke 6:23), where every indignity trying to flesh and blood is held forth as the probable lot of such as were faithful to Him, the word is even stronger than here: "leap," as if He would have their inward transport to overpower and absorb the sense of all these affronts and sufferings; nor will anything else do it.
2. "For great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you." You do but serve yourselves heirs to their character and sufferings, and the reward will be common.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Regard it as a great privilege thus to be persecuted and to suffer - a thing not to be mourned over, but as among the chief blessings of life."
2. "To those who suffer most, God imparts the highest rewards. Hence, the crown of martyrdom has been thought to be the brightest that any of the redeemed shall wear."
3. "Though God does not require us to seek persecution, yet all this shows that there is something in religion to sustain the soul which the world does not possess."

### John Calvin:
1. "The idle reasonings of the Papists, about the word reward, which is here used, are easily refuted: for there is not (as they dream) a mutual relation between the reward and merit, but the promise of the reward is free."
2. "But Christ pronounces those only to be happy who are employed in defending a righteous cause."
3. "The prophets who were before you...ought therefore to be followed as their example."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Needful, because the prospect of persecution is far from awakening joy."
2. "The reason both for rejoicing and for the blessedness. 'Reward,' i.e., recompense; but of grace, not of debt."
3. "For so persecuted they, i.e., the unbelieving Jews, the prophets who were before you."

### John Gill:
1. "Rejoice and be exceeding glad,.... Because of the honour put upon them, the glory they bring to Christ and his cause, by cheerfully suffering for it; and because of the glory and happiness that shall follow upon their sufferings."
2. "For great is your reward in heaven; not of debt, but of grace; for there is no proportion or comparison between what the saints suffer for Christ, and the glory that shall be revealed in them by him; not in earth, but in heaven."
3. "And the more to animate them to suffer with joyfulness, and to support them under all their reproaches and persecutions, it is added; for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you; as Isaiah, Jeremiah, Zechariah, and others."

### John Wesley:
1. Your reward — Even over and above the happiness that naturally and directly results from holiness.
