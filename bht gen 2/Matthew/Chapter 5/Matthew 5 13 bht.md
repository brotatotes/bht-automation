# Matthew 5:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers have the vital role of being the salt of the earth. They are called to preserve society from corruption and bring spiritual seasoning to a tasteless world. This responsibility extends beyond external organizations and depends on the power of Christ in individual believers. By living out their faith and sharing God's Word, they can counteract the foolishness and insipidity of the world. Their presence and impact are crucial in preventing moral decay and spiritual emptiness. Without the salt of the earth, the world would be left vulnerable and devoid of the life-giving qualities that Christ brings.
