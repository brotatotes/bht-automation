# Matthew 5:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
You are the light of the world, meant to carry and spread the light of the Gospel to dispel the darkness of ignorance and error. Your purpose is to shine brightly, like the sun in the sky, and cannot be hidden. Just as a city on a hill cannot be concealed, your light is meant to be seen by all, illuminating the way to truth and holiness. So let your light shine brightly, for all to see, and be a testament to the transformative power of the Gospel.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Christ Himself being τὸ φῶς τὸ ἀληθινόν, ὃ φωτίζει πάντα ἄνθρωπον, ἐρχόμενον εἰς τὸν κόσμον." 
2. "His ministers are λύχνοι, and φωστῆρες, receiving their light, and only burning for a time." 
3. "The CHURCH OF GOD, the city on a hill, in allusion to their present situation, on a mountain, is most probably the leading thought."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Ye are the light of the world—This being the distinctive title which our Lord appropriates to Himself—a title expressly said to be unsuitable even to the highest of all the prophets—it must be applied here by our Lord to His disciples only as they shine with His light upon the world, in virtue of His Spirit dwelling in them, and the same mind being in them which was also in Christ Jesus."
2. "Hence Christians are warily styled 'the salt of the earth'—with reference to the masses of mankind with whom they are expected to mix; but 'the light of the world'—with reference to the vast and variegated surface which feels its fructifying and gladdening radiance."
3. "A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid—nor can it be supposed to have been so built except to be seen by many eyes."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The light of the world often denotes the sun, John 11:9. The sun renders objects visible, shows their form, their nature, their beauties, their deformities."
2. "The term light is often applied to religious teachers... It is pre-eminently applied to Jesus in these places because he is, in the moral world, what the sun is in the natural world."
3. "A city that is set on a hill... They must be seen; and as this was the case, they ought to be holy, harmless, and undefiled."

### John Calvin:
1. "We are all the children of light, after having been enlightened by faith, and are commanded to carry in our hands 'burning lamps,' (that we may not wander in darkness,) and even to point out to others the way of life." 
2. "They are placed in this rank on the condition, that they shall shine, as from an elevated situation, on all others." 
3. "Christ informs the apostles, that they must be more careful to live a devout and holy life, than unknown persons of the common rank, because the eyes of all are directed to them, as to lighted candles."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The influence of salt is internal, of light, external; hence 'earth' (Matthew 5:13), and here 'world,' both referring to society or mankind, the latter more to its organized external form."
2. "Light is opposed to darkness, and dispels it; is the symbol of truth and holiness."
3. "The Church of God is such a city, and must be seen, like the light."

### John Gill:
1. "Ye are the light of the world, carrying and spreading the light of the Gospel not only in Judea, but all over the world, which was in great darkness of ignorance and error."
2. "The doctrines which the apostles were commissioned to preach... were not to be hid or concealed from men."
3. "They were to be 'made a spectacle'; to be set as in a public theatre, to be seen by 'the world, angels, and men'."
