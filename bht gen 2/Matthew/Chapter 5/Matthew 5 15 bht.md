# Matthew 5:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The purpose of the light that God has given us is not to be concealed, but to shine for all to see. Just as a candle is meant to be placed on a candlestick or lampstand to provide light to a room, our spiritual light is meant to be shared with others. We are called to let our light shine brightly, so that it may benefit and bless those around us. By doing so, we fulfill the purpose that God has given us and bring glory to His name.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A bushel [τον μοδιον] . Rev., rightly, 'the bushel;' since the definite article is designed to indicate a familiar object - the grain - measure which is found in every house."
2. "A candlestick [την λυχνιαν] . Rev., the stand. Also a part of the furniture of every house, and commonly but one in the house : hence the article."
3. "The word, which occurs four times in the Gospels and eight times elsewhere, means, in every case, not a candlestick, but a lamp - stand."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Under this the light could be hid."
2. "But on the candlestick, or ‘lampstand;’ its proper place, an elevated holder or stand, so that its light might be diffused as widely as possible."
3. "'Giveth light,' implies that a certain effect is necessarily produced, but the lamp only shines, its light may be rejected."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The figure is taken from lowly cottage life. There was a projecting stone in the wall on which the lamp was set. The house consisted of a single room, so that the tiny light sufficed for all" (Bruce).
2. "It was not put under the bushel (the only one in the room) save to put it out or to hide it. The bushel was an earthenware grain measure."
