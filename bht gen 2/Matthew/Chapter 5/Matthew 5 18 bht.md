# Matthew 5:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For the law is not fulfilled until all that it requires or foretells is accomplished, including both its precepts being obeyed and its punishments and rewards being carried out. This demonstrates the enduring nature and superior excellence of the law, which holds more value than even the heavens and the earth. This is evident in other passages of scripture such as Luke 16:17 and 21:33.
