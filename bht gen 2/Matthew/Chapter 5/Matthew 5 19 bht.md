# Matthew 5:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Breaking one of the least commandments and teaching others to do the same will result in being least in the kingdom of heaven. It is important to appreciate and uphold even the seemingly insignificant parts of God's law. Teachers must practice what they preach and uphold the entire law, without making distinctions between greater and lesser commandments. Only then will they be recognized as great in the kingdom of heaven.
