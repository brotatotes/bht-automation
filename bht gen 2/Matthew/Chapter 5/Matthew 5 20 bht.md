## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The whole of the rest of our Lord’s sermon is a comment on, and illustration of, the assertion in this verse."
2. "Notice, that not only the hypocrites among the Scribes and Pharisees are here meant; but the declaration is, 'Your righteousness must be of a higher order than any yet attained, or conceived, by Scribe or Pharisee.'"
3. "A very usual formula... implying exclusion from the blessings of the Christian state, and from the inheritance of eternal life."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The superiority to the Pharisaic righteousness here required is plainly in kind, not degree; for all Scripture teaches that entrance into God's kingdom, whether in its present or future stage, depends, not on the degree of our excellence in anything, but solely on our having the character itself which God demands."
2. "Our righteousness, then—if it is to contrast with the outward and formal righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees—must be inward, vital, spiritual."
3. "This was no new doctrine... But our Lord's teaching here stretches beyond the present scene, to that everlasting stage of the kingdom, where without 'purity of heart' none 'shall see God.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Unless you are more holy than they are, you cannot be saved."
2. "The righteousness of true Christians is seated in the heart, and is therefore genuine."
3. "The righteousness that Jesus required in his kingdom was purity, chastity, honesty, temperance, the fear of God, and the love of man."

### John Calvin:
1. "Nothing has less influence over their minds than zeal for the law."
2. "By confining the law of God to outward duties only, they trained their disciples, like apes, to hypocrisy."
3. "The objection which, as we have already said, was unjustly brought against him by the Scribes, is powerfully thrown back on themselves."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Except your righteousness, your obedience, rectitude, shall exceed, abound more than, that of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven." 
2. "He exacts more than these so exact and exacting in their’ righteousness.’ Less a charge of hypocrisy or wickedness than a declaration that they, with all their care, had not yet understood the real spirit of the law."
3. "Christ only unfolds its true meaning, first, by saying that the way to obey it is not that of the Pharisees. Christ is the way to obedience."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Shall exceed (περισσευση πλειον). Overflow like a river out of its banks and then Jesus adds 'more' followed by an unexpressed ablative (της δικαιοσυνης), brachylogy."
2. "A daring statement on Christ's part that they had to be better than the rabbis. They must excel the scribes, the small number of regular teachers (Matthew 5:21-48), and the Pharisees in the Pharisaic life (Matthew 6:1-18) who were the separated ones, the orthodox pietists."

### John Gill:
1. "except your righteousness exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven."
2. "it is contrary to his nature, and would be destructive to the comfort of saints, to receive an unrighteous person into his kingdom and glory."
3. "the righteousness of Christ, which is imputed to them, and received by faith, is infinitely more excellent in its author, perfection, purity, and use; and which is their only right and title to eternal glory."

### John Wesley:
1. The righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees — Described in the sequel of this discourse.
