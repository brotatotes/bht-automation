# Matthew 5:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The traditional understanding of the law, as expounded by the scribes and Pharisees, focused solely on the external actions rather than the internal thoughts and feelings. However, Jesus came to correct these misconceptions and show that the true righteousness required by the law goes beyond mere outward obedience. He teaches that love is the fulfillment of the law and that harming one's neighbor, whether through physical actions or by harboring hatred, goes against this principle. Thus, Jesus clarifies the true meaning of the commandments and emphasizes the importance of a righteousness that is rooted in love and compassion.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The contrasts here are not between the law misunderstood and the law rightly understood, but between the law and its ancient exposition, which in their letter, and as given, were κενά, and the same as spiritualized, πεπληρωμένα, by Christ."
2. "There is no inconsistency in the above view with the assertion in Matthew 5:19: the just and holy and true law was necessarily restricted in meaning and degraded in position, until He came, whose office it was to fulfill and glorify it."
3. "κρίσει [means] the courts in every city, ordered Deuteronomy 16:18, and explained by Josephus Antt. iv. 8. 14 to consist of seven men, and to have the power of life and death."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "To us it seems as plain as possible that our Lord's one object is to contrast the traditional perversions of the law with the true sense of it as expounded by Himself."
2. "This being all that the law requires, whosoever has imbrued his hands in his brother's blood, but he only, is guilty of a breach of this commandment."
3. "Thus was this commandment reduced, from a holy law of the heart-searching God, to a mere criminal statute, taking cognizance only of outward actions."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jesus proceeds here to comment on some prevailing opinions among the Jews; to show that the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees was defective; and that people needed a better righteousness, or they could not be saved."
2. "He illustrates what he meant by that better righteousness by showing that the common opinions of the scribes were erroneous."
3. "The comment of our Saviour shows that it [Thou shalt not kill] was spiritual, and was designed to extend to the thoughts and feelings as well as the external act."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is a mistake, however, to suppose that this is an ἐπανόρθωσις, or correction of the Law, and that Christ raises his disciples to a higher degree of perfection."
2. "Christ vindicates [the law] against such corruptions, and points out its true meaning, from which the Jews had departed."
3. "Love is the fulfilling of the law, and I say that your neighbor is injured when you act towards him otherwise than as a friend."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Ye have heard, when the law was read in public, etc. It was said to (not 'by') them of old time, 'the ancients.'"
2. "Thou shalt not kill. From the Decalogue, the sixth commandment... Whosoever shall kill, commit actual murder, shall be in danger of the judgment, i.e., subject to trial by an earthly court, probably the one in the place he lived."
3. "The interpretation of the scribes; correct, but not complete."

### John Gill:
1. "'Ye have heard'...from the Scriptures being read to them...so that to 'hear', was along with the recital of the text, to receive by tradition, the sense the elders had given of it." 
2. "Their rules for the judgment of such persons were these; 'everyone that kills his neighbor with his hand...lo! such an one must be put to death by the house of judgment, or the sanhedrin.'"
3. "If a man hires a murderer to kill his neighbor...everyone of these is a shedder of blood; and the sin of slaughter is in his hand; and he is guilty of death by the hand of heaven, i.e. God; but he is not to be put to death by the house of judgment, or the sanhedrin."

### John Wesley:
1. "Ye have heard — From the scribes reciting the law; Thou shalt do no murder - And they interpreted this, as all the other commandments, barely of the outward act."
2. "The judgement — The Jews had in every city a court of twenty-three men, who could sentence a criminal to be strangled."
3. "But the sanhedrim only (the great council which sat at Jerusalem, consisting of seventy-two men,) could sentence to the more terrible death of stoning. That was called the judgment, this the council."
