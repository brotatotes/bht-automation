# Matthew 5:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, as the ultimate authority, challenges the traditional understanding of the law by emphasizing that it is not just the physical act that matters, but also the motive behind it. He condemns even anger and hateful speech, going beyond the act of murder itself. The term Gehenna, symbolizing the place of future punishment, is distinct from Hades, which represents the place of departed spirits. Jesus warns against using derogatory language, as it carries severe consequences and exposes one to eternal death. He calls for a higher standard of righteousness and warns of the dire consequences for the unrepentant.
