# Matthew 5:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is important for us to consider not only the complaints we have against others, but also the complaints others may have against us. When we come to worship God, we should take the time to reconcile with our brothers and sisters, making things right with those we have offended. Our worship and service to God are only pleasing to Him when they are accompanied by love and unity among ourselves. Let us be mindful of our actions and words, seeking forgiveness and reconciliation with one another before presenting our offerings to the Lord.
