# Matthew 5:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Acts of love and friendship are more important than religious rituals like sacrifices. Even if you have gifts to offer or prayers to make, they will be worthless if you harbor ill feelings towards others. Reconciliation with others is crucial because sacrifices offered out of anger or without a spirit of forgiveness are unacceptable to God. It is vital to seek reconciliation before offering any sacrifices, as even the act of giving a gift cannot justify the absence of love.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The meaning evidently is—not, 'dismiss from thine own breast all ill feeling,' but 'get thy brother to dismiss from his mind all grudge against thee.'" 
2. "What then? Is he to say, As soon as I have offered this gift I will go straight to my brother, and make it up with him? Nay; but before another step is taken—even before the offering is presented—this reconciliation is to be sought, though the gift have to be left unoffered before the altar."
3. "And when ye stand praying (in the very act), forgive, if ye have aught (of just complaint) against any; that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses. But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive you."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Get reconciled (ingressive aorist, take the initiative)." 
2. "The verb denotes mutual concession after mutual hostility, an idea absent from καταλλασσω." 
3. "This because of δια (two, between two)."

### John Gill:
1. "This shows that acts of love and friendship are preferable to sacrifices."
2. "Sacrifices offered up in wrath, and whilst unreconciled to others, are unacceptable to God, and of no avail."
3. "He was to use all means to obtain a reconciliation."

### John Wesley:
1. Leaving thy gift, go — For neither thy gift nor thy prayer will atone for thy want of love: but this will make them both an abomination before God.
