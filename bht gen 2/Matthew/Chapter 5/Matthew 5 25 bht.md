# Matthew 5:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is prudent to find a resolution with someone we have offended rather than going to court. It is essential to reconcile with others before facing judgment before God. When we have wronged someone, they have the right to make a claim against us and act as a law unto us. We should settle our disputes with them before it escalates to legal intervention.
