# Matthew 5:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Verily, I say unto thee, this can be relied upon, as you will never be able to fully pay the debt. The concept of the last farthing symbolizes the eternal nature of the burden you carry. It is worth noting that the earlier teachings emphasized meekness, while the subsequent teachings shift the focus towards the importance of having a pure heart.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "These words, which in the earthly example imply future liberation, because an earthly debt can be paid in most cases, so in the spiritual counterpart amount to a negation of it, because the debt can never be discharged."
2. "If we are called on to assign a meaning to ·ΩëœÄŒ∑œÅŒ≠œÑŒ∑œÇ in the interpretation, it must represent the chief of those who in ch. Matthew 18:34, are hinted at by Œ≤Œ±œÉŒ±ŒΩŒπœÉœÑŒ±ŒØ, viz. the great enemy, the minister of the divine wrath."
3. "Œ∫ŒøŒ¥œÅŒ¨ŒΩœÑŒ∑ŒΩ, quadrantem, a Latin word (= ŒªŒµœÄœÑœåŒΩ in [48] Luke), the fourth part of an as."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In expounding the sixth commandment, I have spoken of offenses between man and man...assuring you that all worship offered to the Searcher of hearts by one who knows that a brother has just cause of complaint against him, and yet takes no steps to remove it, is vain." 
2. "But I cannot pass from this subject without reminding you of One whose cause of complaint against you is far more deadly than any that man can have against man... make up the quarrel without delay, lest sentence of condemnation be pronounced upon you, and then will execution straightway follow, from the effects of which you shall never escape as long as any remnant of the offense remains unexpiated."
3. "It may safely be said that the unending duration of future punishment... is the only doctrine with which His language here quite naturally and fully accords."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Reconciliation with an offended brother in this life is absolutely necessary before his wrong cry against us to the Great Judge, and we be cast into eternal condemnation."
2. "The warning against law-suits is evident enough, but is not the principal thought."
3. "The main idea is the inexorable rigor of divine justice against the impenitent sinner."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The last farthing...a vivid picture of inevitable punishment for debt."
2. "This is emphasized by the strong double negative ŒøœÖ ŒºŒ∑ with the aorist subjunctive."

### John Gill:
1. "Verily, I say unto thee,.... This may be depended upon, you may assure yourself of it..."
2. "till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing, or 'last farthing';...seems to express the inexorableness of the creditor..."
3. "the impossibility of the debtor's release."

### John Wesley:
1. "Till thou hast paid the last farthing ‚Äî That is, for ever, since thou canst never do this."
