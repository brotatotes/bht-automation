# Matthew 5:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Thou shalt not commit adultery is not limited to the physical act of adultery alone, as the scribes and Pharisees believed. Our Lord Jesus clarifies that the law of God goes beyond mere external actions, but also examines the purity and integrity of our hearts. In fact, He challenges us to be willing to give up anything, no matter how dear or useful, if it leads us into sin. The commandments of God are not to be taken lightly, and Jesus emphasizes the importance of wholehearted obedience, even to the point of radical self-sacrifice.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Thou shall not commit adultery—Interpreting this seventh, as they did the sixth commandment, the traditional perverters of the law restricted the breach of it to acts of criminal intercourse between, or with, married persons exclusively."
2. "Our Lord now dissipates such delusions."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ proceeds with his subject, and shows, that the law of God not only has authority over the life, in a political view, to form the outward manners, but that it requires pure and holy affections of the heart."
2. "He has already told us, that he did not come as a new Legislator, but as the faithful expounder of a law which had been already given."
3. "Christ expressly admits this, but meets it by saying, that the antiquity of an error ought not to be allowed to plead in its favor."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "These quotations from the Decalogue are from the Septuagint and use ου and the future indicative (volitive future, common Greek idiom)."

3. "In Matthew 5:41 the third person singular second aorist active imperative is used."

### John Gill:
1. "The meaning of our Lord is, not that the then present Jews had heard that such a law had been delivered 'to the ancients', their fathers, at Mount Sinai; for that they could read in their Bibles." 
2. "They had received it by tradition, that the sense of it, which had been given to their ancestors, by the ancient doctors of the church, was, that this law is to be taken strictly, as it lies, and only regards the sin of uncleanness in married persons."
3. "It had no respect to fornication, or unchaste thoughts, words, or actions, but that single act only."

### John Wesley:
1. "Thou shalt not commit adultery — And this, as well as the sixth commandment, the scribes and Pharisees interpreted barely of the outward act."
