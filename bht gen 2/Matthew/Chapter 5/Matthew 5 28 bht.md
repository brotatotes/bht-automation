# Matthew 5:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Looking upon a woman is not inherently sinful, but Jesus warns about looking with lustful intent, for this is already committing adultery in one's heart. The religious leaders of the time were known to obsess over minor matters of the law while neglecting weightier issues. They would even refuse to save a drowning woman, claiming it was unlawful to look at her, showing their distorted priorities regarding sin. Some even took it to the extreme, equating intentional lustful looks with actual physical adultery. These commentaries shed light on the deeper meaning behind Jesus' teaching on adultery.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Our Lord is speaking of the sin of adultery, and therefore...the direct assertion in this verse must be understood as applying to the cases where this sin is in question." 
2. "The gazing with a view to feed that desire...affirms that the man who can do this has already in his heart passed the barrier of criminal intention; made up his mind, stifled his conscience; in thought, committed the deed." 
3. "Perhaps there is justice in Stier's remark, that our Lord speaks here after the O.T. usage, in which, both in the seventh commandment...adultery also includes fornication."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her—with the intent to do so, as the same expression is used in...", clearly extending the range of this commandment to all forms of impurity.
2. "...the counsels which follow...seem to confirm this."
3. "As in dealing with the sixth commandment our Lord first expounds it, and then in the four following verses applies His exposition, so here He first expounds the seventh commandment, and then in the four following verses applies His exposition."

### John Calvin:
1. "He says, that not only those who have seduced their neighbors’ wives, but those who have polluted their eyes by an immodest look, are adulterers before God."
2. "This teaches us also, that not only those who form a deliberate purpose of fornication, but those who admit any polluted thoughts, are reckoned adulterers before God."


### Philip Schaff:
1. "Our Lord declares, not that such an one shall be condemned, but that in his heart he has committed the sin."
2. "Adultery of the heart, and of the eye, desecrate the temple of the Holy Spirit; how much more adultery in deed."
3. "A woman may mean a ‘wife,’ but the widest sense is not inappropriate."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In his heart. Not just the centre of the blood circulation though it means that. Not just the emotional part of man's nature, but here the inner man including the intellect, the affections, the will."
2. "This word is exceedingly common in the New Testament and repays careful study always. It is from a root that means to quiver or palpitate."
3. "Jesus locates adultery in the eye and heart before the outward act. Wunsche (Beitrage) quotes two pertinent rabbinical sayings as translated by Bruce: 'The eye and the heart are the two brokers of sin.' 'Passions lodge only in him who sees.' Hence the peril of lewd pictures and plays to the pure."

### John Gill:
1. "It was not any looking upon a woman, that is forbid by Christ as criminal; but so to look, as 'to lust after her'; for such an one hath committed adultery with her already in his heart."
2. "They usually did what our Lord observes, 'strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel'. We read in the Talmud of חסיד שוטה, a 'foolish saint' and it is asked, who is he? and it is answered, one that sees a woman drowning in a river, and says it is not lawful for me לאיסתכולי בה, 'to look' upon her, and deliver her."
3. "Some of them have gone so far as to say that 'everyone that looks upon a woman בכוונה, with intention, it is all one as if he lay with her.' And that נואף בעיניו נקרא נואף, 'he that committeth adultery with his eyes, is called an adulterer'."
