# Matthew 5:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Whoever looks upon women must be careful because it can lead to transgression. However, this doesn't necessarily mean one must literally pluck out their eye when tempted, as it would be sinful to mutilate the body. Instead, it would be more beneficial to give up the carnal pleasures of the eye to avoid exposing oneself to eternal destruction in the fire of hell.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "An admonition, arising out of the truth announced in the last verse, to withstand the first springs and occasions of evil desire, even by the sacrifice of what is most useful and dear to us."
2. "We may observe here, that our Lord grounds His precept of the most rigid and decisive self-denial on the considerations of the truest self-interest, συμφέρελ σοι."
3. "ἵνα belongs to συμφ. σοι (see Joh 16:7); and not (Meyer) to the foregoing, making συμφ. γάρ σοι parenthetical."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And if thy right eye—the readier and the dearer of the two. offend thee—be a 'trap spring,' or as in the New Testament, be 'an occasion of stumbling' to thee. pluck it out and cast it from thee—implying a certain indignant promptitude, heedless of whatever cost to feeling the act may involve."
2. "For as one might put out his eyes without in the least quenching the lust to which they ministered, so, 'if thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light,' and, when directed by a holy mind, becomes an 'instrument of righteousness unto God.'"
3. "He who despises the warning to cast from him, with indignant promptitude, an offending member, will find his whole body 'cast,' with a retributive promptitude of indignation, 'into hell.' Sharp language, this, from the lips of Love incarnate!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "An evil eye denotes sometimes envy and sometimes an evil passion."
2. "The right eye and hand are mentioned because they are of most use to us, and denote that, however strong the passion may be, or difficult to part with, yet that we should do it."
3. "It is better to deny yourself the gratification of an evil passion here, however much it may cost you than to go down to hell forever."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Rev., by restoring the picture in the word, restores its true meaning, causeth to stumble."
2. "Christ's meaning here is: 'If your eye or your hand serve as an obstacle or trap to ensnare or make you fall in your moral walk.'"
3. "He who, when his eye proves a stumbling-block, takes care not to see, does in reality blind himself."

### John Calvin:
1. "However difficult, or severe, or troublesome, or harsh, any commandment of God may be, yet no excuse ought to be pleaded on those grounds, because the justice of God ought to stand higher in our estimation, than all that we reckon most precious and valuable."
2. "You have no right to object to me, that you can scarcely turn your eyes in any direction, without being suddenly drawn away by some temptation: for you ought rather to part with your eyes, than to depart from the commandments of God."
3. "Whatever hinders us from yielding that obedience to God which he requires in his law, ought to be cut off."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We should resist 'the first springs and occasions of evil desire, even by the sacrifice of what is most useful and dear to us.'" 
2. "The surgeon does not hesitate to amputate a limb, if he hopes thereby to save a life; no earthly sacrifice is too great where eternal life is concerned."

### John Gill:
1. "whoever looks upon women, at the end comes into the hands of transgression." 
2. "pluck it out, and cast it from thee: which is not to be understood literally; for no man is obliged to mutilate any part of his body, to prevent sin, or on account of the commission of it; this is no where required, and if done, would be sinful."
3. "it will turn to better account, to lose all the carnal pleasures of the eye, or all those pleasing sights, which are grateful to a carnal heart, than, by enjoying them, to expose the whole man, body and soul, to everlasting destruction, in the fire of hell."
