# Matthew 5:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Blessed are the poor in spirit refers to those who are humble and recognize their spiritual poverty. It is not about being poor in material possessions but about acknowledging our need for God. These individuals place themselves at the door of mercy, seeking God's forgiveness and grace. The kingdom of heaven is not about earthly achievements or possessions; it is about experiencing the reign of God in our hearts and lives. True blessedness comes from humbly surrendering ourselves to God, seeking His forgiveness, and relying on His grace.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Blessed are the poor in spirit - The word 'blessed' means 'happy,' referring to that which produces felicity, from whatever quarter it may come." 
2. "To be poor in spirit is to have a humble opinion of ourselves; to be sensible that we are sinners, and have no righteousness of our own; to be willing to be saved only by the rich grace and mercy of God; to be willing to be where God places us, to bear what he lays on us, to go where he bids us, and to die when he commands; to be willing to be in his hands, and to feel that we deserve no favor from him." 
3. "Jesus overlooked all those things, and fixed his eye on the poor and the humble, and said that happiness was to be found in the lowly vale of poverty more than in the pomp and splendors of life."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The biblical use of the word [blessed] lifted it into the region of the spiritual, as distinguished from the merely intellectual, and besides, intrusted to it alone the task of representing this higher conception."
2. "While the pagan word carries the isolation of the virtuous and the contraction of human sympathy, the Gospel pushes these out with an ideal of a world-wide sympathy and of a happiness realized in ministry."
3. "The Christian word blessed is full of the light of heaven. It sternly throws away from itself every hint of the Stoic's asserted right of suicide as a refuge from human ills, and emphasizes something which thrives on trial and persecution, which glories in tribulation, which not only endures but conquers to world, and expects its crown in heaven."

### John Calvin:
1. "But Christ pronounces those to be happy who, chastened and subdued by afflictions, submit themselves wholly to God, and, with inward humility, betake themselves to him for protection."
2. "Others explain the poor in spirit to be those who claim nothing for themselves, and are even so completely emptied of confidence in the flesh, that they acknowledge their poverty."
3. "We see that Christ does not swell the minds of his own people by any unfounded belief, or harden them by unfeeling obstinacy, as the Stoics do, but leads them to entertain the hope of eternal life, and animates them to patience by assuring them, that in this way they will pass into the heavenly kingdom of God."

2. "If you know these things, happy (ŒºŒ±Œ∫Œ±œÅŒπŒø) are you if you do them."
