# Matthew 5:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During the time of Jesus, there were varying views on divorce, with some interpreting the law to allow divorce for trivial reasons. Jesus addressed this by stressing that divorce should not be taken lightly and that it went against God's original intention for marriage. He acknowledged that the writing of divorcement provided some protection for the dismissed wife, but also emphasized the importance of upholding the sanctity of marriage. Jesus sought to counter the lax attitudes towards divorce and remind people that it was not meant to be a means of indulging selfish desires, but rather a sacred commitment.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The law of divorceâ€”according to its strictness or laxityâ€”has so intimate a bearing upon purity in the married life, that nothing could be more natural than to pass from the seventh commandment to the loose views on that subject then current."
2. "The one legitimate ground of divorce allowed by the enactment just quoted was 'some uncleanness'â€”in other words, conjugal infidelity. But while one school of interpreters (that of SHAMMAI) explained this quite correctly, as prohibiting divorce in every case save that of adultery, another school (that of HILLEL) stretched the expression so far as to include everything in the wife offensive or disagreeable to the husbandâ€”a view of the law too well fitted to minister to caprice and depraved inclination not to find extensive favor."
3. "It was to meet this that our Lord uttered what follows."

### John Calvin:
1. "Hence proceeded the error, that there was nothing wrong in such putting away, provided that the forms of law were observed."
2. "Christ admonishes us not to conclude, that what is allowed by the national law of Moses is, on that account, lawful in the sight of God."
3. "An exception is added, except on account of fornication: for the woman, who has basely violated the marriage-vow, is justly cast off; because it was by her fault that the tie was broken, and the husband set at liberty."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Loose notions about divorce indicate and increase unchastity."
2. "Our Lord says... that even this precept was owing to the hardness of their hearts."
3. "The writing of divorcement, designed not to encourage divorce, but to render it more difficult, was in effect a protection of the repudiated wife."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A writing of divorcement, 'a divorce certificate'... 'a written notice of divorce'... The written notice was a protection to the wife against an angry whim of the husband who might send her away with no paper to show for it."

### John Gill:
1. "This was not debated by them of old time, but was a new thing, just started in the time of Christ."
2. "For though a wife was obtained by several ways, there was but one way of dismissing her, as the Jews observe."
3. "This bill being written in twelve lines, neither more nor less, and being sealed by the husband, and signed by the witnesses, was delivered, either by him, or by a messenger, or deputy of his or hers, into her hand, lap, or bosom, in the presence of two persons."

### John Wesley:
1. "Let him give her a writing of divorce â€” Which the scribes and Pharisees allowed men to do on any trifling occasion."
2. "Deuteronomy 24:1, Matthew 19:7, Mark 10:2, and Luke 16:18."
