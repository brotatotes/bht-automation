# Matthew 5:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ clarifies that divorce is not meant for trivial reasons, but rather for cases of serious sexual immorality. However, if a man divorces his wife for this reason and she remarries, then he becomes the cause of her adultery. This reveals the importance of faithfulness and commitment in marriage, emphasizing the gravity of breaking the marriage covenant.
