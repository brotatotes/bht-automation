# Matthew 5:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our Lord teaches us that swearing by any creature and in our everyday conversation is forbidden. The scribes and Pharisees, however, falsely taught that this type of swearing was innocent. They failed to see God in all things and did not understand the purity of heart that comes from truly seeing Him. We must not fall into the same error, but strive to live in a way that reflects our promise to the Lord and His commandments.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This is plain from what follows." 
2. "But so narrow was the circle of them that a man might swear, says LIGHTFOOT, a hundred thousand times and yet not be guilty of vain swearing."

### Albert Barnes:

3. "Our Saviour here evidently had no reference to judicial oaths, or oaths taken in a court of justice. It was merely the foolish and wicked habit of swearing in private conversation; of swearing on every occasion and by everything that he condemned."

### John Calvin:
1. "The man who perjures himself is not the only person who takes the name of God in vain... He does so, who idly and contemptuously pronounces the name of God on trivial occasions, or in ordinary conversation." 
2. "Christ reproves this gross error of supposing that they might, without danger, abuse the name of God, provided they did not swear falsely."

2. "The twofold mistake of the Jews, answered by our Lord: that only false swearing, and swearing by the name of God, were forbidden."
3. "They probably considered no oaths binding, save those in which the name of God occurred; this error, though not mentioned, is necessarily opposed."

### John Gill:
1. "Thou shalt not forswear thyself": and is the law forbidding perjury, or false swearing; and was what the Jews were chiefly, if not only concerned about; little regarding the vanity, only the truth of an oath.
2. "For they took swearing vainly, to be the same as swearing falsely; wherefore so long as what they swore was truth, they were not careful whether it was of any importance or not."
3. "Moreover, these men sinned, in that they swore by the creatures, which they thought they might do, and not sin; and when they had so done, were not under obligation to perform; because they made no use of the name of God, to whom only vows and oaths were to be performed."

### John Wesley:
1. "Our Lord here refers to the promise made to the pure in heart of seeing God in all things, and points out a false doctrine of the scribes, which arose from their not thus seeing God."
2. "What he forbids is, the swearing at all, 1, by any creature, 2, in our ordinary conversation: both of which the scribes and Pharisees taught to be perfectly innocent."
