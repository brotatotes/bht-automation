# Matthew 5:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus instructs us to refrain from swearing altogether, including rash vows made about insignificant matters and oaths that involve creatures. Swearing by heaven, for instance, does not constitute a valid oath since it does not invoke the sacred name of God. The rationale behind this prohibition lies in the fact that heaven is God's throne, and to use it in vain is a transgression. By recklessly swearing and indirectly invoking God through these oaths, people commit a twofold offense: speaking trivially about what is sacred and dragging God into their hasty and empty promises.
