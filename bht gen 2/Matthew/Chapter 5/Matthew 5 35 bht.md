# Matthew 5:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We are reminded that God's authority is not dependent on the earth, for it is His footstool according to Isaiah 66:1. The earth serves as a manifestation of His glory and a creation of His hands. Furthermore, Jerusalem, being the city of the great King, holds a significant religious importance as the dwelling place of the Lord. This highlights the reverence and respect owed to God in oaths taken in relation to these earthly entities.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Nor by the earth. In this case also, the oath, if not senseless, would derive its validity from the relation of the earth to God."
2. "By Jerusalem, or, strictly, 'towards,' turning towards it, as in praying. Any solemnity attending this oath, came from the fact that it was the city of the great; where the temple stood, the seat of the special religious government Jehovah had established over Israel."

### John Gill:
1. "The earth is God's footstool, referring, as before, to Isaiah 66:1 on which he treads; and where he also manifests forth his glory, and is a considerable part of the work of his hands."
2. "The reason given for prohibiting this kind of oath is; for it is the city of the great king: not of David, but of the King of kings, the Lord of hosts."
