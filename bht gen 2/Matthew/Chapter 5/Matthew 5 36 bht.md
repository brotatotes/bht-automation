# Matthew 5:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Swearing by one's own head or by the color of one's hair is condemned because these things are not within human control; they belong to God. The appearance of grey hairs on one's head is not something that can be manipulated. In swearing by one's own head, one is essentially making an appeal to the life that God has given, as the author of life. Thus, it is improper and profane to pledge what ultimately belongs to God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Thou hast no control over the appearance of grey hairs on thy head thy head is not thine own." 
2. "Every oath is an appeal to God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black."
2. "In the other oaths specified, God's name was profaned quite as really as if His name had been uttered... But in swearing by our own head and the like, the objection lies in their being 'beyond our control'."
3. "And therefore profanely assumed to have a stability which they have not."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To swear by the head was the same as to swear by the life; or to say, I will forfeit my life if what I say is not true."
2. "God is the Author of the life, and to swear by that, therefore, is the same as to swear by him."
3. "You have no control or right over your own life. You cannot even change one single hair. God has all that control; and it is therefore improper and profane to pledge what is God’s gift and God’s property; and it is the same as swearing by God himself."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "No man can create a hair of his head, or even transform its color; what solemnity, then, in such an oath."
2. "To swear by what is under God’s control alone, is to swear by Him, and that in a very roundabout and senseless way."
3. "The Orientals today are fearfully profane, swearing continually, by the heart, their life, the temple, or the church."

### John Gill:
1. "Neither shalt thou swear by thy head... because thou canst not make one hair white or black." 
2. "This form of swearing is condemned... a man's head, nor, indeed, one hair of his head, is in his own power, and therefore he ought not to swear by it."
3. "He ought not to swear by heaven, or earth, or Jerusalem, because these were in the possession of God."

### John Wesley:
1. For thou canst not make one hair white or black — Whereby it appears, that this also is not thine but God's.
