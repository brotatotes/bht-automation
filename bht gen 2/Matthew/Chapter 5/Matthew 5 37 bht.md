# Matthew 5:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The call to simplicity and integrity in our speech is clear in this passage. We are urged to let our yes be yes and our no be no. This means that our words should be sincere and trustworthy, without the need for excessive oaths or embellishments. The use of profanity and deceitful speech only reveals a corruption of the heart. Instead, our conversation should be characterized by honesty and straightforwardness, so that our words carry weight and convey truth.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Let these words only be used, and they in simplicity and unreservedness."
2. "The evil of man's corrupt nature is in Scripture spoken of as the work of ·ΩÅ œÄŒøŒΩŒ∑œÅœåœÇ, and is itself œÑ·Ω∏ œÄŒøŒΩŒ∑œÅœåŒΩ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Let a simple Yes and No suffice in affirming the truth or the untruth of anything."
2. "The untruthfulness of our corrupt nature shows itself not only in the tendency to deviate from the strict truth, but in the disposition to suspect others of doing the same."
3. "The practice of going beyond Yes and No in affirmations and denials‚Äîas if our word for it were not enough, and we expected others to question it‚Äîsprings from that vicious root of untruthfulness which is only aggravated by the very effort to clear ourselves of the suspicion of it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Profane swearing is always the evidence of a depraved heart. To trifle with the name of God, or with any of his works, is itself most decided proof of depravity."
2. "No man is believed any sooner in common conversation because he swears to a thing. When we hear a man swear to a thing, it is pretty good evidence that he knows what he is saying to be false, and we should be on our guard."
3. "Profaneness does no one any good. Nobody is the richer, or wiser, or happier for it. It helps no one‚Äôs morals or manners. It commends no one to any society."

### John Calvin:
1. "But your speech shall be, Yes, yes; No, no Christ now prescribes, in the second place, a remedy; which is, that men act towards each other sincerely and honestly: for then simplicity of speech will have quite as much weight as an oath has among those who are not sincere."
2. "Whence comes the great propensity to swearing, but from the great falsehood, the numerous impositions, the unsteady and light conduct, so that hardly anything is believed?"
3. "Fairness and honesty in our words are, therefore, demanded by Christ, that there may be no longer any occasion for an oath."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The true oath consists in the simple asseveration uttered under a sense of the presence of God, before Him, and in Him."
2. "All strengthening of simple yea and nay is occasioned by the presence of sin, and the power of Satan, in the world."
3. "There is no more striking proof of the existence of evil than the prevalence of the foolish, low, useless habit of profanity."

### John Gill:
1. "A righteous man's yea, is yea, and his no, is no; his word is sufficient."
2. "The Jews have no reason to reject this advice of Christ, who often use and recommend the same modes of expression."
3. "Whatever exceeds this way of speaking and conversation, in the common affairs of life, is either from the devil, who is the evil one, by way of eminency; or from the evil heart of man, from the pride, malice, envy, &c. that are in it."

### John Wesley:
1. Let your conversation be yea, yea; nay, nay ‚Äî That is, in your common discourse, barely affirm or deny.
