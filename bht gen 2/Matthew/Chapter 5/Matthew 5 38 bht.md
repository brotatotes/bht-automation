# Matthew 5:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is important to understand that the phrase an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth was originally intended as a judicial rule, guiding judges in determining appropriate punishments for offenses. However, over time, it had been distorted to justify personal revenge. Jesus challenges this interpretation, emphasizing the need for meekness and love even in the face of persecution. Rather than seeking violent retribution, we are called to respond with gentleness and forgiveness, reflecting the righteousness of God.
