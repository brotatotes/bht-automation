# Matthew 5:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We must not seek revenge or repay evil with evil. Instead, when faced with an offense, it is better to turn the other cheek, choosing to suffer the damage and not engage in a rigorous pursuit of retribution. By doing so, we demonstrate our willingness to absorb the wrongdoing rather than perpetuating a cycle of harm. This approach is in stark contrast to the prevailing mindset of demanding an eye for an eye, as it requires us to bear bodily wrongs and give up material possessions rather than seeking retaliation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Taken slavishly and literally, neither did our Lord Himself conform to this precept, nor his Apostles."
2. "But truly, and in the spirit, our blessed Redeemer obeyed it; ‘He gave his back to the smiters, and his cheeks to them that plucked off the hair, and hid not his face from shame and spitting’."
3. "Or, perhaps, in the indefinite sense, as before, evil, generally, 'when thus directed against thee.' Only, the other possible meaning there, 'the evil one,' is precluded here."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Our Lord's own meek, yet dignified bearing, when smitten rudely on the cheek (John 18:22; John 18:23), and not literally presenting the other, is the best comment on these words."
2. "It is the preparedness, after one indignity, not to invite but to submit meekly to another, without retaliation, which this strong language is meant to convey."

### John Calvin:
1. "We must attend to the contrast between the vice and the correction of it." 
2. "The amount of the whole admonition is, that believers should learn to forget the wrongs that have been done them, — that they should not, when injured, break out into hatred or ill-will, or wish to commit an injury on their part, — but that, the more the obstinacy and rage of wicked men was excited and inflamed, they should be the more fully disposed to exercise patience."
3. "Unquestionably, Christ did not intend to exhort his people to whet the malice of those, whose propensity to injure others is sufficiently strong: and if they were to turn to them the other cheek, what would it be but holding out such an encouragement?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Our Lord refers to sin and evil in the world, which is conquered by wise Christian submission rather than by strenuous resistance."
2. "Christian love must make us bear twice as much as the world, in its injustice, could demand."
3. "This neither justifies the world in its demand, nor requires passive non-resistance, since the example of Christ and His Apostles show that there is a time for standing upon our rights."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "One thing certainly is meant by Jesus and that is that personal revenge is taken out of our hands, and that applies to 'lynch-law.'"
2. "Aggressive or offensive war by nations is also condemned, but not necessarily defensive war or defense against robbery and murder."
3. "Professional pacifism may be mere cowardice."

### John Gill:
1. "We must not render evil for evil, or repay him in the same way."
2. "But whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also: which is to be understood comparatively, rather than seek revenge."
3. "Directly contrary to the Jewish canons, which require, in such a case, a pecuniary fine."

### John Wesley:
1. "Return not evil for evil: yea, turn to him the other - Rather than revenge thyself."
2. "Where the damage is not great, choose rather to suffer it, though possibly it may on that account be repeated, than to demand an eye for an eye, to enter into a rigorous prosecution of the offender."
3. "Rather than return evil for evil, when the wrong is purely personal, submit to one bodily wrong after another, give up one part of your goods after another, submit to one instance of compulsion after another."
