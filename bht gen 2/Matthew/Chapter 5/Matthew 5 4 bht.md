# Matthew 5:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Blessed are those who mourn, as they experience both the sorrow of their own sins and the sins of others, which leads to a constant seriousness in their spiritual life. In their mourning, they find comfort not only in the present, where the consolation of God overpowers their grief, but also in the future, as they can look forward to an eternal comfort that comes from uninterrupted communion with God.
