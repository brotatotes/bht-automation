# Matthew 5:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If someone is demanding your coat or outer garment, it is often wiser to let them take it and avoid engaging in a contentious argument. Instead of holding onto material possessions, it is better to maintain peace and not hinder the other person from taking what they believe they are entitled to. Remember, even the poor should be treated with respect and dignity, for they too are children of God.
