# Matthew 5:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When faced with requests for help, we should be openhearted and generous, giving and lending to others according to our abilities and the extent of their need. It is important not to be selective in our acts of kindness, but to extend our charity to all those in need, without discrimination. However, we must also exercise discernment and wisdom, being mindful of our own responsibilities and limitations. Luke 6:30 reminds us to give and lend, but within the boundaries of our obligations to creditors, family, and fellow believers.

3. "To give every thing to every one [...] would be to act as the enemy of others and ourselves. Ours should be a higher and deeper charity, flowing from those inner springs of love, which are the sources of outward actions sometimes widely divergent; whence may arise both the timely concession, and the timely refusal."

2. "Christ affirms that when, in lending or doing other kind offices, we look to the mutual reward, we perform no part of our duty to God. He thus draws a distinction between charity and carnal friendship."
