# Matthew 5:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The command to love our neighbor was given by God Himself in Leviticus 19:18. However, the scribes added their own interpretation by instructing people to hate their enemies. This distorted view of love and hate led them to believe that loving their neighbor meant hating their enemy. But it is important to note that this addition was not from God, but rather a detestable gloss made by the corrupt teachers. True love extends beyond individuals and even nations, as Jesus teaches us to love all mankind, including those who oppose or persecute us.
