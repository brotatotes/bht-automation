# Matthew 5:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In order to continue to be recognized as true children of God, it is important for us to imitate our heavenly Father by treating others with love and kindness, even our enemies. God bestows blessings upon all, whether they are grateful or undeserving. However, it is crucial to note that spiritual blessings are only received by those who are willing to receive them.
