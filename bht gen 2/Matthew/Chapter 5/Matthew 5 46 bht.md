# Matthew 5:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our Lord speaks about the importance of love that goes beyond the ordinary. He emphasizes that simply loving those who love us is not enough. Even the despised tax collectors, who were known for their corrupt practices, were capable of such love. This challenges us to extend our love to those who may be considered unlovable, showing a higher form of love that transcends societal norms. This call to love unconditionally reflects the true nature of Christ's teachings and sets believers apart from the world.

### Henry Alford:
1. "Manifesta est ratio cur Dominus jusserit ἀγαπᾷν τοὺς ἐχθρούς, non autem φιλεῖν. Nam φιλεῖν, amare, pessimum quemque vir honestus non potest: sed poterit eum tamen ἀγαπᾷν, i.e. bene ei cupere et facere, quippe homo homini, cui etiam Deus benefaciat." 
2. "Amor imperari non potest, sed dilectio: dilectio humanitatis est, amor eorum tantum, quibus eadem mens est, idem animus."
3. "These τελῶναι or ἐθνικοί, men of this world, actuated by worldly motives, 'what thank have ye in being like them?'"

2. "Do you deserve any thanks for your love now? none at all, it is what you are obliged to by your friend's love to you."
3. "Now our Lord instances in these men who were the most profligate part of the nation, and had in greatest contempt by the rest; and yet these, by the very dictates of nature, loved such as loved them."
