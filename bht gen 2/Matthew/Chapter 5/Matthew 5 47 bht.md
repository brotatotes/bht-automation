# Matthew 5:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our Lord urges his followers to go beyond the narrow mentality of only greeting their own kind. He points out that even the worst individuals, like the tax collectors, would do the same. Christians should strive to show a different spirit, treating even their enemies with kindness. Instead of dividing ourselves into factions, let us embrace our brothers and sisters in Christ, regardless of their affiliations or beliefs. May this reminder resonate with us and drive us towards greater unity in the Church.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1.  47.   ἀσπάσησθε ] Here, most probably in its literal sense. Jews did not salute Gentiles: Mohammedans do not salute Christians even now in the East.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And if ye salute your brethren only—of the same nation and religion with yourselves. what do ye more than others?" 
2. "Do not even the publicans so?" 
3. "The true reading here appears to be, 'Do not even the heathens the same?'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Saviour says that the worst men, the very publicans, would do this."
2. "Christians should do more; they should show that they have a different spirit; they should treat their 'enemies' as well as wicked people do their 'friends.'"
3. "This should be done."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Jews, despising the Gentiles, did not usually salute them. The morality of the Pharisees is proved to be, in this respect, no better than that of the heathen."
2. "The same idea is repeated here, except that heathen is substituted for ‘publicans, according to the best authorities."
3. "The same. This is correct here; in Matthew 5:46 it is doubtful whether we should read ‘so ‘or ‘the same.’"

### John Gill:
1. "The persons they usually gave their salutations to were those of their own nation, their countrymen, relations, and friends; and who are here designed by 'brethren'; meaning, not brethren in the strict sense, but any kindred, acquaintance, or any of their own nation."
2. "They were not very free in saluting any persons, as strangers and Gentiles... even a Gentile in the streets."
3. "What great matter was this to salute their brethren and their friends, when even the very Heathens, who had nothing but the light of nature to guide them, did the same?"

### John Wesley:
1. "Our Lord probably glances at those prejudices, which different sects had against each other, and intimates, that he would not have his followers imbibe that narrow spirit."
2. "Would to God this had been more attended to among the unhappy divisions and subdivisions, into which his Church has been crumbled!"
3. "And that we might at least advance so far, as cordially to embrace our brethren in Christ, of whatever party or denomination they are!"
