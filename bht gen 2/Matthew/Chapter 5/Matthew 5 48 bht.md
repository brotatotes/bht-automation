# Matthew 5:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Therefore, as Christians, our aim should be to reflect the perfection and holiness of our Heavenly Father. This perfection does not imply that we can reach the same level of love as God, but rather that we strive to imitate His character of sincerity, uprightness, and kindness towards others. Our Lord, in His wisdom, emphasizes the importance of this perfection in both the pursuit of happiness and the fulfillment of His commandments. Let us, therefore, seek to embody the love and righteousness of our Heavenly Father in all aspects of our lives.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Often people are most happy in poverty, in sickness, in persecution, when supported by the presence and promises of a merciful God."
2. "True enjoyment is found in meekness, peace, calmness, and benevolence. In such a firmness, and steadiness, and dependence on God as to keep the soul unruffled in the midst of provocation, is happiness."
3. "If there is any one sentiment of most value for the comfort, the character, the virtuous sociability of the young - one that will shed the greatest charm over society, and make it the most pure, it is that which inculcates 'perfect delicacy' and 'purity' in the contact of the sexes."

### John Calvin:
1. "However distant we are from the perfection of God, we are said to be perfect, as he is perfect, when we aim at the same object, which he presents to us in Himself."
2. "The perfection of God means, first, that free and pure kindness, which is not induced by the expectation of gain; — and, secondly, that remarkable goodness, which contends with the malice and ingratitude of men."
3. "This appears more clearly from the words of Luke, Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful: for mercy is contrasted with a mercenary regard, which is founded on private advantage."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The first reference is to completeness in love to others; to an all embracing, instead of a narrow, exclusive affection."
2. "We may then accept the correctness of the ordinary view, which understood the verse as setting up our heavenly Father as the ultimate standard of our morality and holiness."
3. "Christ alone can really give us such instruction, since He alone by life and death shows the perfection of God in man."

2. "The word is used also for relative perfection as of adults compared with children."

### John Gill:
1. "Be ye therefore perfect, as your Father,.... This perfection is to be restrained to the subject Christ is upon, love to men, and not to be referred to any, or every other thing."
2. "That is to say, not that men may, or can, or ought to be as perfect in love, as to the degree of it, as God is; that is impossible: the 'as' here, is not a note of equality, but of likeness."
3. "To be 'perfect,' is to be sincere and upright: in this sense is the word often used, and answers to the Hebrew word תמים, which signifies the same."

### John Wesley:
1. "Therefore ye shall be perfect; as your Father who is in heaven is perfect" - So the original runs, referring to all that holiness which is described in the foregoing verses, which our Lord in the beginning of the chapter recommends as happiness, and in the close of it as perfection.
2. "And how wise and gracious is this, to sum up, and, as it were, seal all his commandments with a promise!" - He well knew how ready our unbelief would be to cry out, this is impossible! And therefore stakes upon it all the power, truth, and faithfulness of him to whom all things are possible.
