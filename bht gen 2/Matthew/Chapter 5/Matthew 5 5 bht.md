# Matthew 5:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Blessed are the meek, those who patiently endure and respond with gentleness to mistreatment and offenses. Their meekness is rooted in humility, recognizing their own limitations and the greatness of God. This meekness is not weakness, but a display of strength and self-control. The meek will inherit the earth, not only enjoying the blessings of this life but also receiving the promises of God's eternal kingdom. Their inheritance extends beyond mere possessions and encompasses the peace and contentment that comes from a heart set on God. In their meekness, they find true fulfillment and an enduring legacy.
