# Matthew 5:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Blessed are the merciful, those who are not only willing to provide material assistance to those in need but also offer comfort and support through their words. It is not solely about giving out of abundance, but also about expressing heartfelt compassion, even if one has nothing material to offer. The act of showing mercy to others reflects our likeness to God and His nature of being loving and compassionate. In this way, by displaying mercy towards others, we become vessels through which God's mercy can flow, both from fellow humans and from God Himself.
