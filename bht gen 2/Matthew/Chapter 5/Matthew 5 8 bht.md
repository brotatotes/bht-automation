The pure in heart refers to those who are sanctified and love God with all their hearts. They are the ones who will see God not only in all things in this life but also in glory in the hereafter. This emphasizes the importance of inner purity and devotion to God, as it leads to a deeper and more intimate relationship with Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is no Levitical cleanness, nor mere moral purity, that is here meant: but that inner purity, which is brought about by faith, has its fruit in love."
2. "The καθ . τῇ κ . are οἱ ῥεραντισμένοι τὰς καρδίας ἀπὸ συνειδήσεως πονηρᾶς."
3. "But there is also allusion to the nearer vision of God attained by progressive sanctification."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The inward vision thus clarified, and the whole inner man in sympathy with God, each looks upon the other with complacency and joy, and we are 'changed into the same image from glory to glory.'"
2. "Then shall His servants serve Him: and they shall see His face; and His name shall be in their foreheads. They shall see Him as He is."
3. "But, says the apostle, expressing the converse of this beatitude—'Follow holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Blessed are the pure in heart - That is, whose minds, motives, and principles are pure; who seek not only to have the external actions correct, but who desire to be holy in heart, and who are so."
2. "Man looks on the outward appearance, but God looks on the heart."
3. "They shall see God - There is a sense in which all will see God, Revelation 1:7. That is, they will behold him as a Judge, not as a Friend. In this place, it is spoken of as a special favor. So also in Revelation 22:4, 'And they shall see his face.' To see the face of one, or to be in the presence of any one, were terms among the Jews expressive of great favor."

### John Calvin:
1. "Purity of heart is universally acknowledged to be the mother of all virtues."
2. "Christ does not at all agree with carnal reason, when he pronounces those to be happy, who take no delight in cunning, but converse sincerely with men, and express nothing, by word or look, which they do not feel in their heart."
3. "Simple people are ridiculed for want of caution, and for not looking sharply enough to themselves. But Christ directs them to higher views, and bids them consider that, if they have not sagacity to deceive in this world, they will enjoy the sight of God in heaven."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The pore in heart. Either a single virtue, or total freedom from sin. The former is here meant, i.e., a simplicity of heart, or 'that steady direction of the soul toward the Divine life which excludes every other object from the homage of the heart.'"
2. "More than sincerity, or chastity of feeling, or outward purity, such as the Levitical law demanded and the hearers might have deemed sufficient, or the moral purity which philosophers enjoin; it is inward purity derived from God."
3. "This vision of God begins when spiritual vision begins in the regenerate heart; it is perfected when in eternity we shall see Him face to face, perfect knowledge being combined with perfect love."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Without holiness no man will see the Lord in heaven."
2. "The Beatific Vision is only possible here on earth to those with pure hearts."
3. "Sin befogs and beclouds the heart so that one cannot see God."

### John Gill:
1. "Not in the head; for men may have pure notions and impure hearts; not in the hand, or action, or in outward conversation only."
2. "But such may be said to be so, who, though they have sin dwelling in them, are justified from all sin, by the righteousness of Christ."
3. "And happy they are, for they shall see God; in this life, enjoying communion with him, both in private and public, in the several duties of religion, in the house and ordinances of God."

### John Wesley:
1. The pure in heart — The sanctified: they who love God with all their hearts.They shall see God — In all things here; hereafter in glory.
