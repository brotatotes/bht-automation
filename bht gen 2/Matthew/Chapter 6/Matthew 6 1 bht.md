# Matthew 6:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Take heed to perform acts of righteousness and give alms sincerely, for these actions are means to do what is right before God. It is important to avoid seeking praise from men and to not make a show or spectacle of our good works. The reward we receive should not come from men, but from God. When we engage in acts of righteousness and give alms with the intention of glorifying God and not ourselves, we will be rewarded by Him and regarded as perfect righteous individuals in the world to come.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The discourse of our Lord now passes from actions to motives; not that He has not spoken to the heart before, but then it was only by inference, now directly."
2. "The words πρὸς τὸ θεαθ... clearly define the course of action objected to: not the open benevolence of the Christian who lets his light shine that men may glorify God, but the ostentation of him whose object is the praise and glory coming from man."
3. "εἰ δὲ μήγε does not apply to προσέχετε... but to μὴ ποιεῖν, and means, if ye do."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "By 'righteousness,' in this case, we are to understand that same righteousness of the kingdom of heaven, whose leading features—it is the great object of this discourse to open up."
2. "It refers to the actings of righteousness in the life—the outgoings of the gracious nature—of which our Lord afterwards said to His disciples, 'Herein is My Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit so shall ye be My disciples.'"
3. "True, He had required them to let their light shine before men that they might see their good works, and glorify their Father which is in heaven. But this is quite consistent with not making a display of our righteousness for self-glorification. In fact, the doing of the former necessarily implies our not doing the latter."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Take heed that ye do not your alms - The word “alms” here denotes liberality to the poor and needy."
2. "Our Saviour here does not positively command his disciples to aid the poor, but supposes that they would do it of course, and gives them directions how to do it."
3. "To a person who is disposed to do good from a right motive, it matters little whether it be in public or in private."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The preposition means with, by the side of; so that the true sense is, reserved for you and awaiting you by the side of your Father."
2. "The true sense is reserved for you and awaiting you by the side of your Father."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ exhorts his people to devote themselves sincerely to good works; that is, to endeavor, with simplicity, to do what is right before God, and not to make a parade before men." (424)
2. "A very necessary admonition; for in all virtues the entrance of ambition is to be dreaded, and there is no work so laudable, as not to be in many instances corrupted and polluted by it." (424)
3. "He speaks of alms only, as he speaks shortly afterwards about prayers: though some copies, instead of ἐλεημοσύνην, alms, read δικαιοσύνην, righteousness, which is also the rendering of the old translator. But the difference is of little moment: for in either way there is no room to doubt, that the design is, to correct the disease of ambition, when, in doing what is right, we seek glory from men." (424)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Hiding from men only necessary to prevent the praise of men from becoming the motive."
2. "The reward may (usually does) come from men, but not from God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Take heed...to 'hold the mind on a matter,' take pains, take heed." 
2. "Our word theatrical is this very word, spectacular performance." 
3. "Literally 'beside your Father,' standing by his side, as he looks at it."

### John Gill:
1. "Now alms was so called, because it is a righteous action, which ought to be performed; and to withhold from the poor what is meet, is to deal unrighteously."
2. "Let this sela be for alms, that my son may live, and that he may be a son of the world to come; lo! this is a perfect righteous man."
3. "When a man's self, and not the glory of God, is the chief end of any action, that cannot be called a good work, nor will it have any reward; whereas a good work, which springs from a principle of grace, and is directed to the glory of God, will have a reward, not of debt, but of grace, from whence it arises."
