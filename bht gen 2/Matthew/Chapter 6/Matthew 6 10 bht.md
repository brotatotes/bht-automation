# Matthew 6:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through this prayer, we ask for the fulfillment of God's kingdom here on earth, as it is described in the prophetic Scriptures. It implies the process of events that will lead to this accomplishment. We desire for all hindrances to be removed and for all people to come under the dominion of God. This prayer encompasses the Messianic kingdom, which brings order and harmony to a chaotic world. We seek the success of the Gospel in reaching all people, both Jews and Gentiles, and we also pray for our own sanctification as we align our will with God's.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Messiahâ€™s kingdom, which in organized form had not yet come, but was proclaimed by the Lord Himself, as at hand. It did speedily come, as opposed to the Old Testament theocracy; but in its fulness, including the triumph of Christâ€™s kingdom over the kingdom of darkness it has not yet come." 
2. "A missionary petition, but not less a prayer for our own higher sanctification and for the second coming of Christ."
