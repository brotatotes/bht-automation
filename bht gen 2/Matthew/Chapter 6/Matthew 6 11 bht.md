# Matthew 6:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God desires to provide for our daily needs, supplying us with the sustenance we require. This provision is not just for a single day, but rather extends throughout our entire lives. The food that God grants us is tailored to our individual circumstances, ensuring that it is suitable and sufficient. When we pray for bread, we are requesting all of the essentials for life and acknowledging our dependence on God for these provisions.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ὁ ἄρτος ὁ ἐπιούσιος will be equivalent to St. James’s τὰ ἐπιτήδεια τοῦ σώματος (Mat 2:16), and the expressions are rendered in Sy. by the same word. Thus only, σήμερον has its proper meaning."
2. "To explain ἐπιούσιος (as Orig. Cyr.-jer), ὁ ἐπὶ τὴν οὐσίαν τῆς ψυχῆς κατατασσόμενος, and understand the expression of the Eucharist primarily, or even of spiritual feeding on Christ, is to miss the plain reference of the petition to our daily physical wants."
3. "But not to recognize those spiritual senses, is equally to miss the great truth, that the ἡμεῖς whose bread is prayed for, are not mere animals, but composed of body, soul, and spirit, all of which want daily nourishment by Him from whom all blessings flow."

### John Calvin:
1. "When we pray, therefore, we must never turn away our eyes from that object. There is this difference, however, between the two kinds of petitions which we have mentioned. When we pray for the kingdom of God and the sanctification of his name, our eyes ought to be directed upwards, so as to lose sight of ourselves, and to be fixed on God alone."
2. "This kind and gentle manner of treating us raises our confidence higher."
3. "The adverb today, as I said a little ago, is added to restrain our excessive desire, and to teach us, that we depend every moment on the kindness of God, and ought to be content with that portion which he gives us, to use a common expression, 'from day to day'."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "'Bread,' food in general; the form in the Greek hints that it is 'ours,' i.e., created for our use." 
2. "'This day,' shows that we are to pray daily and to ask neither for riches nor poverty, but, with contentment and thankfulness for the day's portion only."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The effort has been made to derive it from επ and ων (ουσα). It clearly comes from επ and ιων (επ and ειμ) like τη επιουση ("on the coming day," "the next day," Acts 16:12)."
2. "Moulton and Milligan, Vocabulary say: 'The papyri have as yet shed no clear light upon this difficult word (Matthew 6:11; Luke 11:3), which was in all probability a new coinage by the author of the Greek Q to render his Aramaic Original.'"
3. "The opinion here expressed has been confirmed by A. Debrunner's discovery (Theol. Lit. Ztg. 1925, Col. 119) of επιουσιος in an ancient housekeeping book."

### John Gill:
1. "God would give us, 'day by day', as Luke expresses it, that is, every day of our lives, to the end thereof, a proper supply of food."
2. "God would give us, for the present time, such food as we stand in need of; is suitable to us, to our nature and constitution, state and condition, and is sufficient and convenient for us."
3. "By 'bread' is meant all the necessaries of life, and for the support of it: it is called 'our's'; not that we have a right unto it, much less deserve it, but to distinguish it from that of beasts; and because it is what we need, and cannot do without."
