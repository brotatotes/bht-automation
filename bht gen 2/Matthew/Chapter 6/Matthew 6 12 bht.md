# Matthew 6:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We should always begin with seeking forgiveness for our sins, recognizing that sin is both a wrong committed and a debt owed. We are reminded that forgiveness is not about satisfying a debt, but about God generously releasing us from our obligations. As we ask for forgiveness, we are reminded that our forgiveness is connected to our willingness to forgive others, showing that forgiveness received and forgiveness given go hand in hand. We should approach God with a spirit of forgiveness, trusting in His mercy and grace.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "τὰ ὀφειλ [...] 'Quod utique non de illis peccatis dicitur quæ in baptismi regeneratione dimissa sunt, sed de iis quæ quotidie de seculi amarissimis fructibus humanæ vitæ infirmitas contrahit.'" 
2. "ὡς καί]  like as ( quippe ; not exactly nam, cf. Klotz ad Devar. p. 766. Hartung, Partikellehre, i. p. 460) we also, &c. implying similarity in the two actions, of kind, but no comparison of degree."
3. "ἀφήκαμεν here implies that (see ch. Mat 5:23-24) the act of forgiveness of others is completed before we approach the throne of grace."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Debts [οφειληματα] . So rightly, A. V., and Rev. (compare Luke 11:4). Sin is pictured as a debt, and the sinner as a debtor (compare Matthew 18:28, Matthew 18:30). Accordingly, the word represents sin both as a wrong and as requiring satisfaction."
2. "In contrast with the prayer, 'Forgive us our debts,' Tholuck (" Sermon on the Mount ") quotes the prayer of Apollonius of Tyana, 'O ye gods, give me the things which are owing to me.'"
3. "Forgive [αφηκαμεν] . Lit., to send away, or dismiss. The Rev. rightly gives the force of the past tense, we have forgiven; since Christ assumes that he who prays for the remission of his own debts has already forgiven those indebted to him."

### John Calvin:
1. "We ought always, therefore, to begin with the forgiveness of sins: for the first hope of being heard by God beams upon us, when we obtain his favor."
2. "Christ has included in two petitions all that related to the eternal salvation of the soul, and to the spiritual life: for these are the two leading points of the divine covenant, in which all our salvation consists."
3. "The forgiveness, which we here ask to be bestowed on us, is inconsistent with satisfaction, by which the world endeavors to purchase its own deliverance. For that creditor is not said to forgive, who has received payment and asks nothing more,—but he who willingly and generously departs from his just claim, and frees the debtor."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "‘Debts,’ undoubtedly, moral obligations unfulfilled, i.e., sins."
2. "The spirit of forgiveness, which God implants, gives a better assurance of His forgiveness."
3. "Our debtors, like 'debts,' is to be taken in the moral sense. We are sinners, always needing forgiveness; forgiveness and readiness to forgive cannot be separated, the latter being the evidence of the former."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is correct in verse Matthew 6:14 in Christ's argument about prayer, but it is not in the Model Prayer itself."
2. "We are thus described as having wronged God."
3. "We ask forgiveness 'in proportion as' (ως) we also have forgiven those in debt to us, a most solemn reflection."

### John Gill:
1. "These are called 'debts'; not because they are so in themselves, for then it would be right to do them; debts should be paid; they are not debts we owe to God, but are so called, because on account of them we owe satisfaction to the law and justice of God."
2. "This petition supposes a sense, acknowledgment, and confession of sin, and of inability to make satisfaction for it; and that God only can forgive it, who does, for Christ's sake, and on account of his blood, sacrifice, and satisfaction."
3. "The injuries of enemies, the unkindness of friends, all sorts of offences, are to be forgiven by us; and not only so, but we are to pray to God to forgive them also."
