# Matthew 6:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In our prayers, we should not ask to be shielded completely from temptations, for they can serve as trials that strengthen our character. However, we should implore God for protection and guidance, acknowledging our own weakness and the need for His deliverance. Through this petition, we express our trust in God's power to keep us from falling and to lead us on the righteous path. The concluding phrase, Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever, Amen, affirms our unwavering faith in God's sovereignty and our confidence that our prayers will be answered.

### Henry Alford:
1. "The sentiment is not in any way inconsistent with the Christian‚Äôs joy when he œÄŒµŒπœÅŒ±œÉŒºŒø·øñœÇ œÄŒµœÅŒπœÄŒ≠œÉ·øÉ œÄŒøŒπŒ∫ŒØŒªŒøŒπœÇ, but is a humble self-distrust and shrinking from such trial in the prospect." 
2. "In another view, however, as expressing the deep desire of all Christian hearts to be delivered from all evil, these words form a seventh and most affecting petition, reaching far beyond the last."
3. "The doxology must on every ground of sound criticism be omitted. Had it formed part of the original text, it is absolutely inconceivable that all the ancient authorities should with one consent have omitted it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Temptation [œÄŒµŒπœÅŒ±œÉŒºŒøŒΩ] . It is a mistake to define this word as only solicitation to evil. It means trial of any kind, without reference to its moral quality."
2. "Here, generally of all situations and circumstances which furnish an occasion for sin."
3. "We cannot pray God not to tempt us to sin," for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man " (James 1:13)."

### John Calvin:
1. "We are conscious Of our own weakness, and desire to enjoy the protection of God, that we may remain impregnable against all the assaults of Satan."
2. "Whoever implores the assistance of God to overcome temptations, acknowledges that, unless God deliver him, he will be constantly falling."
3. "It is surprising that this clause, which agrees so well with the rest of the prayer, has been left out by the Latins: for it was not added merely for the purpose of kindling our hearts to seek the glory of God, and of reminding us what ought to be the object of our prayers; but likewise to teach us, that our prayers, which are here dictated to us, are founded on God alone, that we may not rely on our own merits."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "God cannot tempt us, i.e., solicit us to evil, but 'temptation' means also a trial of our moral character; these trials are under God's control, and His Providence may lead us into them, may even permit us to be solicited by evil." 
2. "In view of the many temptations from within (our 'flesh'), from without (the 'world'), and from beneath ('the devil'), to which we are constantly exposed, there is no help and safety for us, but in the personal trust in Christ which underlies the proper offering up of this petition."
3. "Entire deliverance by God‚Äôs grace from evil (or from the evil one) is entire freedom from temptation, and looks toward that final redemption in heaven where all our wants shall be satisfied and our prayers, as petitions, be lost in never-ceasing thanksgiving and praise."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "No one understood temptation so well as Jesus...but without success." 
2. "Pray that ye enter not into temptation." 
3. "The idea is then: 'Do not allow us to be led into temptation.'"

### John Gill:
1. "We are not here taught to pray against temptations at all, or in any sense, for they are sometimes needful and useful; but that they may not have the power over us, and destroy us."
2. "To be delivered from [the evil one], is to be rescued out of his hands, preserved from his snares, and delivered from his temptations."
3. "Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever, Amen...the whole is concluded with the word 'Amen'; which is a note of asseveration, of the truth...is expressive of an hearty wish, and desire to have all fulfilled; and also of faith and confidence, that they will be answered."
