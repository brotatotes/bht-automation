# Matthew 6:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus emphasizes the importance of forgiving others by instructing his disciples to forgive men their trespasses. He urges them to forgive all sorts of injuries and offenses from the heart, without holding grudges or demanding apologies. This act of forgiveness is not a means to earn God's forgiveness, but rather a response to God's gracious forgiveness towards us.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "This word is derived from parapiptw, to fall or thrown one's self beside. Thus it has a sense somewhat akin to aJmartia, of going beside a mark, missing."
2. "It does not, therefore, imply palliation or excuse. It is a conscious violation of right, involving guilt, and occurs therefore, in connection with the mention of forgiveness."
3. "Unlike parabasiv (transgression), which contemplates merely the objective violation of law, it carries the thought of sin as affecting the sinner, and hence is found associated with expressions which indicate the consequences and the remedy of sin."

### John Calvin:
1. "God will not be ready to hear us, unless we also show ourselves ready to grant forgiveness to those who have offended us."
2. "Unless God pardon us every day many sins, we know that we are ruined in innumerable ways: and on no other condition does he admit us to pardon, but that we pardon our brethren whatever offenses they have committed against us."
3. "Those who refuse to forget the injuries which have been done to them, devote themselves willingly and deliberately to destruction, and knowingly prevent God from forgiving them."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Trespasses (παραπτωματα). This is no part of the Model Prayer."
2. "The word 'trespass' is literally 'falling to one side,' a lapse or deviation from truth or uprightness."
3. "Παραβασις (Romans 5:14) is a positive violation, a transgression, conscious stepping aside or across."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ presses it upon them closely to 'forgive men their trespasses'; all sorts of injuries done them, or offences given them, whether by word or deed; and that fully, freely, from the heart; forgetting, as well as forgiving; not upbraiding them with former offences; and even without asking pardon, and though there might be no appearance of repentance."
2. "Now to this he encourages by saying, your heavenly Father will also forgive you; will hear your prayers, and manifest his forgiving love to you."
3. "Not that the forgiveness of others is the procuring cause of forgiveness with God, which is the blood of Christ; or of the manifestation and application of it, that is, the advocacy of Christ; nor the moving cause of it, that is, the free grace of God."

### John Wesley:
1. Mark 11:25.
