# Matthew 6:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If we truly understand and appreciate the abundant grace of God in forgiving our own sins, it should naturally lead us to extend the same forgiveness to those who have wronged us. Failing to forgive others reveals a lack of understanding and gratitude for God's forgiveness towards us. We cannot expect to experience the fullness of God's forgiveness if we are unwilling to forgive others, especially when we are all equal in our need for forgiveness.

### John Gill:
1. "Had they any right apprehensions of the grace and goodness of God, in the forgiveness of their sins, this would influence their minds, and engage their hearts to forgive such who have offended them."
2. "It is a plain case, that your Father has not given you a true sense of the pardon of your sins, nor can you be certain that he will; nor have you any reason to expect it, when you are so cruel and revengeful to others."
