# Matthew 6:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
True fasting is not about outward displays or seeking the approval of others. Jesus cautions against the hypocrisy of those who put on a show of extreme sorrow and piety while fasting. The intention behind fasting is not to draw attention or admiration from others, but rather to express genuine grief and repentance. It is not about disfiguring our faces or putting on a somber countenance, but rather a personal discipline and means of deepening our connection with God. Our focus should be on the sincerity of our inward devotion rather than any external show.
