# Matthew 6:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ allows for fasting, but He distinguishes it from the fasting of the Jews, which was primarily focused on outward abstinence from food and worldly comforts. The kind of fasting Christ encourages is one focused on abstaining from sin, acknowledging and confessing it, and exercising faith and hope in God's forgiveness. In this kind of fasting, cheerfulness and enjoying the blessings of God's creation without abusing them are fitting. Therefore, Christ advises His disciples to dress and present themselves as usual when fasting, so as not to draw unnecessary attention to their spiritual practices.
