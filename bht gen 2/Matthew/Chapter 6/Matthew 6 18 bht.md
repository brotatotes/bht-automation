# Matthew 6:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When engaging in fasting, it is crucial to remember that it is not about seeking approval or recognition from others. Instead, it is a personal act of devotion and surrender to God. Our fasting should be done in a way that is only seen by God, as he sees and rewards what is done in secret. This inward focus reflects our heavenly-mindedness and filial confidence, as we prioritize the honor and approval that comes from God over the applause of men. Rest assured, God delights in our acts of grace and will reward them with glory.
