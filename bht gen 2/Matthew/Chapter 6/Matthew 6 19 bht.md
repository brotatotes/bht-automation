# Matthew 6:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our desires for earthly treasures and wealth can distract us from heavenly pursuits. The perishable nature of these treasures is emphasized by the references to moths, rust, and thieves. It is a reminder that all worldly possessions are temporary and can easily be lost or destroyed. Jesus advises against hoarding wealth, directing our focus instead towards spiritual treasures. In doing so, we avoid the pitfalls of covetousness and the futile pursuit of material gain.
