# Matthew 6:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When giving, it is important not to seek the applause of others, like the hypocrites who perform good deeds to gain fame and self-praise. The hypocrites in this context are the Scribes and Pharisees, who outwardly appeared religious but were inwardly wicked. They would make a show of their charity in public places like synagogues and streets, where large crowds could witness their actions. However, such actions only earn them temporary praise from men, and they will receive no further reward from God. Their focus on earthly recognition hinders their ability to please God and receive His blessings.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "A proverbial expression, not implying any such custom of the hypocrites of that day, but the habit of self-laudation, and display of good works in general." 
2. "Meyer remarks that the word σαλπίσῃς is tuba canas, not tuba cani cures, and must therefore refer to what the person himself does: but all verbs of action may surely refer to action per alterum, so that this does not decide the point."
3. "μὴ σαλπίσῃς cannot well be maintained. The synagogues, as afterwards the Christian churches, were the regular places for the collection of alms."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Therefore, when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee... as the hypocrites do... in the synagogues and in the streets... that they may have glory of men." 
2. "Verily I say unto you... They have their reward. All they wanted was human applause, and they have it—and with it, all they will ever get."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'hypocrite' is taken from 'stage-players,' who act the part of others, or speak not their own sentiments, but the sentiments of others."
2. "Those who 'dissemble' or hide their real sentiments, and assume or express other feelings than their own - those who, for purposes of ostentation, gain, or applause, put on the appearance of religion."
3. "They obtain the applause they seek the reputation of being charitable; and as this applause was all they wished, there is, of course, no further reward to be looked for or obtained."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Sound a trumpet [σαλπισης]. There seems to be no trace of any such custom on the part of almsgivers, so that the expression must be taken as a figurative one for making a display."
2. "It is just possible that the figure may have been suggested by the 'trumpets' of the temple treasury - thirteen trumpet-shaped chests to receive the contributions of worshippers."
3. "Have their reward (ajpecousin). The preposition ajpo indicates receipt in full. Rev. renders they have received, so that there is nothing more to receive. So Wyc., They have received their need."

### John Calvin:
1. "When our service is rendered to the eyes of men, we do not submit our life to the judgment and approbation of God."
2. "There are various kinds of hypocrites. Some...impudently give themselves out for good men before the world... Others allow themselves to proceed to such a pitch of audacity, that they venture to claim even perfect righteousness before God... Others do good, not from a desire to do what is right, nor on account of the glory of God, but only to obtain for themselves fame and a reputation for holiness."
3. "Having no proper object in view in the performance of good works, they assume a different character, that they may appear to be holy and sincere worshippers of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Do not sound a trumpet before thee, etc. It would be impossible to blow a trumpet in the synagogues, where the alms were regularly collected, or even in the streets, where the giver would be accosted by the beggar, and hardly carry a trumpet with him for such casual occurrences. The language is figurative: a trumpet was sounded before official personages to call attention to them; hence self-laudation and display are meant."
2. "Hypocrites. The Pharisees are not named, but, as a class, deserved this epithet."
3. "They have received their reward; already in full, and will get no more. They have the applause of men; the favor of God is denied by Matthew 6:1. Their ‘due’ reward is not spoken of."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Certainly it was in keeping with their love of praise. And Jesus expressly says that 'the hypocrites' (ο υποκριτα) do this very thing."
2. "This is the hardest word that Jesus has for any class of people and he employs it for these pious pretenders who pose as perfect."
3. "They have received their reward (απεχουσιν τον μισθον αυτων). This verb is common in the papyri for receiving a receipt, 'they have their receipt in full,' all the reward that they will get, this public notoriety."

### John Gill:
1. "The persons Christ has reference to were the Scribes and Pharisees, who did all they did to be seen of men; whom he calls 'hypocrites'; as he often does, because they put on an appearance of religion and holiness, but inwardly, and otherwise, were very wicked men." 
2. "When they did their alms, they chose public places for it, such as the 'synagogues', where was a large concourse of people met together for religious worship; or the open 'streets' of the city, where people were continually walking to and fro, so that nothing could be done in this way, but what must be seen and observed."
3. "He that glories in anything done by himself, 'he takes', or receives 'his reward'; for as for any reward from God, they will have none; as the Ethiopic version reads it, 'they have lost their reward'."

### John Wesley:
1. "Many of the scribes and Pharisees did this, under a pretense of calling the poor together."
2. "They have their reward - All they will have; for they shall have none from God."
