# Matthew 6:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If your treasure is on earth, your hearts will be set upon earthly things. However, if your treasure is entrusted to God, your hearts will be with Him, firmly fixed on heavenly things. The concept of treasure lies at the core of these teachings, highlighting the importance of where our true affections and desires reside. When we divide our affection between earthly and heavenly treasures, we experience impracticability. To find lasting happiness, our hearts must be fully devoted to God, recognizing that true fulfillment is found by investing in our relationship with Him and storing our treasure in heaven.
