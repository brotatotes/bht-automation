# Matthew 6:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The eye is the lamp of the body, and just as the eye brings light to the body, our intentions bring purpose to our souls. If our intentions are solely focused on God and heaven, our entire being will be filled with holiness and happiness. However, if our intentions are divided and not fixed on God, we will be led astray. It is important to have a single-mindedness, a singleness of purpose, to serve and please God in everything we do, so that our character may be consistent and bright.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The lamp of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single—simple, clear."
2. "Here, as also in classical Greek, it is used figuratively to denote the simplicity of the mind's eye, singleness of purpose, looking right at its object, as opposed to having two ends in view."
3. "A simple and persistent purpose to serve and please God in everything will make the whole character consistent and bright."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Single. The picture underlying this adjective is that of a piece of cloth or other material, neatly folded once, and without a variety of complicated folds. Hence the idea of simplicity or singleness."
2. "So, in a moral sense, artless, plain, pure. Here sound, as opposed to evil or diseased."
3. "Full of light. Bengel says, 'As if it were all eye.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "Men go wrong through carelessness, because they do not keep their eye fixed, as they ought to do, on the proper object."
2. "The affections may be regarded individually as its members: but as they are blind in themselves, they need direction. Now, God has given reason to guide them, and to act the part of a lantern in showing them the way."
3. "We see, then, as I have already said, that these words reprove the indolence of men, who neglect to open their eyes for the guidance of their affections."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Not an abrupt transition, but an illustration of the importance of dedicating the heart to God supremely."
2. "The lamp of the body is the eye... the application is to single apprehension of God as the supreme object of trust and love."
3. "Full of light, or, 'in light,' 'in full light,' the body having received what the eye was designed to convey."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The figure and the ethical meaning seem to be mixed up, moral attributes ascribed to the physical eye which with them still gives light to the body."
2. "If our eyes are healthy we see clearly and with a single focus (without astigmatism). If the eyes are diseased (bad, evil), they may even be cross-eyed or cock-eyed. We see double and confuse our vision."
3. "Seeing double is double-mindedness as is shown in verse Matthew 6:24."

### John Gill:
1. "The light of the body is the eye,.... Or, the 'candle of the body is the eye'; for the eye is that in the body, as a candle is in the house; by the light of it, the several members of the body perform their office."
2. "if therefore thine eye be single: that is, if thy mind be liberal, generous, and bountiful... the sense of our Lord in these words; whose meaning is, that if a man is not covetous, but his mind is disposed to generosity and liberality..."
3. "thy whole body shall be full of light: all thy actions will be influenced by this noble principle; thy whole life will be illuminated, guided and governed by it; thy mind will be cheerful and pleasant, and thy estate and condition will be prosperous and successful."

### John Wesley:
1. "The eye is the lamp of the body — And what the eye is to the body, the intention is to the soul."
2. "If thine eye be single — Singly fixed on God and heaven, thy whole soul will be full of holiness and happiness."
3. "If thine eye be evil — Not single, aiming at anything else."
