# Matthew 6:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If our inward purpose is not heavenward, our being will be characterized by darkness and distortion. Without a guide, we wander in vice, lacking reason to restrain dark lusts. A divided heart sees falsely, worse than blindness. False seeing leads to a life of thick darkness. Covetousness fills our body with darkness, leading to a miserable existence. The sin of covetousness extinguishes the light of reason, leading to deeds of darkness and eternal consequences unless prevented by grace.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If a man's inward purpose, scope, aim in life, is not simple and heavenward, but distorted and double, what must all the other faculties and principles of our nature be which take their direction and character from these, and what must the whole man and the whole life be but a mass of darkness?"
2. "As a vitiated eye, or an eye that looks not straight and full at its object, sees nothing as it is, so a mind and heart divided between heaven and earth is all dark."
3. "If thy whole body therefore be full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The blind seek for a guide; we wander about without a guide."
2. "Seeing falsely is worse than blindness."
3. "False seeing is unseeing, on the negative side of blindness."

### John Calvin:
1. "We ought not to wonder, if men wallow so disgracefully, like beasts, in the filth of vices, for they have no reason which might restrain the blind and dark lusts of the flesh."
2. "The light is said to be turned into darkness, not only when men permit the wicked lusts of the flesh to overwhelm the judgment of their reason, but also when they give up their minds to wicked thoughts, and thus degenerate into beasts."
3. "Christ has good grounds for declaring, that thick and appalling darkness must of necessity reign in the life of men, when they choose to be blind."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The evil result of a divided state of heart, where what God designed to be the means of showing Himself to us as the supreme object of love, fails to perform its office."
2. "Man can lose the proper use of what God designed to be the organ of spiritual light, even this may be darkness."
3. "'No blindness is so terrible as blindness of conscience, when what was made to enlighten us but increases our darkness."

### John Gill:
1. "If thou art of a sordid disposition, of an avaricious temper, if the sin of covetousness prevails over thee, thy whole body will be full of darkness."
2. "Thy mind will be always sad and sorrowful, harassed and distressed; and thy estate and condition will be most miserable and uncomfortable."
3. "So when the light of reason in the mind is so far extinguished by any prevailing iniquity, particularly the sin of covetousness, so that it is wholly influenced and governed by it, what irregular actions is it led into! What deeds of darkness does it perform! and what will be the consequence of it, but utter and eternal darkness, if grace prevent not!"
