# Matthew 6:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
No man can serve two masters. It is impossible to divide our affections and obedience between God and worldly treasures. If we sincerely serve one, we will necessarily disregard and despise the other. Riches, also known as mammon, may be loved, sought after, and trusted, but they cannot be served alongside God. The pursuit of earthly wealth can easily become the object of our devotion, leading us astray from true service to the Lord. Ultimately, we must choose who we will serve, as serving both God and mammon is a contradiction in terms and a recipe for failure.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And this division in man’s being cannot take place he is and must be one light or dark serving God or Mammon."
2. "He will either hate A and love B, or cleave to A and despise B."
3. "Mammon does not appear to have been the name of any Syrian deity, as Schleusner asserts."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Even if the two masters be of one character and have but one object, the servant must take law from one or the other: though he may do what is agreeable to both, he cannot, in the nature of the thing, be servant to more than one." 
2. "In this case, if our affections be in the service of the one—if we 'love the one'—we must of necessity 'hate the other'; if we determine resolutely to 'hold to the one,' we must at the same time disregard, and (if he insist on his claims upon us) even 'despise the other.'"
3. "The service of this god and the true God together is here, with a kind of indignant curtness, pronounced impossible."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "No man can serve two masters at the same time. His affections and obedience would be divided, and he would fail altogether in his duty to one or the other."
2. "The servant of God cannot at the same time obey him and be avaricious, or seek treasures supremely on earth. One interferes with the other, and one or the other will be, and must be, surrendered."
3. "Ye cannot serve the true God, and at the same time be supremely engaged in obtaining the riches of this world. One must interfere with the other."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The other [ετερον] . Implying distinction in quality rather than numerical distinction."
2. "Here the word gives the idea of two masters of distinct or opposite character and interests, like God and Mammon."
3. "Hold to [ανθεξεται] . The preposition ajnti, against, indicates holding to the one master as against the other. He who is for God must be against Mammon."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ affirms that it is impossible for any man to obey God, and, at the same time, to obey his own flesh."
2. "Where riches hold the dominion of the heart, God has lost his authority."
3. "All are deceived, who imagine that he will be satisfied with the half of their heart."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For either he will hate the one, etc. Explanations: (1) The suppositions the reverse of each other, with no particular difference between the two sets of verbs: ‘He will either hate A and love B, or cleave to A and despise B.’"
2. "The proper master (God) may be loved or hated, but cannot be despised. Hence in any case ‘one’ in the latter clause must be God."
3. "If God be not the object of supreme trust, something else will be, and it is most likely to be money. We must choose. Not the possession of money, but its mastery over the mind, is condemned."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "No man can serve two masters. Many try it, but failure awaits them all."
2. "The slave of mammon will obey mammon while pretending to obey God."
3. "When the guide is blind and leads the blind, both fall into the ditch."

3. "The Jews, in Christ's time, were notorious for the love of 'mammon'; and they themselves own, that this was the cause of the destruction of the second temple." (138 words)
