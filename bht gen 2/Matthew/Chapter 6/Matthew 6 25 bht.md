# Matthew 6:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are encouraged to trust in God and serve Him wholeheartedly, without being consumed by worries and anxieties. It is important to distinguish between thoughtful consideration and excessive, burdensome care. God, who has given us the invaluable gift of life, will surely provide for our needs and sustain us. We should recognize that our true worth is found in our relationship with God rather than in material possessions, for life is more than just food or outward appearances.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The E. V., 'Take no thought,' does not express the sense, but gives rather an exaggeration of the command, and thus makes it unreal and nugatory."
2. "Be not anxious, would be far better."
3. "Οὐχὶ ἡ ψ . ] τοῦτο εἶπε δηλῶν ὅτι ὁ τὸ πλεῖον δοὺς ἡμῖν καὶ τὸ ἔλαττον δώσει . πλεῖον δὲ τὸ μεῖζον λέγει ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Thought or forethought, for temporal things—in the sense of reflection, consideration—is required alike by Scripture and common sense. It is that anxious solicitude, that oppressive care, which springs from unbelieving doubts and misgivings, which alone is here condemned."
2. "When 'careful (or 'full of care') about nothing,' but committing all in prayer and supplication with thanksgiving unto God, the apostle assures us that 'the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep our hearts and minds in Christ Jesus'."
3. "If God, then, gives and keeps up the greater—the life, the body—will He withhold the less, food to sustain life and raiment to clothe the body?"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "God has given 'life,' a far greater blessing than 'meat;' that he has created the body, of far more consequence than raiment. Shall not he who has conferred the 'greater' blessing be willing to confer the 'less?'"
2. "The word 'thought,' when the Bible was translated, meant 'anxiety,' and is so used frequently in Old English authors... The word 'anxiety' would now exactly express the sense, and is precisely the thing against which the Saviour would guard us."
3. "There is a degree of 'thinking' about the things of this life which is proper... But it should not be our supreme concern; it should not lead to anxiety; it should not take time that ought to be devoted to religion."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Take thought, in this passage, was a truthful rendering when the A. V. was made, since thought was then used as equivalent to anxiety or solicitude."
2. "It is uneasiness and worry about the future which our Lord condemns here, and therefore Rev. rightly translates be not anxious."
3. "This phase of the word is forcibly brought out in 1 Peter 5:7, where the A. V. ignores the distinction between the two kinds of care. 'Casting all your care (merimnan, Rev., anxiety) upon Him, for He careth [αυτω μελει] for you,' with a fatherly, tender, and provident care."

### John Calvin:
1. "But immoderate care is condemned for two reasons: either because in so doing men tease and vex themselves to no purpose, by carrying their anxiety farther than is proper or than their calling demands; or because they claim more for themselves than they have a right to do, and place such a reliance on their own industry, that they neglect to call upon God."
2. "Though the children of God are not free from toil and anxiety, yet, properly speaking, we do not say that they are anxious about life: because, through their reliance on the providence of God, they enjoy calm repose."
3. "He who is fully convinced, that the Author of our life has an intimate knowledge of our condition, will entertain no doubt that he will make abundant provision for our wants."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Anxiety, which is distrust of God, is the source of avarice."
2. "Living to God is the proper life, and it relieves from care, because we trust Him for what we need."
3. "Is not He who gave ‘the life’ able and willing to give what will sustain it, and He who made ‘the body,’ what will protect it."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Be not anxious for your life (μη μεριμνατε τη ψυχη υμων). This is as good a translation as the Authorized Version was poor; "Take no thought for your life.""
2. "The command not to have the habit of petulant worry about food and clothing, a source of anxiety to many housewives, a word for women especially as the command not to worship mammon may be called a word for men."
3. "Here ψυχη stands for the life principle common to man and beast, which is embodied in the σωμα: the former needs food, the latter clothing."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ does not forbid labour to maintain, support, and preserve this animal life; nor does he forbid all thought and care about it, but all anxious, immoderate, perplexing, and distressing thoughts and cares."
2. "The several and the only things necessary for the support and comfort of human life are mentioned: meat, drink, and clothing; eating and drinking to preserve life, and raiment to cover and defend the body from the injuries of the heavens."
3. "Since these are better, and much more excellent than food and raiment, it may be depended upon that he will give the lesser; that he will give meat and drink to uphold that valuable life, which he is the author of; and raiment to clothe that body, which he, with so much wisdom and power, has accurately and wonderfully made."

### John Wesley:
1. "And if you serve God, you need be careful for nothing." 
2. "Take not thought — That is, be not anxiously careful."
3. "Is not the life more than meat?"
