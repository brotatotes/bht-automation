# Matthew 6:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Take a moment to reflect on the ravens, observe them closely, and you will see that they do not engage in sowing, reaping, or gathering into barns. However, this is not meant to discourage human efforts in these areas, but rather to rebuke our lack of trust and faith in God. If the Lord takes care of lowly and insignificant creatures, how much more will He provide for you? Remember, when troubles arise, it is often a result of our own sins.
