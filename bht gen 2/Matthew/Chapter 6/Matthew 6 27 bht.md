# Matthew 6:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible teaches us that no matter how much we strive and worry, we cannot add a single day or a single moment to our lives. It is not within our power to increase our stature or age. God has ordered every aspect of our lives, from our physical growth to the length of our days. Our only duty is to depend on Him and trust that He will provide for our needs and sustain us. Instead of exhausting ourselves with pointless anxieties, let us turn to God and seek His guidance and blessings in all our endeavors.
