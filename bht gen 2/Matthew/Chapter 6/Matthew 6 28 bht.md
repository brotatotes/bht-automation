# Matthew 6:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Consider the lilies of the field, which may include not only lilies, but also other wild flowers like anemones, poppies, gladioli, and irises. Christ directs his hearers to observe these flowers that grow without the care of men. He wants them to look closely and contemplate their growth, noting their variety of garbs, beautiful colors, and fragrant odors. Despite not toiling or spinning like humans do, these flowers still flourish and display their beauty in the field.

1. "Christ does not direct his hearers to the lilies, or flowers which grow in the garden which receive some advantage from the management and care of the gardener; but to those of the field, where the art and care of men were not so exercised."
2. "which he would have them look upon, with their eyes, consider and contemplate in their minds, how they grow; in what variety of garbs they appear, of what different beautiful colours, and fragrant odours, they were."
3. "and yet they toil not, or do not labour as husbandmen do, in tilling their land, ploughing their fields, and sowing them with flax, out of which linen garments are made: neither do they spin; the flax, when plucked and dressed, as women do, in order for clothing; nor do they weave it into cloth, or make it up into garments, as other artificers do."
