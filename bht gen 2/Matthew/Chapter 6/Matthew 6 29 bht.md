# Matthew 6:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we are reminded that the glory and magnificence of all human pomp and wealth cannot compare to the beauty found in the humblest of God's creations. Even Solomon, known for his extravagant court and riches, could not be clothed as exquisitely as a single flower. This serves as a powerful reminder of the surpassing beauty and splendor that God has bestowed upon His creation, and the insignificance of worldly adornment in comparison.
