# Matthew 6:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do good deeds in such a way that even your own left hand is unaware of what your right hand is doing. This proverbial expression emphasizes the need for secrecy and humility in our acts of kindness. We should strive to do good without any desire for recognition or reward, so much so that we are willing to keep our acts of kindness hidden even from ourselves. Our focus should be on sincerely serving others and pleasing God rather than seeking praise or acknowledgment.
