# Matthew 6:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The grass of the field, which includes both herbs and flowers, serves as a reminder of God's provision and attention to detail. Just as He clothes these plants in a complete and protective dress, He will surely provide for His people in even greater measure. The delicate beauty and intricate design of every flower observed under a microscope further confirm the truth of this passage. Our faith should not waver, for if God cares for the transient and insignificant, how much more will He care for His beloved children?

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "Shall, then, God's children, so dear to Him, and instinct with a life that cannot die, be left naked?" 
3. "He does not say, Shall they not be more beauteously arrayed? but, Shall He not much more clothe them? that being all He will have them regard as secured to them."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'grass,' applied here to the lily, denotes merely that it is a vegetable production, or that it is among the things which grow wild, and which are used for fuel."

1. "If God so clothes the lilies, the flowers of the field, and whatever grows up out of the earth, in such a beautiful and splendid manner, as even to outdo Solomon, there's no doubt to be made of it, or at least ought not, but that he will much more provide clothing for men."
2. "Now if God clothes these plants, which are so short lived, and at last used for such mean purposes, shall he not much more clothe you men, his people, who are of a much longer life, and designed for greater ends and purposes?"
3. "O ye of little faith...who distrust the providence of God, with respect to food and raiment."

### John Wesley:

2. "If God so clothe ‚Äî The word properly implies, the putting on a complete dress, that surrounds the body on all sides; and beautifully expresses that external membrane, which (like the skin in a human body) at once adorns the tender fabric of the vegetable, and guards it from the injuries of the weather."
3. "Every microscope in which a flower is viewed gives a lively comment on this text."
