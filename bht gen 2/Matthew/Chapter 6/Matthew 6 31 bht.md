# Matthew 6:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let us not burden ourselves with unnecessary anxiety about our basic needs, but rely on God's care. It is foolish to seek after things without looking to God. We must have faith and understand that it is lawful to care for our present needs, not worrying about the future. Let us not harm ourselves by carrying the burden of anxiety that God has already taken off us. Instead, let us joyfully trust in our heavenly Father, who knows our needs and has given us life and a body worth more than material possessions.
