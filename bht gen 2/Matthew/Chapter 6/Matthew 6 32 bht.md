# Matthew 6:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As believers, it is unbecoming for us to pursue worldly desires like the unbelievers do, being ignorant of the greater blessings that God has in store for us. We are called to have supreme dedication to God, our Father, trusting in His providence and abundance of all good things. We must understand that our heavenly Father knows our needs, even the basic necessities of life, and He will provide for us. It is important to have faith in His care and affectionate concern for His children.
