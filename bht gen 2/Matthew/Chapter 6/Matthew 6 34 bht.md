# Matthew 6:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Each day has enough troubles of its own, and we should not be overly anxious about tomorrow. The future is uncertain, and it is foolish to waste our energy worrying about something that may never come. Instead, we should focus on the present and trust in God to provide for our needs. Allowing ourselves to be consumed by the cares of tomorrow only weighs us down and prevents us from fully experiencing the grace and peace that God offers us in the present.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "for the morrow will care for it, viz. for ἡ αὔριον mentioned above: i.e., will bring care enough about its own matters"
2. "after all your endeavour to avoid worldly cares, you will find quite enough, and more of them when to-morrow comes, about to-morrow itself: do not then increase those of to-day by introducing them before their time."
3. "A hint, as is the following κακία, that in this state of sin and infirmity the command of Mat 6:31 will never be completely observed."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof" - An admirable practical maxim, and better rendered in our version than in almost any other, not excepting the preceding English ones.
2. "Every day brings its own cares; and to anticipate is only to double them."


### Albert Barnes:
1. "Christ has here forcibly taught the necessity of charity, of prayer, and of all religious duties."
2. "The duty of prayer is urged by every consideration... How strange that any man can live, and not pour out his desires to God! How strange that anyone is willing to go to eternity with this sad reflection: 'I have gone through this world, spent my probation, wasted my strength, and am dying, and have never prayed!'"
3. "Satisfied with the troubles of today, let us not add to those troubles by anxieties about tomorrow. Rather, like the rest of the creation, let us depend on the aid of the universal Parent, and feel that he who hears the young ravens which cry will also supply our necessities."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The morrow is here personified."
2. "For the morrow will be anxious for itself. Not 'take care of itself,' but 'bring its own cares and anxieties,' do not foolishly increase those of today by borrowing from the morrow."
3. "Sufficient unto the day, or for the day, is the evil thereof. 'Evil' may mean natural or moral evil, suffering, or sin. The latter sense is the more usual one, the former suits the context better. Perhaps both may be included, the sin being the want of trust under the suffering. A hint that we never fully obey the precepts just uttered, because our dedication to God is so imperfect."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The last resort of the anxious soul when all other fears are allayed."
2. "The ghost of tomorrow stalks out with all its hobgoblins of doubt and distrust."

### John Gill:
1. "A man cannot promise or assure himself, that he shall have a morrow, and therefore it is great weakness and folly to be anxiously thoughtful about it."
2. "Perhaps tomorrow may not be, and thou wilt be found distressing thyself, for the time which is nothing to thee."
3. "Every day brings along with it fresh care and thought, being attended with fresh wants and troubles; and therefore, it is very unadvisable, to bring the cares and troubles of two days upon one."

### John Wesley:
1. "The morrow shall take thought for itself - That is, be careful for the morrow when it comes."
2. "But all trouble is, upon the whole, a real good. It is good physic which God dispenses daily to his children, according to the need and the strength of each."
