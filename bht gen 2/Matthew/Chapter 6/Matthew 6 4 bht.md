# Matthew 6:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus instructs his disciples to give alms in secret, he is emphasizing the importance of selfless acts without seeking applause or recognition. The idea is not to perform good works for the sake of appearing righteous to others, but to genuinely help those in need. This humble approach aligns with the admonition in the Talmud, which highlights the value of discreet giving to the poor. By placing the duty of giving alms before prayer, Jesus underscores its significance, as it was customary to give alms as a precursor to communing with God.
