# Matthew 6:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In every city, the synagogues played an important role as places of worship and community. They held regular services and housed a council of leaders, overseen by the ruler of the synagogue. While the term synagogue refers specifically to these religious buildings, it can also encompass any public space where people gather. This broad definition allows us to understand that the admonition against praying in public meant to avoid seeking attention and applause for one's piety in any public setting.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "They take pleasure, or love."
2. "No stress must be laid on this word as implying ostentation; for it was the ordinary posture of prayer."
3. "The synagogues were places of prayer; so that, as Theophyl. (Thol.), οὐ βλάπτει ὁ τόπος , ἀλλὰ ὁ τρόπος καὶ ὁ σκυπός."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And when thou prayest, thou shalt—or, preferably, 'when ye pray ye shall.'"
2. "The standing posture in prayer was the ancient practice, alike in the Jewish and in the early Christian Church. But of course this conspicuous posture opened the way for the ostentatious."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Hypocrites manifested the same spirit about prayer as almsgiving; it was done in public places."
2. "Our Lord evidently could not mean to condemn prayers in the synagogues."
3. "The Jews were much in the habit of praying in public places...they sought publicity, and regarded it as proof of great piety."

### John Calvin:
1. "We must not literally interpret the words, enter into thy closet: as if he ordered us to avoid the presence of men, or declared that we do not pray aright, except when there are no witnesses. He speaks comparatively, and means, that we ought rather to seek retirement than desire a crowd of men to see us praying."
2. "Whether a man prays alone, or in the presence of others, he ought to have the same feelings, as if he were shut up in his closet, and had no other witness but God."
3. "When Christ says, thy Father shall reward thee, he declares plainly that all the reward, which is promised to us in any part of Scripture, is not paid as a debt, but is a free gift."

2. "Not posture and place, but spirit and motive are condemned."
3. "The fashion of airing piety in this way has not died out."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In the synagogues and in the corners of the streets (εν ταις συναγωγαις κα εν ταις γωνιαις των πλατειων). These were the usual places of prayer (synagogues) and the street corners where crowds stopped for business or talk."
2. "If the hour of prayer overtook a Pharisee here, he would strike his attitude of prayer like a modern Moslem that men might see that he was pious."

### John Gill:
1. "Neither the posture, nor places of prayer, are condemned by our Lord, but their view in all to be seen of men."
2. "A considerable emphasis lies upon the word 'love'; they loved 'standing' in prayer, rather than any other posture, because they could be better seen."
3. "They liked public better than private prayer, because it gained them applause among men."

### John Wesley:
1. "The synagogues... were in every city from the time of the Babylonish captivity, and had service in them thrice a day on three days in the week."
2. "In every synagogue was a council of grave and wise persons, over whom was a president, called the ruler of the synagogue."
3. "But the word here, as well as in many other texts, signifies any place of public concourse."
