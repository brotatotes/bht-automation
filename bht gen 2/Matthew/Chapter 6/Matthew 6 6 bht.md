# Matthew 6:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When you pray, go into your own private space and keep it as secret as possible. Direct your prayers to your Father, who is unseen by human eyes but is fully aware of everything that happens in secret. Rest assured that your Father, who knows the depths of your heart and the sincerity of your prayers, will reward you openly with His abundant blessings, both in this life and in the life to come.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is not the simple publicity of prayer which is here condemned. It may be offered in any circumstances, however open, if not prompted by the spirit of ostentation, but dictated by the great ends of prayer itself."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There should be some place where we may be in secret - where we may be alone with God. There should be some 'place' to which we may resort where no ear will hear us but 'His' ear, and no eye can see us but His eye."
2. "The Saviour had all the difficulties which we can have, but yet he lived in the practice of secret prayer. To be alone, he rose up 'a great while before day,' and went into a solitary place and prayed."
3. "Prayer, then, is the element of being - the breath the vital air; and, then, the Christian must and should pray. He is the most eminent Christian who is most favored with such strong emotions urging him to prayer."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Closet [ταμιειον] . See on Luke 12:3.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "‘Thy’ implies that the place is one where the person can secure privacy."
2. "Private prayer, which is exclusively referred to here, is not to be performed in public places."
3. "Actual solitude may be impossible, but even in the midst of a crowd we may be alone with God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Into thy closet (εις το ταμειον). The word is a late syncopated form of ταμιειον from ταμιας (steward) and the root ταμ- from τεμνω, to cut."
2. "So it is a store-house, a separate apartment, one's private chamber, closet, or 'den' where he can withdraw from the world and shut the world out and commune with God."

### John Gill:
1. "Our Lord does not mean to exclude and condemn public prayer, but his view is to instruct persons that they should not only pray in public, but in private also; and especially the latter, which is more suitable and fitting for their particular cases, and less liable to pride, hypocrisy, and vanity."
2. "Pray to thy Father, which is in secret; who is invisible; not to be seen with the eyes of the body, but to be approached with a true heart, in faith and fear, through his Son Jesus Christ, the only mediator between God and man."
3. "Thy Father, which seeth in secret, observes and takes notice of the secret breathings, pantings, desires, and requests of thy heart and lips, shall reward thee openly, both here and hereafter; by pouring into thy bosom all the good things thou hast been praying for, both for time and eternity."

### John Wesley:
1. Enter into thy closet — That is, do it with as much secrecy as thou canst.
