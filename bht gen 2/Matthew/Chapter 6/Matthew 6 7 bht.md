# Matthew 6:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When praying, refrain from empty, meaningless repetitions or babbling, like the heathens or worshipers of idols who pray from morning till noon. Such vain and heathenish repetitions, without genuine meaning or intent, are dangerous and all too common. One's words in prayer, no matter how many or carefully crafted, hold no value if they do not reflect the sincere desires of the heart. The focus should not be on quantity or flowery language, but on the authenticity and depth of our prayers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The sense has generally been held to be, 'do not make unmeaning repetitions.'"
2. "Taking the word in its largest meaning, that of saying things irrelevant and senseless, it may well include all these."
3. "What is forbidden in this verse is not much praying, for our Lord Himself passed whole nights in prayer: not praying in the same words, for this He did in the very intensity of His agony at Gethsemane; but the making number and length a point of observance, and imagining that prayer will be heard, not because it is the genuine expression of the desire of faith, but because it is of such a length, has been such a number of times repeated."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Babble not" would be a better rendering, both for the form of the word—which in both languages is intended to imitate the sound—and for the sense, which expresses not so much the repetition of the same words as a senseless multiplication of them; as appears from what follows.
2. This method of heathen devotion is still observed by Hindu and Mohammedan devotees.
3. But praying much, and using at times the same words, is not here condemned, and has the example of our Lord Himself in its favor.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Use not vain repetitions - The original word here is supposed to be derived from the name of a Greek poet, who made long and weary verses, declaring by many forms and endless repetitions the same sentiment."
2. "The next move will bring him to his knees, and then, settling back upon his heels, he will mumble over various small petitions, with sundry grunts and exclamations, according to taste and habit."
3. "Christ does not fix the length of our prayers. He says that we should not repeat the same thing, as though God did not hear; and it is not improbable that he intended to condemn the practice of long prayers. His own supplications were remarkably short."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Use vain repetitions [βατταλογησητε] . A word formed in imitation of the sound, battalogein: properly, to stammer; then to babble or prate, to repeat the same formula many times..."
2. "...as the worshippers of Baal and of Diana of Ephesus (1 Kings 18:26; Acts 19:34) and the Romanists with their paternosters and aves."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ reproves the folly of those who, with the view of persuading and entreating God, pour out a superfluity of words."
2. "The grace of God is not obtained by an unmeaning flow of words; but, on the contrary, a devout heart throws out its affections, like arrows, to pierce heaven."
3. "This condemns the superstition of those who entertain the belief, that they will secure the favor of God by long murmurings."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Use not vain repetitions. The correct sense of the Greek word (lit, ‘to speak stammeringly’) is given in our English version, although all senseless and irrelevant expressions are included."
2. "There may be ‘vain repetitions’ of the Lord’s Prayer, which immediately follows. Hence Luther calls it ‘the greatest martyr.’ ‘What is forbidden here is not  much praying, not praying  in the same words  (the Lord did both); but the making number and length a  point of observance.’" 
3. "For they think they shall be heard for their much speaking. A second error; the first seeking to gain merit before men; this, attempting to gain merit before God. Prayer, not a magical charm, but a reasonable service. ‘Much speaking’ not much praying;’ vain repetition’ of heathen origin; merely external worship leads to senseless and sinful worship."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Use not vain repetitions...mere babbling or chattering, empty repetition."
2. "Certainly Jesus does not mean to condemn all repetition in prayer since he himself prayed three times in Gethsemane 'saying the same words again.'"
3. "The Pagans thought that by endless repetitions and many words they would inform their gods as to their needs and weary them into granting their requests."

### John Gill:
1. "But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions,.... Saying the same things over and over again,as the Heathens do, as the worshippers of Baal, from morning till noon." 
2. "This our Lord observes, to dissuade from such practices, because the Gentiles, who were odious to the Jews, used them, and the Jews were guilty of the same; had they not, there would not have been any need of such advice."
3. "Moreover, their prayer books abound in tautologies, and in expressing the same things in different words, and by a multiplicity of them."

### John Wesley:
1. "Use not vain repetitions — To repeat any words without meaning them, is certainly a vain repetition."
2. "The vain and heathenish repetitions which we are here warned against, are most dangerous, and yet very common; which is a principal cause why so many, who still profess religion, are a disgrace to it."
3. "Indeed all the words in the world are not equivalent to one holy desire. And the very best prayers are but vain repetitions, if they are not the language of the heart."
