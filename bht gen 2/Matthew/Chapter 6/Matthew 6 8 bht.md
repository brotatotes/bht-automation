# Matthew 6:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Prayer is not about informing God of our needs, as He already knows them before we even ask. Instead, prayer serves to acknowledge our dependence on Him and cultivate a disposition to receive His grace and blessings. The omniscience of God should encourage us to approach Him in prayer, recognizing that He knows us intimately and anticipates our needs. Through prayer, we not only express our desires but also deepen our dependence on God and foster a relentless pursuit of His blessings in our lives.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "εἰ οἶδε, φησίν, ὧν χρείαν ἔχομεν, τίνος ἕνεκεν εὔχεσθαι δεῖ?"
2. "ἵνα διδάξῃς, ἀλλ ʼ ἵνα ἐπικάμψῃς · ἵνα οἰκειωθῇς τῇ συνεχείᾳ τῆς ἐντεύξεως, ἵνα ταπεινωθῇς, ἵνα ἀναμνησθῇς τῶν ἁμαρτημάτων τῶν σῶν."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Your Father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye ask him—and so needs not to be informed of our wants, any more than to be roused to attend to them by our incessant speaking."
2. "What a view of God is here given, in sharp contrast with the gods of the heathen!"
3. "Yet He will have His children pray to Him, and links all His promised supplies to their petitions for them; thus encouraging us to draw near and keep near to Him, to talk and walk with Him, to open our every case to Him, and assure ourselves that thus asking we shall receive—thus seeking we shall find—thus knocking it shall be opened to us."

### John Calvin:
1. "Whoever is convinced, that God not only cares for us, but knows all our wants, and anticipates our wishes and anxieties before we have stated them, will leave out vain repetitions."
2. "Believers do not pray, with the view of informing God about things unknown to him, or of exciting him to do his duty, or of urging him as though he were reluctant. On the contrary, they pray, in order that they may arouse themselves to seek him, that they may exercise their faith in meditating on his promises, that they may relieve themselves from their anxieties by pouring them into his bosom."
3. "We must, therefore, maintain both of these truths, that He freely anticipates our wishes, and yet that we obtain by prayer what we ask."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Our prayers do not tell 'our Father' of our needs, but simply confess our consciousness of them, and our trust that He can and will supply them."
2. "Both of these feelings must precede answer to prayer."
3. "Hence the reason holds good against vain repetitions, not against childlike petitions."

### John Gill:
1. "Do not be imitators of them, and follow their ways, who have only the dim light of nature to guide them."
2. "It would be shameful in you to do as they do when you have a divine revelation for your direction."
3. "The omniscience of God is a considerable argument and a great encouragement to prayer; he knows our persons and our wants beforehand."

### John Wesley:
1. "We do not pray to inform God of our wants. Omniscient as he is, he cannot be informed of any thing which he knew not before."
2. "The chief thing wanting is, a fit disposition on our part to receive his grace and blessing."
3. "Consequently, one great office of prayer is, to produce such a disposition in us: to exercise our dependence on God; to increase our desire of the things we ask for; to us so sensible of our wants, that we may never cease wrestling till we have prevailed for the blessing."
