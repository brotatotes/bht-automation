## BHT:
This prayer serves as a model and guide for us to follow, encompassing all of our true needs and expressing our legitimate desires. It is not intended as a rigid formula, but as a pattern to shape our prayers and direct our approach to God. The opening words, addressing God as our Father, remind us of our intimate relationship with Him and the privilege we have in coming before His presence. The mention of God's name emphasizes the reverence and awe we should have for Him, recognizing His divine nature and the perfection of His character.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The variations in Luke have been regarded as fatal to the supposition of its being used liturgically at the time when these Gospels were written."
2. "These opening words of the Lord’s Prayer set clearly before us the status of the Christian, as believing in, depending upon, praying to, a real objective personal GOD, lifted above himself."
3. "God’s Name is not merely His appellation, which we speak with the mouth, but also and principally the idea which we attach to it, His Being, as far as it is confessed, revealed, or known."

### John Calvin:
1. "He embraces, therefore, in six petitions what we are at liberty to ask from God. Nothing is more advantageous to us than such instruction."
2. "Let us therefore know, that we shall be in a state of mind for praying in a right manner, if we not only are in earnest about ourselves and our own advantage but assign the first place to the glory of God."
3. "The substance of this petition is, that the glory of God may shine in the world, and may be duly acknowledged by men. But religion is in its highest purity and rigour when men believe, that whatever proceeds from God is right and proper, full of righteousness and wisdom."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The beauty of the Lord’s Prayer is in its unity, symmetry, completeness, and pervading spirit."
2. "It embodies all essential desires of a praying heart, resembling in this respect a pearl on which the light of heaven plays."
3. "The very preface to the Lord’s Prayer is a denial of Atheism, Pantheism, and Deism, since it recognizes a God, a Personal God, who is our Father through Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It should be called 'The Model Prayer' rather than 'The Lord's Prayer.' 'Thus' pray as he gives them a model. He himself did not use it as a liturgy."
2. "There is no evidence that Jesus meant it for liturgical use by others."
3. "God is the Father of all men in one sense; the recognition of Him as the Father in the full sense is the first step in coming back to him in regeneration and conversion."

### John Gill:
1. "This prayer is not a strict form, but a pattern of prayer, and a directory to it, both as to brevity, order, and matter."
2. "By 'father,' our Lord means the first person in the Trinity, who is the Father of all men by creation, and of the saints by adoption; who are to address him in prayer under the character of 'our Father,' partly to command a reverential fear of him, and partly to secure boldness and liberty of speech before him."
3. "By the 'name' of God is meant he himself, the perfections of his nature, and the several names by which he is known, and which we are to think and speak of with holy reverence."

### John Wesley:
1. "He who best knew what we ought to pray for, and how we ought to pray, what matter of desire, what manner of address would most please himself, would best become us, has here dictated to us a most perfect and universal form of prayer, comprehending all our real wants, expressing all our lawful desires; a complete directory and full exercise of all our devotions."
