# Matthew 7:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Judge not, as Christ warns, does not mean that all forms of judgment are prohibited. The context clarifies that it is the inclination to view others unfavorably and pronounce rash and unfair judgments that is condemned. This disposition leads to violations of the law of love. Christ does not condemn judging as a magistrate according to justice, but rather speaks against the habit of forming hasty and harsh judgments without considering mitigating factors and expressing them unnecessarily. By exercising discernment in a charitable manner, we avoid both the judgment of men and the stricter judgment of God.

3. "And yet it is by our own fault that we draw upon ourselves that very thing which our nature so strongly detests, for which of us is there, who does not examine too severely the actions of others; who does not manifest undue rage against slight offenses; or who does not peevishly censure what was in itself indifferent?"
