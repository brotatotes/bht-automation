# Matthew 7:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If someone were to ask for a fish, would they be given a serpent instead? This analogy highlights the deceptive and hurtful nature of offering something that is not what it appears to be. It's like mistaking bread for a stone or a fish for a serpent, misunderstanding the good gifts that God provides. This passage serves to illustrate the absurdity and inhumanity of such behavior. We can see from this analogy that such actions are completely contrary to what is expected of decent human beings, and are only found among monsters in nature.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 10. Or if he ask a fish, will he
	give him a serpent?—like it, indeed, but only to sting him.

### Philip Schaff:
1. Matthew 7:10.  A serpent.  A response both deceptive and hurtful. We often deem the bread a stone, and the fish a serpent, misunderstanding God’s good gifts.
	

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Fish--serpent  (ιχθυν--οφιν). Fish, common article of food, and water-snakes could easily be substituted. Anacoluthon in this sentence in the Greek. 

### John Gill:
1. "Fish and bread are mentioned, because these were common food." 
2. "In Luke 11:12 it is added, 'or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?' which is used, as the rest, to show the absurdity and inhumanity of such conduct."
3. "Nothing of this kind is to be found among men, unless it be among monsters in nature."
