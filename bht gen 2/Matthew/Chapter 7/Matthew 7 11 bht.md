# Matthew 7:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If we, as imperfect parents, know how to give good things to our children, how much more will our heavenly Father give good things to those who ask Him? Despite our fallen nature, the fatherly instinct within us is not extinguished. Just as the parable of the unjust judge reminds us, when we approach God with persistence in prayer, He is eager to grant us what is good. Therefore, let us align our desires with His will and strive to imitate the God of love, for He gives only good gifts that lead to life and godliness.
