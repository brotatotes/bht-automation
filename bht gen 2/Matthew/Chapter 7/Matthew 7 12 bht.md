# Matthew 7:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Golden Rule, as stated in Luke 6:31, is a universal command that applies to all people, regardless of their religious background. It encapsulates the essence of fulfilling God's law and is rooted in both the teachings of the Old Testament and the natural moral compass of humanity. By following this rule, we are reminded to treat others as we would like to be treated, showing kindness, fairness, and empathy in our interactions.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Dixit hoc Pythagoras, dixit hoc Plato.… Propterea si inventus fuerit aliquis eorum hoc dixisse quod dixit et Christus, gratulamur illi, non sequimur illum. Sed prior fuit ille quam Christus. Si quis vera loquitur, prior est quam ipsa Veritas! O homo, attende Christum, non quando ad te venerit, sed quando te fecerit."
2. "Be ye like unto God."
3. "We are to think what we should like done to us, and then apply that rule to our dealings with others: viz., by doing to them what we have reason to suppose they would like done to them."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This is the substance of all relative duty; all Scripture in a nutshell."
2. "The righteousness of the kingdom...would be seen to involve self-sacrifice at every step."
3. "This would divide all within the sound of these truths into two classes: the many, who will follow the path of ease and self-indulgence—end where it might; and the few, who, bent on eternal safety above everything else, take the way that leads to it—at whatever cost."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "All things whatsoever ... - This command has been usually called the 'Saviour’s golden rule,' a name given to it on account of its great value."
2. "Act not from selfishness or injustice, but put yourself in the place of the other, and ask what you would expect of him."
3. "It would prevent all irregularity of movement in the moral world, as that does in a steam-engine."

### John Calvin:
1. "We are here informed, that the only reason why so many quarrels exist in the world, and why men inflict so many mutual injuries on each other, is, that they knowingly and willingly trample justice under their feet, while every man rigidly demands that it shall be maintained towards himself."
2. "Christ therefore shows, that every man may be a rule of acting properly and justly towards his neighbors, if he do to others what he requires to be done to him."
3. "The meaning is, that the second table of the law is fulfilled, when every man conducts himself in the same manner towards others, as he wishes them to conduct themselves towards him."

2. "Not, do to others what we would have them do to us (this might become mere barter); but, do to them what we think they would wish to have done to them." 
3. "The Golden Rule, though not without parallels in heathen ethics (in a negative form), is distinctively Christian. It presents God’s benevolence as the guide of duty."

### John Gill:

### John Wesley:
1. Luke 6:31.
