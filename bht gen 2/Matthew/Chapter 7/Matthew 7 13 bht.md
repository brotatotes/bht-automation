# Matthew 7:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The first step in religion requires us to triumph over our natural inclinations, embarking on a narrow and thorny road. Christ reminds his disciples that the gate is at the beginning, not the end, emphasizing the entrance to the narrow path. This path, though challenging, leads to life. On the other hand, the wide gate is easily entered and the broad way easily trodden, leading to destruction. The broad way appeals to many, but its end is ruin. The narrow gate and road, though difficult, lead to true life and should be chosen over the easy path to destruction.

### Philip Schaff:

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The narrow gate" is repeated in verse Matthew 7:14 and straitened the way (τεθλιμμενη η οδος) added. The way is "compressed," narrowed as in a defile between high rocks, a tight place like στενοχωρια in Romans 8:35.
2. "The way that leads to life involves straits and afflictions" (McNeile).
3. "The broad way" (ευρυχωρος) is in every city, town, village, with the glaring white lights that lure to destruction.

### John Gill:
1. "By the 'strait gate' is meant Christ himself... as he is into the church below, and into all the ordinances and privileges of it; as also to the Father, by whom we have access unto him, and are let into communion with him, and a participation of all the blessings of grace..."
2. "This is called 'strait'; because faith in Christ, a profession of it, and a life and conversation agreeable to it, are attended with many afflictions, temptations, reproaches, and persecutions."
3. "For wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction; so that the one may be easily known from the other... it takes in a large compass of vices, and has in it abundance of company; but its end is destruction."

### John Wesley:
1. "The strait gate - The holiness described in the foregoing chapters. And this is the narrow way."
2. "Wide is the gate, and many there are that go in through it - They need not seek for this; they come to it of course."
3. "Many go in through it, because strait is the other gate - Therefore they do not care for it; they like a wider gate."
