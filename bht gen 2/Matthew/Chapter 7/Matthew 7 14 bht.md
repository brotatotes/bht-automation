# Matthew 7:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The way to destruction is broad because so many choose to follow it, even though it ultimately leads to their own demise. On the other hand, the way to life is narrow and restricted, causing many to shy away from it. This narrow path is not easy to walk on, as it requires constant self-denial and is filled with afflictions and tribulations. However, the reward is worth it, for this is the path that leads to eternal life. Despite its difficulties, the narrow way is the only way that leads to true fulfillment and salvation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The reason why the way to destruction is so broad, is because so few find their way into the narrow path of life."
2. "The reason why so many perish is not that it is so ordained by God, who will have all to come to the knowledge of the truth, but because so few will come to Christ, that they may have life; and the rest perish in their sins."
3. "τεθλιμμένη, restricted, crushed in, in breadth: i.e. as Clem. Alex Strom. Matthew 7:5 (31), p. 664 Ρ, … τὴν μὲν … στενὴν κ. τεθλιμμένην τὴν κατὰ τὰς ἐντολὰς κ. ἀπαγορεύσεις περιεσταλμένην, τὴν δὲ ἐναντίαν τὴν εἰς ἀπώλειαν φέρουσαν, πλατεῖαν κ. εὐρύχωρον, ἀκώλυτον ἡδοναῖς τε καὶ θυμῷ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The whole course is as difficult as the first step."
2. "The recommendation of the broad way is the ease with which it is trodden and the abundance of company to be found in it...The one disadvantage of this course is its end—it 'leadeth to destruction.'"
3. "The disadvantage of [the narrow way] lies in its narrowness and solicitude. Its very first step involves a revolution in all our purposes and plans for life, and a surrender of all that is dear to natural inclination."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Even after we pass through the gate the Christian course continues difficult, is a constant conflict and self-denial, but it leadeth unto life."
2. "The way to destruction is broad 'because' it is used by so many."
3. "Few are they that find the straitened way. It is not even discovered by most, much less entered upon. This not because God has made it so 'strait,' but because so few desire to find it."

### John Gill:
1. "The way is unpleasant to the flesh to walk in, being hedged up on each side with afflictions and tribulations."
2. "The great encouragement to walk on in it is, because it is that way which leadeth unto life: unto eternal life."
3. "The flesh loves to walk at liberty, unconfined, and uncontrolled, and with a multitude to do evil: hence, Zion's ways are thin of passengers; a small number, comparatively speaking, walk thereto, and will be saved."
