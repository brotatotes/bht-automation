# Matthew 7:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Beware of those who pretend to guide you into the narrow way but lead you astray. False prophets come in sheep's clothing, appearing innocent and righteous, yet inwardly they are greedy, seeking their own gain. They assume the appearance of holiness to deceive others and achieve their own selfish purposes. Their false teachings and deceptive actions pose a constant threat to the Church. We must be on guard and discerning, not allowing ourselves to be misled by their false doctrines. Stay steadfast and vigilant, for throughout history, false prophets have always reappeared, preying on those who lack discernment.
