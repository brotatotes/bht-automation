# Matthew 7:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By their fruits, the true nature of teachers is revealed. This principle serves as a clear method to discern true from false prophets. True prophets bear fruits of conversion and strengthening believers in their faith. False prophets lack the power to turn people from the influence of Satan to God. This criterion for discernment is accessible to all, making it an invaluable tool for identifying true messengers from God.
