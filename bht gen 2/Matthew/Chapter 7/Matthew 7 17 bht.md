# Matthew 7:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A tree is known by its fruit, and in the moral world, this principle holds true. A good tree, one that is inherently good, will produce good fruit. It is not the fruit that makes the tree good, but rather, the tree's nature that determines the quality of its fruit. Similarly, a good person will naturally perform good works because they are already good, rather than their actions making them good. Likewise, a minister who is filled with the good treasure of Gospel truths will bring forth valuable teachings for the spiritual growth of others.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Mala ergo arbor fructus bonos facere non potest; sed ex mala fieri bona potest, ut bonos fructus ferat." 
2. "These verses were his weapon against the shallow Pelagian scheme, which would look at men’s deeds apart from the living Root in man out of which they grew, and suppose that man’s unaided will is capable of good."
3. "ἐπιγν., more than simply γνώσεσθε: 'ye shall thoroughly know them;’ see 1 Corinthians 13:12."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 17. Even so every good tree bringeth
	forth good fruit: but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'corrupt' here does not signify... that the tree 'had been' good, but had become 'vitiated;' but that it was a tree of a useless character, of a nature that produced nothing beneficial."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "As the tree, so is the fruit. The principle holds good in the moral world."
2. "Every good tree, i.e., of a good nature for bearing fruit."
3. "Our Lord applies the general law to men’s actions and their moral results; these are but manifestations of a moral nature, depraved or sanctified."

### John Gill:
1. "The tree that brings forth good fruit, is good antecedent to the fruit it produces; it is first good, and then puts forth good fruit: it is not the fruit that makes the tree good, but makes it appear to be so."
2. "As a good man does, and will do good works, but his works do not make him a good man; he is so before he performs good works, or he would never be able to do them; these make him appear to be a good man."
3. "Such a good minister of the Gospel, out of the good treasure of Gospel truths put into his earthen vessel, will bring forth, from time to time, good and excellent truths, to the edification and profit of those that hear."
