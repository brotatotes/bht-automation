# Matthew 7:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither a corrupt tree good fruit. This passage emphasizes that the quality of the fruit is directly related to the nature of the tree. It is not simply about individual morality, but rather about the doctrine being preached. Even a bad man can speak the truth and convert sinners, but it does not make him a true prophet. The key is that only those who speak the truth and convert sinners are true prophets.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit—Obvious as is the truth here expressed in different forms—that the heart determines and is the only proper interpreter of the actions of our life—no one who knows how the Church of Rome makes a merit of actions, quite apart from the motives that prompt them, and how the same tendency manifests itself from time to time even among Protestant Christians, can think it too obvious to be insisted on by the teachers of divine truth."

### John Gill:
1. "A man that is unprincipled with the grace of God, has an experimental acquaintance with the Gospel of Christ, and is guided by the Spirit of God into all truth, as it is in Jesus, cannot knowingly deliver, maintain, and abide by any doctrine that is contrary to the glory of God's grace."
2. "A corrupt preacher, one destitute of the truth of the Gospel, reprobate concerning the faith, who never had any experience of the doctrines of grace, and denies them in the theory of them, cannot, consistent with himself, and his own principles, deliver, or preach good doctrine."
3. "As our Lord means by 'a good tree', not a good man, barely, or one that is made so by the grace of God; but a good minister, one that is furnished by the Spirit of God, and is well instructed in the kingdom of heaven."

### John Wesley:
1. "A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither a corrupt tree good fruit"
2. "The goodness or badness here mentioned respects the doctrine, rather than the personal character."
3. "For a bad man preaching the good doctrine here delivered, is sometimes an instrument of converting sinners to God."
4. "Yet I do not aver, that all are true prophets who speak the truth, and thereby convert sinners."
5. "I only affirm, that none are such who do not."
