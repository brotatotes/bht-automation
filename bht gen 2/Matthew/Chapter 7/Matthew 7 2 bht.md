# Matthew 7:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In our actions and judgments towards others, we determine the measure by which God will judge us. This principle is expressed in the words, With what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you. We should be mindful of our judgments, choosing to be fair and merciful rather than harsh and unkind. The way we judge others will ultimately influence the judgment we receive. May we always show love and mercy, for in doing so, we open ourselves to the same benevolence from both God and man.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἐν, not instrumental, but of the sphere in which the act takes place, i.e. in this case, the measure, according to which"
2. "as in ref. 2 Cor., ἐν ἑαυτοῖς ἑαυτοὺς μετροῦντες"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For with what judgments ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete—it shall be measured to you again."
2. "This proverbial maxim is used by our Lord in other connections—as in Mark 4:24, and with a slightly different application in Mark 4:24-."
3. "Unkind judgment of others will be judicially returned upon ourselves, in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ."
4. "Such harsh judgment gets self-punished even here. For people shrink from contact with those who systematically deal out harsh judgment upon others—naturally concluding that they themselves may be the next victims—and feel impelled in self-defense, when exposed to it, to roll back upon the assailant his own censures."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "With what judgment ... - This was a proverb among the Jews. It expressed a truth; and Christ did not hesitate to adopt it as conveying his own sentiments."
2. "It refers no less to the way in which people will judge of us than to the rule by which God will judge us."
3. "Mete - Measure. You shall be judged by the same rule which you apply to others."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The 'measure' according to which God's judgment will take place, namely, our own severe judgment."
2. "The second clause repeats the same idea, making it more general."

### John Gill:
1. "He that judgeth his neighbour according to the balance of righteousness, or innocence, they judge him according to righteousness."
2. "When you see a man as it were in "equilibrio", inclining to neither part, it is not clear from what he does, that he is either good or evil, righteous or unrighteous; yet when you see him do a thing which may be interpreted either to a good or a bad sense, it ought always to be interpreted to the best."
3. "With what measure a man measures, they measure to him": one might fill up almost a page, in referring to places, where it is used in this form: besides those in the margin, take the following, and the rather, because it gives instances of this retaliation."

### John Wesley:
1. "With what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you — Awful words! So we may, as it were, choose for ourselves, whether God shall be severe or merciful to us."
2. "God and man will favour the candid and benevolent: but they must expect judgment without mercy, who have showed no mercy."
