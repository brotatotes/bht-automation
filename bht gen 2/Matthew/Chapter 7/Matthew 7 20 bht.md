# Matthew 7:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The means of detecting false teachings lies not only in the end result, but also in the actions and influence of those who profess to be teachers. Their fruits, or their outward actions and their moral impact, reveal their true character and intentions. It is crucial to be aware of the hypocrisy of those who cloak themselves in religious virtue and use it as a facade to deceive others. Underneath these sheep's clothing, they promote corrupt and harmful doctrines that undermine the true message of Christ and harm the souls of those who follow them.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But the point I now press is not so much the end of such, as the means of detecting them; and this, as already said, is their fruits."
2. "The hypocrisy of teachers now leads to a solemn warning against religious hypocrisy in general."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "â€˜Fruits,â€™ If in this case not â€˜actions,â€™ as usually, the actions of the false teachers were decisive as to their character."
2. "â€˜acts seemingly virtuous are often nothing more than the sheepâ€™s clothing in which the wolf wraps himself in order that he may deceive and devour the sheep." 
3. "Their influence, the moral effect of their teaching, is meant. Their acts may be included, and also the influence exerted upon the doctrinal belief of others."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. See on Matthew 7:16. 

### John Gill:
1. "The sum of the whole is, that ordinarily, and generally speaking, as men are, so are the doctrines they preach, and by them they may be known, and judged to be what they are."
2. "Christ here, and in the preceding verses, is speaking not of men of bad lives and conversations, who take upon them to teach others; but of men that put on sheep's clothing, who pretended to much holiness of life and conversation, and strictness of religion."
3. "Under that disguise, they delivered out the most corrupt and unwholesome doctrines, which tended greatly to depreciate him and his grace, and to do damage to the souls of men."
