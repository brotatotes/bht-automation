# Matthew 7:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Not everyone who professes their allegiance to Jesus as Lord will enter into eternal glory, but only those who truly do the will of God. Mere lip service and empty professions are not enough to gain entrance into the kingdom of heaven. It is through heartfelt obedience and faithful adherence to the teachings of Jesus that one truly demonstrates their discipleship. True disciples are not just listeners, but doers of the will of their Heavenly Father.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The doom of the hypocritical false prophets introduces the doom of all hypocrites, and brings on the solemn close of the whole, in which the hypocrite and the true disciple are parabolically compared."
2. "Observe that here the Lord sets Himself forth as the Judge in the great day, and at the same time speaks not of τὸ θέλ. μου, but τὸ θέλ. τοῦ πατρός μου: an important and invaluable doctrinal landmark in this very opening of His ministry in the first Gospel."
3. "The context must rule the meaning of such wide words as λέγει. Here it is evidently used of mere lip homage; but in οὐδεὶς δύναται εἰπεῖν Κύριος Ἰησοῦς εἰ μὴ ἐν πνεύματι ἁγίῳ, 1 Corinthians 12:3, the 'saying' has the deeper meaning of a genuine heartfelt confession."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord—the reduplication of the title 'Lord' denoting zeal in according it to Christ."
2. "He that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven—that will which it had been the great object of this discourse to set forth."
3. "And He so speaks here to give authority to His asseverations."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The power of working miracles had no necessary connection with piety."
2. "Saving power on the mind is the work of God, and he may convey it by any agency which he chooses."
3. "Many may be found in the day of judgment who may have been endowed with powers of prophecy or miracle, as Balaam or the magicians of Egypt; in the same way as many people of distinguished talents may be found, yet destitute of piety, and who will be shut out of his kingdom."

### John Calvin:
1. "Whoever then desires to be reckoned among the disciples, must labor to devote himself, sincerely and honestly, to the exercises of a new life."
2. "To do the will of the Father not only means, to regulate their life and manners by the rule of virtues, but also to believe in Christ."
3. "These words, therefore, do not exclude faith, but presuppose it as the principle from which other good works flow."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Not every one. The really pious profess Christ, but not all who profess are really pious."
2. "But he that doeth, etc. Of all who thus confess, only those doing the will of God shall enter into the Kingdom of heaven."
3. "My Father. The whole Gospel shows that this means a closer relation than that expressed by the phrases, ‘your Father,’ ‘our Father.’ Christ, the only begotten Son, always addresses God as ‘Father,’ or ‘my Father.’"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Not--but  (ου--αλλ'). Sharp contrast between the mere talker and the doer of God's will. 

### John Gill:
1. "Not everyone that saith unto me Lord, Lord,.... Not every one that calls Christ his Lord and Master, professes subjection to him, or that calls upon his name, or is called by his name; or makes use of it in his public ministrations."
2. "But of eternal glory, into which none shall enter, but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven."
3. "These words chiefly respect preachers, the sense of them is this, that only such who are faithful dispensers of the word shall enter into the joy of their Lord."

### John Wesley:
1. "No one that saith, Lord, Lord - That makes a mere profession of me and my religion, shall enter."
2. "He that doth the will of my Father - as I have now declared it."
3. "Every thing short of this is only saying, Lord, Lord."
