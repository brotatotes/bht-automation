# Matthew 7:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On that day, those who prophesied and did mighty works in the name of the Lord will be shocked to hear him declare, I never knew you. Their pleas of their accomplishments, their preaching, and their miracles will be of no avail on the great day of judgment. The number of false teachers and hypocrites is large, and their worldly success is not a true indicator of their knowledge of Christ. It is a solemn reminder that one's knowledge of Christ and relationship with him cannot be measured by outward success or the performance of miraculous acts.
