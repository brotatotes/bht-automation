# Matthew 7:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus declares, 'I never knew you,' meaning that He never approved or had any affection for their conduct. Despite their claims of saving others, they themselves were not saved from their sins. These words should bring us to self-examination, asking ourselves if this could be our own case.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ὅτι οὐδ . ἔγν . ὑμ . after ἀποχ ., &c., in which case the meaning ‘ for, because ,' would be right." 
2. "ὁμολογήσω is here a remarkable word, as a statement of the simple truth of facts, as opposed to the false colouring and self-deceit of the hypocrites 'I will tell them the plain truth.'" 
3. "Neither the preaching Christ, nor doing miracles in His Name, are infallible signs of being His genuine servants, but only the devotion of life to God’s will which this knowledge brings about."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I never knew you—What they claimed—intimacy with Christ—is just what He repudiates, and with a certain scornful dignity. 'Our acquaintance was not broken off—there never was any.'"
2. "depart from me—(Compare Matthew 25:41). The connection here gives these words an awful significance. They claimed intimacy with Christ, and in the corresponding passage, Matthew 25:41- :, are represented as having gone out and in with Him on familiar terms. 'So much the worse for you,' He replies: 'I bore with that long enough; but now—begone!'"
3. "ye that work iniquity—not 'that wrought iniquity'; for they are represented as fresh from the scenes and acts of it as they stand before the Judge."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I never knew you - That is, I never approved of your conduct; never loved you; never regarded you as my friends." 
2. "This proves that, with all their pretensions, they had never been true followers of Christ." 
3. "I do not know of a more decided proof that Christians do not fall from grace than this text."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Profess [ομολογησω] . The word which is used elsewhere of open confession of Christ before men (Matthew 10:32; Romans 10:9); of John's public declaration that he was not the Christ (John 1:20); of Herod 's promise to Salome in the presence of his guests (Matthew 14:7). Hence, therefore, of Christ 's open, public declaration as Judge of the world." 
2. "The picture is not of two men deliberately selecting foundations, but it contrasts one who carefully chooses and prepares his foundation with one who builds at hap-hazard. This is more strongly brought out by Luke (vi. 48) : 'Who digged and went deep, and laid a foundation upon the rock' (Rev.)."
3. "The abrupt style of ver. 25 pictures the sudden coming of the storm which sweeps away the house on the sand: 'Descended the rain, and came the floods, and blew the winds.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "They indeed have confessed me with the tongue, and imagine that they have fully discharged their duty. The confession of my name is now heard aloud from their tongue. But I too will confess on the opposite side, that their profession is deceitful and false."
2. "He orders those persons to go out from his presence, who had stolen, under a false title, an unjust and temporary possession of his house. ...He declares that they were disowned by the Lord, though by a vain show they captivated the eyes of men."
3. "He then exhorts all those who wish to be reckoned among the disciples of Christ, to withdraw early from iniquity, that Christ may not drive them from his presence, when he shall 'separate the sheep from the goats.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They make false professions, but 'I will tell them the plain truth.'"
2. "Intimate knowledge of persons implies sympathy and similarity."
3. "The seeming success of a hypocrite is habitual and heightened iniquity. Important for self-examinations."

### John Gill:
1. "I never knew you; which must be understood consistent with the omniscience of Christ."
2. "The meaning of Christ here is, I never had any love, or affection for you; I never esteemed you; I never approved of you, nor your conduct."
3. "The former of these expressions contains the awful sentence pronounced by Christ, the judge; which is, banishment from his presence, than which nothing is more terrible."

### John Wesley:
1. "I never knew you - There never was a time that I approved of you."
2. "...as many souls as they had saved, they were themselves never saved from their sins."
3. "Lord, is it my case?"
