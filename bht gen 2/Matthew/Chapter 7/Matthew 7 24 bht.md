# Matthew 7:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who hear the words of Christ and do them will be like the wise builder who lays a foundation upon the rock. This foundation, which is the person, blood, and righteousness of Christ, is firm, strong, and immoveable. It is through God's efficacious grace that this foundation is established, and when our lives are built upon it, we can rise to the Mount of Beatitudes in our spiritual journey.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Notice the ὅστις both times, not merely ὅς. ὅς identifies only: ὅστις classifies."
2. "τοὺς λόγους τούτους seems to bind together the Sermon, and preclude, as indeed does the whole structure of the Sermon, the supposition that these last chapters are merely a collection of sayings uttered at different times."
3. "ὁμοιώσω αὐτόν (or, ὁμοιωθήσεται)] Meyer and Tholuck take this word to signify, not ‘I will compare him,’ but ‘I will make him like,’ viz. ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ, as in ch. Matthew 6:8; Romans 9:29. But it is, perhaps, more in analogy with the usage of the Lord’s discourses to understand it, I will compare him: so ὁμοιώσω, ch. Matthew 11:10; Luke 13:18, and reff."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
