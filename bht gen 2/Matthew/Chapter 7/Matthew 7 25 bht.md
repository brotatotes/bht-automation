# Matthew 7:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who heed and follow the words of Christ are like a house built on a rock, finding stability and security in Him. In contrast, those who only listen without putting His teachings into practice lack a firm foundation and are vulnerable in times of adversity. The imagery of rain, floods, and winds symbolizes the challenges and trials of life. By grounding ourselves in Christ, we can withstand the storms and difficulties that come our way. Building our lives upon Him ensures that our actions are rooted in our connection with Him, granting us the strength and steadfastness to endure.
