# Matthew 7:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who merely hear the teachings of Jesus without truly understanding or believing them are like foolish builders who despise and reject them. Their reliance on empty professions and external acts of service without a genuine foundation of faith is akin to building a house on sand that cannot bear weight. This serves as a stark reminder that true discipleship requires more than just hearing sermons; it necessitates putting the teachings into practice and building on the solid foundation of faith in Christ.
