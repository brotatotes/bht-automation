# Matthew 7:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The builders and their structure are no match for the trials and temptations they face. The force of Satan's temptations, the floodwaters of persecution from the world, and the torrents of their own sinful desires will ultimately cause their downfall. Their destruction is certain and irreparable. True obedience involves following Christ further and living out His teachings in our lives by doing good works and immersing ourselves in His law. The firm foundation we build through obedience will withstand the storms of life.
