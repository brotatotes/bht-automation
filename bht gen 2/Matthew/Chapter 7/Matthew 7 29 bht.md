# Matthew 7:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus taught the multitudes with a unique authority, demonstrating the power of the Spirit. His teaching was not like that of the scribes, who only expounded the law without life or effect. He spoke with dignity and majesty, carrying the weight of his own authority rather than relying on the testimony of others.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The assertion is spread more widely, by this resolved imperfect, over His whole course of teaching."
2. "Οὐ γὰρ εἰς ἕτερον ἀναφέρων, ὡς ὁ προφήτης καὶ ὁ Μωυσῆς, ἔλεγεν ἅπερ ἔλεγεν ἀλλὰ πανταχοῦ ἑαυτὸν ἐνδεικνύμενος εἶναι τὸν τὸ κῦρος ἔχοντα."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For he taught them as one having authority—The word 'one,' which our translators have here inserted, only weakens the statement."
2. "The consciousness of divine authority, as Lawgiver, Expounder and Judge, so beamed through His teaching, that the scribes' teaching could not but appear drivelling in such a light."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. He taught [ην διδασκων] . He was teaching. This union of the verb and participle emphasized the idea of duration or habit more than the simple tense.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus spoke with the authority of truth, the reality and freshness of the morning light, and the power of God's Spirit."
2. "This sermon which made such a profound impression ended with the tragedy of the fall of the house on the sand like the crash of a giant oak in the forest."
3. "There was no smoothing over the outcome."

### John Gill:
1. "He spoke as a lawgiver, as one that had authority from heaven, and not from men."
