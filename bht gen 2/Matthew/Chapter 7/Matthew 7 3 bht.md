# Matthew 7:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Why are we so quick to point out the smallest faults in others, yet fail to acknowledge the much greater faults in ourselves? It is as if we have a splinter in our own eye but focus all our attention on removing the speck in our brother's eye. We must realize that this conduct is hypocritical and selfish. Instead of scrutinizing and condemning others, let us humbly examine our own faults and seek to address them, for we too are in need of forgiveness and growth.
