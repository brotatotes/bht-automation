# Matthew 7:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
And then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye. When we first address and correct our own faults, we avoid hypocrisy. It is hypocritical to point out the faults in others while neglecting our own. Once we have dealt with our own issues and removed the beam from our own eye, only then can we truly see clearly and effectively help our brothers and sisters in their struggles. This requires self-reflection and personal transformation before we can earnestly assist others in their spiritual journey.

### Henry Alford:
1. "ὑποκριτὴν τὸν τοιοῦτον ὠνόμασεν ὡς ἰατροῦ μὲν τάξιν ἁρπάζοντα , νοσοῦντος δὲ τόπον ἐπέχοντα" (Euthymius Zigabenus) 
2. "Before, βλέπειν τὸ κάρφος was all to stare at thy brother’s faults, and as people do who stand and gaze at an object, attract others to gaze also: but now, the object is a very different one ἐκβαλεῖν τὸ κάρφος to help thy brother to be rid of his fault, by doing him the best and most difficult office of Christian friendship" (Euthymius Zigabenus)
3. "The βλέπειν was vain and idle; the διαβλέπειν is for a blessed end, viz. (ch. Mat 18:15) κερδῆσαι τὸν ἀδελφόν σου" (Euthymius Zigabenus)

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Thou hypocrite... first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye." 
2. "The 'hypocrisy' which, not without indignation, He charges it with, consists in the pretense of a zealous and compassionate charity, which cannot possibly be real in one who suffers worse faults to lie uncorrected in himself."
3. "He only is fit to be a reprover of others who jealously and severely judges himself."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "By first amending our own faults, or casting the beam out of our eye, we can 'consistently' advance to correct the faults of others."
2. "There will then be no hypocrisy in our conduct. We shall also 'see clearly' to do it."
3. "The sentiment is, that the readiest way to judge of the imperfections of others is to be free from greater ones ourselves. This qualifies us for judging, makes us candid and consistent, and enables us to see things as they are, and to make proper allowances for frailty and imperfection."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "With the beam in thine eye thou starest at thy brother's little failing." 
2. "Pull out the beam; then thou shalt see clearly, not only the fault itself, but how to help thy brother get rid of it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Such action is hypocrisy before God and before the conscience also."

3. "...how to help the brother get the splinter out (εκβαλειν) of his eye."

### John Gill:
1. "Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye....a man should first begin with himself, take notice of his own sins, reprove himself for them, and reform....and then it will be soon enough to observe other men's."
2. "And then shalt thou see clearly, to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye: then will he, and not before, be a proper person to reprove others; all objections and impediments to such a work will then be removed."
3. "The sense of each of them is, that a man should first reform himself, and then others; and that he that finds faults with others, ought to be without blame himself."

### John Wesley:
1. "Thou hypocrite — It is mere hypocrisy to pretend zeal for the amendment of others while we have none for our own."
2. "Then — When that which obstructed thy sight is removed."
