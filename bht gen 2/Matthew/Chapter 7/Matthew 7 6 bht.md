# Matthew 7:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To avoid unnecessary harm, believers are urged not to share the sacred teachings of the faith with those who are unrepentantly sinful or deeply hostile to the truth. Instead, they are encouraged to discern those who are open to receiving the blessings of God's word and to share with them the profound experiences of His grace. However, this does not mean that believers should refrain from offering necessary reproof and correction when circumstances call for it. It is a matter of prudence and discernment in determining when and to whom the truths of the Gospel should be shared.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The similitude is derived from τὸ ἅγιον, or τὰ ἅγια, the meat offered in sacrifice, of which no unclean person was to eat."
2. "Thus interpreted, the saying would be one full of meaning to the Jews."
3. "Give not that which is holy to dogs, then...be not such mere children, as not to distinguish the characters of those with whom you have to do."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Give not that which is holy unto the dogs—savage or snarling haters of truth and righteousness. neither cast ye your pearls before swine—the impure or coarse, who are incapable of appreciating the priceless jewels of Christianity."
2. "Religion is brought into contempt, and its professors insulted, when it is forced upon those who cannot value it and will not have it."
3. "Go to God with it," is our Lord's reply; but He expresses this with a fulness which leaves nothing to be desired, urging now not only confidence, but importunity in prayer."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "By some the word 'holy' has been supposed to mean 'flesh offered in sacrifice,' made holy, or separated to a sacred use; but it probably means here 'anything connected with religion' - admonition, precept, or doctrine."
2. "'Dogs' signify people who spurn, oppose, and abuse that doctrine; people of special sourness and malignity of temper, who meet it like growling and quarrelsome curs."
3. "'Swine' denote those who would trample the precepts underfoot; people of impurity of life; those who are corrupt, polluted, profane, obscene, and sensual; those who would not know the value of the gospel, and who would tread it down as swine would pearls."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The picture is that of a priest throwing a piece of flesh from the altar of burnt-offering to one of the numerous dogs which infest the streets of Eastern cities."
2. "Another picture of a rich man wantonly throwing handfuls of small pearls to swine. Swine in Palestine were at best but half-tamed, the hog being an unclean animal."
3. "Small pearls, called by jewellers seed-pearls, would resemble the pease or maize on which the swine feed. They would rush upon them when scattered, and, discovering the cheat, would trample upon them and turn their tusks upon the man who scattered them."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ reminds the Apostles, and, through them, all the teachers of the Gospel, to reserve the treasure of heavenly wisdom for the children of God alone, and not to expose it to unworthy and profane despisers of his word."
2. "As the ministers of the Gospel, and those who are called to the office of teaching, cannot distinguish between the children of God and swine, it is their duty to present the doctrine of salvation indiscriminately to all."
3. "Lest these trample them under their feet... swine and dogs must not be permitted to approach it. There are two designations which Christ bestows on the doctrine of salvation: he calls it holy, and compares it to pearls. Hence we learn how highly we ought to esteem this doctrine."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The latter, no less than censoriousness, is an unwise attempt at the correction of others, and will be avoided by those who ‘see clearly.’"
2. "'Even saving truth must be withheld from those who would surely reject it with contempt and savage hatred' (J. A. Alexander)."
3. "No encouragement, however, either to 'cowardly suppression of the truth,' or revenge against its rejectors."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is not that the dogs would not eat it, for it would be welcome to them; but that it would be a profanation to give it to them, thus to make it a skubalon."
2. "Pearls look a bit like peas or acorns and would deceive the hogs until they discovered the deception."
3. "The wild boars haunt the Jordan Valley still and are not far removed from bears as they trample with their feet and rend with their tusks those who have angered them."

### John Gill:
1. "Men should be cautious and prudent in rebuking and admonishing such persons for their sins, in whom there is no appearance or hope of success; yea, where there is danger of sustaining loss." 
2. "The phrase is used in a metaphorical sense; and is generally understood of not delivering or communicating the holy word of God, and the truths of the Gospel, comparable to pearls, or the ordinances of it, to persons notoriously vile and sinful."
3. "That is, despise the admonitions and reproofs given, and hurt the persons who give them, either by words or deeds."

### John Wesley:
1. "Give not - That is, talk not of the deep things of God to those whom you know to be wallowing in sin."
2. "Neither declare the great things God hath done for your soul to the profane, furious, persecuting wretches."
3. "Our Lord does in nowise forbid us to reprove, as occasion is, both the one and the other."
