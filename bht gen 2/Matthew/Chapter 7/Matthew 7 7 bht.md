## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The three similitudes are all to be understood of prayer." 
2. "Form a climax: ἀπὸ δὲ τοῦ κρούειν τὸ μετὰ σφοδρὀτητος προσιέναι καὶ μετὰ θερμῆς διανοίας ἐδήλωσε."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Ask for what we wish; seek for what we miss; knock for that from which we feel ourselves shut out."
2. "Answering to this threefold representation is the triple assurance of success to our believing efforts."
3. "To meet this, our Lord repeats the triple assurance He had just given, but in such a form as to silence every such complaint."

### John Calvin:
1. "There is no superfluity of language, when he says, Ask, seek, knock: but lest the simple doctrine should be unimpressive, he perseveres in order to rouse us from our inactivity."
2. "Nothing is better adapted to excite us to prayer than a full conviction that we shall be heard. Those who doubt can only pray in an indifferent manner; and prayer, unaccompanied by faith, is an idle and unmeaning ceremony."
3. "First, we learn from it, that this rule of prayer is laid down and prescribed to us, that we may be fully convinced, that God will be gracious to us, and will listen to our requests."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Encouragement is given by showing God’s willingness to give."
2. "'To ask, indicates the want of an object, which can only be obtained by free gift; to seek, that it has been lost; to knocks that it has been shut up hence this prayer, which is both the work of life and the evidence of life.'"
3. "Others apply 'ask' to prayer, 'seek' to our endeavors, 'knock' to our investigation of the Scripture; the former explanation is simpler."

### John Gill:
1. "Ask and it shall be given you...such, who ask according to the will of God, in the name of Christ, and under the direction, guidance, and influence of the Spirit, who ask in faith and fear, and with submission to the divine will, shall have what they ask for..." 
2. "Seek, and ye shall find...which such shall find, who seek in a right way, by Christ, and with their whole hearts, diligently..." 
3. "Knock and it shall be opened unto you...men should stand and knock at the door of mercy, which will not always be shut against them. Faith in prayer is a key that opens this door, when a poor soul finds grace and mercy to help it in time of need..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Pray for them, as well as for yourselves: in this there can be no such danger."
2. "Add your own diligent endeavors to your asking."
3. "Persevere importunately in that diligence."
