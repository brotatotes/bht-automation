# Matthew 7:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
No man can be so heartless as to give a stone instead of bread to his hungry child, for even the resemblance of a stone to bread would not satisfy the child's hunger or silence his cries. Instead, the child would continue to complain bitterly, longing for true sustenance. This illustrates the contrast between the cruelty of humans and the infinite goodness of God. In fact, the resemblance between stones and bread is mentioned in another passage of the Bible (Matthew 4:3), where the devil tempts Jesus to perform a similar deceptive act.
