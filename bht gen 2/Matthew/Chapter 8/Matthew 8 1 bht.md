# Matthew 8:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus came down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him, drawn by the fame of his powerful teachings and miraculous healings. The people were convinced that he had come from God, so they continued to gather around him. His healing of the leper was particularly remarkable, as leprosy was a notoriously difficult disease to cure, often considered incurable. The fact that Jesus healed the leper before a large crowd was a clear demonstration of his divine power. While some believed that this miracle was performed more privately, it was certainly witnessed by many, leaving no doubt about its authenticity.
