# Matthew 8:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The centurion's faith was truly remarkable, even more so than the faith of the people of Israel. Jesus was amazed by this Gentile's faith, because unlike the Jews who sought after outward signs, the centurion believed that a mere word from Jesus would be enough to heal his servant. He recognized Jesus as more than just a man, but as a prophet sent by God. This centurion's faith was so extraordinary that it surpassed even those within the Israelite nation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "He wondered at it, or he deemed it remarkable."
2. "He was the first Gentile convert to Christianity, and was a very early illustration of what was more clearly revealed afterward - that the pagans were to be brought to the knowledge of the truth."
3. "Israel was a name given to 'Jacob'...because he persevered in wrestling with the angel that met him, and obtained the blessing."

### John Calvin:
1. "Not even in Israel have I found so great faith...Another reason was, that while the Jews were excessively eager to obtain outward signs, this Gentile asks no visible sign, but openly declares that he wants nothing more than the bare word."
2. "Christ was going to him: not that it was necessary, but to try his faith; and he applauds his faith chiefly on the ground of his resting satisfied with the bare word."
3. "This man asks no bodily approach or touch, but believes the word to possess such efficacy as fully to expect from it that his servant will be cured. Now, he ascribes this honor to the word, not of a man, but of God: for he is convinced that Christ is not an ordinary man, but a prophet sent by God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He marvelled. Not to be explained away. Our Lord could marvel; a mystery of His humanity."
2. "With no man in Israel have I found so great faith. This is the sense of the correct reading, which however places last, for emphasis, the phrase, ‘in Israel.’ There greater faith might have been looked for, but a Gentile was the first to acknowledge Christ’s power to heal at a distance."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  So great faith  (τοσαυτην πιστιν). In a Roman centurion and greater than in any of the Jews. In like manner Jesus marvelled at the great faith of the Canaanitish woman (Matthew 15:28). 

### John Gill:
1. "I have not found so great faith, no not in Israel: that is, among the people of Israel."
2. "He did not ascribe more to Christ than was proper, and which, by the way, is a clear proof of our Lord's divinity."
3. "He is so far from finding fault with him, for thinking or speaking so highly of him, that he praises him for it, and prefers his faith in him, to any instance of it he had met with among the Israelites."

### John Wesley:
1. I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel — For the centurion was not an Israelite.
