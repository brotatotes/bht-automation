# Matthew 8:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Many people from all corners of the world, including the Gentiles, will come to believe in Jesus and partake in the blessings of the Gospel, just like Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob did. The Gospel will be preached to all nations, and those who believe will share in the same salvation. The blessings of the Gospel and the joys of heaven are depicted as a feast or banquet, open to people from all nations. While the Jews initially had the first claim to these blessings, they will be excluded from them if they reject Jesus.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "Many shall come from the east ... - Jesus takes occasion from the faith of a Roman centurion to state that this conversion would not be solitary; that many pagans - many from the east and west would be converted to the gospel, and be saved, as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were."
2. "The phrase 'from the east and from the west,' in the Scripture, is used to denote the 'whole world'"
3. "The enjoyments of heaven are described under the similitude of a feast or banquet - a very common manner of speaking of it... It is used here to denote felicity, enjoyment, or honor."

### John Wesley:
1. "Many from the farthest parts of the earth shall embrace the terms and enjoy the rewards of the Gospel covenant established with Abraham."
