# Matthew 8:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jews, who had expected to be included in the kingdom, will instead be expelled into the outer darkness, as they did not truly belong to the Church of God. This image of darkness represents a state of exclusion, where they will weep and gnash their teeth. The Gentiles, on the other hand, will be grafted into the kingdom, causing the Jews to be driven out, which seemed unimaginable to them. This portrayal of expulsion into darkness serves as a striking image of future woe.
