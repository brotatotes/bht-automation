# Matthew 8:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter's mother-in-law was struck with a severe fever, so severe in fact that it was described as raging and furious. This illness had greatly debilitated her, rendering her bedridden and unable to perform daily tasks. Peter, being married, had a wife who was likely concerned about her mother's condition. It is noteworthy that even in the early days of Jesus' ministry, He was already performing miracles, such as healing the sick, demonstrating His divine power and authority.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. Sick of a fever [πυρεσσουσαν] . Derived from pur, fire. Our word fever comes through the German feuer.

2. "Peter was therefore married."
3. "Legend says that her name was Perpetua or Concordia."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Lying sick of a fever (βιβλημενην κα πυρεσσουσαν). Two participles, bedridden (perfect passive of βαλλω) and burning with fever (present active)."
2. "How long the fever had had her we have no means of knowing, possibly a sudden and severe attack (Mark 1:30), as they tell Jesus about her on reaching the house of Peter."
3. "Fever itself was considered a disease. 'Fever' is from German feuer (fire) like the Greek πυρ."

### John Gill:
1. "The distemper was very raging and furious, it had got to a very great height."
2. "Hence it may be observed against the Papists, that ministers of the Gospel may lawfully marry; Peter, an apostle, and from whom they pretend to derive their succession of bishops, was a married man, had a wife."

### John Wesley:
1. Peter's wife's mother — St. Peter was then a young man, as were all the apostles. Mark 1:29; Luke 4:38.
