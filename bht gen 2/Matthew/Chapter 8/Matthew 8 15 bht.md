# Matthew 8:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After Jesus touched her hand, the woman's fever immediately left her. This miraculous healing demonstrated the power of Christ and the immediate effect of his touch. The fact that she was able to rise and walk about on her own after the fever, unlike most people who are weak after illnesses, is a clear indication of the extraordinary miracle that Jesus had performed on her. In gratitude for this mercy, she rose and served Jesus and his friends, preparing food for them as a way of showing her appreciation and devotion.

1. "Our Lord could heal by a word at a distance, in the response to faith, but He generally made some outward sign of His willingness and will to cure... proving that His will healed."
2. "The faith of her family had called for the miracle, but she shows her own faith and her gratitude by ‘serving’ the Lord, and that too in the natural and womanly way of household duty."
3. "He healed them all, both those possessed with demons and the sick; two classes carefully distinguished from each other in the Gospels."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Touched her hand (ηψατο της χειρος αυτης). In loving sympathy as the Great Physician and like any good doctor today."

### John Gill:
1. "And he touched her hand....and the fever left her immediately." 
2. "The former of these actions is a proof of her being restored to health and strength, in so much that she could rise and walk about of herself; whereas generally, persons after fevers continue very weak a considerable time; which shows what a miracle was wrought upon her by Christ." 
3. "The latter of them expresses her gratitude, for the mercy she had received; she rises and serves him and his friends, preparing proper and suitable provisions for them."
