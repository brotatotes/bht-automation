# Matthew 8:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the evening, the sick were brought to Jesus, possibly because it was cooler or because it was the end of the Sabbath. This demonstrated Jesus' compassion and divine mission. The whole city gathered at the door, and the demons, recognizing Jesus as the Son of God, cried out. However, Jesus did not allow them to speak. He healed the sick with a word, showing his power over Satan and his ability to cure even the most incurable diseases.
