# Matthew 8:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, after speaking to the multitudes in parables, withdrew to the other side of the lake. This was a deliberate move to find solitude and rest, both for himself and for the people. The other gospel accounts provide more context, revealing that Jesus desired to pray privately, avoid disturbances, test his disciples' faith, and redirect the crowd's attention from temporal concerns. The term the other side does not necessarily mean the exact opposite side of the lake, but rather refers to a region below Capernaum. Jesus commanded his disciples to journey there, seeking renewal and respite.
