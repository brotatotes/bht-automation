# Matthew 8:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Luke 9:57, a scribe approaches Jesus with a seemingly earnest desire to follow him. However, Christ sees through the scribe's true intentions, knowing that his heart is not genuine. The scribe, influenced by the miracles and popularity of Jesus, seeks to join him not out of true discipleship, but with the expectation of personal gain, ease, honor, and wealth. His hasty approach and self-promotion contrasts with the way Jesus calls and invites his true disciples to follow him.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A scribe (ŒµŒπœÇ Œ≥œÅŒ±ŒºŒºŒ±œÑŒµœÖœÇ). One (ŒµŒπœÇ)="a," indefinite article. Already a disciple as shown by 'another of the disciples' (ŒµœÑŒµœÅŒøœÇ œÑœâŒΩ ŒºŒ±Œ∏Œ∑œÑœâŒΩ) in Matthew 8:21."
2. "He calls Jesus 'Teacher' (Œ¥ŒπŒ¥Œ±œÉŒ∫Œ±ŒªŒµ), but he seems to be a 'bumptious' brother full of self-confidence and self-complacency. 'Even one of that most unimpressionable class, in spirit and tendency utterly opposed to the ways of Jesus' (Bruce)."

### John Gill:

### John Wesley:
1. Luke 9:57.
