# Matthew 8:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The leper, representative of a sinner deeply covered in sin, approached Christ in reverence and worship, acknowledging His fame and authority. Recognizing Christ's power, the leper believed that Jesus alone could truly cleanse him, surpassing the limitations of the religious authorities. This encounter illustrates how sinners are drawn to the miraculous power and love of Christ and seek His transformative touch for complete forgiveness and restoration. By suppressing public excitement and hostility, Jesus sought to fulfill His mission and give sinners the opportunity to approach Him with humble hearts.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The leper was not shut out from the synagogue, nor from the Christian churches... Besides, the analogy of the other uncleannesses under the Mosaic law, e.g. having touched the dead, having an issue, which are joined with leprosy, shows that sanitary caution was not the motive of these ceremonial enactments, but a far deeper reason."
2. "The leper was the type of one dead in sin: the same emblems are used in his misery as those of mourning for the dead... All this exclusion and mournful separation imported the perpetual exclusion of the abominable and polluted from the true city of God..."
3. "Thus in the above-cited instances we find leprosy inflicted as the punishment of rebellion, lying, and presumption... the Jews, from the prophecy Isaiah 53:4, had a tradition that the Messiah should be a leper."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "All that needs be said here is that it was a cutaneous disease, of a loathsome, diffusive, and, there is reason to believe, when thoroughly pronounced, incurable character."
2. "And while the ceremonial ordinances for detection and cleansing prescribed in this case by the law of Moses held forth a coming remedy 'for sin and for uncleanness,' the numerous cases of leprosy with which our Lord came in contact, and the glorious cures of them which He wrought, were a fitting manifestation of the work which He came to accomplish."
3. "But one thing he was sure of, that He had but to 'will' it. This shows with what 'worship' of Christ this leper fell on his face before Him."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "No disease with which the human family has been afflicted has been more dreadful than that which is often mentioned in the Bible as the leprosy."
2. "These spots, though few at first, gradually spread until they cover the whole body."
3. "In compliance with the laws of the land, Jesus directed the man that he had healed to make the customary offering, and to obtain the testimony of the priest that he was healed."

### John Calvin:
1. "The outward gesture of kneeling was exhibited by the leper as a token of reverence."
2. "He who, by the mere expression of his will, restores health to men, must possess supreme authority."
3. "The leper had not learned by any inspired communication, or any promise of God, what Christ would do. It would have been improper in him, therefore, to go beyond these limits."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Men more easily believe in miraculous power than in miraculous love."
2. "This is a condition of the third class (undetermined, but with prospect of being determined), a hopeful doubt at any rate."
3. "The command to 'tell no one' was to suppress excitement and prevent hostility."

### John Gill:
1. "He was a very lively emblem of a poor vile sinner, full of sin and iniquity, who is brought to see himself all over covered with sin when he comes to Christ for pardon and cleansing."
2. "This man came of his own accord, having heard of the fame of Christ, and worshipped him in a civil and respectful way, showing great reverence to him as a man."
3. "He was fully assured of his power, that he could make him clean, entirely rid him of his leprosy, which the priest could not do."
