## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is the name by which the Lord ordinarily in one pregnant word designates Himself as the Messiah the Son of God manifested in the flesh of man the second Adam."
2. "And to it belong all those conditions, of humiliation, suffering, and exaltation, which it behoved the Son of Man to go through."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Knowest thou whom thou art pledging thyself to follow, and whither haply He may lead thee? No warm home, no downy pillow has He for thee: He has them not for Himself. The foxes are not without their holes, nor do the birds of the air lack their nests; but the Son of man has to depend on the hospitality of others, and borrow the pillow whereon He lays His head."
2. "Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God."
3. "No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word, derived from skhnh, a tent, has the more general meaning of shelter or habitation."
2. "The nest is not to the bird what the hole is to the fox, a permanent dwelling-place, since the bird frequents the nest only during incubation."
3. "The Rev. retains nests, but puts lodging-places in the margin."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Son of God describes by these words what was his condition while he lived on the earth."
2. "Christ should say, that he had not a foot of earth on which he could lay his head, while there were many godly and benevolent persons, who would willingly receive him into their houses."
3. "But this was spoken, it ought to be observed, as a warning to the scribe, not to expect an abundant and rich hire."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Son of Man. A term applied to no one else, and often applied by our Lord to himself; used in Daniel 7:13, in reference to the Messiah seen in a vision."
2. "He did not own a dwelling, as even the foxes and birds do; but we have no reason to believe that He ever suffered from want of a lodging."
3. "The father was already dead, and the disciple wanted to go home and attend to all the funeral ceremonies, intending to return and follow Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Son of man (θο υιος του ανθρωπου). This remarkable expression, applied to himself by Jesus so often, appears here for the first time. There is a considerable modern literature devoted to it."
2. "Often it means the Representative Man. It may sometimes stand for the Aramaic barnasha, the man, but in most instances that idea will not suit. Jesus uses it as a concealed Messianic title."
3. "Jesus in his early ministry, except at the very start in Matthew 8:4, abstains from calling himself Messiah. This term suited his purpose exactly to get the people used to his special claim as Messiah when he is ready to make it openly."

### John Gill:
1. "The son of man has not where to lay his head, when he is weary, and wants rest and sleep, as he did at this time."
2. "Though he was Lord of all, as being the mighty God; yet as 'the son of man', a phrase, expressive both of the truth and meanness of his human nature, the most despicable of creatures in the earth and air, were richer than he."
3. "When Christ styles himself 'the son of man', it is no contradiction to his being God; nor any objection to trust and confidence in him, as the Jews suggest; for he is truly and properly God, as well as really man."

### John Wesley:
1. "The Son of man — The expression is borrowed from Daniel 7:13, and is the appellation which Christ generally gives himself: which he seems to do out of humility, as having some relation to his mean appearance in this world."
2. "Hath not where to lay his head — Therefore do not follow me from any view of temporal advantage."
