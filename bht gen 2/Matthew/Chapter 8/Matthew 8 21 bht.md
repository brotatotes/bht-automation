# Matthew 8:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciple's address to Jesus reflects great respect and humility, as he expresses his willingness to follow Jesus without any personal agenda. It may seem reasonable for the disciple to prioritize the duty of burying his dead father, which was considered an act of kindness and piety. However, Jesus emphasizes the importance of putting God's command first, even if it means setting aside earthly obligations.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "A tradition of this nature was hardly likely to be wrong; so that perhaps the words ἀκολούθει μοι are to be taken (as in John 21:19; Joh 21:22) as an admonition occasioned by some slackness or symptom of decadence on the part of the Apostle." 
2. "The attempt to evade the strong words of our Lord’s command by supposing that θάψαι τὸν πατέρα means, ‘to reside with my father till his death’ (Theophylact), is evidently futile, since πρῶτον ἀπελθεῖν καὶ θάψαι is plainly said of an act waiting to be done."
3. "The reason for our Lord’s rebuke was the peremptory and all-superseding nature of the command ἀκολούθει μοι."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'disciple' properly signifies 'learner,' and was given to the followers of Jesus because they received him as their teacher."
2. "The Saviour saw that in his circumstances there might be danger, if he was thus permitted to go, that he would not return to him: and he commanded him, therefore, to perform the more important duty - the duty of attending to the salvation of his soul even at the risk of the apparent neglect of another duty."
3. "The first duty of man is religion, and everything else should be made subordinate to that."

### John Calvin:
1. "The person whom Christ retains had an opposite fault. He was prevented from immediately obeying the call of Christ by the weakness of thinking it a hardship to leave his father."
2. "From Christ's reply we learn that children should discharge their duty to their parents in such a manner that, whenever God calls them to another employment, they should lay this aside, and assign the first place to the command of God."
3. "All ought to consider what God requires from them as individuals, and what is demanded by their particular calling, that earthly parents may not prevent the claims of the highest and only Father of all from remaining entire."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The first man was an enthusiast. This one is overcautious. It is by no means certain that the father was dead." 
2. "The probability is that this disciple means that, after his father is dead and buried, he will then be free to follow Jesus."
3. "Jesus wanted first things first. But even if his father was not actually dead, service to Christ comes first."

### John Gill:
1. "His address to Christ is made with great respect and reverence, and in a very modest and humble manner." 
2. "This may seem very reasonable, since burying the dead was reckoned by the Jews, not only an act of kindness and respect to the deceased, but an act of piety and religion."

### John Wesley:
1. "I will follow thee without any such view"
2. "Perhaps his son desired to stay with him, being very old, till his death."
