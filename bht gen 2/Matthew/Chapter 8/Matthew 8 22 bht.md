# Matthew 8:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus teaches that when God calls, we should not allow ourselves to be distracted by the concerns of the world. In the passage, the call to follow Jesus takes precedence over even the most important tasks, such as burying the dead. Jesus wants those who are spiritually dead to take care of their own earthly matters, while those who are alive in Christ should focus on the higher calling of preaching the gospel. Let us remember to prioritize our commitment to Jesus above all else.
