# Matthew 8:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The journey across the lake took place after a series of parables, as recorded by St. Mark and St. Luke. The disciples sailed on a small open boat used for fishing on the Sea of Tiberias. Other ships were in the area, making the subsequent miracle more powerful. Mark noted that it was evening, following Christ's discourse on the preaching of the gospel. Christ's sleep served to reveal the disciples' weakness, and the boat they sailed on was one He had been teaching from. His disciples, likely the Twelve, accompanied Him, while others followed in different boats.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This journey across the lake, with its incidents, is placed by St. Mark and St. Luke after the series of parables commencing with that of the sower, and recorded in ch. 13." 
2. "By Mark with a precise note of sequence: ŒªŒ≠Œ≥ŒµŒπ Œ±·ΩêœÑŒø·øñœÇ ·ºêŒΩ ·ºêŒ∫ŒµŒØŒΩ·øÉ œÑ·øá ·º°ŒºŒ≠œÅ·æ≥ ·ΩÄœàŒØŒ±œÇ Œ≥ŒµŒΩŒøŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒ∑œÇ, Mark 4:35."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This was on the Sea of Tiberias. The 'ship' in which they sailed was probably a small open boat with sails, such as was commonly used for fishing on the lake."
2. "There were many other ships in company with him, Mark 4:36. This circumstance would render the miracle much more striking and impressive."

### John Calvin:
1. "The waters of Gennesareth, all admit, were pleasant and healthful to drink: but the Gadarene lake, Strabo tells us, was so unwholesome and pestilential, that the cattle which drank of it often lost their hair and their hoofs." 
2. "It remains that we now inquire as to the time, which cannot be learned either from Matthew or from Luke. Mark alone mentions that it was the evening of that day on which Christ discoursed about the preaching of the gospel under the parable of the sower." 
3. "Though Christ‚Äôs sleep was natural, yet it served the additional purpose of making the disciples better acquainted with their weakness. I will not say, as many do, that Christ pretended sleep, in order to try them. On the contrary, I think that he was asleep in such a manner as the condition and necessity of human nature required."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A boat. The best authorities omit the definite article."
2. "It was, however, the boat from which he had been teaching."
3. "His disciples, probably the Twelve, though others followed in other boats."

### John Gill:
