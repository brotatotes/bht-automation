# Matthew 8:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of a serene scene on the Sea of Galilee, a great storm arose by divine providence. The disciples, caught off guard, found themselves in the midst of a tempest as the ship was covered with waves. In their extremity, they were reminded that man's desperate state is the perfect opportunity for God to display His power. It is in these moments of chaos and uncertainty that we can find comfort knowing that God is able to intervene and bring calm to the storm. His power is made manifest in our weakest moments.

2. "To understand the causes of these sudden and violent tempests we must remember that the lake lies low - six hundred and eighty feet below the sea; that the mountainous plateau of the Jaulan rises to a considerable height, spreading backward to the wilds of the Hauran, and upward to snowy Hermon; that the water - courses have worn or washed out profound ravines and wild gorges, converging to the head of this lake."

"When the disciples entered the ship, the air was serene, and the sea still and quiet; but as soon as they had set sail, at once, on a sudden, this storm came down, with great force into the sea, and lifted up its waves; insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves; it was just sinking to the bottom, so that they were in the utmost extremity."
