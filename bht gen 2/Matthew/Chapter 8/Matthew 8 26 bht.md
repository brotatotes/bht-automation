## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "They were of little faith, in that they were afraid of perishing while they had on board the slumbering Saviour: they were not faithless, for they had recourse to that Saviour to help them."
2. "Therefore He acknowledges the faith which they had; answers the prayer of faith, by working a perfect calm: but rebukes them for not having the stronger, firmer faith, to trust Him even when He seemed insensible to their danger."
3. "The symbolic application of this occurrence is too striking to have escaped general notice. The Saviour with the company of His disciples in the ship tossed on the waves, seemed a typical reproduction of the Ark bearing mankind on the flood, and a foreshadowing of the Church tossed by the tempests of this world, but having Him with her always. And the personal application is one of comfort, and strengthening of faith, in danger and doubt."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "You should have remembered that the Son of God, the Messiah, was on board. You should not have forgotten that he had power to save, and that with him you are safe."
2. "So Christians should never fear danger, disease, or death. With Jesus they are safe. No enemy can reach him; and as he is safe, so they shall be also."
3. "His word awed the tempest and allayed the storm! There is not anywhere a sublimer description of a display of power. Nor could there be clearer proof that he was truly the Son of God."

### John Calvin:
1. "He rebuked the winds...to show that the power of his voice reached the elements, which were devoid of feeling."
2. "And not only the sea and the winds, which are without feeling, but wicked men also, with all their obstinacy, obey the commands of God."
3. "When God is pleased to allay the tumults of war, he does not always soften the fierce minds of men, and mould them to obedience, but even while their rage continues, makes the arms to drop from their hands."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Fear while the Saviour was with them, evidence of â€˜little faith;â€™ the cry to Him evidence they were not faithless."
2. "He rewards the faith they had, but rebukes them, because of their â€˜little faith.â€™"
3. "A great calm, a perfect stillness."

### John Gill:
1. "Though they had some faith in him, yet there was a great deal of fear and unbelief."
2. "Their faith was very small, it could hardly be discerned."
3. "He rebukes them in such language as this, 'peace, be still'; ÏƒÎ¹Ï‰Ï€Î± Ï€ÎµÏ†Î¹Î¼Ï‰ÏƒÎ¿, as it is in Mark, be silent, hold your peace, stop your mouth, put a bridle on it, as the words used signify."

### John Wesley:
1. Why are ye fearful â€” Then he rebuked the winds - First, he composed their spirits, and then the sea.
