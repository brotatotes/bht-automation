# Matthew 8:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The remarkable event described in this passage showcases the immense shine of majesty and divine power demonstrated by Jesus. The absolute obedience of the winds and the sea to His command leaves no doubt that He is more than a mere man. This account of a nature miracle serves as a powerful affirmation of the deity of Christ. To deny His divinity in light of this incredible display of power would be to reject the very essence of God's revelation.

3. "So the tempest rolls and thickens over the head of the awakened sinner. So he trembles over immediate and awful destruction.

An indescribable peace takes possession of the soul, and he glides on a tranquil sea to the haven of eternal rest."
