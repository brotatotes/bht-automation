# Matthew 8:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The encounter with the demoniacs took place in the country of the Gergesenes, which included the towns of Gergesa and Gadara. Two demoniacs met Jesus, although Mark and Luke only mention one. The presence of these demoniacs in the tombs is significant as it aligns with the preference of malevolent spirits for symbols of death and destruction. (43 words)
