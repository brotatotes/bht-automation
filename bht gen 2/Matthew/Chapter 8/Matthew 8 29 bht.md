1. "Thus we see that the devils breathe nothing but rebellion against God; and yet, with all their swelling pride, they are crushed and fall in a moment."
2. "Christ paid regard to the spectators. Accordingly, when malicious and wicked men were present, he was more eager to repress calumnies, and more inclined to put a severe restraint on devils."
3. "As criminals, when they come to the judgment-seat, expect their punishment, so devils and all wicked men must tremble at the sight of God, as truly as if they already experienced hell, the unquenchable fire, and the torments that await them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "What have we to do with thee, lit 'What (is) to us and thee,' what have we in common? The language of the demons, who recognized Him as the son of God."
2. "Dost thou come hither before the time to torment us? 'Before the time,' i.e., too soon, to be joined with 'come;' peculiar to this Gospel."

3. "Nothing could give more torment, pain, and uneasiness, than to be turned out, and remanded to their prison, and restrained from doing more mischief to the bodies and souls of men."
