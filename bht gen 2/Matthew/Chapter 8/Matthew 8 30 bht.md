# Matthew 8:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is interesting to consider the presence of a large herd of swine in the land of Israel, where it was forbidden for the Jews to keep such animals. However, it is important to note that the prohibition applied specifically to the Israelites and not to strangers. The existence of this herd highlights that there were individuals, likely Gentiles, engaged in a trade that was considered unclean according to the Mosaic law. In permitting the swine to be destroyed, Jesus demonstrated both justice and mercy.
