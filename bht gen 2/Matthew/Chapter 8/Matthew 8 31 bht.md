# Matthew 8:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The demons pleaded to Jesus, not to be sent out of the land, potentially into the abyss. They sought to remain on earth, continuing their malicious work of opposition. This request revealed their recognition of Jesus' power and their reliance on His permission. The demons desired to go into the herd of swine, possibly to delight in their impurity or to incite the people against Christ. However, Jesus simply granted them permission, not commanding their actions.

### John Calvin:

### John Gill:
1. "This request shows the weakness of the infernal spirits, they are not able to do anything without leave, and the superior power of Christ over them, and their acknowledgment of it."
2. "Many reasons have been thought of, why the devils should desire to go into the herd of swine; as because of the filthiness of these creatures, these impure spirits delighting in what is impure; or out of pure hatred to the inhabitants of this country, who, because they could no longer hurt their persons, would destroy their goods; or that by so doing, they might set the people against Christ, and so prevent his usefulness among them; which last seems to be the truest reason, and which end was answered."

### John Wesley:
1. He said, Go — A word of permission only, not command.
