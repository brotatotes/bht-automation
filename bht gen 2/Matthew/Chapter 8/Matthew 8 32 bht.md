# Matthew 8:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Gospel narratives consistently assert the truth of these events, emphasizing the historicity of the occurrences. Jesus' permission for the demons to enter the herd of swine serves various purposes, including as a warning, a means of delivering the possessed men, and a just punishment. The destruction of the swine, while incidental, demonstrates the existence of evil spirits, the reality of possessions, and the power of Christ over demons. This event challenges any doubt about the authenticity of these narratives, reminding us of the supernatural elements underlying the Gospel accounts.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Gospel narratives are distinctly pledged to the historic truth of these occurrences... Either they are true, or the Gospels are false."
2. "It is wholly at variance with any Christian idea of the perfection of truthfulness in Him who was Truth itself, to suppose Him to have used such plain and solemn words repeatedly, before His disciples and the Jews, in encouragement of, and connivance at, a lying superstition."
3. "The frequently urged objection, How comes it that this malady is not  now among us? admits of an easy answer, even if the assumption be granted. The period of our Lord‚Äôs being on earth was certainly more than any other in the history of the world under the dominion of evil."


### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A steep place [œÑŒøœÖ Œ∫œÅŒ∑ŒºŒΩŒøœÖ] . Much better the steep (Rev.). Not an overhanding precipice, but a steep, almost perpendicular declivity, between the base of which and the water was a narrow margin of ground, in which there was not room for the swine to recover from their headlong rush."
2. "Dr. Thomson (" Land and Book ") says : "Farther south the plain becomes so broad that the herd might have recovered and recoiled from the lake."
3. "The article localizes the steep as in the vicinity of the pasture."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The fact of the possession of the swine is stated. It is not more improbable than that the human body could be under demoniacal control."
2. "The whole herd, etc. The simultaneous rush of the whole herd was not a natural movement, but due to the possessed, since few gregarious animals are so marked by individual stubbornness as swine."
3. "The permission given by our Lord to enter the herd of swine can be readily justified. It suggests the above warning, it helped to rid the men of the demons; there may have been other reasons growing out of the Mosaic law, which make the loss of property a just punishment; and after all it was but a permission."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The power of Christ over the demons, over the herd of hogs."
2. "Difficulties in plenty exist for those who see only folk-lore and legend, but plain enough if we take Jesus to be really Lord and Saviour."
3. "The incidental destruction of the hogs need not trouble us when we are so familiar with nature's tragedies which we cannot comprehend."

### John Gill:
1. "Without divine permission, these evil spirits cannot do anything to the bodies, souls, or estates of men."
2. "This was suffered to show the malice of the evil spirits, under whose influence they were, and who would, if they had but leave, serve them as they did the swine."
3. "Which shows the real existence of these spirits, the truth of possessions and dispossessions; and that by these devils cannot be meant the sins and corruptions of men's hearts."
