# Matthew 8:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The herdsmen, shocked and distressed by the loss of the swine, fled in fear and astonishment. Their main concern was not the destruction of the pigs, but rather their own well-being and the potential blame from their masters. As they ran away, they spread the news far and wide, sharing the incredible story of how Jesus had cast out the demons and restored the possessed men to full health. This remarkable demonstration of Jesus' power and authority left a lasting impact on the herdsmen and served as a testimony to the miraculous work of Christ.
