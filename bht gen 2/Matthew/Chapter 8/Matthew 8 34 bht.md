# Matthew 8:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Great numbers of people flocked to meet Jesus, driven by curiosity or fear. However, when Jesus performed a miracle and cast out demons, the people were more concerned about the loss of their swine than the healing and deliverance that had taken place. They even begged Jesus to leave their coasts, prioritizing their material possessions over their own spiritual well-being. This situation reminds us that it is easy to become attached to earthly things and to neglect our souls.

### Henry Alford:
1. "This request...was probably not from humility, but for fear the miraculous powers of our Lord should work them still more worldly loss."
2. "For the additional particulars of this miracle, see Mark 5:15-16; Mark 5:18-20; Luke 8:35, and notes."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Christ healed madmen where calculating selfishness drove Him away."
2. "This miracle alone tells of a transfer of demoniacal possession and of its effect upon other creatures than man."
3. "The most natural and tenable position is: that in the time of Christ persons were, actually and bodily, possessed by personal evil spirits."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The whole city was excited over the destruction of the hogs and begged Jesus to leave, forgetful of the healing of the demoniacs in their concern over the loss of property."
2. "They cared more for hogs than for human souls, as often happens today."

### John Gill:
1. "Great numbers flocked from all parts and came out to meet Jesus, not out of any love and respect to him, but either out of curiosity or being terrified at the report concerning him."
2. "They besought him that he would depart out of their coasts, fearing lest some greater punishment should be inflicted on them for their sins."
3. "They preferred the presence of their swine over the presence of Christ, even to any cures wrought."
