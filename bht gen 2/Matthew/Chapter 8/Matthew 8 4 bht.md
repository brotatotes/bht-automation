# Matthew 8:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When given the command to show himself to the priest, it was not Christ's intention for the man to publicly declare his healing, but rather to fulfill the necessary requirements according to the law. This was a specific instruction for the man in this circumstance, as Christ often commanded others to refrain from sharing their miracles. It is also notable that the man chose to send messengers instead of going himself, feeling unworthy of such an honor.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Our Lord almost uniformly repressed the fame of His miracles, for the reason given in ch. Matthew 12:15-21, that, in accordance with prophetic truth, He might be known as the Messiah not by wonder-working power, but by the great result of his work upon earth."
2. "These latter were tokens of power common to our Lord and his followers; but in His great conflict, ending in His victory, He trod the winepress alone."
3. "It is satisfactory to observe this drawing of parallels between the Levitical and (popularly so called) Christian priesthood, thus completely shewing the fallacy and untenableness of the whole system; all those priests being types, not of future human priests, but of Him, who abideth a Priest for ever in an unchangeable priesthood, and in Whom not a class of Christians, but all Christians, are priests unto God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "A hard condition this would seem to a grateful heart, whose natural language, in such a case, is 'Come, hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what He hath done for my soul'." 
2. "Thus—by an over-zealous, though most natural and not very culpable, infringement of the injunction to keep the matter quiet—was our Lord, to some extent, thwarted in His movements."
3. "And He withdrew Himself...into the secret place of the Most High, and thus coming forth as dew upon the mown grass, and as showers that water the earth."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was his duty to hasten to him immediately ... as the first thing, to obey the laws of God, and make proper acknowledgments to him by an offering."
2. "Perhaps, also, Christ was apprehensive that the report would go 'before' the man if he delayed, and the priest, through opposition to Jesus, might pronounce it an imposition."
3. "Show thyself to the priest, and get his testimony to the reality of the cure, as a proof to the people that the healing is genuine. It was necessary that he should have that testimony before he could be received to the congregation or allowed to mingle with the people."

### John Calvin:
1. "If he wished to express his gratitude to him to whom he was indebted for his cure, no better method could have been found than obedience."
2. "This example shows us, that those who allow themselves to be guided by inconsiderate zeal act improperly, because the more eager they are to please God, the greater progress do they make in rebellion to his commands."
3. "When the ministers of the Gospel, by the command of Christ, declare to sinners that they are cleansed from their sins, this must not be tortured into the pretended jurisdiction, which the priests imagine, of pronouncing a decision about leprosy."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The telling was forbidden until this duty was fulfilled."
2. "Our Lord adds: for a testimony to them; i.e., a testimony to the people that the cleansing had taken place."
3. "The command also implies a caution against making too much of the external miraculous acts of our Lord; a kind of materialism, no less than the denial of the possibility of such miracles."

### John Gill:
1. "Not that this fact could be concealed, if it was done publicly, before the multitude nor was it Christ's design that it should be; only it was his counsel to this man, that whilst he was on the road to Jerusalem, and when he was come there, that he would speak of it to no man..."
2. "The man was now in one of the cities of Galilee; from hence Christ orders him to make the best of his way, directly to Jerusalem; and present himself to one of the priests, by him to be examined, whether he was free of his leprosy; and then offer what was ordered by the law of Moses in such cases..."
3. "The Jewish canons, concerning this matter, are as follow..."


### John Wesley:
1. "Perhaps our Lord only meant here, Not till thou hast showed thyself to the priest-who was appointed to inquire into the case of leprosy."
2. "But many others he commanded, absolutely, to tell none of tho miracles he had wrought upon them."
3. "He thought himself not worthy to come in person, and therefore spoke the words that follow by his messengers."
