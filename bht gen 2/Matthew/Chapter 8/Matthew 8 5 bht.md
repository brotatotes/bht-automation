# Matthew 8:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The healing of the Gentile centurion's servant was a powerful display of Jesus' miraculous power and his compassion for people of all backgrounds. The centurion, although a Gentile, held a deep attachment to the Jewish people and their religion. He had even built a synagogue for them, an act that exposed him to risk and possible hatred. The servant's condition was a sudden and severe palsy, leaving no hope of recovery from the first attack. The account of this healing, recounted by multiple Gospel writers, affirms the unity of this miraculous event.
