## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The centurion, perhaps, had but one slave, see Matthew 8:9."
2. "'Lucas hoc modo dubitationem prævenit, quæ subire poterat lectorum animos; scimus enim non habitos fuisse servos eo in pretio, ut de ipsorum vita tum anxii essent domini, nisi qui singulari industria vel fide vel alia virtute sibi gratiam acquisierant. Significat ergo Lucas non vulgare fuisse sordidumque mancipium , sed fidelem et raris dotibus ornatum servum, qui eximia gratia apud dominum polleret: hinc tanta illius vitæ cura et tam studiosa commendatio.’ (Calvin in loc.)"

### Albert Barnes:

It can hardly have been apoplexy, which usually deprives of sensation.’"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
