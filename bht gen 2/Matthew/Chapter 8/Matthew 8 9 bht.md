# Matthew 8:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The centurion, a man under authority, recognizes the power and obedience of those under him in the military. In comparison, he acknowledges that Christ, as the Lord of all, has even greater authority and control. The strength of his faith lies in his understanding that just as he can command his soldiers to go and they obey, Christ can command diseases and they will obey Him. Thus, he believes that if Christ commands healing for his servant, it will be done, even without Him physically present.

1. "I know how to obey, being myself under authority: and in turn know how others obey, having soldiers under me:’ inferring, ‘if then I, in my subordinate station of command, am obeyed, how much more Thou, who art over all, and whom diseases serve as their Master!’" 
2. "That this is the right interpretation, is shewn by our Lord’s special commendation of his faith."
