# Matthew 9:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage highlights the surprising dining companions at Levi's feast - publicans, despised for their corrupt practices, and notorious sinners. Despite the criticism from the Pharisees, Levi, also known as Matthew, hospitably welcomed Jesus and his disciples. Matthew's humility is evident in his omission of his own role in organizing the gathering. Jesus, motivated by compassion, willingly associated with those who had been cast out by society. His presence offered an opportunity for these outcasts to hear the gracious teachings of their newfound teacher.
