# Matthew 9:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Pharisees questioned why Jesus would associate himself with publicans and sinners, viewing it as a scandalous act. To the Pharisees, this association was seen as a reproach and an undermining of Jesus' own righteousness. They held strict customs of separation from those they considered morally unclean, hence their perplexity at Jesus' actions. However, Jesus' choice to dine with sinners displayed his mission of seeking out those who were in dire need of his transformative power and redemption. It challenged the self-righteous mindset of the Pharisees and highlighted their lack of compassion and understanding.
