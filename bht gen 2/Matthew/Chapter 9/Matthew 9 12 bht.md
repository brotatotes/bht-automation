# Matthew 9:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He knows the nature of all diseases of the soul, without needing to be told by the patient, and he is always equipped with the proper remedy and knows the best time and manner to administer it. Jesus is an infallible physician – no one ever leaves him without a cure, and his healing is permanent. It is important to note that those who consider themselves 'whole' and self-sufficient have no need for Jesus as a physician in their own perception, as they believe they are strong and able to handle everything on their own.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Both words, in the application of the saying, must be understood subjectively (‘ironica concessio,’ Calvin, Meyer): as referring to their respective opinions of themselves."
2. "Not as though the Pharisees were objectively either ἰσχύοντες or δίκαιοι, however much objective truth κακῶς ἔχοντες and ἁμαρτωλοί may have had as applied to the publicans and sinners."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick—that is, 'Ye deem yourselves whole; My mission, therefore, is not to you: The physician's business is with the sick; therefore eat I with publicans and sinners.'"
2. "Oh, what myriads of broken hearts, of sin-sick souls, have been bound up by this matchless saying!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They that be whole ... - Jesus, in reply, said that the whole needed not a physician. Sick persons only needed his aid."
2. "If you Pharisees are such as you think yourselves - already pure and holy - you do not need my aid. It would be of no use to you, and you would not thank me for it."
3. "I came on purpose to save sinners: my business is with them. There are none righteous; and as a physician is in his proper place with the 'sick,' so am I with guilty and miserable sinners."

### John Calvin:
1. "Hypocrites, being satisfied and intoxicated with a foolish confidence in their own righteousness, do not consider the purpose for which Christ was sent into the world, and do not acknowledge the depth of evils in which the human race is plunged, or the dreadful wrath and curse of God which lies on all."
2. "He came to quicken the dead, to justify the guilty and condemned, to wash those who were polluted and full of uncleanness, to rescue the lost from hell, to clothe with his glory those who were covered with shame, to renew to a blessed immortality those who were debased by disgusting vices."
3. "If we feel disgust at being associated by Baptism and the Lord’s Supper with vile men, and regard our connection with them as a sort of stain upon us, we ought immediately to descend into ourselves, and to search without flattery our own evils."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Our Lord, in figurative language, lays down a principle, applicable to the case, on their own estimate of themselves, and the publicans and sinners."
2. "They that are whole have no need of physician, but they that are sick. He is the Physician; the two classes are, the objectors and those objected to."
3. "Those thinking themselves whole (although really they are not) need not (or do not admit their need of) a physician, but those thinking themselves sick (which is really their case)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "But they that are sick." - Probably a current proverb about the physician.
2. "As a physician of body and soul Jesus was bound to come in close touch with the social outcasts."

### John Gill:
1. "He knows the nature of all the diseases of the soul, without being told them by the patient; what are the true causes of them; what is proper to apply; when is the best time, and what the best manner."
2. "He is an infallible one, none ever went from him without a cure; none ever perished under his hands; the disease he heals never returns more to prevail, so as to bring on death and destruction; and he does all freely, without money, and without price."
3. "He suggests indeed, that 'they that be whole', in perfect health and strength [...] were strong, robust, and able to do anything, and everything of themselves; these truly stood in no 'need of' him, as a physician, in their own apprehension."
