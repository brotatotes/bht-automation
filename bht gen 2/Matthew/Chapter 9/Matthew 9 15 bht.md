# Matthew 9:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The words of the Lord about being the Bridegroom fulfill prophecies and figures from the Old Testament, highlighting the relationship between Christ and the Church. This early announcement is both sublime and peaceful, setting the stage for the bitter passage ahead. The fasting of the Christian life should be genuine and born out of the sorrow of the absence of the Bridegroom in our souls. We should not engage in forced and ritualistic fasting, but rather let it be a response to our longing for Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Our Lord in calling Himself the Bridegroom, announces the fulfilment in Him of a whole cycle of O.T. prophecies and figures: very probably with immediate reference to Hosea 2:1-23, that prophet having been cited just before: but also to many other passages, in which the Bride is the Church of God, the Bridegroom the God of Israel."
2. "How sublime and peaceful is this early announcement by our Lord of the bitter passage before Him!"
3. "And this furnishes us with an analogous rule for the fasting of the Christian life: that it should be the genuine offspring of inward and spiritual sorrow, of the sense of the absence of the Bridegroom in the soul, not the forced and stated fasts of the old covenant, now passed away."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ apologizes for his disciples on the score of the season, alleging that God was still pleased to indulge them in joyous feelings, as if they were present at a marriage."
2. "The apology rests on this consideration, that fasting and prayers are adapted to sorrow and adversity: extraordinary prayers I mean, such as are here mentioned."
3. "When the Lord sometimes endures the weakness of our brethren, and acts towards them with gentleness, while he treats us with greater severity, we have no right to murmur."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The application is of course to the disciples of Christ; He Himself being the bridegroom. A common Old Testament figure."
2. "‘How sublime and peaceful is this early announcement by our Lord of the bitter passage before Him’ (Alford)."
3. "Real fasting takes place where there is real occasion for it. History shows that prescribed fasts become formal; that formal fasting is closely linked with Pharisaical ritualism."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The sons of the bride-chamber" is a late Hebrew idiom for the wedding guests, "the friends of the bridegroom and all the sons of the bride-chamber" (Tos. Berak. ii. 10). 
2. Cf. John 2:29.

### John Gill:
1. "By the 'bridegroom' Christ means himself, who stands in such a relation to his church, and to all believers."
2. "The disciples, who were the friends of the bridegroom,...rejoiced at hearing his voice."
3. "The time of Christ's being with his disciples...was their rejoicing time, and there was a great deal of reason for it; they had no occasion to fast and mourn."

### John Wesley:
1. "The children of the bride chamber - The companions of the bridegroom."
2. "While I am with them, it is a festival time, a season of rejoicing, not mourning."
3. "But after I am gone, all my disciples likewise shall be in fastings often."
