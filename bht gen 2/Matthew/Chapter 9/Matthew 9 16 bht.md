# Matthew 9:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The worn-out system of ceremonies should not be combined as a mere addition to the Gospel of liberation and light. Instead, there is a need for a complete transformation - old rituals, burdens, and traditions have passed away. Any attempt to patch up the old with the new will only result in a worse tear. It is crucial to spare the weak by not imposing the same practices on everyone, as not all are suitable for all. The focus should be on the new life that Christ brings, rather than forcing conformity to outdated customs.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The complete and beautiful whole of Gospel light and liberty must not be engrafted as a mere addition on the worn out system of ceremonies." 
2. "The robe must be all new, all consistent: old things, old types, old ceremonies, old burdens, sacrifices, priests, sabbaths, and holy days, all are passed away: behold all things are become new." 
3. "A worse rent takes place: not, as E. V., 'the rent is made worse,' a worse rent, because the old, original rent was included within the circumference of the ·ºêœÄŒØŒ≤ŒªŒ∑ŒºŒ±, whereas this is outside it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Jesus thus pictures the combination of the old forms of piety peculiar to John and his disciples with the new religious life emanating from himself..."
2. "...as the patching of an old garment with a piece of unfulled cloth..."
3. "...which would stretch and tear loose from the old fabric and make a worse rent than before."

### John Calvin:
1. "The amount of the statement is, that all must not be compelled indiscriminately to live in the same manner, for there is a diversity of natural character, and all things are not suitable to all; and particularly, we ought to spare the weak, that they may not be broken by violence, or crushed by the weight of the burden."
2. "He does not mean that they were wasted by long use, but that they were weak and wanted strength."
3. "Our Lord speaks according to the custom of the country, when he uses the word bottles instead of tuns or casks."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The worn out system of fasting for fasting‚Äôs sake cannot be patched up with a piece from the new, fresh, complete gospel."
2. "It is often attempted [to patch up the old with the new], but care must be taken that nothing directly appointed by God be deemed ‚Äòantiquated.‚Äô"
3. "No one putteth a patch of undressed, or ‚Äòunfulled‚Äô cloth upon an old garment. The patch of cloth that would shrink, placed on a worn garment, would tear the weaker fibre; and a worse rent takes place, since the new rent is all round the patch that covered the old one."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "An unfulled, raw piece of woollen cloth that will shrink when wet and tear a bigger hole than ever."
2. "The 'patch' thus does more harm than good."
3. "Our word 'schism.'"

### John Gill:
1. "These words are, by Luke 5:36 called a 'parable', as are those in the following verse; and both are commonly interpreted of the unreasonableness and danger of putting young disciples upon severe exercises of religion."
2. "By putting, or sewing the new cloth to their old garment, is designed, their joining their observance of these traditions to their other duties of religion, to make up a justifying righteousness before God; but in vain, and to no purpose."
3. "Such persons, instead of being justified, are in a worse condition; for they not only set up, and exalt their own righteousness, which is criminal, but disparage the righteousness of Christ as imperfect, by joining it to theirs."

### John Wesley:
1. "It is not a proper time for them to fast."
2. "They are not ripe for it."
3. "New cloth...will tear away the edges to which it is sewed."
