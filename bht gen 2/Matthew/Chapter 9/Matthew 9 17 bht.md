# Matthew 9:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The old bottles, representing the self-righteous religious leaders, are unable to contain the new wine of God's love and grace. This new wine, symbolizing the Gospel and its blessings, cannot be received and retained by those who rely on their own righteousness. Just as fermenting wine will burst worn-out bottles, the new life and teachings of Christ cannot be confined within the limited mindset of self-righteousness. Instead, the message of God's love and grace must be embraced by those with open hearts, ready to accept the truth and understand its deeper meaning.

### John Gill:
1. "For by 'old bottles' are meant, the Scribes and Pharisees...in whom the old man was predominant, were mere formal professors of religion, and self-righteous persons." 
2. "And by 'new wine' is meant, either the love and favour of God compared to wine, that is neat and clean...or the Gospel is signified by wine, for its purity, good flavour, and pleasant taste."
3. "Now as the new wine is not put into old bottles, else the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: so the love of God, the Gospel of the grace of God, and the blessings of it, are not received and retained, nor can they be, by natural men, by self-righteous persons."

### John Wesley:
1. "Fermenting wine will soon burst those bottles, the leather of which is almost worn out."
