# Matthew 9:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The ruler's daughter, whom both Mark and Luke mention, was named Jairus and he was a prominent ruler of the synagogue in Capernaum. Matthew briefly mentions her as 'just now dead,' indicating that he had left her in a critical condition and possibly received news of her death. This ruler, despite his position, displayed a notable act of faith by seeking Jesus for help, even though synagogue rulers were commonly opposed to him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "A ruler of the synagogue, named Jaeirus."
2. "She was not dead, but dying: at the last extremity."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Is even now dead [αρτι ετελευτησεν] . The literal force of the aorist tense is more graphic. Just now died.

### John Calvin:
1. "The only difference is, that the name of Jairus, which is withheld by Matthew, is mentioned by Mark and Luke...there is no absurdity in saying that Matthew, studying brevity, merely glances at those particulars which the other two give in minute detail."
2. "The Evangelists agree in relating, that while Christ, at the request of a ruler of the synagogue, was coming to his house, a woman on the road was secretly cured of a bloody flux by touching his cloak; and that afterwards Christ came into the ruler’s house, and raised a dead young woman to life."
3. "We have here a bright mirror in which the divine condescension towards us is beheld...Though we have not such abundance of faith as might be desired, there is no reason why our weakness should drive away or discourage us from prayer."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A ruler (named Jairus; Mark and Luke), i.e., the president of the synagogue, in virtue of his position as one of the Jewish elders. Therefore of the highest social rank in the city, as Matthew and his company were of the lowest."
2. "Worshipped him. 'Fell at his feet' (Mark and Luke)."
3. "Concise statement Mark and Luke give fuller details: the ruler says that she is at the point of death, and on the way news of her actual death arrives. He had some faith, but not that Jesus could heal with a word, so he asks: Come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Just now died," "just dead" (Moffatt).
2. It is not always easy even for physicians to tell when actual death has come.
3. "The damsel is not dead, but sleepeth," meaning that she did not die to stay dead.

### John Gill:
1. "This man, as both Mark and Luke say, was named Jairus; and was a ruler, not of the sanhedrim, or lesser consistory, but of the synagogue that was at Capernaum; and whom the Jews call, 'the head of the synagogue'."
2. "Her case seems to be differently represented; Mark says, she was 'at the point of death', or 'in the last extremity'; and Luke, that she 'lay dying': but Matthew here says, that she was 'even now dead', which may be easily reconciled."
3. "The ruler's address to Christ on this occasion, is a very considerable, though not so great an instance of faith as some others; that he, who was a ruler of a synagogue, should apply to Christ, which sort of men were generally most averse to him."

### John Wesley:
1. Just dead — He had left her at the point of death, Mark 5:23. Probably a messenger had now informed him she was dead. Mark 5:22; Luke 8:41.
