# Matthew 9:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The presence of a prominent figure in the city drew a crowd to Jesus, reflecting the unusual interest this man generated. Although some may see this situation as commonplace, for those who deeply experience it, it stirs a mysterious and painful sympathy within them. In an act of faith, a woman intentionally approached Jesus from behind and touched the fringe of his garment, the slightest contact possible. In response, Jesus did not criticize the man's profession or question his faith, instead choosing to overlook any weaknesses and immediately accompanying him.
