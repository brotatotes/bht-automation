# Matthew 9:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The remarkable miracle occurred when a paralytic man was brought to Jesus, lying on a bed or couch due to his debilitating condition. It is evident that the faith of both the paralytic and those who brought him moved Jesus. In recognizing their demonstrated faith, Jesus addressed the paralytic as son, showing His compassion and willingness to meet their needs. (Based on Mark 2:3; Luke 5:18)

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Either it was the natural consequence of sinful indulgence, or by its means the feeling of sinfulness and guilt was more strongly aroused in him, and he recognized the misery of his disease as the punishment of his sins."
2. "At all events spiritual and bodily pain seem to have been connected and interchanged within him, and the former to have received accession of strength from the presence of the latter."
3. "The old grammarians themselves were divided about this word... some... treat it as identical with ἀφῶνται ... others, more correctly, take it for the preterite (= ἀφεῖνται ), e.g. Herodian, the Etymologicon, and Suidas, with this difference however, that Suidas believes it to be a Doric, the author of the Etym. an Attic form; the former is certainly right, and this perfect-passive form is cognate with the perf.-act. ἀφέωκα ."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Luke says 'they went upon the housetop, and let him down through the tiling.' To us it would appear that much injury must have been done to the house where Jesus was, and that they must be much incommoded by the removal of tiles and rafters, etc. An acquaintance, however, with the mode of building in the East removes every difficulty of this nature."
2. "This center room, or court, is commonly uncovered or open above. In wet weather, however, and in times of great heat of the sun, it is covered with an awning or canvas, stretched on cords and capable of being easily removed or rolled up. This is what Mark means when he says 'they uncovered the roof.' They 'rolled up' or removed this awning."
3. "The perseverance they had manifested was the evidence of their faith or confidence in his power to heal the sick man."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is God alone, indeed, who knows faith: but they had given evidence of faith by the laboriousness of that attempt."
2. "The fruit of their faith appeared in their not being wearied out, when they found the entrance closed up on all sides."
3. "But the only way of obtaining deliverance from all evils is to have God reconciled to us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Behold. A remarkable miracle."
2. "Seeing their faith, not only of the bearers, but of the man himself, since what follows shows his strong faith."
3. "Thy sins are forgiven. A positive declaration, 'they have been, and are now forgiven.' Certainly not a concession to the popular notion that such sickness was a direct judgment for sin."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They were bringing, a little bed or couch, lying on a bed, stretched on a couch." 
2. "Thy sins are forgiven, one of the dialectical forms appearing in the Koine."

### John Gill:
1. "These brought him to Jesus, lying on a bed, or couch, he being so enfeebled by the disease upon him, his nerves so weak, and the members of his body in such a tremor, that he was not able to walk himself, nor even to be carried by others in any other way than this." 
2. "Christ took notice not only of their faith, but of the sick man's too, who suffered himself to be brought out in this condition, and was contented to go through so much fatigue and trouble, to get at him."
3. "He bids him 'be of good cheer'... under a sense of his sins and transgressions; which Jesus knowing, very pertinently says, 'thy sins be forgiven thee'."

### John Wesley:
1. Seeing their faith — Both that of the paralytic, and of them that brought him.Son — A title of tenderness and condescension. Mark 2:3; Luke 5:18.
