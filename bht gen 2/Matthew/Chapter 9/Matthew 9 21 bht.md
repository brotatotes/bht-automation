The woman in question had a strong conviction that even a touch of Jesus' garment would bring about her healing.

After seeking medical help for many years without success, she may have clung to the hope of a miraculous intervention. Her persistence paid off, as she found healing through her faith in Jesus.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If I do but touch, etc. â€˜Mayâ€™ should be omitted; she was timid, not doubtful."
2. "It is implied that she wished only to touch some part of His clothes, no matter which."
3. "She may have looked for some magical influence, but twelve years in the hands of physicians in those days would certainly excuse such a thought in a weak woman."

### John Gill:
1. "Her faith was, that if she might be allowed, or if she could by any means come at him, to touch any part of his garment, she should have a cure."
