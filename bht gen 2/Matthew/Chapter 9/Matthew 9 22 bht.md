# Matthew 9:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The woman who was healed by touching Jesus' garment demonstrated faith and fear, with a trembling response to her healing. Jesus, perceiving that power had gone out from him, inquired about who had touched him. This question was not out of ignorance, but rather a reminder for the woman to take courage. Her trembling showed the weakness of her faith, and Jesus wanted to strengthen her. Through her confession and testimony, her faith was commended, and she was called daughter by Jesus, reflecting His kindness and tenderness towards her.
