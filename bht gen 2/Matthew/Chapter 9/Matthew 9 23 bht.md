# Matthew 9:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The use of musical instruments during mourning was not meant to alleviate the grief of the bereaved, but rather to intensify and express it. The sound of flutes and other instruments, along with the mourners' disheveled hair and sorrowful tones, evoked deep emotions and brought forth tears from those who witnessed the mourning. The choice of instruments varied depending on the age of the deceased, with flutes commonly played when a child had passed away and louder instruments for the death of adults. These customs and practices surrounding mourning in biblical times demonstrate the reality and seriousness of death.
