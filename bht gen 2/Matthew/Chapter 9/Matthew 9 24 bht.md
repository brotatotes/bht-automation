# Matthew 9:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The crowd's reaction to Jesus' statement that the girl was not dead but sleeping was one of mockery and scorn, dismissing his words as foolishness. However, Jesus meant that the girl's death was not permanent, but rather a temporary state akin to sleep, from which he would soon awaken her. Just as Jesus had the power to raise the dead, he intended to demonstrate that death is not the ultimate end, but a temporary suspension of life. Thus, his words carried a deeper meaning, proclaiming his authority over death itself.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "No inference can be drawn from these words as to the fact of the maiden’s actual death; for our Lord uses equivalent words respecting Lazarus (Joh 11:11)."
2. "In both cases, the words are most probably used with reference to the speedy awakening which was to follow."
3. "Luke appends, after κατ. αὐτ., εἰδότες ὅτι ἀπέθανεν, in which words there is at least no recognition by the Evangelist of a mere apparent death."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth. A direct reference to the miracle, which He was about to perform. She did not die, as others die; but she is as one who sleepeth, for I am about to raise her, as one is wakened from a sleep."
2. "There is also a deeper and more general meaning; for Christ has, by His own resurrection and His promise to raise believers, declared death to be but a sleep."
3. "And they laughed him to scorn. They laughed Him down, not sharing the father's faith."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ's meaning is, that she was not so dead as the company thought; as always to remain in the state of the dead, and not to be restored to life again."
2. "Our Lord signifies, it would be seen in a very little time, that she should be raised again, just as a person is awaked out of sleep."
3. "They mocked at his words, and had him in the utmost contempt, as a very weak silly man; taking him either to be a madman, or a fool; knowing that she was really dead, of which they had all the evidence they could have."

### John Wesley:
1. "Withdraw - There is no need of you now; for the maid is not dead - Her life is not at an end."
2. "But sleepeth - This is only a temporary suspension of sense and motion, which should rather be termed sleep than death."
