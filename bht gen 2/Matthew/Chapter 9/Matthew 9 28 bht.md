# Matthew 9:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage shows that Jesus initially did not respond to the request for healing, allowing their cries to go unanswered to test the depth and sincerity of their faith. When Jesus finally questioned their belief in His ability to heal, it was not out of doubt but to further strengthen their faith and bring about a confession of faith in Him as the Son of David. Their unwavering belief in His power and identity was a crucial factor in the eventual granting of the healing miracle, which served to deepen their faith and emphasize the connection between faith and salvation.
