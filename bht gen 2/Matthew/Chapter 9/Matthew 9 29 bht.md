# Matthew 9:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, in his compassion, touched the blind men's eyes as an outward sign of His power, rewarding the faith they had placed in Him. He could have simply spoken the word and restored their sight, but He chose to physically touch them to accommodate their limited understanding. This demonstrated to them that their belief in His ability to heal was not in vain, as they experienced an immediate and miraculous cure.

### Henry Alford:
1. "In this miracle however we have this peculiar feature, that no direct word of power passes from our Lord, but a relative concession, making that which was done a measure of the faith of the blind men." 
2. "We may already notice, in the history of this first period of our Lord’s ministry, that from having at first yielded immediately to the request for healing, He begins, by degrees, to prove and exercise the faith of the applicants."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "According to your faith be it unto you—not, Receive a cure proportioned to your faith, but, Receive this cure as granted to your faith."

### John Calvin:
