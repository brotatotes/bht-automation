# Matthew 9:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This man is accused of blaspheming because he claims to have the power to forgive sins, an act that is reserved for God alone. The religious leaders are quick to accuse him, assuming that he is ascribing to himself what is meant for God. His words and actions show that he is, in fact, divine and has the authority to do what only God can do.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "When applied to God, it means to speak of him unjustly; to ascribe to him acts and attributes which he does not possess; or to speak impiously or profanely."
2. "It also means to say or do anything by which his name or honor is insulted, or which conveys an 'impression' unfavourable to God."
3. "Christ was charged 'with saying a thing in his own name, or attempting to do a thing, which properly belonged to God;' thus assuming the place of God, and doing him injury, as the scribes supposed, by an invasion of his prerogatives."

### John Calvin:
1. "They accuse Christ of blasphemy and sacrilege, because he claims for himself what is God’s prerogative."
2. "It is beyond all question, that their eagerness to slander drove them to this wicked conclusion. If they think that there is any thing which deserves blame, why do they not inquire into it?"
3. "They must have been already poisoned by malice and envy, otherwise they would not so eagerly have seized an occasion of blaming Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Blasphemeth. The parallel passages base the charge on the correct premise, that God only can forgive sins. The language of our Lord must therefore have been authoritative."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  This man blasphemeth  (ουτος βλασφημε). See the sneer in "this fellow." "The prophet always is a scandalous, irreverent blasphemer from the conventional point of view" (Bruce). 

### John Gill:
1. "They reasoned and concluded in their own minds...that this man blasphemeth: the reason was, because they thought he ascribed that to himself, which was peculiar to God."
