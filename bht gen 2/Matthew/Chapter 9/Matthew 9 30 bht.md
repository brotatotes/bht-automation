# Matthew 9:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus sternly warned them... This warning was given firmly and emphatically, indicating the seriousness of the situation. Their eyes were opened, their vision fully restored, and they were to keep this miracle private, as Jesus instructed. The reasons for this secrecy are not entirely clear, perhaps to avoid any appearance of seeking attention or popularity, or because Jesus foresaw negative consequences that would arise from too much attention being drawn to the miracle.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The purpose of our Lord’s earnestness appears to have been twofold: (1) that He might not be so occupied and over-pressed with applications as to have neither time nor strength for the preaching of the Gospel: (2) to prevent the already-excited people from taking some public measure of recognition, and thus arousing the malice of the Pharisees before His hour was come."
2. "No doubt the two men were guilty of an act of disobedience in thus breaking the Lord’s solemn injunction: for obedience is better than sacrifice; the humble observance of the word of the Lord, than the most laborious and wide-spread will-worship after man’s own mind and invention."
3. "Trench (Miracles, p. 197) well remarks, that the fact of almost all the Romish interpreters having applauded this act, is “very characteristic, and rests on very deep differences.”

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 30. And their eyes were opened: and
	Jesus straitly charged them—The expression is very strong,
	denoting great earnestness.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "And their eyes were opened - Immediately. That is, their sight was restored."
2. "And Jesus straitly charged them... He enjoined it on them in the most earnest and solemn manner."
3. "The injunction could not mean that they should screen the fact that no one 'should' know it, for there were witnesses of it, and it would be made known; but they were not to make it a point to proclaim to the world what was done to them."

### John Calvin:
1. "Either he wished to have other persons as witnesses of the miracle, or to delay the publication of it till another time."
2. "Their conduct in immediately proclaiming it every where is worthy of blame: for the notion entertained by some, that Christ forbade them for the purpose of exciting them the more, has been already refuted."
3. "There was, no doubt, some reason for forbidding it, which is unknown to us; and those men, through inconsiderate zeal, spread the rumor before the proper time."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And their eyes were opened. A figurative but natural expression for restoration to sight."
2. "Jesus solemnly charged them, almost equivalent to 'sternly threatened them.' These men had already shouted their belief in His Messiahship, in the public street, and their over-ready zeal might provoke over-ready opposition."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Triple augment (on οι=ωι, ε and then on preposition αν = ην)."
2. "Strictly charged them  (ενεβριμηθη αυτοις)."
3. "The word describes rather a rush of deep feeling which in the synoptic passages showed itself in a vehement injunctive and in John 11:33 in look and manner."

### John Gill:
1. "And their eyes were opened... their sight was perfectly restored to them; and they had a clear, full, and true sight of objects."
2. "Jesus straitly charged them, saying, see that no man know it... a very strict charge... given with great austerity of countenance, and severity of expression, in a very rough and threatening manner."
3. "The reasons for concealing the miracle are not very obvious... to shun all appearance of vain glory, or seeking popular applause... he might foresee that it would be attended with ill consequences."
