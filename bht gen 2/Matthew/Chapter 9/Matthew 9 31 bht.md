# Matthew 9:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people, after witnessing the power of Christ, couldn't help but share his fame far and wide. Their actions, though disobedient to Christ's command to remain silent, were driven by a genuine desire to honor and glorify him. While their zeal was commendable, it's important to remember that our actions should always be aligned with Christ's will, not our own emotions or desires.
