# Matthew 9:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil. The man who was brought to Jesus was not naturally dumb, but he had been deprived of the use of speech because of the possession by a devil. This event occurred immediately after the healing of two blind men, and it is another remarkable case mentioned by Matthew alone. The friends of the demon-possessed man were convinced of the power of Jesus to heal based on the miracles they had witnessed, leading them to seek his help.

2. "Thus Homer applies it to the earth; the dull, senseless earth ("Iliad," 24 25)."
