# Matthew 9:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Pharisees, in their desperate attempt to discredit Jesus, resorted to connecting him with the devil himself. Yet, their dark and malicious thoughts merely revealed their inability to bear the honor and glory given to Christ. Despite their accusations, they could not deny the fact that Jesus had cast out a demon, and they found no fault in his actions. Their futile attempt to tarnish his reputation by attributing his miracles to a diabolical influence only marked their own blindness and wickedness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This seems to be the first muttering of a theory of such miracles which soon became a fixed mode of calumniating them—a theory which would be ridiculous if it were not melancholy as an outburst of the darkest malignity."
2. "As the Mission of the Twelve supposes the previous choice of them—of which our Evangelist gives no account, and which did not take place till a later stage of our Lord's public life—it is introduced here out of its proper place, which is after what is recorded in Matthew 9:1- :."
3. "Third Galilean Circuit (Matthew 9:1- :) —and probably the last."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If they had understood the saying mentioned in the last verse, as referring to the Messiah, it would provoke some such expression as is here recorded."
2. "Their state was even worse than that of the dumb demoniac; they used their power of speaking to blaspheme one who cast out demons, as if the cause of the latter were their own."
