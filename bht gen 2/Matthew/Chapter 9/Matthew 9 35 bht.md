# Matthew 9:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus went about, performing miracles and teaching, in all parts of Galilee. His ministry was characterized by his compassion for all people, regardless of their situation or condition. He took the message of the gospel to the synagogues, where he not only taught, but also led in prayer and the reading of Scripture. Jesus was not limited to healing specific illnesses, but rather, he had the ability to heal every disease encountered. This was truly a remarkable display of his power and purpose in establishing the kingdom of God.
