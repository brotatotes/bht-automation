# Matthew 9:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The crowds that Jesus saw were burdened and exhausted, both physically and spiritually. They were oppressed by the religious leaders and their heavy burden of religious rules. They were lacking competent spiritual leaders and teachers to guide them, like sheep without a shepherd. The people were scattered and neglected, in need of care and attention. These circumstances moved Jesus to feel deep compassion for them, as their faint and distressed state called for the comfort and guidance that only the true Shepherd could provide.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Harassed, plagued, viz. literally, with weariness in following Him; or spiritually, with the tyranny of the Scribes and Pharisees, their φορτία βαρέα."
2. "The context shows that our Lord’s compassion was excited by their being without competent spiritual leaders and teachers."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted—This reading, however, has hardly any authority at all. The true reading doubtless is, 'were harassed.'" 
2. "And were scattered abroad—rather, 'lying about,' 'abandoned,' or 'neglected.'"
3. "As sheep, having no shepherd—their pitiable condition as weary under bodily fatigue, a vast disorganized mass, being but a faint picture of their wretchedness as the victims of pharisaic guidance; their souls uncared for, yet drawn after and hanging upon Him. This moved the Redeemer's compassion."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He saw the people burdened with the rites of religion and the doctrines of the Pharisees; sinking down under their ignorance and the weight of their traditions; neglected by those who ought to have been enlightened teachers; and scattered and driven out without care and attention." 
2. "With great beauty he compares them to sheep wandering without a shepherd. Judea was a land of flocks and herds. The faithful shepherd, by day and night, was with his flock. He defended it, made it to lie down in green pastures, and led it beside the still waters, Psalms 23:2." 
3. "No wonder that the compassionate Redeemer was moved with pity."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Fainted [ησαν εσκυλμενοι] . Rev., better, were distressed."
2. "The word originally means to flay, rend, or mangle."
3. "It is not the dispersion one from another, but their prostration in themselves that is meant."

### John Calvin:
1. "We must listen to the voice of Christ, who declares, that where there are no laborers there are no shepherds, and that those sheep are wandering and scattered which are not collected into the fold of God by the doctrine of the gospel."
2. "His being moved with compassion proves him to be the faithful servant of the Father in promoting the salvation of his people, for whose sake he had clothed himself with our flesh."
3. "Now that he has been received into heaven, he does not retain the same feelings to which he chose to be liable in this mortal life: yet he has not left off the care of his church, but looks after his wandering sheep, or rather, he gathers his flock which had been cruelly chased and torn by the wolves."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Popularity called forth pity. Our Lord's sympathy, like ours, was called forth by particular, passing events."
2. "A figure, showing the spiritual condition of the people. They were suffering ('distressed') from the burdens put on them by those who pretended to be their shepherds, the scribes and Pharisees, and uncared for by these, they wandered ('scattered') as sheep left to stray from the pasture."
3. "All who are without the good Shepherd are thus Spiritually vexed and abandoned."

2. "Being as sheep without a shepherd; that was good for anything, or did the office and duty of a shepherd to them."
3. "The Scribes and Pharisees were shepherds indeed, such as they were, but very bad ones; like the shepherds of Israel of old, who fed themselves, and not the flock."

### John Wesley:
1. "Because they were faint — In soul rather than in body."
2. "As sheep having no shepherd — And yet they had many teachers; they had scribes in every city."
3. "But they had none who cared for their souls, and none that were able, if they had been willing, to have wrought any deliverance. They had no pastors after God's own heart."
