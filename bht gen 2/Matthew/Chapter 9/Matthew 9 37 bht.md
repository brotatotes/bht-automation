# Matthew 9:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The great harvest represents the numerous souls that are ready to be gathered to Christ. However, there is a shortage of laborers who are equipped and called to bring these souls into the Kingdom of God. Only a few are willing to take on the laborious task of spreading the Gospel and converting sinners, while the majority of people remain idle or focused on other pursuits.
