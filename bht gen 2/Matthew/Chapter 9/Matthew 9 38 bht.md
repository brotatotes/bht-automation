# Matthew 9:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Pray to the Lord of the harvest, the one who has the power and authority to bring in all the chosen ones. It is not a task for just anyone, but only those whom God equips with gifts and sends out. We should ask for laborers who are dedicated and hardworking, willing to face the challenges and sacrifices that come with serving in the Lord's harvest. Only those who truly understand the significance and weight of this calling can be effective workers in Christ's harvest.
