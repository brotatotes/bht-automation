# Matthew 9:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus demonstrated his divinity by revealing the secret thoughts of the people. This was a clear evidence of his deity, as only God knows the thoughts of the heart. By forgiving sins, he claimed a power that belonged to God alone. This should have been enough to prove himself as the true Messiah, as it was considered a way to recognize the Messiah according to the Jews. Jesus had no need of human testimony, for he knew the hearts of men, as this instance clearly showed.
