# Matthew 9:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It's important to consider the question: which is easier, to forgive sins or to perform a miraculous healing? This question is not about the difficulty of the task itself, but rather about the authority of the one who claims to have the power to do it. The healing serves as evidence that the one who can perform such a miracle also has the authority to forgive sins. By healing the body, it attests to the power and authority to heal the soul. Ultimately, both actions demonstrate a divine power and authority that only God possesses.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In our Lord’s argument it must be carefully noted, that He does not ask, which is easiest, to forgive sins, or to raise a sick man for it could not be affirmed that that of forgiving was easier than this of healing but, which is easiest, to claim this power or that, to say Thy sins be forgiven thee, or to say, Arise and walk?"
2. "That (i.e. the former) is easiest, and I will now prove my right to say it, by saying with effect and with an outward consequence setting its seal to my truth, the harder word, Arise and walk."
3. "By doing that which is capable of being put to the proof, I will vindicate my right and power to do that which in its very nature is incapable of being proved."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "One is as easy as the other; and to be able to do the one, involves the right and the power to do the other."

1. "As it is not easier to quicken by a word a body which is nearly dead than to forgive sins, there is no reason to wonder that he forgives sins, when he has accomplished the other."
2. "Christ adapts his discourse to their capacity: for, being carnal, they were more powerfully affected by outward signs, than by all the spiritual power of Christ, which related to eternal salvation."
3. "Thus he proves the efficacy of the Gospel for quickening men from the fact, that at the last day he will raise the dead by his voice out of their graves."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Which is easiest, to claim this power or to claim that; to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee, or to say, Arise and walk?"

3. "By doing that which is submitted to the eyes of men, I will attest my right and power to do that which, in its very nature, lies out of the region of proof."
