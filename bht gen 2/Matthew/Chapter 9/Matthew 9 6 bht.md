### Henry Alford:
1. "The Alexandrian Fathers, in their conflict with the Nestorians, made use of this passage in proof of the entire transference which there was of all the properties of Christâ€™s divine nature to His human."

2. "The fact that a man, just before perfectly helpless, could now take up and carry his own bed or couch, proved that a divine 'power' had been exerted; and that fact proved that he who had performed the miracle must also have the 'power' and the 'authority' to forgive sin."
3. "Such a bed is obviously a portable one; it is easy to take it up, fold it together, and carry it from place to place, as convenience may require."

### John Calvin:
1. "By these words Christ declares that he is not only the minister and witness, but likewise the author, of this grace."
2. "Christâ€™s meaning was, that forgiveness of sins ought not to be sought from a distance: for he exhibits it to men in his own person, and as it were in his hands."
3. "Now, as Christ descended to earth for the purpose of exhibiting to men the grace of God as present, he is said to forgive sins visibly, because in him and by him the will of God was revealed which, according to the perception of the flesh, had been formerly hidden above the clouds."

2. "He ordered him to 'arise' from his bed, on which he was carried by four men, and 'take up his bed', and carry it himself; which would be not only an evidence that the disease had left him, but that he was in full strength, and perfect health."
