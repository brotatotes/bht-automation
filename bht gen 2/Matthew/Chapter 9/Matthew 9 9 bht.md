# Matthew 9:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Matthew, also known as Levi, was called by Jesus while he was sitting at the custom house, the place where customs and taxes were collected. Despite the detestable reputation of tax collectors, Matthew was chosen by Jesus out of that very place to become one of his apostles. This choice demonstrated the amazing grace of God, as it showcased how the calling and conversion of Matthew revealed the power of Christ's word and the sovereign and distinguishing grace of God. With great readiness, Matthew left behind his profitable occupation and wholeheartedly followed Jesus as his disciple.
