## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "prisoner of Christ Jesus, i.e. one whom He (or His cause) has placed in bonds"
2. "the tact of the Apostle in associating with Philemon those connected with his house, but not going beyond the limits of the house"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "prisoner of Jesus Christ â€“ one whom Christâ€™s cause has made a prisoner"
2. "He does not call himself, as in other Epistles, 'Paul an apostle,' as he is writing familiarly, not authoritatively."
3. "...fellow labourer â€“ in building up the Church at Colosse, while we were at Ephesus."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ - A prisoner at Rome in the cause of Jesus Christ." 
2. "As Timothy was of that region of country, and as he had accompanied Paul in his travels, he was doubtless acquainted with Philemon."
3. "The word rendered 'fellow-laborer' does not determine what office he held, if he held any, or in what respects he was a fellow-laborer with Paul. It means a co-worker, or helper, and doubtless here means that he was a helper or fellow-worker in the great cause to which Paul had devoted his life."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A prisoner for Christ's sake. This is the only salutation in which Paul so styles himself. The word is appropriate to his confinement at Rome." 
2. "Timothy, our brother. Lit., the brother. Timothy could not be called an apostle. He is distinctly excluded from this office in 2 Corinthians 1:1; Colossians 1:1; compare Philippians 1:1." 
3. "Philemon. An inhabitant, and possibly a native of Colossae in Phrygia. He was one of Paul's converts (ver. 19), and his labors in the Gospel at Colossae are attested by the title fellow-laborer, and illustrated by his placing his house at the disposal of the Colossian Christians for their meetings (ver. 2)."

### John Calvin:
1. "Sending back a runaway slave and thief, he supplicates pardon for him. But in pleading this cause, he discourses about Christian forbearance with such ability, that he appears to speak about the interests of the whole Church rather than the private affairs of a single individual."
2. "In behalf of a man of the lowest condition, he demeans himself so modestly and humbly, that nowhere else is the meekness of his temper painted in a more lively manner."
3. "In the same sense in which he elsewhere calls himself an Apostle of Christ, or a minister of Christ, he now calls himself 'a prisoner of Christ'; because the chains by which he was bound on account of the gospel were the ornaments or badges of that embassy which he exercised for Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Paul, a prisoner...employs a word which should challenge sympathy more than make a claim to obedience."
2. "This was St. Paulâ€™s first imprisonment at Rome, which lasted for two whole years...The Epistle to Philemon may therefore have been written near the close of his imprisonment."
3. "It was for the cause of Christâ€™s religion, and that it might be spread abroad, that the apostle was in prison...and of this grace the Gentiles were partakers."

### John Gill:
1. "He was not a prisoner for any capital crime, and therefore had no reason to be ashamed of his chain, nor was he; but rather gloried in it."
2. "he chooses to make use of rather than that of a servant of God, or an apostle of Christ, as he elsewhere does, that he might not by constraint, or authority, but by love, move the pity and compassion of Philemon to grant his request."
3. "and to show that they were united in this affair, and both desired this favour of him; hoping that by their joint application it would be obtained."

### John Wesley:
1. "This single epistle infinitely transcends all the wisdom of the world."
2. "It gives us a specimen how Christians ought to treat of secular affairs from higher principles."
3. "Paul a prisoner of Christ â€” To whom, as such, Philemon could deny nothing."
