# Philemon 1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul, as a prisoner of Jesus Christ, writes this epistle that surpasses all worldly wisdom. In it, he addresses secular matters with principles rooted in Christ, setting an example for Christians. Paul's imprisonment for the cause of Christ lends weight to his plea, making it difficult for Philemon to refuse his request.
