# Philemon 10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul refers to the person as his spiritual child whom he had begotten in my bonds. This signifies the special bond formed between Paul and this individual while he was in prison. Despite his confinement, Paul finds solace in the fact that the word of God was not limited but had a free course and was glorified. This highlights how Paul's teachings and influence were able to transcend his physical circumstances, impacting the lives of others, including his spiritual child.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In the Greek, the name 'Onesimus' is skillfully put last, he puts first a favorable description of him before he mentions the name that had fallen into so bad repute with Philemon."
2. "Scripture does not sanction slavery, but at the same time does not begin a political crusade against it."
3. "It sets forth principles of love to our fellow men which were sure (as they have done) in due time to undermine and overthrow it, without violently convulsing the then existing political fabric, by stirring up slaves against their masters."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The address and tact of Paul here are worthy of particular observation."
2. "The phrase 'my son' makes the way easy for the mention of his name, for he had already found the way to his heart before his eye lighted on his name."
3. "The delicate address of the apostle in introducing the subject is better seen in the original than in our translation... Was there ever more delicacy evinced in preparing the way for disarming one of prejudice and carrying an appeal to his heart?"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word means helpful, and it was a common name for slaves."
2. "Under Roman law the slave was a chattel."

3. "The Jews, as may be seen all through the Old Testament, were specially regardful of the meaning of names, so we need not wonder that when he writes the name, the sense which it had, and how aforetime the bearer of it had not corresponded to it in his character, should at once come into his mind, and furnish the thought which follows in the next verse."

### John Gill:
1. "he really was his spiritual father; he had been the happy instrument of his conversion" 
2. "the word of God was not bound, but had a free course, and was glorified"
