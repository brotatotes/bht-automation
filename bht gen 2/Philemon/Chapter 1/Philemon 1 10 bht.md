# Philemon 10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul affectionately speaks of Onesimus as his spiritual child, whom he had brought to Christ while he was in chains. He takes pride in the fact that he had played a significant role in the conversion of Onesimus, thus making him his son in a spiritual sense. This personal bond between Paul and Onesimus serves as a strong plea to Philemon, urging him to receive his runaway servant with love and forgiveness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I beseech thee for my son, whom I have begotten in my bonds, Onesimus." 
2. "Scripture does not sanction slavery, but at the same time does not begin a political crusade against it."
3. "It sets forth principles of love to our fellow men which were sure (as they have done) in due time to undermine and overthrow it, without violently convulsing the then existing political fabric, by stirring up slaves against their masters."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The phrase 'my son' makes the way easy for the mention of his name, for he had already found the way to his heart before his eye lighted on his name, by the mention of the relation which he sustained to himself."
2. "Who could refuse to such a man as Paul - a laborious servant of Christ - an aged man, exhausted with his many sufferings and toils - and a prisoner - a request which he made for one whom he regarded as his son?"
3. "Was there ever more delicacy evinced in preparing the way for disarming one of prejudice, and carrying an appeal to his heart?"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Under Roman law the slave was a chattel. The attitude of the law toward the slave was expressed in the formula servile caput nullum jus habet; the slave has no right."
2. "The master's power was unlimited. He might mutilate, torture, or kill the slave at his pleasure."
3. "Onesimus was a runaway Phrygian slave, who had committed some crime and therefore had fled from his master and hidden himself in Rome."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul shows that Onesimus is so closely related to him as to afford a good reason for supplicating in his behalf."
2. "When he says that Onesimus has been begotten by him this must be understood to mean, that it was done by his ministry, and not by his power."
3. "Moreover, because the word of God preached by man is the seed of eternal life, we need not wonder that he from whose mouth we receive that seed is called a father."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He puts the tenderest word in the forefront of his petition, and speaks of the fugitive slave as his child, before he mentions him by name."
 
2. "Conversion is so often spoken of in the New Testament as a new birth, that it is not surprising that the apostle employs the figure in speaking of one who had been won to Christ by his ministry."
 
3. "The name is Greek, and signifies 'profitable.' The Jews, as may be seen all through the Old Testament, were specially regardful of the meaning of names, so we need not wonder that when he writes the name, the sense which it had, and how aforetime the bearer of it had not corresponded to it in his character, should at once come into his mind, and furnish the thought which follows in the next verse."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For my child (περ του εμου τεκνου). Tender and affectionate reference to Onesimus as his spiritual child."
2. "Whom I have begotten in my bonds (ον εγεννησα εν τοις δεσμοις). First aorist active indicative of γενναω, to beget."
3. "Paul is evidently proud of winning Onesimus to Christ though a prisoner himself."

### John Gill:
1. "He had been the happy instrument of his conversion, and he was his son according to the common faith, or in a spiritual sense."
2. "But as being the instrument and means of it, through the preaching of the Gospel, the word of truth, by which God of his own will, and by the power of his grace, regenerated this person."
3. "And this circumstance is mentioned to engage Philemon to regard the entreaty of the apostle; he had been the instrument of begetting many souls to Christ; but this man was begotten by him in his bonds, when he was a prisoner, and so was peculiarly dear to him."

### John Wesley:
1. Whom I have begotten in my bonds — The son of my age.
