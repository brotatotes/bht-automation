# Philemon 11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The runaway slave Onesimus had been unprofitable and had wronged his master, but he has now become profitable in both a practical and spiritual sense. Christianity has the power to transform even the most hopeless cases, making an unprofitable person profitable. Philemon is encouraged to see the benefit he will gain from Onesimus as a changed man. The world, including Christians, had been slow to recognize the incompatibility of slavery with Christian principles. However, grace has the ability to make an unprofitable person profitable. The true profit lies in godliness, bringing gain in this life and the life to come.
