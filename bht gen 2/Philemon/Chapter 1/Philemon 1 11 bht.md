# Philemon 11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Onesimus, the runaway slave in Philemon, was once deemed unprofitable and useless. However, the transformative power of Christianity changed his identity. Now referred to as profitable, Onesimus embodies the true meaning of his name. This transformation goes beyond material gain and encompasses becoming a valuable, beneficial, and spiritually impactful individual. Paul acknowledges Onesimus' potential to serve as a valuable servant to Philemon, a supportive Christian brother, and a positive influence to others. Onesimus serves as a powerful reminder that through the grace of Christ, even those considered unprofitable can be transformed into valuable and impactful servants.
