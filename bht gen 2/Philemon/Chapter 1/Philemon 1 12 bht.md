## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The expression more probably means, mine own heart 'as dear to me as mine own heart.'"
2. "But the expression more probably means, mine own heart 'as dear to me as mine own heart.' Meyer compares the expressions in Plautus, 'meum corculum,' Cas. iv. 4. 14, 'meum mel, meum cor,' Pœn. i. 2. 154."
3. "The construction (see var. readd.) is an anacoluthon: the Apostle goes off into the relative clause, and loses sight, as so often, of the construction with which he began."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. mine
	own bowels
	— as dear to me as my own heart [Alford]. Compare  :-,
	“as myself.” The object of my most intense affection as that of a
	parent for a child.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Paul had no power to send Onesimus back to his master unless he chose to go."
2. "There may have been many reasons why Onesimus desired to return to Colosse."
3. "The passage shows that it is right to aid a servant of any kind to return to his master, if he desires it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "I have sent again [ανεπεμψα] . Rev., sent back. The epistolary aorist..."
2. "That Onesimus accompanied the letter appears from Colossians 4:7-9."
3. "Thou therefore receive. Omit, and render aujton him as Rev., in his own person; his very self."

### John Calvin:
1. "Nothing could have been more powerful for assuaging the wrath of Philemon; for if he had refused to forgive his slave, he would thus have used cruelty against 'the bowels' of Paul."
2. "This is remarkable kindness displayed by Paul, that he did not hesitate to receive, as it were into his bowels, a contemptible slave, and thief, and runaway, so as to defend him from the indignation of his master."
3. "And, indeed, if the conversion of a man to God were estimated by us, at its proper value, we too would embrace, in the same manner, those who should give evidence that they had truly and sincerely repented."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "No doubt the discipline of Onesimus' return was food both for master and slave, to the latter that he might have an opportunity of making some amends for his previous wrongdoing, and might show that his Christianity was worth the name and was already fruitful in ripe actions; to Philemon also it was a benefit that he should be called on to exercise forgiveness for a serious wrong..." 
2. "...the more tender conduct which would be shown towards Onesimus in the future, would do something, if not much, toward loosening the bonds of any other slaves among the congregation..."
3. "...it is better to interpret the words here as an expression of deep affection."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I have sent back (ανεπεμψα). Epistolary aorist. As it will look when Onesimus arrives."
2. "In his own person (αυτον). 'Himself,' intensive pronoun with ον (whom)."
3. "My very heart (τα εμα σπλαγχνα). As in verse Philemon 1:7. He almost loves Onesimus as his own son."

### John Gill:
1. "thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels;"
2. "meaning his son, who, in a spiritual sense, came out of his bowels, to whom he stood in the relation of a spiritual father;"
3. "he suggests by this expression, that should he reject him, it would give him the utmost pain and uneasiness; and he should be obliged to cry out as the Prophet Jeremy did, 'my bowels, my bowels, I am pained at the very heart'."

### John Wesley:
1. "Receive him, that is, my own bowels — Whom I love as my own soul."
