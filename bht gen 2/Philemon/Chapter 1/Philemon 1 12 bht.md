# Philemon 12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Receive him with love and compassion, as if he were a part of your own being. This is the deep affection and attachment that Paul feels towards Onesimus, whom he loves dearly. To reject him would cause Paul great pain and distress, just as when the prophet Jeremiah cries out in anguish, my bowels, my bowels, I am pained at the very heart. As a father in Christ, Paul's love for his spiritual children knows no bounds. Let us also show such love towards those who have repented and turned to God, embracing them with open arms.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There does not appear to be any allusion to the fact of sonship in the expression 'mine own heart,' as Chrys., Thdrt. (ἐμός ἐστιν υἱός, ἐκ τῶν ἐμῶν γεγέννηται σπλάγχνων), al.: for thus the spiritual similitude would be confused, being here introduced materially."
2. "But the expression more probably means, 'mine own heart as dear to me as mine own heart.' Meyer compares the expressions in Plautus, ‘meum corculum,’ Cas. iv. 4. 14, ‘meum mel, meum cor,’ Pœn. i. 2. 154."
3. "The construction is an anacoluthon: the Apostle goes off into the relative clause, and loses sight, as so often, of the construction with which he began: taking it up again at Philemon 1:17."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "own bowels— as dear to me as my own heart [Alford]." 
2. "The object of my most intense affection as that of a parent for a child."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There may have been many reasons why Onesimus desired to return to Colosse, and no one can prove that he did not express that desire to Paul, and that his 'sending' him was not in consequence of such a request."
2. "The passage shows that it is right to aid a servant of any kind to return to his master, if he desires it."
3. "There is great delicacy also in this expression. If he had merely said 'receive him,' Philemon might have thought only of him as he formerly was. Paul, therefore, adds, 'that is, mine own bowels' - 'one whom I so tenderly love that he seems to carry my heart with him wherever he goes.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The epistolary aorist, see on 1 Peter 5:12."
2. "That Onesimus accompanied the letter appears from Colossians 4:7-9."
3. "Render aujton him as Rev., in his own person; his very self."

### John Calvin:
1. "Nothing could have been more powerful for assuaging the wrath of Philemon; for if he had refused to forgive his slave, he would thus have used cruelty against 'the bowels' of Paul."
2. "This is remarkable kindness displayed by Paul, that he did not hesitate to receive, as it were into his bowels, a contemptible slave, and thief, and runaway, so as to defend him from the indignation of his master."
3. "And, indeed, if the conversion of a man to God were estimated by us, at its proper value, we too would embrace, in the same manner, those who should give evidence that they had truly and sincerely repented."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "No doubt the discipline of Onesimus’ return was food both for master and slave, to the latter that he might have an opportunity of making some amends for his previous wrongdoing, and might show that his Christianity was worth the name and was already fruitful in ripe actions; to Philemon also it was a benefit that he should be called on to exercise forgiveness for a serious wrong."
2. "The more tender conduct which would be shown towards Onesimus in the future, would do something, if not much, toward loosening the bonds of any other slaves among the congregation at Colossæ."
3. "St. Paul everywhere else uses the word rendered ‘bowels’ for the seat of the feelings and emotions, so that it is better to interpret the words here as an expression of deep affection."

### John Gill:
1. "Thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels."
2. "He suggests by this expression, that should he reject him, it would give him the utmost pain and uneasiness."
3. "He should be obliged to cry out as the Prophet Jeremy did, 'my bowels, my bowels, I am pained at the very heart'."
(45 words)

### John Wesley:
1. "Receive him, that is, my own bowels — Whom I love as my own soul."
2. "Such is the natural affection of a father in Christ toward his spiritual children."
