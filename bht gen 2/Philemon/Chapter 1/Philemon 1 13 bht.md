# Philemon 13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle desired to retain Onesimus with him to serve him in Philemon's place, recognizing that Philemon would have willingly provided the same services if he had been present. This decision was not based on any wrongdoing of Onesimus, but rather on the unique circumstances of Paul being bound for the sake of the Gospel. The apostle's intention was both a reflection of his trust in Onesimus and a recognition of the deep bond that had developed between them.

### John Gill:

2. "He would have kept Onesimus with him, either to have waited upon him, in his bonds, and to have provided for him the necessaries of life; or to have assisted him in the ministration of the word, in the room of Philemon, who, had he been there, would have been employed in such service."
3. "This the apostle observes to prevent an objection that might have been made; that since Onesimus was become so profitable to him, why did he send him back? why did he not keep him for his own service? this he obviates and removes, by signifying he should have done it, but for the following reason."
