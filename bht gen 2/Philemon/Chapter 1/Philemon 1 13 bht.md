# Philemon 13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle expresses his desire to keep Onesimus, as he would have been a valuable help in his ministry. However, he chooses to send him back to Philemon, not because he no longer needs his assistance, but because it is right for Philemon to have him in his service. This decision is made in light of Paul's own imprisonment for the sake of the Gospel. Hence, the apostle sends Onesimus back to his master, emphasizing that his bonds were not due to any wrongdoing, but for the sake of proclaiming the Gospel.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

3. "ὀφείλεις μοι διακονίαν ὡς μαθητὴς διδασκάλῳ , κ . διδασκάλῳ τὰ θεῖα κηρύττοντι : not without allusion also to the fetters which the Gospel had laid on himself."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I would have retained - different Greek from the 'would,' 'I could have wished,' 'I was minded' here; but 'I was not willing'".

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A beautiful specimen of christian courtesy and tact; assuming that Philemon would have desired to render these services in person."
2. "A delicate hint at his sufferings is blended with an intimation of the authority which attaches to his appeal as a prisoner of Christ."
3. "This language of Paul is imitated by Ignatius. 'My bonds exhort you' (Tralles, 12.). 'He (Jesus Christ) is my witness, in whom I am bound' (Philadelphia, 7.). 'In whom I bear about my bonds as spiritual pearls' (Ephesians, 11.). 'In the bonds which I bear about, I sing the praises of the churches' (Magnesians, 1.)."

### John Calvin:
1. "It would have been extreme cruelty, to disdain so strong affection manifested by Paul."
2. "He now mentions other circumstances: first, Onesimus will supply the place of his master, by performing this service; secondly, Paul himself, through modesty, was unwilling to deprive Philemon of his right; and, thirdly, Philemon will receive more applause, if, after having had his slave restored to him, he shall willingly and generously send him back."
3. "From this last consideration we infer, that we ought to aid the martyrs of Christ by every kind office in our power, while they are laboring for the testimony of the gospel; for if exile, imprisonment stripes, blows, and violent seizing of our property, are believed by us to belong to the gospel, as Paul here calls them, whoever refuses to share and partake of them separates himself even from Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I personally would have liked to do this... I was in the mind to hold (or keep) him unto myself."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle was in bonds, not for any crime, for any immorality he had been guilty of, but for the sake of the Gospel, for professing and preaching that."
2. "This the apostle observes to prevent an objection that might have been made; that since Onesimus was become so profitable to him, why did he send him back? why did he not keep him for his own service? this he obviates and removes, by signifying he should have done it, but for the following reason."

### John Wesley:
1. To serve me in thy stead — To do those services for me which thou, if present, wouldest gladly have done thyself.
