# Philemon 14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle Paul, in humility, sought the consent of Philemon before taking any action regarding Onesimus. Despite having the authority to do so, Paul chose to consult Philemon, respecting his ownership of Onesimus. This demonstrates Paul's commitment to justice and equity, as he did not want Philemon's kindness in forgiveness to appear forced. The intention was for Philemon's benefit to come willingly, not under any compulsion or constraint.
