# Philemon 14 Commentary Help Text

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The consent of Philemon should first be gained, and St. Paul will not so far influence his Judgment in the matter, as to write while Onesimus is with him, and ask that he may remain, for then it would appear as if he put some constraint upon the master."
2. "To found a claim on his own labours was the last thing in his mind."
3. "Once more by his language St. Paul implies that he is sure of the love of Philemon. He knows that he would be ready to do him any kind act, but to the eye of the world, if St. Paul had kept Onesimus in Rome, and merely written to announce what he had done, it would have seemed as though no choice was left to the master as to what he should do. It would be as it were of necessity."
