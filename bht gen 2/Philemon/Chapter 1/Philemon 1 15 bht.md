# Philemon 15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle suggests that the hand of God may have been involved in Onesimus' departure from his master, softening the situation by referring to it as a temporary separation. This separation could have been part of God's providential plan, similar to the story of Joseph in Egypt. The ultimate purpose was for Philemon to receive Onesimus back not just as a slave, but as a brother in Christ, establishing a lasting bond that would extend beyond this life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "τάχα is delicately said, to conciliate Philemon: so Chrys., καλῶς τὸ τάχα, ἵνα εἴξῃ ὁ δεσπότης."
2. "εὐφήμως καὶ τὴν φυγὴν χωρισμὸν καλεῖ, ἵνα μὴ τῷ ὀνόματι τῆς θυγῆς παροξύνῃ τὸν δεσπότην."
3. "ἀπέχῃς mayest have him for thine own possess him fully, entirely."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "God's Providence probably (for we cannot dogmatically define the hidden purposes of God in providence) overruled the past evil to ultimately greater good to him."
2. "The same Greek as in Matthew 19:29, 'for ever' - in this life and in that to come."
3. "Onesimus' time of absence, however long, was but a short 'hour' (so Greek) compared with the everlasting devotion henceforth binding him to his master."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was possible that this was permitted in the Providence of God in order that Onesimus might be brought under the influence of the gospel."
2. "What appeared to Philemon, therefore, to be a calamity... might have been permitted to occur in order that he might receive a higher benefit."
3. "That thou shouldest receive him for ever - That is, in the higher relation of a Christian friend and brother; that he might be united to thee in eternal affection."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A humble 'perhaps' often grows into a 'verily, verily' - and a hasty, over - confident 'verily, verily' often dwindles to a hesitating 'perhaps."
2. "Let us not be in too great a hurry to make sure that we have the key of the cabinet where God keeps his purposes, but content ourselves with 'perhaps' when we are interpreting the often questionable ways of His providence, each of which has many meanings and many ends."
3. "Not only does he avoid the word ran away, which might have irritated Philemon, but he also uses the passive voice, not the middle, separated himself, as an intimation that Onesimus' flight was divinely ordered for good."

### John Calvin:
1. "A joyful result may be regarded as a remedy for evils, which is held out to us by the hand of God for blotting out offenses."
2. "Paul therefore reminds Philemon that he ought not to be so greatly offended at the flight of his slave, for it was the cause of a benefit not to be regretted."
3. "He says, therefore, that he was a wanderer for a little time, that, by changing his place, he might be converted and become a new man."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For perhaps he was therefore parted from thee for a season. This more literal rendering brings out the force of the apostle’s words more fully."
2. "And in like manner the rest of the language is strongly in contrast with the clause which follows: 'for a season' is rendered literally 'for an hour,' and the idea of the shortness of the separation is prominent in the words here."
3. "A fresh and stronger bond should be established. Onesimus should no longer be the chattel for which so much money had been paid, and from whom a due return was sought, but should be invested with a new interest as a brother in Christ, a partaker of the same grace with his master."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle in this clause seems to soften this business of Onesimus in running away from his master; he calls it not a running away, but a departure, an absence from him, and that but for a little while; and suggests that the hand of God might be in it."
2. "That there was an overruling providence that attended it, such as was in Joseph's going down into Egypt; and that this separation of Onesimus from his master, for a short time, was in order that they should come together again, and never part more."
3. "That thou shouldest receive him for ever; or during life, referring to the law in Exodus 21:6 or to all eternity, since they were in the same spiritual relation, partakers of the same grace, and had a right to the same heavenly inheritance, and should be together with Christ for evermore."

### John Wesley:
1. "God might permit him to be separated (a soft word) for a season."
2. "That thou mightest have him for ever - Both on earth and in heaven."
