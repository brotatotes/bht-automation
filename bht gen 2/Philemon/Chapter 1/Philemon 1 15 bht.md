# Philemon 15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The incident of Onesimus running away from his master is gently referred to as a departure, signifying a temporary absence. This departure, however, was not without divine purpose. Just as God's providence guided Joseph's journey to Egypt for a greater good, it is possible that Onesimus's separation from his master was orchestrated by God to ultimately bring them together in a permanent bond. This bond would transcend earthly relationships, as both master and servant would be united in Christ, sharing in His grace and enjoying eternal fellowship with Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "τάχα is delicately said, to conciliate Philemon: so Chrys., καλῶς τὸ  τάχα , ἵνα εἴξῃ ὁ δεσπότης..." 
2. "He refers to Genesis 45:5 , where Joseph suggests the purpose which God’s providence had in sending him down into Egypt." 
3. "πρὸς ὥραν ] much has been built upon this as indicating that the Epistle was written not so far from Colossæ as Rome: but without ground: the contrast is between πρὸς ὥραν and αἰώνιον ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "God’s Providence probably (for we cannot dogmatically define the hidden purposes of God in providence) overruled the past evil to ultimately greater good to him."
2. "Departed — literally, 'was parted from thee'; a softening term for 'ran away,' to mitigate Philemon’s wrath."
3. "Onesimus’ time of absence, however long, was but a short 'hour' (so Greek) compared with the everlasting devotion henceforth binding him to his master."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was possible that this was permitted in the Providence of God in order that Onesimus might be brought under the influence of the gospel."
2. "What appeared to Philemon, therefore, to be a calamity, and what seemed to him to be wrong on the part of Onesimus, might have been permitted to occur in order that he might receive a higher benefit."
3. "That he might not only be with thee in a far more endearing relation during the present life than he was before, but in the bonds of love in a world that shall never end."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A humble 'perhaps' often grows into a 'verily, verily' - and a hasty, over - confident 'verily, verily' often dwindles to a hesitating 'perhaps."
2. "Let us not be in too great a hurry to make sure that we have the key of the cabinet where God keeps his purposes, but content ourselves with 'perhaps' when we are interpreting the often questionable ways of His providence."
3. "Not only does he avoid the word ran away, which might have irritated Philemon, but he also uses the passive voice, not the middle, separated himself, as an intimation that Onesimus' flight was divinely ordered for good."

### John Calvin:
1. "If we are angry on account of offenses committed by men, our minds ought to be soothed, when we perceive that those things which were done through malice have been turned to a different end by the purpose of God."
2. "A joyful result may be regarded as a remedy for evils, which is held out to us by the hand of God for blotting out offenses."
3. "He prudently softens everything, by calling the flight a departure, and adding, that it was only for a time."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "St. Paul sees in the whole event something more than chance, something guided by God for good."
2. "Onesimus should no longer be the chattel for which so much money had been paid, and from whom a due return was sought, but should be invested with a new interest as a brother in Christ, a partaker of the same grace with his master."
3. "Now the interest felt by the master in his servant would be no mere temporal bond, but one which would stretch away into the world to come."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "That thou shouldst have him (ινα αυτον απεχηις)... 'that thou might keep on having him back.'"

2. "That there was an overruling providence that attended it, such as was in Joseph's going down into Egypt; and that this separation of Onesimus from his master, for a short time, was in order that they should come together again, and never part more."
3. "Referring to the law in Exodus 21:6 or to all eternity, since they were in the same spiritual relation, partakers of the same grace, and had a right to the same heavenly inheritance, and should be together with Christ forevermore."
