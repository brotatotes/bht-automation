# Philemon 16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Not only should Onesimus no longer be regarded simply as a servant, but also as a beloved brother in the Lord. While he may have been a servant in the flesh, he is now united with Philemon in the bond of Christian fellowship. There is a dual significance to this relationship, as it is both an earthly connection as a servant and a spiritual connection as a brother in Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "οὐκέτι ὡς δοῦλον does not imply his manumission; rather the contrary: the stress is on ὡς and ὑπέρ ‘no longer as a slave (though he be one), but above a slave.’"
2. "μάλιστα, ‘of all other men,’ of all those without thy house, with whom he has been connected."
3. "πόσῳ μᾶλλον σοί, with whom he stands in so near and lasting a relation."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "No longer as a mere servant or slave (though still he is that), but above a servant, so that thou shalt derive from him not merely the services of a slave, but higher benefits."
2. "He is a servant 'in the flesh,' he is a brother 'in the Lord.'"
3. "Lest Philemon should dislike Onesimus being called 'brother,' Paul first recognizes him as a brother, being the spiritual son of the same God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "All the proof that he was, is to be found in the word δοῦλος doulos - doulos - in this verse. But, as we have seen, the mere use of this word by no means proves that."
2. "Paul wished him to regard him 'not as a servant,' but as a 'beloved brother.' If Philemon complied with his wishes, Onesimus was never afterward regarded or treated as a slave."
3. "It cannot be supposed that, trained as he was in the principles of the Hebrew religion - of which this was a positive and unrepealed law, and imbued with the benevolent spirit of the gospel - a system so hostile to oppression, the apostle Paul would have constrained a slave who had escaped from bondage to return to servitude against his will."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The negative adverb oujketi states the fact absolutely, not as it may be conceived by Philemon [μηκετι]. However Philemon may regard Onesimus, as a fact he is now no longer as a slave."
2. "More than a slave - a whole man."
3. "Beloved most to Paul, how much more than most to Philemon, since he belonged to him in a double sense, as a slave and as a Christian brother: in the flesh and in the Lord."

### John Calvin:
1. "He next brings forward another advantage of the flight, that Onesimus has not only been corrected by means of it, so as to become a useful slave, but that he has become the ‘brother’ of his master."
2. "Here we behold the uncommon modesty of Paul, who bestows on a worthless slave the title of a brother, and even calls him a dearly beloved brother to himself."
3. "From the same source proceeds a profitable doctrine, that the elect of God are sometimes brought to salvation by a method that could not have been believed, contrary to general expectation, by circuitous windings, and even by labyrinths."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "No longer as a servant... he has become, though a bond-servant, the Lord’s freeman. And this is to be free indeed."
2. "The Christian master was to render to his slaves under all circumstances that which was just and equal... but now that Onesimus had become a believer, he was lifted, in the eyes of the apostle, to a higher level."
3. "For St. Paul has already called him not ‘brother,’ but by the tenderer name of ‘child.’"

### John Gill:
1. "Not now as a servant,.... That is, not only as a servant, for a servant he was, and was to be received as such; his call by grace had not dissolved the civil relation that was between him and his master..."
2. "...but above a servant; in a higher condition, as the Arabic version renders it, than a servant; not barely considered in that relation, but as being in one much preferable to it..."
3. "...both in a natural and civil sense, as being of the same nation and country, and as being part of his family, his servant, and now become an useful and profitable one; and, in a spiritual sense, being in the Lord, belonging to the Lord Jesus, to that family which is named of him, being a fellow citizen with the saints, and of the household of God, and therefore must be doubly dear to him."

### John Wesley:
1. In the flesh — As a dutiful servant.In the Lord — As a fellow-Christian.
