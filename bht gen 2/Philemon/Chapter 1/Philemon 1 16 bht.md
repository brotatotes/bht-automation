# Philemon 16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Now, Onesimus is no longer to be regarded simply as a servant, but as someone above a servant, having a higher status. He is more than just a servant, for he is now a brother in Christ, deserving of love and respect. This distinction is important because while he may have been a servant in the physical realm, in the spiritual realm, he is a brother to Philemon, both in the flesh and in the Lord.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "οὐκέτι ὡς δοῦλον does not imply his manumission; rather the contrary: the stress is on ὡς and ὑπέρ ‘no longer as a slave (though he be one), but above a slave.’"
2. "μάλιστα, ‘of all other men,’ of all those without thy house, with whom he has been connected: but πόσῳ μᾶλλον σοί, with whom he stands in so near and lasting a relation."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "No longer as a mere servant or slave (though still he is that), but above a servant, so that thou shalt derive from him not merely the services of a slave, but higher benefits."
2. "A servant 'in the flesh,' he is a brother 'in the Lord,' beloved, specially to me."
3. "Lest Philemon should dislike Onesimus being called 'brother,' Paul first recognizes him as a brother, being the spiritual son of the same God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "But still, it is not certain what kind of a servant he was. The word does not necessarily mean slave, nor can it be proved from this passage, or from any other part of the Epistle, that he was at any time a slave."
2. "Paul did not send him back in order that he might be a slave, or with a view that the shackles of servitude should be riveted on him... It cannot be shown that the motive for sending him back was in the slightest degree that he should be a slave."
3. "This passage, therefore, may be regarded as full proof that it is not right to send a slave back, against his will, to his former master, to be a slave... It is perfectly clear that he would not have sent him back to be regarded and treated as a slave."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "No longer as a slave. More than a slave - a whole man." (Rev.)
2. "Especially to me as compared with other Christians."
3. "Beloved most to Paul, how much more than most to Philemon."

### John Calvin:
1. "He next brings forward another advantage of the flight, that Onesimus has not only been corrected by means of it, so as to become a useful slave, but that he has become the 'brother' of his master."
2. "Here we behold the uncommon modesty of Paul, who bestows on a worthless slave the title of a brother, and even calls him a dearly beloved brother to himself."
3. "We must hold it to be an undoubted truth, that Paul does not rashly or lightly answer for a man of whom he knows little, or extol his faith before he has ascertained it by strong proofs, and therefore in the person of Onesimus there is exhibited a memorable example of repentance."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He could no more be looked on as the mere slave, as before... he has become, though a bond-servant, the Lord’s freeman." 
2. "Now that Onesimus had become a believer, he was lifted, in the eyes of the apostle, to a higher level... His work was labour for a brother, and so would be zealously cared for." 
3. "He knows how an act of Christian love, bestowed as he is sure this will be, makes the recipient an object of still greater affection... Philemon's love for Onesimus [is described] as greater still."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "No longer as a servant (ουκετ ως δουλον). 'No longer as a slave.' So it has to be here. So it should be always."
2. "Paul sends Onesimus, the converted runaway slave, back to his legal master, but shows that he expects Philemon the Christian to treat Onesimus as a brother in Christ, not as a slave."
3. "In the flesh Philemon had the brother for a slave; in the Lord he had the slave for a brother" (Meyer).

### John Gill:
1. "Not now as a servant, but above a servant; in a higher condition, than a servant."
2. "A brother beloved, specially to me; a brother in Christ, and to be beloved on that account."
3. "But how much more unto thee, both in the flesh and in the Lord?"

### John Wesley:
1. In the flesh — As a dutiful servant.In the Lord — As a fellow-Christian.
