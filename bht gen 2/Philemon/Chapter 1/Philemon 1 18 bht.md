# Philemon 18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Onesimus may have wronged Philemon before running away, possibly by stealing or causing trouble. Paul delicately refers to this wrongdoing, suggesting that Onesimus may have embezzled or robbed from his master. However, Paul takes responsibility for the debt, indicating that he will cover the losses and make amends for any damage done.

### Albert Barnes:

2. "When he [Paul] had voluntarily assumed it, it was right to treat him [Onesimus] as if he had done so; that is, to hold him responsible."
3. "The Saviour voluntarily assumed the place of man, and God reckoned, or considered it so. He did not hold him guilty or blameworthy in the case; but as he had voluntarily taken the place of the sinner, he was treated as if he had been a sinner."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "If he hath wronged [ει ηδικδσεν] ."
2. "The indicative mood with the conditional particle may imply that what is put hypothetically is really a fact : if he wronged thee as he did."

5. "Put that on my account [τουτο εμοι ελλογα]."

### John Calvin:
1. "Hence we may infer that Onesimus had likewise stolen something from his master, as was customary with fugitives; and yet he softens the criminality of the act, by adding, or if he oweth thee anything."
2. "Not only was there a bond between them recognised by civil law, but the slave had become indebted to his master by the wrong which he had inflicted on him."
3. "So much the greater, therefore, was the kindness of Paul, who was even ready to give satisfaction for a crime."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The offence of the unjust steward, who had appropriated his master’s income (Luke 16:8) is described by the same word. It seems used euphemistically when the mention of actual ‘theft’ is not convenient."
2. "If we suppose some such false entries in the slave’s accounts as are spoken of in St. Luke’s narrative, we can understand that St. Paul, out of tenderness to Onesimus, might speak of the defalcation, which perhaps had been discovered after his flight, as a debt due from the slave to the master."
3. "St. Paul would scarcely have said this if there bad been no business concerns between him and Philemon. It is not as if he had said ‘hold me responsible.’ The word in the original refers to an actual reckoning, and the next verse bears out that sense."

3. "Put that on mine account... signifying that he would be answerable for all, and make good all debts and damages."
