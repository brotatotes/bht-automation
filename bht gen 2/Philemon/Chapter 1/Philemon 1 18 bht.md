# Philemon 18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Philemon 1:18-19 - If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account; I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it. Onesimus had done wrong and potentially stolen from Philemon, but Paul assumes the blame and offers to repay any debts or damages. This reflects the actions of the unjust steward who mishandled his master's resources. By taking responsibility and seeking reconciliation, Paul shows his willingness to be held accountable. This also suggests that there were financial matters between Paul and Philemon, underscoring Paul's commitment to resolving any outstanding concerns.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "'Confessus erat Onesimus Paulo, quæ fecerat,' Bengel."
2. "ἅμα κ . τὸ ἁμάρτημα ὡμολόγησε , καὶ οὐχ ὡς δούλου ἁμάρτημα ἀλλὰ ὡς φίλου πρὸς φίλον , τῷ τῆς ἀδικίας μᾶλλον ἢ τῷ τῆς κλοπῆς ὀνόματι χρησάμενος , Chrys."
3. "'ἢ ὀφείλει is said of the same matter, and is merely explanatory of ἠδίκησεν: τοῦτο referring to both verbs."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But it (thou art not inclined to 'receive him' because) he hath wronged thee"; a milder term than "robbed thee."
2. Onesimus seems to have confessed some such act to Paul.
3. "Put that on mine account — I am ready to make good the loss to thee if required. The latter parts of the verse imply that he did not expect Philemon would probably demand it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He took the blame on himself, and asked Philemon not to remember it against Onesimus."
2. "Paul assumed the debt and the wrong to himself. He was willing, by putting himself in the place of Onesimus, to bear the consequences, and to have Onesimus treated as if he had not done it."
3. "The Saviour voluntarily assumed the place of man, and God reckoned, or considered it so. He did not hold him guilty or blameworthy in the case; but as he had voluntarily taken the place of the sinner, he was treated as if he had been a sinner."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The indicative mood with the conditional particle may imply that what is put hypothetically is really a fact: if he wronged thee as he did."
2. "Perhaps indicating that Onesimus had been guilty of theft. Notice the general word wronged instead of the more exact specification of the crime."

### John Calvin:
1. "We may infer that Onesimus had likewise stolen something from his master, as was customary with fugitives."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "It seems used euphemistically when the mention of actual ‘theft’ is not convenient."
3. "St. Paul would scarcely have said this if there bad been no business concerns between him and Philemon."

### John Gill:
1. "By squandering away his time, spoiling his work, or corrupting his fellow servants"
2. "He would be answerable for all, and make good all debts and damages."
