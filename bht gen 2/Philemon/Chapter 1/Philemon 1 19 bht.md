# Philemon 19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul's decision to write this short letter with his own hand, rather than employing an amanuensis, signifies the significance of his request to Philemon. By assuming responsibility for any debts and damages caused by Onesimus, Paul shows his humility and willingness to go above and beyond. This gesture also highlights the immense gratitude owed to those who have been instrumental in leading others to the faith. Paul emphasizes that Philemon should not only forgive Onesimus but also welcome him back as a beloved brother.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The inference from this is, that the whole Epistle was autographic."
2. "·ºµŒΩŒ± Œº·Ω¥ ŒªŒ≠Œ≥œâ: 'est œÉœá·øÜŒºŒ± œÄŒ±œÅŒ±œÉŒπœâœÄŒÆœÉŒµœâœÇ sive reticenti√¶, cum dicimus nos omittere velle, quod maxime dicimus,' Grot."
3. "Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ œÉŒµŒ±œÖœÑœåŒΩ: Œø·Ωê œÑ·Ω∞ œÉŒ±œÖœÑŒø·ø¶ ŒºœåŒΩŒøŒΩ, Chr."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "with mine own hand ‚Äî not employing an amanuensis, as in other Epistles: a special compliment to Philemon which he ought to show his appreciation of by granting Paul‚Äôs request."
2. "thou owest ... even thine own self ‚Äî not merely thy possessions. For to my instrumentality thou owest thy salvation."
3. "So the debt which 'he oweth thee' being transferred upon me (I making myself responsible for it) is cancelled."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It has been inferred from this, that Paul wrote this entire Epistle with his own hand, though this was contrary to his usual practice."
2. "I will be security for it. It is not probable that Paul supposed that Philemon would rigidly exact it from him, but if he did, he would feel himself bound to pay it."
3. "Paul had doubtless been the means of the conversion of Philemon, and whatever hope he cherished of eternal life, was to be traced to his instrumentality."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The mention of his autograph here, rather than at the end of the letter, may indicate that he wrote the whole epistle with his own hand, contrary to his usual custom of employing an amanuensis."
2. "I thus give my note of hand that I may avoid saying that thou owest, etc. Rev., that I say not unto thee."
3. "I have laid you under obligation, not only for an amount equal to that due from Onesimus, but for yourself as made a Christian through my ministry."

### John Calvin:
1. "By this expression he intended to describe how confidently he believes that he will obtain it; as if he had said, 'There is nothing that thou couldest refuse to give me, even though I should demand thyself.'"
2. "Paul beseeches Philemon not to ask anything back from his slave. Though he does not speak ironically, yet, by an indirect figure, he requests him to blot out and cancel this account."
3. "The meaning, therefore, is ‚Äî 'I wish that thou shouldest not contend with thy slave unless thou choosest to have me for thy debtor in his stead.' For he immediately adds that Philemon is altogether his own; and he who claims the whole man as his property need not give himself uneasiness about paying money."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Up to this point, the apostle had probably used his amanuensis; but that the transaction may be formal and secure, he attaches his own signature to what has been written, and so transforms the Epistle into a bond."
2. "It is no mere offer of himself as security for the slave‚Äôs future good conduct, and that in time he shall, by his working, clear off the loss he has caused: St. Paul would at once by his own payment set Onesimus free from such debt."
3. "He might have urged the larger debt which Philemon owed to him for his conversion to the faith of Christ should be held to far outbalance the loss inflicted by Onesimus. But this he will not press, though by a delicate reference to it, he gives force to the appeal which he is making."

### John Gill:
1. "I Paul have written it, with mine own hand,.... Meaning either this epistle, which being short, he used no amanuensis, but wrote it all himself, and which might be taken as an engagement to do what he promised."
2. "This shows his great humility to be a bondsman for a servant, and to make good damages and debts brought on in a scandalous manner; as also that suretyship in some cases is lawful, though it ought to be cautiously, and for very good reasons, entered into."
3. "From hence may be observed, how greatly obliged regenerated persons are to those, who have been the means and instruments of their conversion."

### John Wesley:
1. "I will repay it ‚Äî If thou requirest it. Not to say, that then owest me thyself ‚Äî It cannot be expressed, how great our obligation is to those who have gained our souls to Christ."
2. "Beside ‚Äî Receiving Onesimus."
