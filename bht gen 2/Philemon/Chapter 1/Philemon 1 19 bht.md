# Philemon 19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
I Paul have written it with mine own hand, offering this promissory note as a sign of my commitment. I will repay it, not to press upon you, but to show my willingness to take responsibility. Let it be known that your indebtedness to me extends even beyond material things, for I have played a role in your own spiritual transformation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The inference from this is, that the whole Epistle was autographic: for it would be most unnatural to suppose the Apostle to break off his amanuensis here, and write this engagement with his own hand."
2. "ἔγραψα ἀποτίσω: 'repay: yes I say this, not doubting thee, but not wishing to press on thee all the claim that I might justly urge.'"
3. "καὶ σεαυτόν: οὐ τὰ σαυτοῦ μόνον, Chr. δι ʼ ἐμοῦ γάρ, φησί, τῆς σωτηρίας ἀπήλαυσας · καὶ ἐντεῦθεν δῆλον, ὡς τῆς ἀποστολικῆς διδασκαλίας ἠξιώθη ὁ Φιλήμων, Thdrt."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "with mine own hand — not employing an amanuensis, as in other Epistles: a special compliment to Philemon which he ought to show his appreciation of by granting Paul's request." 
2. "thou owest ... even thine own self — not merely thy possessions. For to my instrumentality thou owest thy salvation. So the debt which 'he oweth thee' being transferred upon me (I making myself responsible for it) is cancelled."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I Paul have written it with mine own hand - It has been inferred from this, that Paul wrote this entire Epistle with his own hand... He undoubtedly meant to refer to this as a mark of special favor toward Philemon."
2. "I will repay it - I will be security for it. It is not probable that Paul supposed that Philemon would rigidly exact it from him, but if he did, he would feel himself bound to pay it."
3. "Albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides - Paul had doubtless been the means of the conversion of Philemon... His very life - his eternal welfare - was to be traced to his labors."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The mention of his autograph here, rather than at the end of the letter, may indicate that he wrote the whole epistle with his own hand, contrary to his usual custom of employing an amanuensis."
2. "I thus give my note of hand that I may avoid saying that thou owest, etc."
3. "I have laid you under obligation, not only for an amount equal to that due from Onesimus, but for yourself as made a Christian through my ministry."

### John Calvin:
1. "There is nothing that thou couldest refuse to give me, even though I should demand thyself."
2. "I wish that thou shouldest not contend with thy slave, unless thou choosest to have me for thy debtor in his stead."
3. "For he immediately adds that Philemon is altogether his own; and he who claims the whole man as his property, need not give himself uneasiness about paying money."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Up to this point, the apostle had probably used his amanuensis; but that the transaction may be formal and secure, he attaches his own signature to what has been written, and so transforms the Epistle into a bond."
2. "It is no mere ofter of himself as security for the slave’s future good conduct, and that in time he shall, by his working, clear off the loss he has caused: St. Paul would at once by his own payment set Onesimus free from such debt."
3. "He might have urged the larger debt which Philemon owed to him for his conversion to the faith of Christ, should be held to far outbalance the loss inflicted by Onesimus. But this he will not press, though by a delicate reference to it, he gives force to the appeal which he is making."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "With mine hand (τη εμη χειρ). Instrumental case and a note of hand that can be collected."
2. "I will repay it (εγω αποτισω). Future active indicative of αποτινω (αποτιω) to pay back, to pay off. The more usual word was αποδωσω. This is Paul's promissory note."
3. "That I say not (ινα μη λεγω). Neat idiom as in 2 Corinthians 9:4, delicately reminding Philemon that Paul had led him also to Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "I Paul have written it, with mine own hand....a promissory note, written with his own hand, which he sent along with Onesimus, by which he laid himself under obligation to give Philemon full satisfaction in every thing."
2. "This shows his great humility to be a bondsman for a servant, and to make good damages and debts brought on in a scandalous manner; as also that suretyship in some cases is lawful, though it ought to be cautiously, and for very good reasons, entered into."
3. "Albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides...his conversion, which he was the happy instrument of...the salvation of his soul, his better part, was instrumentally owing to him, and so his whole self."

### John Wesley:
1. "I will repay it — If thou requirest it. Not to say, that then owest me thyself — It cannot be expressed, how great our obligation is to those who have gained our souls to Christ." 
2. "Beside — Receiving Onesimus."
