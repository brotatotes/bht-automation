## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Apphia — the Latin, 'Appia'; either the wife or some close relative of Philemon. She and Archippus, if they had not belonged to his family, would not have been included with Philemon in the address of a letter on a domestic matter."
2. "Archippus — a minister of the Colossian Church."
3. "Church in thy house — In the absence of a regular church building, the houses of particular saints were used for that purpose. Observe Paul’s tact in associating with Philemon those associated by kindred or Christian brotherhood with his house, and not going beyond it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "And Archippus our fellow-soldier - See the notes at Colossians 4:17. It has been supposed that he was a son of Philemon, and this would appear not to be improbable, as he was one of his family."
2. "On the term 'fellow-soldier,' see the notes at Philippians 2:25. It is applied here to one who was a minister of the gospel, and who is spoken of in connection with Paul as enlisted under the banners of the Captain of salvation, and waging a warfare with the wickedness of the world."
3. "And to the church in thy house - Either the church that commonly met in his house, or more probably that was composed of his own family; compare the notes at Romans 16:5."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word is not the common Roman name Appia, but is a Phrygian name, occurring frequently in Phrygian inscriptions."
2. "Archippus...would appear to have held some important office in the church."
3. "The church in thy house."

### John Calvin:
1. "Although the condition of a soldier belongs to all Christians universally, yet because teachers may be regarded as standardbearers in the warfare, they ought to be ready more than all others to fight, and Satan usually gives them greater annoyance."
2. "By employing these terms, he bestows the highest praise on the family of Philemon. And certainly it is no small praise of a householder, that he regulates his family in such a manner as to be an image of the Church, and to discharge also the duty of a pastor within the walls of his dwelling."
3. "Nor must we forget to mention that this good man had a wife of the same character; for she, too, not without reason, is commended by Paul."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is clear from the way in which Archippus is addressed...that he occupied some ministerial office in the Colossian church."
2. "The word used there to describe his duty is the same that is employed concerning Timothy...He may have been one of the deacons of the Colossian church."
3. "St. Paul was led to include the congregation in his salutation, because the runaway slave, who was now returning, came back as a Christian convert, and therefore one with a claim on the sympathy of the whole Church."

### John Gill:
1. "And to our beloved Apphia... for this is a woman's name; and it is thought that she was the wife of Philemon."
2. "that this Archippus was a preacher of the Gospel at Colosse is manifest from Colossians 4:17"
3. "Not in the house of Archippus, but in the house of Philemon; and designs not the church at Colosse, as though it met at his house; but his own family, which for the great piety and religion which were among them, and for the good order and decorum in which they were kept, were like a church of themselves."

### John Wesley:
1. "To Apphia — His wife, to whom also the business in part belonged."
2. "And the church in thy house — The Christians who meet there."
