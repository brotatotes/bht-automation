# Philemon 2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The mention of thy house in this context refers to the gathering of believers in the household of Philemon. It is interesting to observe how, in the absence of dedicated church buildings, early Christians would meet in the homes of fellow believers. This practice not only facilitated their worship and fellowship but also fostered a sense of intimacy and community within the household. These gatherings served as a microcosm of the larger church, where believers would come together to pray, study the Word, and support one another in their faith.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

3. "Fellow - soldier. In christian warfare. Perhaps at Ephesus. Applied also to Epaphroditus, Philippians 2:25."

### John Calvin:
1. "Although the condition of a soldier belongs to all Christians universally, yet because teachers may be regarded as standardbearers in the warfare, they ought to be ready more than all others to fight, and Satan usually gives them greater annoyance."
2. "By employing these terms, he bestows the highest praise on the family of Philemon. And certainly it is no small praise of a householder, that he regulates his family in such a manner as to be an image of the Church, and to discharge also the duty of a pastor within the walls of his dwelling."
3. "Nor must we forget to mention that this good man had a wife of the same character; for she, too, not without reason, is commended by Paul."

### John Gill:

2. "For though this character belongs to private Christians, who are enlisted as volunteers under Christ, the Captain of salvation, and fight under his banners, against sin, Satan, and the world, being accoutred with the whole armour of God, and are more than conquerors through Christ that has loved them; yet it very eminently belongs to the ministers of the Gospel, who are more especially called upon, to endure hardness, as good soldiers of Christ; to war a good warfare, to fight the good fight of faith."
3. "Not in the house of Archippus, but in the house of Philemon... his own family, which for the great piety and religion which were among them, and for the good order and decorum in which they were kept, were like a church of themselves." (150 words)
