# Philemon 21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse serves to remind Philemon of the apostolic authority with which Paul writes and expresses his confidence in Philemon's obedience. The apostle hints at the possible manumission of Onesimus, without directly requesting it. Philemon's obedience to Christ in all aspects of faith and duty is commended, and the expectation is that he would go above and beyond what was asked of him. This demonstrates the selfless service of Christian love, which reflects the example of Christ and seeks to serve others freely.
