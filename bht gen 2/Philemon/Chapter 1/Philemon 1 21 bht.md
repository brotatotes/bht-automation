# Philemon 21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Having confidence in your obedience, I remind you of my apostolic authority. Your faithful obedience to Christ encourages me to make this request. I believe that you will go beyond what I ask of you. This kind of love-driven service mirrors Christ's example. While it may seem that Paul is avoiding a direct denouncement of slavery, his careful approach suggests a wise strategy for ultimately bringing about its abolition. His words imply the possibility of manumission, without explicitly commanding it. He trusts that you will understand the deeper implications and willingly exceed his expectations.
