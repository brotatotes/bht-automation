## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But at the same time (as thou fulfillest my request), also." 
2. "We may, perhaps, take this direction as serving to secure the favourable reception of Onesimus."
3. "Or it may be, as Ellic., that Philemon was not to consider the Epistle as a mere petition for Onesimus, but as containing special messages on other matters to himself."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This prospect of Paul‚Äôs visiting Colosse would tend to secure a kindly reception for Onesimus, as Paul would know in person how he had been treated."
2. "The same expectation is expressed by him [Paul], written in the same imprisonment."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "While you are granting this favor, do me also another by preparing a lodging for me."

3. "I shall be permitted to return to you, as a favor."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "There is a gentle compulsion in this mention of a personal visit to Colossae. The apostle would thus be able to see for himself that Philemon had not disappointed his expectations."
2. "I shall be given. A beautiful assumption of his correspondent's affection for him, in that his visit to them will be a gracious gift."
3. "The word is also used of granting for destruction, Acts 25:11; or for preservation, Acts 3:14."

### John Calvin:
1. "This confidence must have powerfully excited and moved Philemon."
2. "He had no confident hope of his release, further than if it pleased God."
3. "Here it deserves notice, that he says that everything that believers obtain 'through their prayers,' is 'given' to them; for hence we infer that our prayers, though they are not unsuccessful, yet have no power through their own merit; for what is yielded to them is of free grace."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He did not need much preparation to be made for him, but that Philemon may be moved with joy at the prospect of a speedy visit..."

3. "So he ascribes his expected release already to the grace of God."

### John Gill:
1. "Not that the apostle expected or desired any grand apartment to be fitted up for him; a room with such furniture as the Shunamite provided for the man of God was sufficient for him, and what he would have been entirely contented with."
2. "The apostle was a man of prayer himself, and he had a very great regard to the prayers of others, and often desired an interest in them; that he might perform his ministerial work as it should be; that he might have success in it; and that he might be delivered from the unbelieving Jews, and from wicked and unreasonable men."
3. "He had some secret hope and trust in his own mind, that through the prayers of the saints he should be delivered from his bonds, and go up and down preaching the Gospel as heretofore."

### John Wesley:
1. Given to you ‚Äî Restored to liberty.
