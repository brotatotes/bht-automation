# Philemon 23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Epaphras, a faithful companion to Paul, was potentially sent by the Colossians to minister to and inquire after the imprisoned apostle. While it is disputed whether fellow prisoner refers to a literal or spiritual imprisonment, the likelihood leans towards the latter. Epaphras, a native of Colossae and member of the church there, had shared in the captivity of Paul by voluntarily standing with him in his imprisonment. This term of captivity may have been used because they were both captives for the cause of Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Epaphras, my fellow prisoner - He had been sent by the Colossian Church to inquire after, and minister to, Paul, and possibly was cast into prison by the Roman authorities on suspicion. However, he is not mentioned as a prisoner in Colossians 4:12, so that “fellow prisoner” here may mean merely one who was a faithful companion to Paul in his imprisonment, and by his society put himself in the position of a prisoner."
2. "Benson conjectures the meaning to be that on some former occasion these two were Paul’s 'fellow prisoners,' not at the time."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The same persons who are here mentioned as greeting Philemon, are mentioned in the close of the Epistle to the Colossians - furnishing a high degree of evidence that Philemon resided at Colosse."
2. "Epaphras was a member of the church there."
3. "My fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus - In the cause of Christ."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Epaphras appears to have been a native of Colossae."
2. "It is disputed whether fellow-prisoner is to be taken in a literal or in a spiritual sense."
3. "The probabilities seem to favor the spiritual sense."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Epaphras belonged to Colossæ (Colossians 4:12), and had brought word to St. Paul of the condition of the Christians there."
2. "Why the apostle calls him ‘fellow-prisoner’ is not clear. In writing to the Colossians (Colossians 4:10) he uses the same expression concerning Aristarchus. But the term is different from that employed when he calk himself a prisoner."
3. "Therefore it seems probable that the word is used of these friends because they voluntarily shared the imprisonment of the apostle, and so in fact were captives as much as he."

### John Gill:
1. "My fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus; this good man, and minister of Christ, might have been sent by the Colossians, as Epaphroditus was by the Philippians, to the apostle at Rome, to pay him a visit, and comfort and assist him under his afflictions." 
2. "Staying and preaching the Gospel there, [Epaphras] was committed to prison, or was laid in bonds, as the apostle was, and upon the same account; namely, for the sake of Christ, and his Gospel."
3. "Nero began to persecute the Christians, which he did in the better and more moderate part of his reign; for among several things for which he is commended by the historian, this is one; 'Afficti suppliciis Christiani, genus hominum superstitionis novae ac maleficae'; the Christians were punished, a sort of men of a new and bad religion.'"
