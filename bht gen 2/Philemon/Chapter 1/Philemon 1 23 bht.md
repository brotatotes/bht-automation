# Philemon 23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Epaphras, the Colossian preacher, came to Rome to seek Paul's help against emerging Gnosticism. He was not a literal prisoner, but used the term metaphorically, like in 2 Corinthians 10:5. However, it is possible that Epaphras voluntarily shared Paul's imprisonment. As a minister of Christ, he may have been sent by the Colossians to visit and comfort Paul, given that both were facing afflictions for the sake of Christ and the Gospel. The Christians in Colossae were seen as followers of a new and controversial religion, which led to their persecution.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Epaphras, my fellow prisoner — He had been sent by the Colossian Church to inquire after, and minister to, Paul, and possibly was cast into prison by the Roman authorities on suspicion."
2. "[Epaphras] is not mentioned as a prisoner in Colossians 4:10, so that 'fellow prisoner' here may mean merely one who was a faithful companion to Paul in his imprisonment, and by his society put himself in the position of a prisoner."
3. "Benson conjectures the meaning to be that on some former occasion these two were Paul’s 'fellow prisoners,' not at the time."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There salute thee Epaphras... Philemon resided at Colosse." 
2. "Epaphras was a member of the church there." 
3. "My fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus - In the cause of Christ."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Epaphras is mentioned Colossians 1:7; Colossians 4:12. Some identify him with Epaphroditus, but without sufficient reason."
2. "It is disputed whether fellow-prisoner is to be taken in a literal or in a spiritual sense. For the latter see Romans 7:23; 2 Corinthians 10:5; Ephesians 4:8."
3. "The probabilities seem to favor the spiritual sense. Lightfoot suggests that Epaphras' relations with Paul at Rome may have excited suspicion and led to his temporally confinement; or that he may voluntarily have shared Paul's imprisonment."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Epaphras, my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus, saluteth thee." Epaphras belonged to Colossæ (Colossians 4:12), and had brought word to St. Paul of the condition of the Christians there.
2. "From the terms in which St. Paul speaks of him elsewhere (Colossians 1:7), he appears to have been closely connected with the congregation at Colossæ."
3. "The term is different from that employed when he calk himself a prisoner. It does not necessarily imply ‘bound’ as St. Paul was. Therefore it seems probable that the word is used of these friends because they voluntarily shared the imprisonment of the apostle, and so in fact were captives as much as he."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Epaphras, the Colossian preacher...had come to Rome to enlist Paul's help in the fight against incipient Gnosticism in the Lycus Valley." 
2. "Epaphras, my fellow-prisoner...Used metaphorically like the verb αιχμαλωτιζω in 2 Corinthians 10:5, though some hold that Epaphras became a prisoner with Paul in Rome."

### John Gill:
1. "my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus; this good man, and minister of Christ, might have been sent by the Colossians, as Epaphroditus was by the Philippians, to the apostle at Rome, to pay him a visit, and comfort and assist him under his afflictions"
2. "staying and preaching the Gospel there, was committed to prison, or was laid in bonds, as the apostle was, and upon the same account; namely, for the sake of Christ, and his Gospel"
3. "the Christians were punished, a sort of men of a new and bad religion"
