# Philemon 25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. This blessing is not just for Philemon, but also for Apphia and Archippus, to whom the letter was also sent.

The grace of Jesus is a powerful message that extends to all believers and reminds us of the importance of unity and love within the church community.

"The Epistle to Philemon, though the shortest that Paul wrote, and though pertaining to a private matter in which the church at large could not be expected to have any direct interest, is nevertheless a most interesting portion of the New Testament, and furnishes some invaluable lessons for the church."
2. "It is a model of courtesy. It shows that the apostle was a man of refined sensibility, and had a delicate perception of what was due in friendship, and what was required by true politeness."
3. "The Epistle shows that he had great tact in argument, and great skill in selecting just such things as would be adapted to secure the end in view."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "He knows that to bring slavery into contact with living Christianity is to kill slavery. He accepts the social condition as a fact, and even as a law. He puts the christian slave on his true footing of a christian brother beside his master."

Bengel says : 'A familiar and exceedingly courteous epistle concerning a private affair is inserted among the New Testament books, intended to afford a specimen of the highest wisdom as to how Christians should arrange civil affairs on loftier principles.'"

2. "Not with his spirit only, but with the spirit of Apphia and Archippus, to whom also the epistle was sent; and therefore the word is in the plural number."
3. "The salutation is the same as in all the epistles; the form of it agrees with Galatians 6:18."
