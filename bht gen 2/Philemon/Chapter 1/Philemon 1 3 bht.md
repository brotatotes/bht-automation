# Philemon 3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Grace and peace are extended to the recipients of this epistle as a customary salutation. This salutation, though used in other epistles, holds significance as it is bestowed through Christ, the channel of grace and the source of spiritual unity and tranquility within the Church. The Son, working alongside the Father, not only contributes to the creation and redemption of all things but also plays a role in bestowing the gifts of grace and peace. This brief epistle, despite its size, follows the pattern of larger epistles, beginning with an inscription, a salutation, and a preface.
