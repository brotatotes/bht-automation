# Philemon 9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For the love and respect that Paul has for Philemon, he chooses to appeal to him lovingly rather than assert his authority. As an older and imprisoned servant of Christ, Paul humbly and kindly asks Philemon to consider his plea. Paul's gentle approach, referring to Philemon as his beloved son, emphasizes the transformed life of Onesimus, subtly acknowledging his past while highlighting the positive change in him. The skillful way in which Paul weaves these elements together demonstrates his wisdom and love for both Philemon and Onesimus.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "τὴν ἀγάπην] is quite general 'that Christian love, of which thou shewest so bright an example."
2. "Being such an one (as declared in διὸ...παρακαλῶ), as (1) Paul the aged and (2) now a prisoner also of Christ Jesus."
3. "If we read ἐγώ before ἐγέννησα, the repetition of ἐμοῦ ἐγώ will serve, as Meyer remarks, to mark more forcibly the character of his own child, and ἐν τοῖς δεσμοίς gives more weight still to the entreaty."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Christian love of which thou showest so bright an example."
2. "Being such a one as thou knowest me to be, namely, Paul - the founder of so many churches, and an apostle of Christ, and thy father in the faith."
3. "Now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ - the strongest claim I have on thy regard: if for no other reason, at least in consideration of this, through commiseration gratify me."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Yet for love’s sake - For the love which you bear me, and for the common cause.I rather beseech thee - Rather than command thee."
2. "The argument here is, that we feel that it is proper, as far as we can, to grant the request of an old man. Paul thus felt that it was reasonable to suppose that Philemon would not refuse to gratify the wishes of an aged servant of Christ, who had spent the vigor of his life in the service of their common Master."
3. "The argument here is, that it might be presumed that Philemon would not refuse the request of one who was suffering in prison on account of their common religion. For such a prisoner we should be ready to do all that we can to mitigate the sorrows of his confinement, and to make his condition comfortable."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "The latter rendering is supported by presbeuw I am an ambassador, Ephesians 6:10."

### John Calvin:

2. "When, by condescending to entreaty, he foregoes his right, this has far greater power to obtain his wish than if he issued a command."

2. "In Ephesians 6:20 Paul says πρεσβευω εν αλυσε (I am an ambassador in a chain). Hence Lightfoot holds that here πρεσβυτης = πρεσβευτης because of common confusion by the scribes between υ and ευ."
