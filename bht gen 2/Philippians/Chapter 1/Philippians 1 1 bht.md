# Philippians 1:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this epistle to the Philippians, Paul and Timothy express their deep affection and familiarity with the church. Though Paul does not explicitly identify himself as an apostle, he acknowledges his leadership and strong connection with the Philippians. The inclusion of Timothy's name signifies his involvement in the church's foundation and his genuine care for its well-being. Additionally, the epistle emphasizes the distinct roles of bishops (pastors) and deacons within the church, with bishops overseeing internal affairs and deacons serving in practical ministry. This letter provides insight into the unity, love, and structure of the early church.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Certainly no official character is intended to be given by it, as Huther, al., have thought: for of all the Epistles, this is the least official."
2. "The warm affection which breathes through this whole Epistle is best accounted for from the warm affection which breathes through this whole Epistle."
3. "The simple juxtaposition of the officers with the members of the Church, and indeed their being placed after those members, shews... the absence of hierarchical views such as those in the Epistles of the apostolic fathers."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The mention of his name implies merely that Timothy joined in affectionate remembrances to them."
2. "He writes rather in a tone of affectionate familiarity."
3. "This accords with the probable course of events, deduced alike from the letters and history."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There was special propriety in the fact that Timothy was joined with the apostle in writing the Epistle, for he was with him when the church was founded, and doubtless felt a deep interest in its welfare."
2. "It is clear, moreover, that they were the only officers of the church there except 'deacons'; and the persons referred to, therefore, must have been those who were invested simply with the pastoral office."
3. "The church was organized by the apostle Paul himself, and there can be no doubt that it was organized on the 'truly primitive and apostolic plan'."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The term implies, but does not assert, actual, personal sanctity. It is a social, not a personal epithet."
2. "It was therefore an appropriate starting - point for the Gospel in Europe, a field in which it could demonstrate its power to deal with all differences of nation, faith, sex, and social standing."
3. "The work of the deacons was, primarily, the relief of the sick and poor; but spiritual ministrations naturally developed in connection with their office."

### John Calvin:
1. "For they had persevered in the calling of God steadfastly, and in an even tenor."
2. "The titles, therefore, of bishop and pastor, are synonymous."
3. "It were at the same time better for us in speaking to follow the Holy Spirit, the author of tongues, than to change for the worse forms of speech which are dictated to us by Him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "When Christ is the master, the service, though there is no promise that it shall be easy at all times, is perfect freedom. So there is pride in being called the slave of such a Lord."
2. "The title 'saints' or 'holy ones' is given in the New Testament to all those who are 'being saved', i.e., who have entered on the way of salvation. The sanctifying work of the Spirit is not complete as soon as it is begun."
3. "The deacons were those officers of the church who discharged such duties as were given to the seven chosen at the time of the murmuring of the Hellenists against the Hebrews. These were the almoners to the needy first of all, and guardians of church funds."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In Christ Jesus. The centre for all Christian relations and activities for Paul and for us."
2. "The word 'all' means that all individual believers are included. Paul employs this word frequently in Philippians."
3. "The two New Testament church officers are here mentioned (bishops or elders and deacons). The plural is here employed because there was usually one church in a city with several pastors (bishops, elders)."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle sets his own name first, as being not only superior to Timothy in age, in office, and in character, but the sole writer of this epistle."
2. "He chooses a character which agreed to them both; he does not say apostles, for Timothy was no apostle, though he himself was, but 'servants of Jesus Christ'."
3. "The officers of this church were 'the bishops and deacons'. The 'bishops' were the pastors, elders, and overseers of the church... and the 'deacons' were such as served tables, the Lord's table, the minister's table, and the poor's table; took care of the secular affairs of the church."

### John Wesley:
1. "St. Paul, writing familiarly to the Philippians, does not style himself an apostle."
2. "The apostolic epistles were sent more directly to the churches, than to the pastors of them."
3. "The former properly took care of the internal state, the latter, of the externals, of the church."
