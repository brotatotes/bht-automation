# Philippians 1:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The purpose of gaining knowledge and perceptiveness is to discern between different things and make wise choices. It is important to choose what is good and refuse what is evil. This discernment involves not just distinguishing between good and bad, but also between what is good and what is best. We should strive to approve and embrace the things that are truly excellent. This requires examining and testing everything, so that we may embrace what is valuable and discard what is not. We should aim to be sincere, without stumbling or causing others to stumble.
