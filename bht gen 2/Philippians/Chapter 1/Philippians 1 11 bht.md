# Philippians 1:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The believer's life is called to bear fruits of righteousness, encompassing both inward holiness and outward good works. These fruits, abundant and all-encompassing, should fill us entirely. They find their sustenance and vitality in the unceasing support of Jesus Christ, the root from which they grow. As these fruits flow from His grace, they are meant to bring glory and praise to God, reflecting His character and drawing others to recognize and honor Him. The believer's fruits of righteousness are not merely for personal recognition, but serve the purpose of magnifying and glorifying the Lord.
