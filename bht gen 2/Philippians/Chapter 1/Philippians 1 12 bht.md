# Philippians 1:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Apostle wants the Philippians to know that despite his imprisonment, the spread of the Gospel has actually been furthered rather than hindered. He wants to assure them that his circumstances have not been in vain but have served a purpose in advancing the Gospel. The persecution he faced has paradoxically led to the promotion and dissemination of the message of Christ. In fact, the very things that were meant to impede the Gospel have instead contributed to its progress and advancement. This demonstrates that God can work through adversity and use it for His purposes.
