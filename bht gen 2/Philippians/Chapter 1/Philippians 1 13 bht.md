## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "They became known, not as a matter simply of notoriety, but of notoriety in Christ, i.e. in connexion with Christ’s cause, as endured for Christ’s sake; and thus the Gospel was furthered."
2. "The word 'prætorium' is also used of castles or palaces belonging to Cæsar or to foreign princes or even to private persons: it cannot be shown ever to have signified the palatium at Rome, but the above meanings approach so nearly to this, that it seems to me no serious objection can be taken to it."
3. "The fact here mentioned may be traced to St. Paul being guarded by a prætorian soldier, and having full liberty of preaching the Gospel: but more probably his situation had been changed since then."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "So that my bonds have become manifest in Christ," that is, known, as endured in Christ's cause.
2. "The barrack of the Prætorian guards attached to the palace of Nero, on the Palatine hill at Rome; not the general Prætorian camp outside of the city; for this was not connected with 'Cæsar's household,' which shows the Prætorium here meant was. The emperor was 'Prætor,' or Commander-in-Chief; naturally then the barrack of his bodyguard was called the Prætorium."
3. "Manifest to all the other Prætorian soldiers stationed elsewhere, through the instrumentality of the Prætorian household guards who might for the time be attached to the emperor's palace, and who relieved one another in succession."
