# Philippians 1:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who preached out of love knew that the apostle was set for the defense of the Gospel, while those who preached out of contention sought to exalt themselves and cause trouble for him. The former proclaimed Christ sincerely and with pure intentions, while the latter did so with impure motives, aiming to add affliction to his bonds. Their ambition and jealousy led them to undermine the apostle's preaching and cause him trouble. However, God, in His providence, used these circumstances to ultimately advance the spread of the Gospel and showcase His faithfulness.
