# Philippians 1:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Notwithstanding the motives or intentions of these individuals, the proclamation of Christ is the focal point. It is more important to Paul that Christ is made known, whether it is done in pretense or with genuine sincerity. The advancement of the gospel is what brings him joy, regardless of the mixed motives or imperfect efforts of those involved. Ultimately, the important thing is that Christ is being preached, and that is a cause for rejoicing.
