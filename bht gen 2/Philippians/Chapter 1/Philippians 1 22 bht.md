# Philippians 1:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If I am to continue living in this mortal body, it will be a laborious journey for me. However, if this is the means by which I can bear fruit and carry out the work of spreading the Gospel, then I will gladly embrace it. Long life, in this sense, becomes a blessing, as it allows me to continue serving the Lord and furthering His kingdom. Yet, if given the choice, I cannot determine what I should prefer - whether to remain in this world or to depart and be with Christ.

1. "St. Paul has just spoken of the great gain of dying. Now the thought seems to arise: ‘Yet suppose that the means whereby my labour can bring forth its fruit, is only to be secured by my continuing to live in the flesh, then I should desire that such fruit should be secured.’" 
2. "For though death might be gain to him, the fruit of his apostolic labours might be eternal life to many brethren in Christ."

3.

### John Wesley:
1. "But if I am to live is the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour — This is the fruit of my living longer, that I can labour more. Glorious labour! desirable fruit! in this view, long life is indeed a blessing."
