# Philippians 1:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle finds himself in a difficult position, torn between his desire to depart from this earthly life and be with Christ, and his understanding that it is more necessary for him to continue living in order to serve and benefit others. He sees the great gain and joy that awaits him in being with Christ, but he is also aware of the important work that still lies before him. Ultimately, he surrenders his personal desire to God's will, recognizing that whether he remains or departs, he is in the hands of a loving and sovereign God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I am perplexed by the two, having my desire towards departing and being with Christ."
2. "Thus much is true: but not perhaps that which some have inferred from our verse, that it shows a change of view respecting the nearness of the Lord’s advent."
3. "To continue in my flesh is more needful on account of you."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I know not (:-), BUT am in a
	strait (am perplexed) betwixt the two (namely, 'to live' and
	'to die'), having the desire for departing (literally, 'to
	loose anchor,' 2 Timothy 4:6) and
	being with Christ; FOR (so
	the oldest manuscripts) it is by far better"; or as the Greek,
	more forcibly, "by far the more preferable"; a
	double comparative.
	
2. This refutes the notion of the soul being dormant during its separation from the body. It also shows that, while he regarded the Lord's advent as at all times near, yet that his death before it was a very possible contingency.
	
3. To depart is better than to remain in the flesh; to be with Christ is far, far better; a New Testament hope (2 Timothy 4:6-:).

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The apostle represents himself as in a similar condition. His strong affection for them bound his heart to them - as an anchor holds a ship to its moorings and yet there was a heavenly influence bearing upon him - like the gale upon the vessel - which would bear him away to heaven."
2. "It was his strong love to Christ; his anxious wish to be with him; his firm belief that in his presence was 'fulness of joy.'"
3. "The soul of the believer is made happy at death. To be with Christ is synonymous with being in heaven - for Christ is in heaven, and is its glory."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The picture is that of a man pressed on both sides. Lit. I am held together, so that I cannot incline either way."
2. "Having a desire. Lit., the desire : my desire, as expressed in ver. 21, for death with its gain."
3. "To depart [αναλυσαι] . The verb means originally to unloose, undo again. So of Penelope's web : 'During the night she undid it' (Homer, 'Odyssey,' 2, 105). Of loosing a ship from her moorings : of breaking up a camp."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul did not desire to live with any other object in view that that of promoting the glory of Christ, and doing good to the brethren."
2. "Persons in despair have recourse to [death] from having become weary of life; believers, on the other hand, willingly hasten forward to it, because it is a deliverance from the bondage of sin, and an introduction into the kingdom of heaven."
3. "To be set free...is the separation of the soul from the body...and what condition awaits believers after death — that of dwelling with Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The apostle describes himself as thus holden and constrained of (i.e., by) the two things, death or the continuance of life that his work may bear its fruit." 
2. "He says ‘be with Christ,’ as though he looked forward to the presence with Christ at the moment of his departure."
3. "He cannot forget the greatness of the gain, though his love for the salvation of men may reconcile him to forego it."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I am held together." Present passive indicative of the common compound verb συνεχω, to hold together, to hem together as in Luke 8:45. "I am hemmed in on both sides" (Lightfoot).
2. "Pressure to live on, pressure to die and be with Christ."
3. "Very far better. Double comparative (triple Lightfoot calls it because of πολλω) like Isocrates and the Koine often. See 2 Corinthians 7:13 for περισσοτερως μαλλον. Πολλω is the instrumental case of measure (by much)."

### John Gill:
1. "Death is desired for some other end; wicked men desire it, and desire others to put an end to their lives, or do it themselves to free them from some trouble they are in; or because they are not able to support under a disappointment of what their ambition or lust have prompted them to."
2. "Good men desire death, though always when right, with a submission to the will of God, that they may be rid of sin, which so much dishonours God as well as distresses themselves; and that they may be clothed upon with the shining robes of immortality and glory."
3. "To depart and be with Christ is better than to live in the flesh in this sinful world, in the midst of a variety of sorrows and troubles, and in which communion with Christ is but now and then enjoyed, though such a life is better than sleeping in the grave." (136 words)

### John Wesley:
1. To depart — Out of bonds, flesh, the world.And to be with Christ — In a nearer and fuller union. It is better to depart; it is far better to be with Christ.
