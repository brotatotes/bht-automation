# Philippians 1:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To abide, or continue in the flesh, refers to the belief that the soul will live on even after death, occupying a separate state of existence. The apostle Paul understood the value of his own life, recognizing that his continued presence on earth served a purpose in God's larger plan. He saw the importance of using his experience, influence, and paternal counsel to benefit the church. Paul's willingness to prolong his stay on earth was driven by a sincere desire to be of service to others and advance the cause of religion.
