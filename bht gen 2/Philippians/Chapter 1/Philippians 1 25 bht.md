# Philippians 1:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul expresses a confident assurance that he will remain alive and be with the believers, which arises from a divine revelation and a firm conviction. He anticipates his presence among them to advance their faith and bring them joy. This expectation is not based on human appearances but on his belief that his life is necessary for their welfare, a belief that God will uphold. In this, Paul sees a furtherance of faith and the promotion of the joy that comes from believing.
