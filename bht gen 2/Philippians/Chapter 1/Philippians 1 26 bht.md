# Philippians 1:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage emphasizes the importance of rejoicing in Christ Jesus. Paul's presence among the Philippians was seen as the grounds for their rejoicing, as he had been instrumental in bringing the Gospel to them. However, their joy was not solely because of Paul himself, but because of what he preached - the person, righteousness, and salvation of Christ. Even if Paul's presence with them was not possible, their joy would still be rooted in Christ and the abundant blessings found in the Gospel.
