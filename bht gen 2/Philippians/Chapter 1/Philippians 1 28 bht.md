## BHT:
When facing opposition from adversaries, whether they be Jews or Gentiles, it is important to maintain our Christian integrity and stand firm in our faith. These adversaries, by contending against us, are only rushing towards their own ruin. The persecution we face is not in vain, for it serves as a proof of our salvation, showing that we are counted worthy of the kingdom of God. Let us not be shaken by the multitude of opposition, but rather, hold fast to our trust in Christ, as He has given us a sure token of deliverance.
