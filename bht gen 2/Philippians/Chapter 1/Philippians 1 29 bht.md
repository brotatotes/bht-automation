# Philippians 1:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Faith is not something we can achieve by our own will, but a gift from God through the Holy Spirit. Believing in and trusting through Christ is the path to eternal salvation. Suffering for Christ is not a mark of God's anger, but a gift of His grace. It is a privilege to endure trials for His sake, as it resembles Jesus, provides evidence of our faith, promotes a good cause, and will bring greater honor in heaven. Suffering in Christ's behalf is a gift from God, evidence of our sonship, and a means of spreading His gospel.
