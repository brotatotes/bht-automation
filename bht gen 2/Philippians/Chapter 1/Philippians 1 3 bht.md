# Philippians 1:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle begins by expressing his thankfulness to God for the Philippians. This thankfulness is not occasional, but is present in all his remembrances and mentions of them. He acknowledges the grace of God that brought about their Christian progress, and praises God for the manifestation of their love towards him. The apostle's continual eucharist and gratitude to God is evident, as he attributes all to God's grace and expresses his happiness in the fellowship of the Philippians in the gospel of Christ.
