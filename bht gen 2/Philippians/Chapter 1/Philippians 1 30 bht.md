# Philippians 1:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul is reminding the Philippians that they are facing a similar kind of conflict with their adversaries as he faced when he was with them in Philippi. This conflict refers to the persecution and sufferings they experienced for the sake of the Gospel. Paul's sufferings in Philippi were well-known to the Philippians, as they saw firsthand the opposition he faced. By mentioning this, Paul is encouraging the Philippians to take courage and stand firm in the face of their own hardships, knowing that they are not alone in their struggle.
