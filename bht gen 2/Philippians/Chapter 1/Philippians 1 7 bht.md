# Philippians 1:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Because the Philippians were recipients of the same grace as Paul, who held them in his heart, it was only right for him to pray for them with joy and give thanks for their participation in the Gospel. This shared grace also meant that they were companions in the sufferings that God had granted to Paul as a favor. Thus, Paul was confident that God's work in them would be fulfilled, just as it was in himself. It was a prophetic insight into the full victory that God had sealed for them.
