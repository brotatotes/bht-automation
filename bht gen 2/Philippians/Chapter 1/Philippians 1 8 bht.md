# Philippians 1:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For God, my witness, knows the depths of my heart, and I appeal to Him as the ultimate authority of truth. I yearn eagerly for all of you with genuine affection, desiring your well-being and spiritual growth. It is this sincere love that resonates within me, a reflection of the love that Christ Himself has for you. In me, it is not my own love that dwells, but the love of Jesus Christ that moves and stirs me. Therefore, I long for you with the same tenderness and compassion that flows from the very bowels of Christ.

2. "He calls God as a witness to the truth, inasmuch as he alone is the Truth, and as a witness of his affection, inasmuch as he alone is the searcher of hearts."
3. "True love can flow from no other source than from the bowels of Christ, and this, like a goad, ought to affect us not a little — that Christ in a manner opens his bowels, that by them he may cherish mutual affection between us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For God is my witness. He knows my heart, which you cannot know, and that I appeal unto Him is the greatest pledge of the truth of what I say."
2. "The warmth of the apostle’s affection is very marked in this Epistle (cf. Philippians 4:1), where, as here, the feeling is called forth because they are his joy and crown in the Lord."
3. "The word translated 'bowels' was in Greek applied to the nobler portions of the interior organs, the heart, liver, etc., as opposed to the entrails, and in them was supposed to be the seat of the affections, especially those of love and pity. There was something of the same idea, though not so strictly defined, among the Hebrews, as may be seen from the language of many passages in the Old Testament (Genesis 43:30; 1 Kings 3:26, etc.), so that the rendering given above conveys the sense of the apostle."

1. "For God is my record,.... Which is all one as swearing by him; it is in form of an oath, being a solemn appeal to him as the searcher of hearts, for the uprightness of his mind, the sincerity of his expressions, and the strength of his affections."
2. "He longed after their spiritual welfare, an increase of gifts and grace among them; he was their spiritual father, and he hankered after them; as parents after their children."
3. "It was in the most tender manner that he loved them, and was affected to them; the phrase denotes, that his love towards them was internal, in his heart, and was most tender and strong; and like to that tender concern Christ had for them, and which he stirred up in him."

### John Wesley:
1. I long for you with the bowels of Jesus Christ — In Paul, not Paul lives, but Jesus Christ. Therefore he longs for them with the bowels, the tenderness, not of Paul, but of Jesus Christ.
