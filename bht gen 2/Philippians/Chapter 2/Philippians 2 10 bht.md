## BHT:
In the name of Jesus, every knee should bend and offer worship to Him, recognizing His divine authority and honor. This worship is not merely an outward act, but a heartfelt expression of reverence and submission to Jesus. It is a universal homage that encompasses all creatures and extends throughout the entire universe, both in heaven and on earth. Whether with love or trembling, every creature is called to bow before Him and give Him the reverence and adoration that He deserves.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The salutation is not at the name of Jesus, as by bowing when the name is uttered, but...the spiritual sphere, the holy element as it were, in which every prayer is to be offered and every knee to bow."
2. "Things in heaven, etc. The words may apply either to all intelligent beings or to all things."

### John Calvin:
1. "Though respect is shewn to men also be means of this rite, there can nevertheless be no doubt that what is here meant is that adoration which belongs exclusively to God..."
