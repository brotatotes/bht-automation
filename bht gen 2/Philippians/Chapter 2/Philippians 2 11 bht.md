# Philippians 2:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the end, every individual, both believers and unbelievers, will openly and genuinely acknowledge Jesus Christ as Lord. This includes heavenly beings such as angels, as well as those who initially opposed him. The confession of Jesus as Lord is not limited to mere words, but it reflects the recognition of his divine authority and sovereignty. This confession brings great glory to God the Father, as it signifies the fulfillment of Christ's mediatorial office and establishes his universal reign.
