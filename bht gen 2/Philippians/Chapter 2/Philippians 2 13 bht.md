# Philippians 2:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God is always present and actively working in us, guiding our will and actions according to His good pleasure. We are called to work towards our own salvation, but take comfort in knowing that it is God who empowers and assists us in this process. His divine influence does not negate our efforts, but rather supports and encourages them. With God's unwavering presence and help, we can confidently navigate our journey of faith and find assurance in His mighty strength.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This working must not be explained away with Pelagius (in Mey.), ‘velle operatur  suadendo et  præmia promittendo :’ it is an efficacious working which is here spoken of: God not only brings about the will, but creates the will we owe both the will to do good, and the power, to His indwelling Spirit."
2. "εὐδοκίαν δὲ τὸ ἀγαθὸν τοῦ θεοῦ προσηγόρευσε θέλημα · θέλει δὲ πάντας ἀνθρώπους σωθῆναι , κ . εἰς ἐπίγνωσιν ἀληθείας ἐλθεῖν."
3. "Do all things for the sake of (to carry out) your own good pleasure."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The will, and the power to work, being first instalments of His grace, encourage us to make full proof of, and carry out to the end, the 'salvation' which He has first 'worked,' and is still 'working in' us, enabling us to 'work it out.'"
2. "Man is, in different senses, entirely active, and entirely passive: God producing all, and we acting all. What He produced is our own acts."
3. "Thus the same things in Scripture are represented as from God, and from us. God makes a new heart, and we are commanded to make us a new heart; not merely because we must use the means in order to the effect, but the effect itself is our act and our duty."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is of importance, therefore, to understand what this declaration of the apostle means, in order to see whether this objection is valid, or whether the fact that God 'works in us' is to be regarded as a reason why we should make no effort."
2. "The declaration here, therefore, cannot mean that God compels us, or that we are anything else but free agents still, though He 'works in us to will and to do.' It must mean merely that he exerts such an influence as to secure this result."
3. "The influence which God exerts on the mind is in the way of help or aid. What He does will not embarrass or hinder us. It will prevent no effort which we make to be saved; it will throw no hindrance or obstacle in the way."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "For it is God which worketh in you...to will and to do... Both are from God, and are of one piece, so that he who wills inevitably does."
2. "We will, but God works the will in us. We work, therefore, but God works the working in us" 
3. "For to do, Rev. substitutes to work, thus preserving the harmony in the Greek between 'God which worketh' and 'to work.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "It is God that worketh. This is the true engine for bringing down all haughtiness — this the sword for putting an end to all pride, when we are taught that we are utterly nothing, and can do nothing, except through the grace of God alone."
2. "God restores in us a free choice, that we may have it in our power to will aright. Thus they acknowledge to have received from God the power of willing aright, but assign to man a good inclination. Paul, however, declares this to be a work of God, without any reservation."
3. "The Holy Spirit, however, calls us to consider, that he wishes to work upon living organs, but he immediately represses arrogance by recommending fear and trembling... Confidence in ourselves produces carelessness and arrogance... The remedy for both evils is, when, distrusting ourselves, we depend entirely on God alone."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The first movement comes from God. He bestows His quickening gift, and then you may improve what He has given by your earnest labour."
2. "Even the wish to serve God comes from Himself, is roused first by Him in the heart of man; and when He has so awakened the mind, He bestows the energy, the working power, so that the wish may have its fulfilment."
3. "And God’s graces are bestowed because He willeth not the death of a sinner, but that all men should come to salvation. This is His good pleasure, and for the sake of its achievement, He is thus large in His bounty to men’s souls."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "God is the Energy and the Energizer of the universe."
2. "God does it all, then. Yes, but he puts us to work also and our part is essential."
3. "So Whitney puts 'the will of God' behind gravitation and all the laws of nature."

### John Gill:
1. "all we have, and do, is from God"
2. "points out the spring, principle, and foundation of all good works; namely, the grace of God wrought in the heart"
3. "God works in his people both to will and to do of [his] good pleasure"

### John Wesley:
1. "For it is God — God alone, who is with you, though I am not." 
2. "That worketh in you according to his good pleasure — Not for any merit of yours. Yet his influences are not to supersede, but to encourage, our own efforts." 
3. "Work out your own salvation — Here is our duty. For it is God that worketh in you — Here is our encouragement. And O, what a glorious encouragement, to have the arm of Omnipotence stretched out for our support and our succour!"
