# Philippians 2:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do all things without murmurings and disputings, for such murmuring and disputing arise from selfishness and a lack of submission to God. Let us conduct ourselves agreeably among others, without brawls, strifes, or contentions, seeking to please God and not to please ourselves. May we avoid quarrels and slanderings, being content to wait for God's guidance and trusting in Him. Let our actions be in accordance with the righteous law and good will of God, done without hesitation or doubt.

### John Calvin:
1. "For every man that has learned carefully to submit himself to God, without claiming anything for himself, will also conduct himself agreeably among men."
2. "When every one makes it his care to please himself, two faults prevail: First, they calumniate one another; and secondly, they strive against one another in contentions."
