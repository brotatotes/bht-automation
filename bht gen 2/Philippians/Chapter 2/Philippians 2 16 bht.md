# Philippians 2:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are called to hold forth the light of Christ's word, reflecting His light and making the gospel known. Through their conduct and proclamation, they shine as stars in the darkness, carrying the transformative power of the word to others. The Apostle Paul rejoices when he sees believers continuing in the faith, for it shows that his labor has not been in vain. This calls for Christians to persevere in holding fast to the word of life and running the race of faith with endurance, living lives and conversations that are fitting to the gospel they proclaim.
