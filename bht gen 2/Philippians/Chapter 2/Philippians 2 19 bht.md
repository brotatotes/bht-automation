# Philippians 2:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For it is by being firmly grounded in the faith that believers are enabled to withstand the trials and tribulations of life. The Apostle Paul expresses his hope that upon his return, he will have the joy of witnessing the steadfastness of the Philippians. This steadfastness, rooted in their faith in the Lord Jesus, will provide comfort and encouragement not only to Paul but also to all Gospel ministers who long to see the church thriving and standing firm in the midst of adversity.

1. "‘In the Lord Jesus’ is equivalent to ‘through the Lord Jesus,’ It was to Jesus he looked in all his need."
