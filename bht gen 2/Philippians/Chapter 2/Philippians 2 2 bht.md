# Philippians 2:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
May the joy of the Philippians be made complete through their unity. They are called to be of the same mind, having the same love and being of one accord. This unity is essential, as it reflects their common faith in Christ and their shared affection for one another. Let their minds be united in thought and judgment, and let them be of one heart and will, joyfully experiencing the same love for God as they navigate their Christian journey together.
