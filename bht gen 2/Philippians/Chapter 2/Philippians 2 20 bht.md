# Philippians 2:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The absence of anyone with a soul like Timothy's, who would share that same deep affection and concern for the welfare of the Philippians, is the reason why Paul chooses to send Timothy to them. Timothy's sincere love and genuine care for their well-being, combined with his faithful preaching of the Gospel, makes him the perfect messenger for such an important task.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

3. "who (of that kind, who) will really (emphatic: with no secondary regards for himself, as in Php 2:21) care for your affairs (have real anxiety about your matters, to order them for the best)"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I have none so 'like-minded,' literally, 'like-souled,' with myself as is Timothy."
2. "Paul's second self, naturally—Greek, 'genuinely'; 'with sincere solicitude.'"
3. "A case wherein the Spirit of God so changed man's nature, that to be natural was with him to be spiritual: the great point to be aimed at."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The meaning is, that there was no one with him who would feel so deep an interest in their welfare."
2. "He might be depended on to enter heartily into their concerns."
3. "Paul regarded Timothy as a son, and Paul’s sending him on such an occasion would evince the feelings of a father who should send a beloved son on an important message."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Like minded [ισοψυχον] Only here in the New Testament."
2. "The kindred adjective gnhsiov true, own, occurs 1 Timothy 1:2; Titus 1:4; 2 Corinthians 8:8 (see note)."

### John Calvin:
1. "I have no one equally well-affected for attending to your interests."
2. "Paul compares Timothy with others and pronounces this eulogium upon him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For I have no man like-minded. That is, like-minded with myself, whose soul equally with my own will be filled with affection and interest for you."
2. "who will care truly for your state. This word ‘truly’ is used by Paul in another place of Timothy (1 Timothy 1:2), where he styles him ‘his true child in the faith.’ We can see then that the sense here is ‘genuinely,’ and the ‘care’ is that intense anxiety which St. Paul speaks of (2 Corinthians 11:28) as his own lot in ‘the care of all the churches.’"
3. "It is the thought which admits no rest till the object of it is quite secured, and hardly then, but finds new anxiety for itself."

1. "Likeminded with Timothy, not with Paul."
2. "Truly, genuinely."
3. "Legitimate birth, not spurious."

### John Gill:
1. "Timothy had a soul like the apostle's, which none that were with him, besides him, had... his soul was knit to his, and they had, as it were, but one soul in two bodies." 
2. "He was a second Paul in the pulpit; and there was no man likeminded as he, or so well disposed to the Philippians as he was, that had their good and cause at heart." 
3. "He had a sincere love, an hearty and real concern for their good; and which he would show by delivering to them the sincere milk of the word, by preaching the Gospel in the power and purity of it, with all sincerity and uprightness, with a single eye to the glory of Christ, and the good of their souls."

### John Wesley:
1. I have none — Of those who are now with me.
