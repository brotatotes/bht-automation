# Philippians 2:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They all sought their own matters instead of prioritizing the interests of Jesus Christ. Their pursuits included seeking personal gain, worldly comfort, and recognition from others. Interestingly, Timothy was an exception to this pattern, as he did not have the same self-centered motives. This reminds us of the difficulty of finding individuals who are truly willing to sacrifice their own priorities for the sake of advancing the cause of Christ.
