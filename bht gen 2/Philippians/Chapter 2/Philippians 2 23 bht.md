# Philippians 2:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul anticipates sending Timothy to the readers as soon as he determines the outcome of his situation, whether he is acquitted or condemned. He acknowledges the uncertainty surrounding his circumstances and the possibility that he may soon be able to spare Timothy to visit the churches. Paul's use of the word presently suggests the immediacy with which he expects to make a decision, looking beyond his current situation and trusting in God's divine purposes.
