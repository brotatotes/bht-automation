# Philippians 2:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
But I trust in the Lord, that I also myself shall come shortly. In these words, Paul's deep faith and reliance on the Lord are evident. He sees his entire life revolving around Christ, fully placing his trust in Him. Paul wants the Philippians to know that he still holds the inner belief and hope that he will be able to visit them soon. It is clear from his language and intent that sending Timothy is not a substitute for his personal presence, as he plans to visit them himself if circumstances allow.
