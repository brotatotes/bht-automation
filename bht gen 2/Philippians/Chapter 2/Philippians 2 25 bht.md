# Philippians 2:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Epaphroditus, the messenger whom the Philippians had sent to Paul with their generous offering, was now to be sent back to them without delay. This was met with great anticipation and concern from both parties, as Epaphroditus had been longing for a reunion with his fellow believers, while the Philippians eagerly awaited his return. They were aware of the hardships he had endured in his service for the Lord, and their hearts were filled with gratitude for his dedicated work and the sacrifices he had made.
