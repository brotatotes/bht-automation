# Philippians 2:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Epaphroditus, the recipient of the letter, longed to see the Philippians and alleviate their concerns. He experienced deep sorrow and distress, similar to the anguish Christ felt in Gethsemane. Epaphroditus's heartfelt desire to return to Philippi was driven not only by affection but also by a sense of duty to support and comfort his fellow believers. His illness and the knowledge of the Philippians' distress intensified his heaviness, which became a sign of his genuine pastoral care. Even from a distance, Epaphroditus remained concerned for his flock and longed to ease their anxieties.
