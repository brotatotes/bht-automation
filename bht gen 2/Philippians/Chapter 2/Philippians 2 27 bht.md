## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "'sorrow coming upon sorrow,' not, sorrow superimposed upon sorrow."
2. "The second λύπην refers to his own distress in his imprisonment, so often implied in this Epistle."
3. "This is better, than with Chrys., al., to refer it to Epaphroditus’s sickness, τὴν ἀπὸ τῆς τελευτῆς ἐπὶ τῇ διὰ τὴν ἀῤῥωστίαν , which does not agree with ἀλυπότερος , Philippians 2:28 , implying that λύπη would remain even after the departure of Epaphroditus."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Epaphroditus' sickness proves that the apostles had not ordinarily the permanent gift of miracles, any more than of inspiration: both were vouchsafed to them only for each particular occasion, as the Spirit thought fit."
2. "lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow—namely, the sorrow of losing him by death, in addition to the sorrow of my imprisonment."
3. "Here only occurs anything of a sorrowful tone in this Epistle, which generally is most joyous."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The account of the sickness and recovery of Epaphroditus is such as to lead us to suppose that he was not restored by miracle." 
2. "This account...shows also that this Epistle is not the work of an impostor. Had it been, a miracle would not have been spared."
3. "The sources of his sorrow, had Epaphroditus died, would have been such as these: He would have lost a valued friend...he would have felt that his life had been lost in endeavoring to do him good."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Sorrow upon sorrow [λυπην επι λυπην] . The accusative implies motion. Sorrow coming upon sorrow, as wave after wave.

### John Calvin:
1. "It is, however, surprising that he should ascribe it to the mercy of God that Epaphroditus had had his period of life prolonged, while he had previously declared that he desired death in preference to life."
2. "Paul acknowledges that the death of Epaphroditus would have been bitterly painful to him, and he recognizes it as an instance of God’s sparing mercy toward himself, that he had been restored to health."
3. "This, in the first place, is invariable in the case of all believers, that, on occasion of the death of any one, they are reminded of the anger of God against sin; but Paul was the more affected with the loss sustained by the Church, which he saw would be deprived of a singularly good pastor at a time when the good were so few in number."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For indeed he was sick nigh unto death... St. Paul’s words indicate that the report which the Philippians had heard had come short of the reality."
2. "The phrase is common in the Gospels in the petitions to be healed which men utter to Jesus... St. Paul does not consider that for all men it is a mercy to them that they be taken away."
3. "St. Paul does not mean by this that he would have had the sorrow of mourning over Epaphroditus’ death added to the grief which he had felt while he was sick... he says that to this, his wonted grief, the death of his friend would have brought an addition of sorrow."

### John Gill:
1. "Good men, such as Christ loves, are sometimes sick, not exempt from bodily disorders that bring them to the brink of the grave. Such was this good man's case."
2. "God had mercy on him, his recovery was not by man, but by God, and whenever means succeed in restoration, it ought to be ascribed to divine blessing."
3. "Grace and the doctrine of grace regulate passions, restrain from immoderate sorrow, but do not deny their proper use. Christianity encourages sympathy and weeping with them that weep within due bounds."

### John Wesley:
1. God had compassion on him — Restoring him to health.
