# Philippians 2:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In order to maintain unity, do not engage in strife or vainglory. Strife and contention disrupt the peace of the Church and hinder the oneness of purpose. Instead, let each person esteem others better than themselves. This humble mindset allows for the preservation of peace, love, and unity. By considering others as more important, we demonstrate the fruit of the Spirit and foster harmonious relationships.
