# Philippians 2:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Epaphroditus risked his life to serve the Apostle, exhibiting true humility and selflessness. He willingly undertook the service of Christian love, even at the cost of serious sickness. The Philippians lacked the opportunity to send their bounty, not the will, and Epaphroditus fulfilled that which they desired to do. As believers, we should follow Christ's example of genuine religion and act with compassion toward others. Let us be willing to sacrifice our ease to promote the welfare of our fellow believers, just as Epaphroditus did.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "[Epaphroditus] incurred so serious and nearly fatal a sickness: not to be understood of danger incurred by the hostility of the authorities... (he) risked his life in the way above hinted at, i.e. probably by too constant and watchful attendance on the Apostle."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He was probably in a delicate state of health in setting out from Philippi; but at all hazards he undertook this service of Christian love, which cost him a serious sickness."
2. "Not that Paul would imply, they lacked the will: what they 'lacked' was the 'opportunity' by which to send their accustomed bounty."
3. "That which ye would have done if you could (but which you could not through absence), he did for you therefore receive him with all joy."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is one evidence, also, of true humility and of right feeling when we esteem them as better than ourselves, and when we are willing to see them honored, and are willing to sacrifice our own ease to promote their welfare."
2. "We should feel a deep interest in the welfare of others... We may have an opportunity every day. It is an easy matter to do good to others."
3. "Let us in all things look to the example of Christ... He showed us what true religion is, for it is just such as was seen in his life. He showed us how to act in our treatment of mankind."
4. "Christians should let their light shine... Every word that he speaks, every expression of the eye, every cloud or beam of sunshine on his brow, will have some effect in doing this."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "If the latter, the meaning is labor for the Gospel; compare Acts 14:38."
2. "Paul says that Epaphroditus recklessly exposed his life. Rev., hazarding."
3. "The expression is complimentary and affectionate, to the effect that all that was wanting in the matter of their service was their ministration in person, which was supplied by Epaphroditus."

### John Calvin:
1. "Sickness, indeed, is not an excellence, but it is an excellence not to spare yourself that you may serve Christ."
2. "Epaphroditus felt that his health would be in danger if he applied himself beyond measure; yet he would rather be negligent as to health than be deficient in duty."
3. "Assuredly there is nothing in which we can better serve God, than when we help his servants who labor for the truth of the gospel."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The work' is a New Testament phrase for the work of preaching the Gospel."
2. "He drew near, even unto death,' expresses the fulness of the phrase, in which the verb alone expresses the proximity, and the preposition which could have been dispensed with is added to give emphasis to the danger in which the life of Epaphroditus had been."
3. "It represents him as encountering the labour and danger which attended on St. Paul’s circumstances with full free will, and an entire disregard of consequences to himself, such as only true devotion could supply."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The word παραβολευσαμενος from an inscription at Olbia or the Black Sea of the second century A.D. where it plainly means 'exposing himself to danger' as here." 
2. "The word παραβολαν (riskers) was applied to the Christians who risked their lives for the dying and the dead."

### John Gill:
1. "he cheerfully undertook, and faithfully performed"
2. "what with the long and fatiguing journey...almost issued in his death"
3. "he loved not his life, nor counted it dear to himself; he rather despised it"

### John Wesley:
1. To supply your deficiency of service — To do what you could not do in person.
