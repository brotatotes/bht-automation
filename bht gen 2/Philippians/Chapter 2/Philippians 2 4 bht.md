# Philippians 2:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are called to shift their focus from self-centeredness to the needs of others. It is not enough to look out for our own interests; we must also actively consider the well-being of those around us. By cultivating a heart of compassion and showing mercy, we demonstrate the true essence of Christ's teachings. Our actions should reflect selflessness and a genuine concern for the welfare of others, rather than being solely driven by our own ambitions and desires.
