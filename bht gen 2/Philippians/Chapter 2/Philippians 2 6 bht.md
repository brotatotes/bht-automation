# Philippians 2:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ did not consider it a violation of someone else's rights or a usurpation of authority to be equal with God, for that was his rightful and unquestionable position. The term equal used here signifies not just a resemblance, but a true and proper equality, indicating the fullness and supreme height of the Godhead. In contrast to this divine status, Christ willingly emptied and humbled himself.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The divine nature had infinite BEAUTY in itself, even without any creature contemplating that beauty: that beauty was 'the form of God'"
2. "His argument is that the antithesis requires it, 'He used His equality with God as an opportunity, not for self-exaltation, but for self-abasement, or emptying Himself.'"
3. "Not 'looking on His own things' (Philippians 2:4), He, though existing in the form of God, He esteemed it no robbery to be on an equality with God, yet made Himself of no reputation."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The importance of the passage on the question of the divinity of the Saviour will be perceived at once, and no small part of the point of the appeal by the apostle depends, as will be seen, in the fact that Paul regarded the Redeemer as equal with God."
2. "Instead of retaining this by an earnest effort, or by a grasp which he was unwilling to relinquish, he chose to forego the dignity, and to assume the humble condition of a man."
3. "The natural and obvious meaning of the language is, that there was an equality of nature and of rank with God, from which he humbled himself when he became a man."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Being in the form of God [εν μορφη θεου υπαρχων] . Being. Not the simple einai to be, but stronger, denoting being which is from the beginning."
2. "Form [μορφη] . We must here dismiss from our minds the idea of shape. The word is used in its philosophic sense, to denote that expression of being which carries in itself the distinctive nature and character of the being to whom it pertains."
3. "To say, then, that Christ was in the form of God, is to say that He existed as essentially one with God. The expression of deity through human nature thus has its background in the expression of deity as deity in the eternal ages of God's being."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ’s humility consisted in his abasing himself from the highest pinnacle of glory to the lowest ignominy: our humility consists in refraining from exalting ourselves by a false estimation."
2. "Being such as he was, he could, without doing wrong to any one, shew himself equal with God; but he did not manifest himself to be what he really was, nor did he openly assume in the view of men what belonged to him by right."
3. "For just as a man is known, when we mark the form of his appearance and his person, so the majesty, which shines forth in God, is his form or figure."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Christ being in the form of God: here the word ‘being’ is not the usual simple substantive verb, but a stronger word which is employed when the nature of a thing, in contradistinction to its mere existence, is to be predicated."
2. "All these the apostle says Christ had originally, and in this way was ‘in the form of God,’ though He had not been manifested unto men."
3. "He did not count His equality with God as a prize to be held fast. He possessed this equality, but consented to forego it for a time, that He might work out the salvation of men."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In his preincarnate state Christ possessed the attributes of God and so appeared to those in heaven who saw him."
2. "Paul means a prize to be held on to rather than something to be won."
3. "Undoubtedly Christ gave up his environment of glory. He took upon himself limitations of place (space) and of knowledge and of power, though still on earth retaining more of these than any mere man."

### John Gill:
1. "This phrase, 'the form of God', is to be understood of the nature and essence of God, and describes Christ as he was from all eternity... he was in the glorious form, nature, and essence of God."
2. "And now Christ being in this glorious form, or having the same divine nature with the Father, with all the infinite and unspeakable glories of it, thought it no robbery to be equal with God."
3. "This divine form and equality, or true and proper deity, he did not obtain by force and rapine, by robbery and usurpation... but Christ enjoyed this equality by nature; he thought, he accounted, he knew he had it this way; and he held it hereby, and of right, and not by any unlawful means."

### John Wesley:
1. "Counted it no act of robbery — That is the precise meaning of the words,-no invasion of another's prerogative, but his own strict and unquestionable right." 
2. "To be equal with God — the word here translated equal, occurs in the adjective form five or six times in the New Testament...In all which places it expresses not a bare resemblance, but a real and proper equality." 
3. "It here implies both the fulness and the supreme height of the Godhead; to which are opposed, he emptied and he humbled himself."
