# Philippians 2:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Though Christ was equal with God, He chose to humble Himself by taking on the form of a servant. This emptying of Himself involved relinquishing His divine glory and assuming the likeness of humanity. While He remained fully divine, He veiled His divine nature, allowing only glimpses of His glory to be seen through His works and miracles. This incredible act of humility and condescension demonstrates His willingness to set aside His rights and position for our sake.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He used His equality with God as an opportunity, not for self-exaltation, but for self-abasement."
2. "He ceased, while in this state of exinanition, to reflect the glory which He had with the Father."
3. "And this state, of a servant of God, is further defined by what follows) being made in the likeness of men."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The two latter clauses (there being no conjunctions, 'and . . . and,' in the Greek) expresses in what Christ's 'emptying of Himself' consists, namely, in 'taking the form of a servant'"
2. "His subjection to the law and to His parents, His low state as a carpenter, His betrayal for the price of a bond-servant, and slave-like death to relieve us from the slavery of sin and death, finally and chiefly, His servant-like dependence as man on God, while His divinity was not outwardly manifested, are all marks of His 'form as a servant'."
3. "His emptying Himself presupposes His previous plenitude of Godhead. He remained full of this; yet He bore Himself as if He were empty."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The essential idea is that of bringing to emptiness, vanity, or nothingness; and, hence, it is applied to a case where one lays aside his rank and dignity, and becomes in respect to that as nothing; that is, he assumes a more humble rank and station."
2. "In regard to the actual change respecting his manifestations in heaven, or the withdrawing of the symbols of his glory there, the Scriptures are nearly silent, and conjecture is useless - perhaps improper."
3. "He was made like a servant in the lowly condition which he assumed. The whole connection and force of the argument here demands this interpretation."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He divested Himself of that peculiar mode of existence which was proper and peculiar to Him as one with God."
2. "His self-emptying was not self-extinction, nor was the divine Being changed into a mere man."
3. "What Christ grasped at in His incarnation was not divine sovereignty, but service."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ, indeed, could not divest himself of Godhead; but he kept it concealed for a time, that it might not be seen, under the weakness of the flesh."
2. "The abasement of the flesh was, notwithstanding, like a vail, by which his divine majesty was concealed."
3. "He lived in such a manner, that he seemed as though he were on a level with mankind, and yet he was very different from a mere man, although he was truly man."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But no figure ever exactly represents that for which it is put, and must therefore never be too closely pressed."
2. "Christ had possessed from eternity all those qualities and attributes which are distinctly Divine; these He now, as it were, puts off, lets them not constantly be seen, and wears the character and manifests the attributes of a servant."
3. "Christ at His incarnation entered on a new manifestation of Himself. He had before been in the form of God, He now assumes a human likeness."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He took the characteristic attributes of a slave. His humanity was as real as his deity."
2. "It was a likeness, but a real likeness, no mere phantom humanity as the Docetic Gnostics held."
3. "Note the difference in tense between eternal existence in the form of God and becoming, definite entrance in time upon his humanity."

### John Gill:
1. "The glory of his divine nature was covered, and out of sight; and though some rays and beams of it broke out through his works and miracles, yet his glory, as the only begotten of the Father, was beheld only by a few."
2. "He willingly assented to it, to lay aside as it were his glory for a while, to have it veiled and hid, and be reckoned anything, a mere man, yea, to have a devil, and not be God: O wondrous humility! astonishing condescension!"
3. "Put these two together, 'the form of God', and 'the form of a servant', and admire the amazing stoop!"

### John Wesley:
1. "He was so far from tenaciously insisting upon, that he willingly relinquished, his claim."
2. "He veiled his fulness from the sight of men and angels."
3. "He took the form of a servant."
