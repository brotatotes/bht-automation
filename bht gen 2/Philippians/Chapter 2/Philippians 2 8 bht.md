### Philip Schaff:
1. "Being found, that is of those by whom he was seen and known. This was constantly expressed by those who saw and heard Him: ‘Never man spake like this man;’ and even the centurion (Mark 15:39), while styling Him ‘Son of God,’ speaks of Him as ‘this man,’ and St. Peter in his Pentecostal sermon calls Him ‘Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God unto you.’"
2. "His self-abasement went still farther, and went, too, of His own will. He became obedient, for He had taken the ‘form of a slave.’ His obedience was yielded to the Father, as we may learn from the agonized language in Gethsemane: ‘Not my will, but Thine, be done.’"

3. "Jesus came all the way down to the most despised death of all, a condemned criminal on the accursed cross."
