# Philippians 2:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ's exaltation was a result of his voluntary and supreme act of humility. Through his resurrection, he received a glorious body and became the pledge for all believers of the glory to come. His exaltation also means that he has been given the gifts of the Spirit without measure to bestow upon his church. Therefore, he possesses a dignity and majesty that is unparalleled, surpassing all names and all greatness among men and angels.
