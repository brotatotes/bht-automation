# Philippians 3:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Rejoicing in the Lord is not just a suggestion but a duty for all Christians. It is a joyful response to the assurance of salvation in Jesus Christ. This joy is not dependent on worldly achievements or possessions, but on a deep and intimate relationship with the Lord. It is in this joy that believers find true safety against the deception of false teachings and the distractions of earthly desires. As Paul reminds the Philippians to rejoice in the Lord, he is reinforcing the importance of finding ultimate satisfaction and contentment in Christ alone.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The sense is evidently closed with ch. 3:30."
2. "And this same exhortation, χαίρειν, is in fact the groundtone of the whole Epistle."
3. "The word ἀσφαλές is no objection to this: because the χαίρ . ἐν κυρ . is in fact an introduction to the warning which follows: a provision, by upholding the antagonist duty, against their falling into deceit."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Furthermore" [BENGEL and WAHL] as in :-. Literally, "As to what remains," c. It is often used at the conclusion of Epistles for "finally" (Ephesians 6:10
2 Thessalonians 3:1).
2. "the prevailing feature in this Epistle."
3. "marks the true ground of joy, in contrast with 'having confidence in the flesh,' or in any outward sensible matter of boasting."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "We may rejoice that we have such a Saviour. He is just such as we need."
3. "The principal joy of the true Christian should be in the Lord. He should find his happiness not in riches, or gaiety, or vanity, or ambition, or books, or in the world in any form, but in communion with the Lord Jesus, and in the hope of eternal life through him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Finally, frequent in Paul's writings in introducing the conclusions of his letters."
2. "Rejoice, the same things."
3. "Grievous, the vexation arising from weary waiting."

### John Calvin:
1. "Rejoice in the Lord...that they may not cease to exercise holy joy." 
2. "He calls them dogs; the metaphor being grounded upon this — that, for the sake of filling their belly, they assailed true doctrine with their impure barking." 
3. "He calls them evil workers, meaning, that, under the pretext of building up the Church, they did nothing but ruin and destroy everything."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Rejoice in the Lord...They must first imitate the Lord's humiliation, and then they could rejoice in Him."
2. "The need for [previous oral warnings against Judaizing teachers] may have been suggested to the apostle's mind by a prevalence of Jewish teaching among some who professed Christ in Rome."
3. "To repeat such admonitions to the Philippians, even if there be no special immediate need for them, so far as he knows, is no burden to him, and to them it may chance to be a timely warning."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Finally (το λοιπον). Accusative of general reference, literally, 'as for the rest.' So again in Philippians 4:8. It (or just λοιπον) is a common phrase towards the close of Paul's Epistles (2 Thessalonians 3:1; 2 Corinthians 13:11)."
2. "But Paul uses the idiom elsewhere also as in 1 Corinthians 7:29; 1 Thessalonians 4:1 before the close of the letter is in sight. It is wholly needless to understand Paul as about to finish and then suddenly changing his mind like some preachers who announce the end a half dozen times."
3. "To write the same things (τα αυτα γραφειν). Present active articular infinitive, 'the going on writing the same things.' What things? He has just used χαιρετε (go on rejoicing) again and he will repeat it in Philippians 4:4. But in verse Philippians 3:2 he uses βλεπετε three times."

### John Gill:
1. "He exhorts them in a most affectionate manner, as his dear brethren in a spiritual relation, that they would make Christ their chief joy."
2. "A believer has always reason to rejoice in Christ; in the greatness of his person, he being in the form of God, and equal to him..."
3. "...the saints may be the more established in the present truth... for you [it is] safe; being a means of preserving them from the error of the wicked."

### John Wesley:
1. The same things — Which you have heard before.
