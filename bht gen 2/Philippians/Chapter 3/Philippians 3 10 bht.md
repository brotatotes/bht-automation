# Philippians 3:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle longed to truly know Christ, not just as a theological concept, but as his personal Savior. He desired to experience the transformative power of Christ's resurrection in his own life, being raised from the death of sin into the fullness of life in love. And he was willing to share in the sufferings of Christ, understanding that by being crucified with Him, he would ultimately partake in the glory of His resurrection.
