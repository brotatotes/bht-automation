# Philippians 3:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul acknowledges that he has not yet obtained the perfect knowledge and fellowship with Christ, but he continues to pursue it fervently. He uses the metaphor of a race, emphasizing the need for continuous progress and pressing toward the goal. Despite not having reached the mark, Paul remains determined, reflecting on his initial encounter with Christ and the purpose for which he was seized. His pursuit of holiness is not in vain, as he recognizes that his efforts are guided by the grace of God.

2. "The A. V. gives the sense of chasing; whereas the apostle 's meaning is the pressing toward a fixed point. The continuous present would be better, I am pressing."
3. "Paul's meaning is, 'I would grasp that for which Christ grasped me. Paul's conversion was literally of the nature of a seizure. That for which Christ laid hold of him was indeed his mission to the Gentiles, but it was also his personal salvation.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "In connection with this, there is much weight in what he now adds — that he himself, while he had given up all hinderances, had nevertheless not attained that object of aim, and that, on this account, he always aimed and eagerly aspired at something further."
2. "He teaches, therefore, by his own example, that we ought to make progress, and that the knowledge of Christ is an attainment of such difficulty, that even those who apply themselves exclusively to it, do nevertheless not attain perfection in it so long as they live."

2. "Every day brings its new opportunities either to be improved or to be neglected. If rightly used, they bring men nearer to perfection; but the work is ever doing, never done; for the stature of the fulness of Christ is the Christian’s aim, and of this his greatest and best efforts must ever fall short."
3. "That is, gain the prize in the end, which cannot be without the constant hastening and toil."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

### John Wesley:
1. "Not that I have already attained — The prize. He here enters on a new set of metaphors, taken from a race. But observe how, in the utmost fervour, he retains his sobriety of spirit."

The speaking conditionally both here and in the preceding verse, implies no uncertainty, but only the difficulty of attaining."
