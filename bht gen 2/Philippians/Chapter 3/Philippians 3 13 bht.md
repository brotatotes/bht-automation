# Philippians 3:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul humbly admits that he does not consider himself to have already attained perfect holiness. He recognizes that he has not yet reached the ultimate goal of his heavenly calling in Christ Jesus. However, this acknowledgment does not discourage him but rather motivates him to keep moving forward, striving to leave behind the things of the past and pressing on towards the prize that awaits him. Paul's unwavering determination serves as a reminder to all believers that spiritual growth is a continual pursuit, and that true progress lies in persistently seeking after the fullness of God's purposes.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Brethren, I do not reckon myself to have laid hold: but one thing I do: forgetting the things behind, but ever reaching out towards the things before, I pursue towards the goal for the prize of my heavenly calling of God in Christ Jesus."
2. "The prize consequent on the faithful carrying out of that summons which I received from God in heaven."
3. "The unity of the idea of the calling in the Lord, 1 Corinthians 7:22, would dispense with it (the use of œÑ·øÜœÇ or œÑŒø·ø¶ before ·ºêŒΩ)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He who counts himself perfect, must deceive himself by calling sin infirmity."
2. "Looking back is sure to end in going back."
3. "The Christian is always humbled by the contrast between what he is and what he desires to be."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There is something which I strive after which I have not yet gained... a moral perfection, and not merely the obtainment of the prize or reward."
2. "A Christian will accomplish nothing who has not a single great aim and purpose of soul."
3. "Forward we see everything to cheer and animate us - the crown of victory, the joys of heaven, the society of the blessed - the Saviour beckoning to us and encouraging us."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Myself. As others count themselves.

### John Calvin:
1. "He shews this immediately after, by saying that he was intent on this one thing, leaving off everything else." 
2. "For as it would profit the runner nothing to have left the starting-point, unless he went forward to the goal, so we must also pursue the course of our calling until death, and must not cease until we have obtained what we seek." 
3. "Thus Paul teaches us, that he does not think of what he has been, or of what he has done, but simply presses forward towards the appointed goal, and that, too, with such ardor, that he runs forward to it, as it were, with outstretched arms."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The need for labour in the spiritual race is not ended for him, nor must it be for others." 
2. "And in the word ‚Äòcount‚Äô he expresses this very strongly. It is not the word which has been so rendered in Philippians 3:8. Here the word signifies the making of an accurate reckoning."
3. "And that [he] speaks of one thing only, shows how he felt the singleness of eye with which the great work of salvation was to be pursued."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "To have apprehended (Œ∫Œ±œÑŒµŒπŒªŒ∑œÜŒµŒΩŒ±). Perfect active infinitive of same verb Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±ŒªŒ±ŒºŒ≤Œ±ŒΩœâ (perfective use of Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±, to grasp completely). Surely denial enough."
2. "One thing (ŒµŒΩ Œ¥Œµ). No verb in the Greek. We can supply œÄŒøŒπœâ (I do) or Œ¥ŒπœâŒ∫œâ (I keep on in the chase), but no verb is really needed. 'When all is said, the greatest art is to limit and isolate oneself' (Goethe), concentration."
3. "Forgetting the things which are behind (œÑŒ± ŒºŒµŒΩ ŒøœÄŒπœÉœâ ŒµœÄŒπŒªŒ±ŒΩŒ∏Œ±ŒΩŒøŒºŒµŒΩŒøœÇ). Common verb, usually with the genitive, but the accusative in the Koine is greatly revived with verbs. Paul can mean either his old pre-Christian life, his previous progress as a Christian, or both (all of it)."

### John Gill:
1. "He had not attained to perfect knowledge, was not come to the mark, had not received the prize, or laid hold on eternal life."
2. "He tacitly strikes at the arrogance and vain confidence of false teachers, that pretended to perfection."
3. "He was desirous of, and pursued after with great vehemence and eagerness; the metaphor is taken from runners in a race, who did not stop to look behind them, but look and move forwards, and stretch themselves out to the uttermost, and run with all their might and main to the mark before them."

### John Wesley:
1. I do not account myself to have apprehended this already; to be already possessed of perfect holiness.
