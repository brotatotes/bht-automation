# Philippians 3:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The goal of the Christian race is the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. It is not limited to a select few, but is extended to all believers as their common calling to salvation. As we run this race, our gaze should be fixed on Jesus, who is the mark or watchman that we continually look to. Forgetting the past, we press on towards this goal, reaching forth to the things that lie ahead. The prize awaiting us is the incorruptible crown of life, righteousness, and glory that will never fade away.
