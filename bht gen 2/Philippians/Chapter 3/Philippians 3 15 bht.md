# Philippians 3:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let us, as believers who are fully mature and established in our faith, be single-minded and wholeheartedly devoted to pursuing the prize of knowing Christ. Though we have not yet attained absolute perfection, we strive to be like-minded with the apostle Paul, considering all earthly things as loss compared to the surpassing worth of knowing Jesus. For those who are not yet fully mature, God will reveal His truth and correct any errors or misconceptions in His own timing.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "As many of us then, as are perfect," that is, fully grown (no longer "babes") in the Christian life, fully established in things of God.
2. "He who thinks that he has attained everything, hath nothing."
3. "Paul taught externally God 'reveals' the truth internally by His Spirit."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It can hardly be supposed that the apostle would address them as already perfect, when he had just said of himself that lie had not attained to that state."
2. "Be thus minded - That is, be united in the effort to obtain the prize, and to become entirely perfect."
3. "He will correct your erroneous opinions, and disclose to you the importance of making this effort for the prize."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A somewhat similar figure occurs 1 Timothy 1:6; 1 Timothy 6:21; 2 Timothy 2:18, in the verb ajstocew to miss the aim or the shot. A. V., swerved and erred."
2. "Be temperate as God 's athlete. The prize is incorruption and eternal life."
3. "He that runs looks not at the spectators, but at the prize. Whether they be rich or poor, if one mock them, applaud them, insult them, throw stones at them - if one plunder their house, if they see children or wife or anything whatsoever - the runner is not turned aside, but is concerned only with his running and winning the prize."

### John Calvin:
1. "That it is a rule which all that are perfect ought to follow."
2. "Where now will be that state of perfection which monks dream of — where the confused medley of such contrivances — where, in short, the whole system of Popery, which is nothing else than an imaginary perfection, that has nothing in common with this rule of Paul?"
3. "Let us...learn...that we must bear for a time with ignorance in our weak brethren, and forgive them, if it is not given them immediately to be altogether of one mind with us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Christian is to set before himself the highest ideal, and to be ever striving after it."
2. "To be thus minded is to have the right mind; so by otherwise minded we must understand ‘being in error.’"
3. "The light which they already enjoy is the gift of God, As therefore He has given this, so will He also supply more to those who live according to what they now have."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Here the term τελειο means relative perfection, not the absolute perfection so pointedly denied in verse Philippians 3:12."
2. "Let us keep on thinking this, viz. that we have not yet attained absolute perfection."
3. "He turns such cases over to God. What else can he do with them?"

### John Gill:
1. "Not absolutely, but comparatively, with respect to other believers, in a lower class of knowledge and experience...be thus minded; as the apostle was, to count what were gain to him, loss for Christ; to reckon all things but loss and dung, for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ..." 
2. "...to attain to such a state, and yet to disclaim all perfection, and acknowledge their imperfection..."
3. "Such errors will be made manifest sooner or later; the day will declare them, and such wood, hay, and stubble, will be burnt up by the fire, which will reveal every man's work."

### John Wesley:
1. "Let us, as many as are perfect — Fit for the race, strong in faith; so it means here."
2. "Be thus minded — Apply wholly to this one thing."
3. "And if in anything ye — Who are not perfect, who are weak in faith. Be otherwise minded — Pursuing other things. God, if ye desire it, shall reveal even this unto you - Will convince you of it."
