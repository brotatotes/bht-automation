# Philippians 3:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let us not allow our differing understandings to cause division among us. Instead, let us focus on the common ground we share and continue to walk together on the same path. As we progress in our Christian journey, let us hold on to the knowledge and truth we have already attained. Let us imitate the example set before us and strive for unity and love, even in our differences. May we seek to teach and learn from one another with gentleness and trust that God will reveal His truth to each of us in His perfect timing.
