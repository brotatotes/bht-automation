# Philippians 3:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle encourages believers to imitate his example, but not in a way that exalts himself above others or promotes division. Rather, he desires that all believers join together in imitating him, striving to outdo one another in their zeal for following Christ. They are to keep their eyes on him as the goal and avoid selfish ambition. Ministers should serve as examples to the flock, guiding them by their conduct. True Christian imitation is not about elevating individuals, but conforming to the purity and holiness exemplified by Christ.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Fellow-imitators' would be the literal rendering of the noun in this clause, and it intimates that the apostle desires every one of the Philippians to join in this imitation; and not only so, but to vie with one another in their zeal in doing so..."
2. "Just as to the Romans (Romans 16:17) he counsels that they should mark them that cause divisions for avoidance, so the apostle and those like him are to be looked at for imitation."
3. "It is possible to take the clause as equivalent to 'which so walk as I walk, according as ye have,' etc., or 'which walk in such wise as ye have us for an example; but the former seems to suit the Greek best."

2. "and he would therefore have these Philippians followers of him, "together" with them; and which contains in it an encouraging reason, or argument, since others were followers of him."
3. "believers should be ensamples one to another, especially ministers of the word; pastors of churches are not to be lords over God's heritage, but to be ensamples to the flock."

### John Wesley:
1. Mark them â€” For your imitation.
