# Philippians 3:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Beware of those who falsely claim to be Christians while living lives of comfort and indulgence. These individuals are in direct opposition to the message of the cross. They prioritize earthly matters rather than the higher calling of Christ. Their actions are a stumbling block to others and a discredit to the gospel. We must not be swayed by their empty profession of faith, but instead seek to live lives that truly reflect the transformative power of the cross.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And so Chrys., ἐπειδή τινες ἦσαν ὑποκρινόμενοι μὲν τὸν χριστιανισμόν , ἐν ἀνέσει δὲ ζῶντες κ . τρυφῇ · τοῦτο δὲ ἐναντίον τῷ σταυρῷ" (reason for σκοπεῖτε κ . τ . λ . in the form of warning against others who walk differently)
2. "The enemies (the article designates the particular class intended) of the cross of Christ..." (the enemies of the cross of Christ)
3. "Who regard (it is not easy to give φρονεῖν , φρόνημα , in this sense, by one word in English. They betoken the whole aspect, the set of the thoughts and desires: τὰ ἐπίγεια , are the substratum of all their feelings) the things on earth" (those who regard the things on earth)

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Follow not evildoers, because they are 'many' [...] Their numbers are rather a presumption against their being Christ's 'little flock'."
2. "A hard tone in speaking of the inconsistencies of professors is the very opposite of Paul's spirit, and David's, and Jeremiah's."
3. "The Lord and His apostles, at the same time, speak more strongly against empty professors (as the Pharisees), than against open scoffers."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He who loves religion will weep over the inconsistencies of its friends; he who does not, will exult and triumph."
2. "An immoral life is enmity to the cross of Christ; for he died to make us holy."
3. "It is not by infidels, and scoffers, and blasphemers, so much, that injury is done to the cause of religion; it is by the unholy lives of its professed friends."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "No word is supplied describing the character of their walk..."
2. "This and Judaic formalism were the two prominent errors in the Philippian church."

### John Calvin:
1. "Many walk who mind earthly things, meaning by this, that there are many who creep upon the ground, not feeling the power of God's kingdom."
2. "Being desirous exclusively of their own honor, ease, and gain, they had no regard to the edification of the Church."
3. "I understand it, however, in a more general way, as meaning that, while they pretended to be friends, they were, nevertheless, the worst enemies of the gospel."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Their wicked character is shown in its fuller development in such Epistles as 2 Peter and Jude."
2. "Tears that are shed for the evil which these men will work, and also for the fate which is in store for such offenders."
3. "Such men are the greatest adversaries to the Christian cause... They lead astray the weak by the tempting promises of liberty, which appeal so powerfully to the carnal part of man... Thus their injury operates in two ways, within and without the Church."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Even weeping. Deep emotion as he dictated the letter and recalled these recreant followers of Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "the road both of profaneness and error is a broad one, and many walk therein, which makes it the more dangerous"
