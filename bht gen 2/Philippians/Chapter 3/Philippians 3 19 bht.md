# Philippians 3:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who are doomed to destruction will ultimately meet their end, a fate that should be regarded with great horror. Their downfall is a result of their misplaced devotion, for they have made their own desires their god, finding their greatest satisfaction in the pursuit of sensual pleasures. Their minds are fixed on earthly things, constantly seeking and pursuing worldly desires instead of focusing on the things of God. This serves as a cautionary reminder to prioritize heavenly treasures and spiritual pursuits rather than being consumed by the transient pleasures of this world.
