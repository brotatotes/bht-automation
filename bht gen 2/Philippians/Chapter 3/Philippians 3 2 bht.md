# Philippians 3:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Beware of those impure and unchaste individuals, the dogs, who not only indulge in filthiness but also snarl like enemies of the cross. These evil workmen, disguised as teachers of the Gospel, are actually working for evil. They have lost sight of the true meaning of circumcision, reducing it to a mere cutting of the flesh that threatens to harm the church. These dogs, who were once considered unclean, are now using their influence and causing division within the Church. Let us be cautious of them and their harmful teachings.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Observe, with a view to avoid."
2. "Profane, impure persons. The appellation occurs in various references; but in the Jewish usage of it, uncleanness was the prominent idea."
3. "By ἐργάτας, he seems to point out persons who actually wrought, and professedly for the Gospel, but who were 'evil workmen,' not mere 'evil-doers.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Beware... of dogs, namely, those impure persons... dogs in filthiness, unchastity, and snarling... especially 'enemies of the cross of Christ.'"
2. "Not simply 'evildoers' are meant, but men who 'worked,' indeed, ostensibly for the Gospel, but worked for evil... 'The evil workmen,' that is, bad teachers."
3. "Circumcision had now lost its spiritual significance... Christians have the only true circumcision, namely, that of the heart; legalists have only 'concision,' that is, the cutting off of the flesh... What these legalists are virtually doing in violation of the law."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They are held as unclean, and to call one a dog is a much stronger expression of contempt there than with us."
2. "The strong language which the apostle uses here, shows the sense which he had of the danger arising from their influence."
3. "The meaning of the whole is, that they did not understand the true nature of the doctrine of circumcision, but that with them it was a mere cutting of the flesh, and tended to destroy the church."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Dogs was a term of reproach among both Greeks and Jews. Homer uses it of both women and men, implying shamelessness in the one, and recklessness in the other."
2. "Being unclean animals, dogs were used to denote what was unholy or profane."
3. "The noun here is a play upon peritomh circumcision. It means mutilation. Paul bitterly characterizes those who were not of the true circumcision as merely mutilated."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Beware of the dogs. The word signifies ‘Look out,’ and would rather seem to imply that these teachers were not yet at Philippi, but might come, and so the apostle bids them ‘watch.’"
2. "To the Eastern mind, nothing could express greater contempt than the name ‘dog,’ and there can be little doubt that this feeling was in the apostle’s mind towards such false teachers."
3. "But in this word there may also be an allusion to the severance or cutting asunder in the church which such teachers were sure to cause. They were not only mutilators of the body, but also of the body of Christ, the Church."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Beware (βλεπετε). Three times for urgency and with different epithet for the Judaizers each time."
2. "The Jews so termed the Gentiles which Jesus uses in a playful mood (κυναριοις, little dogs) to the Syro-Phoenician woman (Matthew 15:26). Paul here turns the phrase on the Judaizers themselves."
3. "He had already called the Judaizers 'deceitful workers' (εργατα δολιο) in 2 Corinthians 11:13."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle calls them so, because they returned to Judaism, as the dog to its vomit."
2. "Likewise, they may be styled dogs for their covetousness, being such greedy ones."
3. "Beware of the concision; the men of the circumcision... whereby they made sad divisions, and cutting work among the churches."

### John Wesley:
1. "Beware of dogs — Unclean, unholy, rapacious men."
2. "The title which the Jews usually gave the gentiles, he returns upon themselves."
3. "The apostle will not call them the circumcision, but coins a term on purpose."
