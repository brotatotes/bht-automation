# Philippians 3:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Christ comes again, He will transform our lowly, mortal bodies into glorious, immortal ones. Our earthly bodies, filled with weakness and corruption, will be remade into a state of perfection and beauty. They will surpass the glory of the heavens and shine brighter than the stars. These transformed bodies will resemble the magnificent body that Christ Himself possesses in His heavenly kingdom. As believers, we eagerly anticipate this resurrection and look forward to the day when we will join Christ in His glorious kingdom.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The change from the dust of death in the resurrection, however we may accommodate the expression to it, was not originally contemplated by it; witness the ἀπεκδεχόμεθα, and the σῶμα τῆς ταπεινώσεως ἡμῶν."
2. "The body is that object, that material, in which our humiliation has place and is shewn, by its suffering and being degraded."
3. "He once had such a ταπείνωσις, and has passed through it to His glory and He shall change us so as to be like Him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Who shall transfigure the body of our humiliation, that it may be conformed unto the body of His glory."
2. "Not only shall He come as our 'Saviour,' but also as our Glorifier."
3. "Our spiritual resurrection now is the pledge of our bodily resurrection to glory hereafter."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word thus indicates a change in what is outward and shifting - the body. Rev., correctly, shall fashion anew."
2. "Render, as Rev., the body of our humiliation. The A. V. seems to countenance the stoic contempt of the body."
3. "Conformed for fashioned like. Fashion belongs to the preceding verb. As the body of Christ's glory is a spiritual body, this word is appropriate to describe a conformation to what is more essential, permanent, and characteristic."

### John Calvin:
1. "This body which we carry about with us is not an everlasting abode, but a frail tabernacle, which will in a short time be reduced to nothing."
2. "There is no part of us that ought not to aspire after heaven with undivided affection."
3. "Paul places before our eyes the boundless power of God, that it may entirely remove all doubt."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He shall change our body... Its corruption shall become incorruption; its dishonour, glory; its weakness, power, and from natural it shall become spiritual."
2. "The body is called 'the body of our humiliation'... The body of man was at first, like the rest of God’s creation, made very good, and by the change, the new fashioning, of the Saviour, we look for God’s image to be restored in it."
3. "The fleeting fashion of the body shall be done away, its essential form shall remain, and be like unto Christ in His glory."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The body of our state of humiliation will be made suitable to associate with the body of Christ's glory."
2. "If anyone doubts the power of Christ to do this transformation, Paul replies that he has power 'even to subject all things unto himself.'"

### John Gill:
1. "This vile body, in the resurrection morn, shall be stripped of all its vileness, baseness, and meanness."
2. "Their beauty and glory will be greater than that, it will be like the glory of the second Adam, the Lord from heaven, whose image they shall then bear."
3. "And now who would but follow such persons, who are citizens of heaven, have their conversation there, look for Christ the Savior from thence, who when he comes will raise the dead in Christ first."

### John Wesley:
1. "Who will transform our vile body — Into the most perfect state, and the most beauteous form."
2. "It will then be purer than the unspotted firmament, brighter than the lustre of the stars."
3. "Like that wonderfully glorious body which he wears in his heavenly kingdom, and on his triumphant throne."
