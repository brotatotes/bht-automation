# Philippians 3:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:

1. "My glorying, indeed, is placed in Christ, but, were it warrantable to glory in the flesh, I have also no want of materials."
2. "Let us not allow them to triumph over Christ by an unseemly boasting, without retorting upon them also our grounds of glorying, that they may understand that it is not through envy that we reckon of no value, nay, even voluntarily renounce those things on which they set the highest value."
3. "Not satisfied with putting himself on a level with any one of them, he even gives himself the preference to them. Hence he cannot on this account be suspected, as though he were envious of their excellence, and extolled Christ with the view of making his own deficiencies appear the less inconsiderable."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He mentions this that he may bring out into stronger contrast the small value (or rather no-value) which he sets on outward position and observances."
