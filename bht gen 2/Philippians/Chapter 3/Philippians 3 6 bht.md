# Philippians 3:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle's zeal for what he believed to be true religion led him to relentlessly persecute those he considered to be in error. He was so fervent in his pursuit of the traditional Jewish law and customs that he became a ringleader in the persecution of the early Christians. In his pursuit of legal perfection, he considered himself blameless, adhering strictly to external observances prescribed by the Law. However, he later realized that this righteousness was incomplete and that he had not yet attained perfection.
