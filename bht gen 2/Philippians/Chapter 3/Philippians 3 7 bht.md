# Philippians 3:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul, the author of this letter, reflects on his past beliefs and accomplishments and states that he now considers them as worthless compared to the value of knowing Christ. He acknowledges that these things were once his source of pride and confidence. However, he now views them as loss because he recognizes that nothing can compare to the worth of having a relationship with Christ.
