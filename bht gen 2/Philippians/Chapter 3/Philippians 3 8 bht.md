# Philippians 3:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The writer emphasizes that the knowledge of Christ is so superior to anything else that it surpasses everything in worth. They are willing to sacrifice anything and everything in order to gain Christ. This includes losing all worldly possessions, refraining from relying on external religious acts, and renouncing any righteousness based on human effort or law. It is through faith in Christ that true righteousness is attained, a righteousness that comes from God. Therefore, the believer can consider all other things as loss in comparison to the incomparable value of knowing Christ.
