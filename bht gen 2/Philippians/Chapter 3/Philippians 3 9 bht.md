# Philippians 3:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle reflects on his personal journey of faith, acknowledging that his salvation rests solely in being united with Christ. He renounces any form of righteousness derived from his own efforts or adherence to the law. Instead, he embraces the righteousness that comes from God, received through faith. This righteousness is not based on external obedience but is an inward transformation that can be found only in Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Once lost, I have been 'found,' and I hope to be perfectly 'found' by Him."
2. "Paul was transported from legal bondage into Christian freedom at once, and without any gradual transition."
3. "The righteousness of faith, in Paul's sense, is the righteousness or perfect holiness of Christ appropriated by faith, as the objective ground of confidence for the believer."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "And be found in him - That is, united to him by a living faith. The idea is, that when the investigations of the great day should take place in regard to the ground of salvation, it might be found that he was united to the Redeemer and depended solely on his merits for salvation."
2. "Not having mine own righteousness - That is, not relying on that for salvation. This was now the great aim of Paul, that it might be found at last that he was not trusting to his own merits, but to those of the Lord Jesus."
3. "But that which is through the faith of Christ - That justification which is obtained by believing on the Lord Jesus Christ; see at Romans 1:17, note; Romans 3:24, note; Romans 4:5, note. Righteousness which is of God by faith - Which proceeds from God, or of which he is the great source and fountain."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The A. V. would require the article with ejmhn mine, and assumes the existence of a personal righteousness; whereas Paul says, not having any righteousness which can be called mine."
2. "Rev., better, even that which is of the law; thus bringing out the force of the article which defines the character of that righteousness which alone could be personal, viz., righteousness consisting in the strict fulfillment of the law."
3. "The change of prepositions, through [δια] faith, and of [εκ] the law, as turning on the distinction between faith represented as the medium, and the law as the source of justification."

### John Calvin:
1. "For here that saying is admirably in point — 'I had been lost, if I had not been lost.'"
2. "He, accordingly, shows more fully, how great the riches of Christ, because we obtain and find all things in him."
3. "Hence there are two things that are to be observed here. In the first place, that the righteousness of the law must be given up and renounced, that you may be righteous through faith; and secondly, that the righteousness of faith comes forth from God, and does not belong to the individual."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In this way the finding would refer to the union with Christ, both in time and in eternity."
2. "The righteousness here spoken of is described as proceeding out of the law, that is, from the perfect observance thereof."
3. "Here is a different kind of righteousness. It is not derived from what man can do, as in observance of the law, but comes to men through their belief in the incarnation and sacrifice of Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Be found in him (ευρεθω εν αυτω)."
2. "At death (2 Corinthians 5:3) or when Christ comes."
3. "Explained further by επ τη πιστε (on the basis of faith) as in Acts 3:16."

### John Gill:
1. "and may find in him"; and thinks the sense is, that the apostle renounced all things for Christ, that he might recover all in him.
2. "be in him", as the Ethiopic version renders it; so the word found is used in Galatians 2:17 Philippians 2:8; and he means not a nominal being in Christ, or a being in him by profession, but a real one.
3. he did not desire to "have", and to be found in; not but that he desired to live soberly and righteously, to have, and do works of righteousness, but not depend on them; he would not have, and account this his moral righteousness, as a justifying one.

### John Wesley:
1. "Not having my own righteousness, which is of the law - That merely outward righteousness prescribed by the law, and performed by my own strength."
2. "But that inward righteousness which is through faith - Which can flow from no other fountain."
3. "The righteousness which is from God — From his almighty Spirit, not by my own strength, but by faith alone."
