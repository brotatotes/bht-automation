# Philippians 4:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the early days of the gospel, when it was first preached at Philippi, the believers there showed their gratitude and generosity. They were not only willing to give, but also to receive. No other church had such a close partnership with Paul in this act of giving and receiving. This kind of transaction is often described as trading and commerce, highlighting the mutual exchange between Paul and the Philippians.
