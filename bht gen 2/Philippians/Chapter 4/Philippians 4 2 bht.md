Euodia and Syntyche are mentioned here, suggesting that they may have been deaconesses of the church who were experiencing a disagreement or separation. The apostle entreats them to be reconciled to one another, emphasizing the need for unity and harmony among believers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Euodia and Syntyche...appear to have needed this exhortation on account of some disagreement...The repetition of the verb παρακαλῶ not merely signifies ‘vehementiam affectus’ (Erasm.), but hints at the present separation between them." 
2. "τὸ αὐτὸ φρονεῖν...He adds  ἐν κυρίῳ , both to shew them wherein their unanimity must consist, and perhaps to point out to them that their present alienation was not ἐν κυρίῳ ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Euodia and Syntyche were two women who seem to have been at variance; probably deaconesses of the church."
2. "He repeats, 'I beseech,' as if he would admonish each separately, and with the utmost impartiality."
3. "In the Lord—the true element of Christian union; for those 'in the Lord' by faith to be at variance, is an utter inconsistency."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There was some disagreement between them, and the apostle entreats them to be reconciled to each other."
2. "That they be of the same mind - That they be united, or reconciled."
3. "In their Christian walk and plans...to bury all their petty differences and animosities."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "According to the Tex. Rec., with the long o, the name means fragrance; but the correct reading is with the short o, the meaning being prosperous journey."
2. "In Macedonia, monuments were erected to women by public bodies, and in Macedonian inscriptions records of male proper names are found formed on the mother's name instead of the father's."
3. "To be of the same mind. The same expression as in ch Philippians 2:2, see note. Compare Romans 12:16."

### John Calvin:
1. "He assigns to them so much honor as to call them fellow-soldiers in the gospel."
2. "Whenever he speaks of agreement, he adds also the bond of it - in the Lord."
3. "Nothing is so disjoined, but that it ought to be reunited in Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Euodia was one of those godly women of which the early church made much use, and who in this case were worthy to be called ‘fellow-strugglers’ with St. Paul for the cause of Christ’s Gospel."
2. "These two may have been forming parties in the church, and have been regarded as leaders by favourers of one opinion or the other."
3. "If then, remembering this, they seek to their Master for aid, the unity of spirit will be bestowed. When believers fix their gaze on Christ, the smaller concerns...sink down to their proper level, far below the life in Christ, and are seen not to be worthy of consideration."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Euodia (Ευοδιαν). This name means literally 'prosperous journey' (ευ, οδος). It occurs in the inscriptions." 
2. "Syntyche (Συντυχην). From συντυγχανω, to meet with and so 'pleasant acquaintance' or 'good-luck.' Occurs in the inscriptions and identified with Lydia by some."
3. "Schinz suggests that in such a pure church even slight bickerings would make a real disturbance."

### John Gill:
1. "It becomes a very hard and difficult task to reconcile them, though as here entreated in the most tender and importunate manner to agree."
2. "That they be of the same mind in the Lord; either that they agree together, and be reconciled to each other, considering the relation they stood in to one another, and to the Lord."
3. "That they become of the same mind, and embrace the same truths, and profess and maintain the same principles the church did."

### John Wesley:
1. I beseech — He repeats this twice, as if speaking to each face to face, and that with the utmost tenderness.
