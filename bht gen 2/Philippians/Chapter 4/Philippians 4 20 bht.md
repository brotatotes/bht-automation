## BHT:
In light of all the blessings and provisions that we receive from God, may all glory be given to Him forever and ever. Let us acknowledge that everything good in our lives, both now and in the future, comes from His grace and favor.

Therefore, let us praise Him and express our gratitude for every gift that we receive, recognizing that it is all His doing and not our own merit.
