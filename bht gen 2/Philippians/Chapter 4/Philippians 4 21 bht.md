# Philippians 4:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Salute every believer in Christ Jesus, whether they are esteemed highly or widely known, for each one holds a special place in the body of Christ. The companions of Paul, including Timothy, Epaphras, Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, and Lucas, send their greetings as well, reminding us of the unity and diversity within the Christian community. It is worth noting that while the power and fame of Nero and other Caesars wane, the influence and legacy of Paul, an obscure prisoner, continue to rise, demonstrating the eternal impact of the gospel.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The singular has love and affection, and should not be lost as in Conyb., ‘Salute all God’s people.’"
2. "ἐν χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ belongs more probably to ἀσπάσασθε, see Romans 16:22; 1 Corinthians 16:19, than to ἅγιον, as in ch. Philippians 1:1, where, as Meyer observes, the expression has a diplomatic formality, whereas here there is no reason for so formal an adjunct."
3. "These must, on account of the next verse, have been his closer friends, perhaps his colleagues in the ministry, such as Aristarchus, Epaphras, Demas, Timotheus."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Salute every saint—individually."
2. "The brethren which are with me—Perhaps Jewish believers are meant."
3. "He had only one close friend with him, namely, Timothy."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Salute every saint in Christ Jesus - It was usual for him also to close his epistles with affectionate salutations to various members of the churches to which he wrote."
2. "These salutations are generally specific, and mention the names, particularly if prominent members of the churches."
3. "The brethren which are with me... The word 'brethren' here probably refers to ministers that were with Paul as the 'saints' in general are mentioned in the next verse."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To none of these would he be deemed a stranger, and so he includes them all in the final salutation which specially belongs to the church as a whole."
2. "The persons who send it are the immediate companions and fellow-travellers of St. Paul, who would probably be known to some persons in Philippi, especially to those at the head of the church."
3. "Among the number of the brethren we may probably include (besides Timothy) Luke, Aristarchus, Tychicus, and Epaphras; Philemon also, with John Mark, might be now among the number."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Christianity has begun to undermine the throne of the Caesars. Some day a Christian will sit on this throne. The gospel works upward from the lower classes." 
2. "This obscure prisoner who has planted the gospel in Caesar's household has won more eternal fame and power than all the Caesars combined." 
3. "Nero will commit suicide shortly after Paul has been executed. Nero's star went down and Paul's rose and rises still."

### John Gill:
1. "Salute every saint in Christ Jesus,.... Meaning at Philippi, whether rich or poor, lesser or greater believers, common saints, as well as the officers of the church, bishops and deacons; who were in Christ by electing grace, and as their covenant head, and representative from everlasting, and which was manifested and made known by their conversion and the effectual calling." 
2. "The brethren which are with me greet you; such as Timothy; see Philippians 2:19; and Epaphras, Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, and Lucas; see Philemon 1:23." 
3. "He makes no mention of Peter anywhere when he writes from Rome or to it, which shows he was not there then, or a bishop of that place, as the Papists say."
