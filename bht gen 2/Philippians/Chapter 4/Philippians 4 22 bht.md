# Philippians 4:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
From the grace of God, even in the midst of a wicked and debauched court, Christ was made known to some in Caesar's household. Though we do not know who specifically, it is a testament to God's mercy that the gospel reached even the darkest places. While there may be speculations about individuals like Seneca, there is no solid foundation to support them. However, it is worth noting that Torpes and Evellius, who both suffered martyrdom under Nero, are mentioned as possible converts.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "These perhaps were slaves belonging to the familia of Nero, who had been converted by intercourse with St. Paul, probably at this time a prisoner in the prætorian barracks."
2. "This is much more likely, than that any of the actual family of Nero should have embraced Christianity."
3. "The hint which Chrys., al., find here, εἰ γὰρ οἱ ἐν τοῖς βασιλείοις πάντων κατεφρόνησαν διὰ τὸν βασιλέα τῶν οὐρανῶν, πολλῷ μᾶλλον αὐτοὺς χρὴ τοῦτο ποιεῖν, is alien from the simplicity of the close of an Epistle."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "They that are of Cæsar's household—the slaves and dependents of Nero who had been probably converted through Paul's teaching while he was a prisoner in the Prætorian barrack attached to the palace."
2. "Philippi was a Roman 'colony,' hence there might arise a tie between the citizens of the mother city and those of the colony; especially between those of both cities who were Christians, converted as many of them were by the same apostle, and under like circumstances, he having been imprisoned at Philippi, as he now is at Rome."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "No individuals are specified, perhaps because none of the Christians at Rome were personally known to the church at Philippi."
2. "There was a generous warmth in the newness of the Christian affection - the first ardor of love; and the common trials to which they were exposed would serve to bind them closely together."
3. "The phrase used here - 'the household of Caesar' - may refer to the relatives of the emperor... or to some of the officers of the court that were more particularly employed around his person."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Of Caesar's household. Probably the slaves and freedmen attached to the palace. 

### John Calvin:
1. "It is no common evidence of divine mercy, that the gospel had made its way into that sink of all crimes and iniquities."
2. "It is also the more to be admired, in proportion as it is a rare thing for holiness to reign in the courts of sovereigns."
3. "The conjecture formed by some, that Seneca is here referred to among others, has no appearance of foundation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Though unknown, they were now brethren in Christ, and so could not be without interest in one another."
2. "The reason why they specially send a salutation may be that they, more than any others, had heard of all the love which the Philippians felt toward the apostle, and had beheld, in the zeal and affection of Epaphroditus, a manifestation of the regard in which he was held by them."
3. "These converts, brought into closest communion with St. Paul, would have a special desire to show their sense of what had been done to give consolation to an affliction, which themselves would see, but could do little to lighten."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ was made known to some there likewise; though Nero, the then reigning emperor, was a very wicked prince, and his court a very debauched one, yet the grace of God reached some there."
2. "Who these were cannot be said; as for the conjecture that Seneca the philosopher, Nero's master, was one of them, it is without foundation."
3. "Torpes, a man in great favour and dignity in Nero's court, and Evellius his counsellor, who both suffered martyrdom under him, according to the Roman martyrology, are also mentioned."
