# Philippians 4:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul appeals to his fellow worker, likely Silas, who had been a true partner in his ministry. He urges him to assist the women, including Euodia and Syntyche, who had labored diligently alongside him, enduring hardship for the sake of the Gospel. These women needed help in reconciling their differences and receiving guidance in the teachings of the Gospel. Though their names are not specifically mentioned here, Paul assures that their names are written in the book of life, a record of all believers, akin to the roster of athletes at the Olympic games.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "γνήσιε σύνζυγε": true (‘genuine:’ true, as distinguished from counterfeit: lit. of legitimate worth (γενήσιος)) yoke-fellow. 
2. "συνλαμβάνου αὐταῖς": help them (Euodia and Syntyche): but not, as Grot., ‘ut habeant, unde se suosque honeste sustentent:’ it is the work of their reconciliation which he clearly has in view and in which they would need help.
3. "μετὰ καὶ Κλήμεντος": as did Clemens also &c.’ q. d. ‘not that I mean, by naming those women with distinction, to imply forgetfulness of those others &c., and especially of Clemens.’

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Yoke-fellow—yoked with me in the same Gospel yoke."
2. "Help them, namely, Euodia and Syntyche. Co-operate with them."
3. "Euodia and Syntyche were doubtless two of 'the women who resorted to the riverside, where prayer was wont to be made,' and being early converted, would naturally take an active part in teaching other women called at a later period."
4. "Clement—bishop of Rome shortly after the death of Peter and Paul."
5. "In the book of life—the register-book of those whose 'citizenship is in heaven.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The term 'yoke-fellow' - συζυγος suzugos - some have understood as a proper name (Syzygus); but the proper import of the word is yoke-fellow, and there is no reason to believe that it is used here to denote a proper name."
2. "The reference seems rather to be to influential females who had rendered important assistance to Paul when he was there. The kind of 'help' which was to be imparted was probably by counsel, and friendly cooperation in the duties which they were called to perform."
3. "The phrase 'the book of life,' which occurs here, and in Revelation 3:5; Revelation 13:8; Revelation 20:12, Revelation 20:15; Revelation 21:27; Revelation 22:19, is a Jewish phrase, and refers originally to a record or catalogue of names, as the roll of an army. It then means to be among the living, as the name of an individual would be erased from a catalog when he was deceased."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "For true, see on naturally, ch. 2:20. It is supposed by some that the word rendered yoke-fellow is a proper name, Synzygus, and that true is to be explained as rightly so called."
2. "Help [συλλαμβανου]. Lit., take hold with. Compare Luke 5:7. The verb is used of conception, Luke 1:24; arrest, Matthew 26:55; Acts 12:3; catching, as fish, Luke 5:9."
3. "Clement. Supposed by some to be Clement the Bishop of Rome. Origen identifies them, saying: 'Clement to whom Paul bears Testimony in Philippians 4:3.' So also Eusebius, Epiphanius, and Jerome. Chrysostom speaks of Clement as the constant companion of Paul in all his travels."

### John Calvin:
1. "Now, what is that condition but celibacy?"
2. "The book of life is the roll of the righteous, who are predestinated to life..."
3. "It belongs, it is true, to God alone now to know them that are his, and to separate at least the lambs from the kids; but it is our part to reckon in charity all to be lambs who, in a spirit of obedience, submit themselves to Christ as their Shepherd."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Here St. Paul addresses some man whose influence was likely to have weight in bringing about peace and unity in the Philippian sisterhood."
2. "These women, like the apostle, had entered on the heavenward struggle, and like him were zealous that the Gospel should be spread abroad."
3. "The conception is of God’s record of all those who are striving to serve Him. It is clear from the language of St. John that the names were not considered to be written there unchangeably, but if found unworthy to continue, they might be blotted out."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "After all it matters little that we do not know who the peacemaker was."
2. "‘Take hold with them.’ They laboured with me."
3. "Hence real Christians in spite of their bickerings."

### John Gill:
1. "Not his wife, as some think, for he had none...it is not likely that he should marry a wife within this compass of time."
2. "the apostle, true 'Syzygus', signifying that as was his name, so was he, really and in truth, a companion and fellow labourer."
3. "help those women...either by composing their differences, or by assisting them with good counsel and advice; and giving them proper instructions in the doctrines of the Gospel."

### John Wesley:
1. "And I entreat thee also, true yokefellow... In this number was Barnabas... Silas, whom he probably addresses here; for Silas had been his yokefellow at the very place." 
2. "Help those women who laboured together with me... but danger and toil endured for the sake of the gospel." 
3. "Whose names, although not set down here, are in the book of life - As are those of all believers. An allusion to the wrestlers in the Olympic games, whose names were all enrolled in a book."
