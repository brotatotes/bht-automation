# Philippians 4:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Rejoice in the Lord always, despite the difficulties and trials that come your way. This constant call to joy is a recurring theme in the Bible, highlighting the privilege of Christians to continually find joy in their relationship with God. It is not a fleeting or occasional happiness, but a deep and abiding joy that stems from knowing that God is with us, that His grace, righteousness, and love are everlasting and always available to us. In the face of discouragement and persecution, we can find solace in the unchanging joy that comes from our faith in Christ.
