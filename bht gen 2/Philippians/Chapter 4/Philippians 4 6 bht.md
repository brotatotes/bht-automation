# Philippians 4:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Be not anxious about anything, for care and prayer are mutually exclusive. We are not meant to be burdened by the things of this world, but rather find solace in pouring out our concerns in the bosom of God. In times of temptation, let us turn to prayer as a sacred refuge. Let thanksgiving be present in all forms of prayer, for it is through gratitude that we align our desires with the will of God. May we cast our worries upon Him, knowing that His power, providence, and faithfulness will carry us through.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "μηδέν has the emphasis. It is the accusative of the object, as τὸ πολλὰ μεριμνᾷν , Xen. Cyr. viii. 7. 12."
2. "ἐν παντί] in every thing: see ref. 1 Thess. and note. Meyer remarks that the literally correct rendering of the Vulg. 'in omni (neut.) oratione' led Ambrose wrong, who gives it 'per omnem orationem.'"
3. "τῇ προσευχῇ καὶ τῇ δεήσει] by your prayer and your supplication: or better, by the prayer and the supplication appropriate to each thing. On the difference between προσευχή and δέησις, see on Ephesians 6:18, 1 Timothy 2:1."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Be anxious about nothing." Care and prayer are as mutually opposed as fire and water.
2. Prayer for blessings; and the general term. Supplication, to avert ills; a special term, suppliant entreaty.
3. Thanksgiving gives effect to prayer and frees from anxious carefulness by making all God's dealings matter for praise, not merely for resignation, much less murmuring.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Be not anxious or solicitous about the things of the present life."
2. "There is nothing which pertains to body, mind, estate, friends, conflicts, losses, trials, hopes, fears, in reference to which we may not go and spread it all out before the Lord."
3. "We can always find something to be thankful for, no matter what may be the burden of our wants."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Be careful [μεριμνατε]."
2. "Prayer and supplication. General and special."
3. "Unto God [προς τον θεον]. The force of prov is rather in your intercourse with God."

### John Calvin:
1. "For we are not made of iron, so as not to be shaken by temptations. But this is our consolation, this is our solace — to deposit, or (to speak with greater propriety) to disburden in the bosom of God everything that harasses us."
2. "Whenever, therefore, we are assailed by any temptation, let us betake ourselves forthwith to prayer, as to a sacred asylum."
3. "Gratitude will have this effect upon us — that the will of God will be the grand sum of our desires."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The feeling which the apostle wishes to check is that undue care for the things of this life which puts this world and its concerns before the service of the Lord."
2. "In all things come to God, not merely in those which may be called strictly religious concerns, but whenever the over-anxiety is in danger of becoming too great."
3. "If troubles come, he must be thankful for the Father’s discipline, and strive to find out why they are sent; in joy, thanksgiving will surely come unbidden."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In nothing be anxious. Stop being anxious."  
2. "In all the forms of prayer here named thanksgiving should appear."

### John Gill:
1. "There are many things that saints are to be careful for, as men and Christians; they are to be careful of their bodies, as well as of their souls; of the health of them, which is to be preserved by all lawful means, and not exposed to unnecessary danger..."
2. "The carefulness the apostle speaks of, is an anxious solicitude for worldly things, an immoderate concern for the things of life, arising from diffidence, or negligence, of the power, providence, and faithfulness of God."
3. "In this manner therefore, at all times, upon every occasion, in a way of humble petition and supplication, joined with thankfulness for all favours, let your requests be made known to God; not to men; fly not to an arm of flesh, but to God, to him only..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Carefulness and prayer cannot stand together."
2. "They who by a preposterous shame or distrustful modesty, cover, stifle, or keep in their desires, as if they were either too small or too great, must be racked with care; from which they are entirely delivered, who pour them out with a free and filial confidence."
3. "The surest mark of a soul free from care, and of prayer joined with true resignation. This is always followed by peace. Peace and thanksgiving are both coupled together, Colossians 3:15."
