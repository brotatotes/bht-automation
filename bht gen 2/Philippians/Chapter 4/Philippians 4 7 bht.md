# Philippians 4:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If you lay everything before God in prayer with thanksgiving, the peace of God, a peace that surpasses all human reason, will keep your hearts and minds, like a sentinel guarding a city. This is not the peace that we find in the world, but a peace that comes from God alone. It is a peace that is beyond human comprehension and can only be received by those who believe in Christ Jesus. It is a peace that secures us in Christ, protecting us from condemnation, troubles, and anxieties, and brings a calm and heavenly repose to our souls.
