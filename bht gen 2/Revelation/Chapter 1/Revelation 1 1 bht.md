## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Albert Barnes:

### John Wesley:
1. "It is, as it were, a manifesto, wherein the Heir of all things declares that all power is given him in heaven and earth, and that he will in the end gloriously exercise that power, maugre all the opposition of all his enemies."
2. "In all its parts it has an admirable variety, with the most exact harmony, beautifully illustrated by those very digressions which seem to interrupt it. In this manner does it display the manifold wisdom of God shining in the economy of the church through so many ages."
3. "The things contained in this prophecy did begin to be accomplished shortly after it was given; and the whole might be said to come to pass shortly, in the same sense as St. Peter says, 'The end of all things is at hand;' and our Lord himself, 'Behold, I come quickly.'"
