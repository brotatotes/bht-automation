## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The fair meaning of the passage is, that he was at that time favored, in a large measure, with the influences of the Holy Spirit - the spirit of true devotion; that he had a high state of religious enjoyment, and was in a condition not inappropriate to the remarkable communications which were made to him on that day."
