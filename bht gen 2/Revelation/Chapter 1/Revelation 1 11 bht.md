# Revelation 1:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The seven churches mentioned in the book of Revelation were selected intentionally, representing different aspects of the Church's experience. Smyrna symbolized persecution, while Sardis represented spiritual stagnation despite its reputation. The churches of Sardis and Laodicea faced the danger of complacency due to a lack of opposition. These churches collectively represented the universal Church, and the messages applied individually to each of them. The command to write the visions was urgent, emphasizing their importance. The book containing these visions was sent to all the churches, meant to be read and copied for the benefit of all.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The churches selected are not taken at random, but have a many-sided completeness."
2. "Thus, on one side we have Smyrna, a Church exposed to persecutions unto death; on the other Sardis, having a high name for spiritual life and yet dead."
3. "Finally, Sardis and Laodicea without any active opposition to call forth their spiritual energies; a dangerous position, considering man's natural indolence."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I am Alpha and Omega - Revelation 1:8. The first and the last - An explanation of the terms Alpha and Omega."
2. "Write in a book - Make a fair record of it all; evidently meaning that he should describe things as they occurred, and implying that the vision would be held so long before the eye of his mind that he would be able to transfer it to the 'book.'"
3. "And send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia - The churches which are immediately designated, not implying that there were no other churches in Asia, but that there were particular reasons for sending it to these."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The command to write is so given in the original as to show that it is urgent and that it must be obeyed at once." 
2. "No reasonable doubt can be entertained that they represent the universal Church in all countries and ages."
3. "The character in which the Redeemer is presented to these seven churches consists of a summary of particulars which are afterwards applied separately to the seven churches in chaps. 2 and 3. But the summary represents Jesus as a whole; and the natural inference is, that the seven churches constitute a whole also."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The commission covers the whole series of visions which all grow out of this first vision of the Risen Christ." 
2. "The names of the seven churches of Revelation 1:4 are now given, and the particular message to each church comes in chapters 2 and 3 and in the same order, the geographical order going north from Ephesus, then east and south to Laodicea." 
3. "But apparently the whole book was to be read to each of the seven churches. It would probably also be copied at each church."

### John Gill:
1. "Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last....to excite the attention of John, and to give weight to what he said."
2. "What thou seest, write in a book; that it might remain, and be read of all men, and be profitable to the churches in the then present age, and in all future ones."
3. "After John had written in a book the account of all the visions that he saw, the whole was sent unto them, for their use and benefit."

### John Wesley:
1. "All the books of the New Testament were written by the will of God; but none were so expressly commanded to be written."
2. "The whole book was sent to them all."
3. "From Ephesus to Smyrna is forty-six English miles; from Smyrna to Pergamos, sixty-four; from Pergamos to Thyatira, forty-eight; from Thyatira to Sardis, thirty-three; from Sardis to Philadelphia, twenty-seven; from Philadelphia to Laodicea, about forty-two miles."
