# Revelation 1:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the voice spoke, the speaker turned around to see who was speaking, wanting to see the person behind the voice. In doing so, they beheld seven golden candlesticks, which represented the seven churches. These candlesticks, reminiscent of the lamps in the sanctuary, served the purpose of holding forth light. Just as the candlesticks spread light, the churches of Christ also serve as the bearers of the light of the Gospel, bringing illumination to both sinners and believers.
