# Revelation 1:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The figure described as a Son of man represents Christ, who, as a divine Person, took on the appearance of human nature. This vision is not of Christ's actual human form, but a symbolic representation. The high girdle worn by the figure signifies dignity, reminiscent of the high priest's attire. The use of the word χρυσαν emphasizes the glorious nature of Christ's appearance. His girdle, symbolizing faithfulness and righteousness as a King, truth as a prophet, and love as a priest, highlights the multifaceted nature of Christ's role.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I will not deny that the anarthrous use of this title may mark out less sharply our Lord himself than the use with the articles; but in N. T. Greek we should be no more justified in rendering υἱὸς ἀνθρώπου in such a connexion as this, 'a son of man,' than πνεῦμα θεοῦ, 'a spirit of God.'"
2. "The χιτὼν ποδήρης, vestis talaris, was a sign of high rank or office: 'sunt enim vestes pendulæ et laxæ, apud Persas imprimis, regum nobilium et sacerdotum insigne.'"
3. "Bengel, and after him Züllig and De Wette, suppose a distinction the girding round the loins betokening activity, while that round the breast is a sign of repose. But Hengst. well observes that this would hardly apply: for Christ is here in fulness of energy as ruler and orderer of His Church."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "His glorified form as man could be recognized by John, who had seen it at the Transfiguration."
2. "In :-, when He appears in heaven, His insignia undergo a corresponding change yet even there the rainbow reminds us of His everlasting covenant with them."
3. "The garment and girdle seem to be emblems of His priesthood. Aaron's robe and girdle were "for glory and beauty," and combined the insignia of royalty and priesthood, the characteristics of Christ's antitypical priesthood "after the order of Melchisedec."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This shows that the representation could not have been like that of the vision of Zechariah Zechariah 4:2, where the prophet sees ‘a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon.’"
2. "That it was the Saviour himself is apparent from Revelation 1:18."
3. "The allusion here, doubtless, is to a long, loose, flowing robe, such as was worn by kings."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In the midst of the seven golden candlesticks is One, not walking as in chap. Revelation 2:1, but standing, who is like unto a Son of man." 
2. "The Saviour’s garb, a garment down to the foot, was a long white linen garment reaching to the feet, and worn by priests, or by kings. It was thus not only a priestly but a royal robe."
3. "The Son of man, therefore, is not here at rest, but is engaged in discharging the functions, whatever they are, which belong to Him as a Priest forever. In this dress, we are to see the emblem of both kingly and priestly power."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The absence of the article here shows also (Charles) that the idea is not 'like the Son of man' for Christ is the Son of man. He is like 'a son of man,' but not a man." 
2. "High girding like this was a mark of dignity as of the high priest (Josephus, Ant. III. 7. 2)."
3. "Note also χρυσαν (vernacular Koine) rather than the old form, χρυσην."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ is manifestly designed, who, as a divine Person, appeared in a form like that individual human nature which was at his Father's right hand."
2. "He in a visionary way appears, not in that real human nature he assumed, but in a form like unto it, that being in heaven."
3. "Christ's girdle, as a King, is the girdle of faithfulness and righteousness, which is about his loins; and his girdle, as a prophet, is the girdle of truth; but, as a priest, it is the girdle of love."
