# Revelation 1:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The depiction of the Lord Jesus in this passage draws comparisons to the Ancient of Days from the book of Daniel. Both are described with white hair, symbolizing their eternal nature. The whiteness also represents purity, emphasizing Christ's sinless character. Additionally, the image of Christ's eyes as flames of fire symbolizes his omniscience, with penetrating insight into all things. This imagery portrays the transformative power of Christ's love, leading to genuine repentance in those who encounter it.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The whiteness signifies purity and glory, not as Aug [11] (Expos. ad Galat., c. 40, vol. iii. p. 2134: 'quia et Dominus non nisi ob antiquitatem veritatis in Apocalypsi albo capite apparuit'), Vitr., Stern, al., eternity, either here or in Dan 7:9)"
2. "His eyes as a flame of fire...representing perhaps, as Vitr., ‚Äúperspicaciam divin√¶ et pur√¶ mentis, omnia arcana pervadentis.‚Äù This may be, notwithstanding that Gabriel has eyes like lamps of fire in Daniel."
3. "The 'fiery eye,' among the sons of men, is indicative of energy and power of command: so also in the Son of man Himself."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "like white wool... signifying purity and glory."
2. "eyes... all-searching and penetrating like fire."
3. "implying consuming indignation against sin."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The first suggestion to the mind of the apostle being that of wool, and then the thought occurring of its extreme whiteness resembling snow - the purest white of which the mind conceives."

2. "White as snow." 
3. "In Daniel 7:9 the throne of the Ancient of Days is œÜŒªŒøŒæ œÄœÖœÅŒøœÇ, while in Daniel 10:6 the eyes of the Ancient of Days are ŒªŒ±ŒºœÄŒ±Œ¥ŒµœÇ œÄœÖœÅŒøœÇ (lamps of fire)."

### John Gill:
1. "These metaphors are expressive of the antiquity of Christ, who is the everlasting Father, and whose goings forth were of old, even from everlasting."
2. "His eyes [were] as a flame of fire: which may design the omniscience of Christ, which reaches to all persons, and things, and is very searching and penetrating."

### John Wesley:
