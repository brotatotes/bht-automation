# Revelation 1:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
His feet like fine brass, denoting his stability and strength, as well as the permanent and glorious nature of his presence. As if they burned in a furnace, symbolizing not only their refinement but also their enduring intensity. His voice, resonating like the sound of many waters, is both comforting to his followers and terrifying to his adversaries, overwhelming and overpowering in its deliverance.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Vulg. has aurichalcum (or ori- see Cic de Off. iii. 23. 12, Hor. de Art. poet. 202), the Syriac and Arethas, 'brass from Lebanon'."
2. "Still it appears somewhat strained to refer χαλκολίβανος or - ον to 'thus masculum:' for, granted that 'masculum' may betoken its purity and clearness, how is χάλκος accounted for, which looks more like a hint at hardness?"
3. "And this, considering that in the similar and model passage, Dan 10:6 LXX, we have χάλκος ἐξαστράπτων (as also in Eze 1:7), ib. Theod. χάλκος στίλβων (as also in Eze 40:3), and in Ezekiel 1:4; Ezekiel 1:27; Ezekiel 8:2, ἤλεκτρον, seems the most likely direction in which to find the meaning."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Glowing brass, as if they had been made fiery (red-hot) in a furnace."
2. "The feet of the priests were bare in ministering in the sanctuary. So our great High Priest here."
3. "As the Bridegroom's voice, so the bride's, Revelation 14:2; Revelation 19:6; Ezekiel 1:24, the cherubim, or redeemed creation. His voice, however, is here regarded in its terribleness to His foes."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word properly means 'white brass'...The metal referred to was undoubtedly a species of brass distinguished for its clearness or whiteness."
2. "Brass is a compound metal, composed of copper and zinc. The color varies much according to the different proportions of the various ingredients...The kind of metal here referred to, however, would seem to be some compound of brass - of a whitish and brilliant color."
3. "Anyone who has looked upon the dazzling and almost insupportable brilliancy of metal in a furnace, can form an idea of the image here presented."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Burnished brass. This word has so far been found nowhere else save here and Revelation 2:18. It is in reality an unknown metal." 
2. "As if it had been refined. Perfect passive participle of πυροω, old verb, to set on fire, to glow." 
3. "As the voice of many waters. So the voice of God in the Hebrew of Ezekiel 43:2. Repeated in Revelation 14:2; Revelation 19:6."

### John Gill:
1. "By which is meant...are permanent and glorious."
2. "either the power of Christ...and trampling upon his enemies."
3. "his voice as the sound of many waters;...very terrible and irresistible."

### John Wesley:
1. "His feet like fine brass - Denoting his stability and strength."
2. "As if they burned in a furnace - As if having been melted and refined, they were still red hot."
3. "His voice - To the comfort of his friends, and the terror of his enemies. As the voice of many waters - Roaring aloud, and bearing down all before them."
