# Revelation 1:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When faced with the overwhelming manifestation of God's glorious presence, fallen man is rendered senseless and unconscious. This is evident from the reaction of John, who was overpowered by the evidence of God's presence. However, even in the midst of such awe-inspiring manifestations, the assurance of our Redeemer's nearness is enough to calm our fears and bring peace to our souls. The touch of God's hand imparts strength, lifting us up and supporting us in His powerful embrace. His look may terrify, but His words strengthen us, reminding us not to fear.
