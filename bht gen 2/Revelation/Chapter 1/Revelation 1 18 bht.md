# Revelation 1:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, the one who possesses absolute being and immortality, experienced death but now lives eternally. Through His victory over death, He becomes the assurance of resurrection and eternal life for His people. He holds the keys of the unseen world and of death, indicating His authority over the invisible realm. This sovereignty and power of Christ serve to comfort and support those who look to Him for guidance and protection.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "To Him belongs absolute being, as contrasted with the relative being of the creature; others may share, He only hath immortality: being in essence, not by mere participation, immortal."
2. "His having passed through death as one of us, and now living in the infinite plenitude of life, reassures His people, since through Him death is the gate of resurrection to eternal life."
3. "I can release from the unseen world of spirits and from DEATH whom I will. Keys are emblems of authority, opening and shutting at will 'the gates of Hades'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I am he that liveth, and was dead - I was indeed once dead, but now I live, and shall continue to live forever."
2. "Behold, I am alive forevermore - I am to live forever. Death is no more to cut me down, and I am never again to slumber in the grave."
3. "And have the keys of hell and of death - To hold the key of this, was to hold the power over the invisible world. It was the more appropriate that the Saviour should represent himself as having this authority, as he had himself been raised from the dead by his own power, thus showing that the dominion over this dark world was entrusted to him."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "And I be came dead" (aorist middle participle of γινομα as in Revelation 1:9; Revelation 1:10, definite reference to the Cross).
2. "I am living," as the words ο ζων just used mean.
3. "Unto the ages of the ages," a stronger expression of eternity even than in Revelation 1:6.
4. "The keys...of death and of Hades...Jesus has the keys because of his victory over death."

### John Gill:
1. "He died the death of the cross, for the sins of his people, in due time, and but once; and it was but a short time he was held under the power of death, and will never die any more."
2. "He ever lives to make intercession for them; he rose again from the dead for their justification; their being quickened together with him, and their being begotten again to a lively hope, are owing to his being alive."
3. "This is an expression of the sovereignty, power, and authority of Christ; and is designed to encourage and support John under his present concern and anxiety of mind about the person he saw in this vision."

### John Wesley:
1. "And he that liveth — Another peculiar title of God."
2. "I have the keys of death and of hades — That is, the invisible world."
3. "Christ hath the keys of, that is, the power over, both; killing or quickening of the body, and disposing of the soul, as it pleaseth him."
