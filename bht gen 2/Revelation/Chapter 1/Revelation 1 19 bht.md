# Revelation 1:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The command to write pertains to what John has witnessed, specifically the vision of the Glorified Christ. The instruction to write extends to the state of the churches in the apostolic age, addressing their present condition. Additionally, it encompasses future events that will unfold until the end of the world. The emphasis lies in recording not only the past and present, but also the things that are yet to come.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Write therefore...the things which thou sawest...and what things they signify."
2. "Is it not because the μέλλει γενέσθαι merely signifies the future time, in which this latter class, en masse, were to happen, whereas this ἃ εἰσί imports, what these things, each of them, severally, mean?"
3. "I would take γενέσθαι in the sense of happening, not in the wide ages of history, but in apocalyptic vision: seeing that, ταῦτα meaning ἃ εἶδες, ἃ μέλλει γενέσθαι will by analogy mean the things which shall succeed these, i. e. a future vision."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Write therefore" (inasmuch as I, "the First and Last," have the keys of death, and vouchsafe to thee this vision for the comfort and warning of the Church).
2. "The things which are" imply the present state of things in the churches when John was writing, as represented in the second and third chapters.
3. "The things which shall be hereafter," the things symbolically represented concerning the future history of the fourth through twenty-second chapters.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He had seen not only the Saviour, but he had seen seven lampstands, and seven stars in the hand of the Saviour, and he is now commanded to record the meaning of these symbols as referring to things then actually existing in the seven churches." 
2. "He was to make a correct representation of the things which then were, and then to record what would occur 'after these things:' to wit, of the images, symbols, and truths, which would be disclosed to him after what he had already seen."
3. "The more natural interpretation, however, would seem to be, that it would stretch far into future years, and that it was designed to give at least an outline of what would be the character of the future in general."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Write, seeing that I am what I have now revealed Myself to be."
2. "The things which thou sawest, although most naturally referred to the vision of Revelation 1:10-18, are not necessarily confined to what concerns Jesus in himself... we are thus led not merely to the thought of His individuality, but to that of the fortunes of His people."
3. "The things which are’ then give expression to the present condition of the Church, as she follows her Lord in humiliation and suffering in the world; ‘the things which shall come to pass after these things’ to the glory that awaits her when, all her trials over, she shall enter upon her reward in the world to come."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The vision of the Glorified Christ in verses Revelation 1:13-18." 
2. "The messages to the seven churches (Revelation 1:20-3) in relation to the world in general." 
3. "This part begins in 4:1 and goes to end of chapter 22, though the future appears also in chapters 2 and 3 and the present occurs in 4 to 22 and the elements in the vision of Christ (Revelation 1:13-18) reappear repeatedly."

### John Gill:
1. "Write the things which thou hast seen...."
2. "The state of the churches of Christ in the apostolic age..."
3. "And the things which shall be hereafter..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Write the things which thou hast seen — This day: which accordingly are written, Revelation 1:11-18."
2. "And which are — The instructions relating to the present state of the seven churches. These are written, Revelation 1:20-Re."
3. "And which shall be hereafter — To the end of the world; written, Revelation 4:1, etc."
