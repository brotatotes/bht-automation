## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of the prophecy and observe the things written in it; for the time is near."
2. "Surely it is high time, that such an omission should be supplied. Notice that not three classes of persons, but two only, are here indicated: he that reads, and they that hear and do."
3. "The nearness spoken of is to be understood as the ἐν τάχει, which see. We know little now of relative nearness and distance in point of time: when the day of the Lord shall have opened our eyes to the true measure, we shall see, how near it always was)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "A special blessing attends him who reads or hears the apocalyptic 'prophecy' with a view to keeping the things therein."
2. "Even though he find not the key to its interpretation, he finds a stimulus to faith, hope, and patient waiting for Christ."
3. "Note: the term 'prophecy' has relation to the human medium or prophet inspired, here John: 'Revelation' to the Divine Being who reveals His will, here Jesus Christ."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is, however, more in accordance with the usual meaning of the word rendered 'read,' to suppose that it refers to the act of one’s reading for himself; to learn by reading."
2. "The general sense is, that they were to be regarded as highly favored who became acquainted in any way with what is here communicated."
3. "An author could not be supposed to say that one should regard his condition as a favored one who merely heard words that he could not understand, or who had placed before him magnificent symbols that had to him no meaning."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The passage is of some weight in determining the date of this book. The stated reading of the Apostolical writings did not exist as a received form before the destruction of Jerusalem, A. D. 70." 
2. "Threin to keep, is a peculiarly Johannine word, and is characteristic of Revelation as of the other writings in its own peculiar sense of 'keeping' in the exercise of active and strenuous care." 
3. "The time [ο καιρος]. See on Matthew 12:1. At hand [εγγυς]. Lit., near."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The book must not only be heard, it must be ‘kept;’ that is, not simply must it be obeyed, it must be preserved or treasured in the heart, that there it may become the spirit and the rule of life."
2. "Thus, also, it follows that the things written therein are not to be limited to those exhortations to repentance, faith, patience, etc., which accompany the visions; they include all the words of the prophecy."
3. "Finally, the blessedness of thus ‘keeping’ the revelation is enforced by the thought that the time, the distinct and definite season, when all shall be accomplished, is at hand (comp. Revelation 1:1)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The content of the Apocalypse is not merely prediction; moral counsel and religious instruction are the primary burdens of its pages" (Moffatt).
2. "Today the public reading of the Bible is an important part of worship that is often poorly done."
3. "How near εγγυς (at hand) is we do not know any more than we do about εν ταχε (shortly) in Revelation 1:1."

### John Gill:
1. "Blessed [is] he that readeth... and endeavours open and explain it to others;... that listen attentively to the reading and exposition of this book, and have ears to hear, so as to understand the prophecies contained in it..."
2. "...happy are those persons that observe, and take notice of what is written herein, and meditate upon them, and well weigh them in their minds, and retain them in their memories."
3. "Now, though eternal happiness does not depend upon, nor is procured by any of these means, as reading, hearing, and observing; yet there is a real happiness, a true pleasure, that does attend these things, which may stir up to a regard unto them..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Happy is he that readeth, and they that hear, the words of this prophecy - especially at this time, when so considerable a part of them is on the point of being fulfilled."
2. "In this book our Lord has comprised what was wanting in those prophecies touching the time which followed his ascension and the end of the Jewish polity."
3. "It behoves every Christian, at all opportunities, to read what is written in the oracles of God; and to read this precious book in particular, frequently, reverently, and attentively."
