# Revelation 1:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, faithfully made known to His disciples all that He heard from the Father. In His resurrection, He fulfilled the Scriptures and rose to die no more. By His death on the cross, He obtained the kingship of the world that was offered to Him by the tempter, but without compromising His mission. As the firstborn from the dead, His resurrection marked a significant event that fulfilled the Scriptures and brought about the reality of life after death. Through His sacrifice, He cleansed us from the pollution of sin, offering us redemption and a new life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He was the faithful witness, because all things that He heard of the Father He faithfully made known to His disciples."
2. "Christ rose to die no more. The image is not as if the grave was the womb of His resurrection-birth; but as Acts 13:33; Romans 1:4, treat Christ's resurrection as the epoch and event which fulfilled the Scripture."
3. "The kingship of the world which the tempter offered to Jesus on condition of doing homage to him, and so shunning the cross, He has obtained by the cross."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He is faithful in the sense that he is one on whose testimony there may be entire reliance, or who is entirely worthy to be believed."
2. "The exaltation of the Redeemer is elsewhere expressed in different language, but the idea is one that everywhere prevails in regard to him in the Scriptures."
3. "He has removed the pollution of sin from our souls by his blood; that is, his blood has been applied to cleanse us from sin."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The construction again departs from the grammatical rule. The words witness, first-born, ruler, are in the nominative case, instead of being in the genitive, in apposition with Jesus Christ. This construction, though irregular, nevertheless gives dignity and emphasis to these titles of the Lord."
2. "A faithful witness, because He gave faithful testimony concerning all things which were to be testified to by Him in the world."
3. "The risen Christ regarded in His relation to the dead in Christ. He was not the first who rose from the dead, but the first who so rose that death was thenceforth impossible for Him."
 


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The witness the faithful." 
2. "A Jewish Messianic title." 
3. "Christ loosed us once for all, but loves us always."

### John Gill:
1. "He is described in his prophetic office, the faithful witness... of his truth and faithfulness in his promises."
2. "He is described in his priestly office, the first begotten of the dead... the pledge and earnest of [the resurrection], as well as the efficient cause and exemplar of it."
3. "He is described in his kingly office, the Prince of the kings of the earth... over whom Christ is King and Lord, who receive their crowns and kingdoms from him, and rule by him, and are accountable to him"

### John Wesley:
1. "He was the faithful witness of the whole will of God before his death, and in death, and remains such in glory."
2. "He rose from the dead, as 'the first fruits of them that slept;' and now hath all power both in heaven and earth."
3. "He is here styled a prince: but by and by he hears his title of king; yea, King of kings, and Lord of lords."
