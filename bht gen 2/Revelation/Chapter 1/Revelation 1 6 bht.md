# Revelation 1:6 Commentary Help Text

Christ's love for us is boundless, demonstrated through the cleansing of our sins by His blood, making us kings. We now partake in His kingdom, both presently and for eternity. As priests unto God, we offer ourselves as a holy sacrifice, continuously praising and worshiping Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This kingdom is one in which his saints will themselves reign, see the parallel place ch. Revelation 5:10, where καὶ βασιλεύσουσιν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς is added: and Daniel 7:27; but above all the place which is here referred to, Exodus 19:6, ὑμεῖς δὲ ἔσεσθέ μοι βασίλειον ἱεράτευμα καὶ ἔθνος ἅγιον (1Pe 2:9)."
2. "The βασιλείαν was the collective description: ἱερεῖς is the individual designation."
3. "To Him who is God and His Father: or, to His God and Father. The former is the more probable here, Ebr. remarks, on account of St. John’s habit of repeating the possessive genitive after words of possession."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He made us (to be) a kingdom. So Exodus 19:6, 'a kingdom of priests'; 1 Peter 2:9, 'a royal priesthood.' The saints shall constitute peculiarly a kingdom of God, and shall themselves be kings."
2. "They are kings because they are priests: the priesthood is the continuous ground and legitimization of their kingship; they are kings in relation to man, priests in relation to God, serving Him day and night in His temple."
3. "All persons and things shall be holy to the Lord. Unto Him who is at once God and His Father. The glory and the might."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Christ had made us in fact kings and priests; that is, Christians are exalted to the dignity and are invested with the office, implied in these words."
2. "The word 'kings,' as applied to them, refers to the exalted rank and dignity which they will have; to the fact that they, in common with their Saviour, will reign triumphant over all enemies."
3. "The word 'priests' refers to the fact that they are engaged in the holy service of God, or that they offer to him acceptable worship."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The reigning of the saints is emphasized in this book."
2. "The priesthood of believers grows out of the priesthood of Christ."
3. "The consummation of this ideal appears in Revelation 21:22, where the heavenly Jerusalem is represented as without temple. It is all temple."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The idea here is that Christians are the true spiritual Israel in God's promise to Abraham as explained by Paul." 
2. "Each member of this true kingdom is a priest unto God, with direct access to him at all times."
3. "The adoration of Christ which vibrates in this doxology is one of the most impressive features of the book."

### John Gill:
1. "The saints are made 'kings' by Christ; they are so now; they have received a kingdom of grace, which cannot be taken away; and they have the power of kings over sin, Satan, and the world, and all their enemies; and they live and fare like kings, and are clothed like them, in rich apparel, the righteousness of Christ."
2. "And they become such by being the sons of God, which power and privilege they receive from Christ, and so are heirs of God, and joint heirs with him, and by being united to him."
3. "And he also makes them 'priests' to offer up the spiritual sacrifices of prayer and praise, and those of a broken heart, and of a contrite spirit, and even their souls and bodies, as a holy, living, and acceptable sacrifice unto God."

### John Wesley:
1. "To him that loveth us, and, out of that free, abundant love, hath washed us from the guilt and power of our sins with his own blood, and hath made us kings."
2. "Partakers of his present, and heirs of his eternal, kingdom."
3. "And priests unto his God and Father — To whom we continually offer ourselves, an holy, living sacrifice."
