## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I am the Alpha and the Omega." The first and last letters of the alphabet. God in Christ comprises all that goes between, as well as the first and last.
2. "Accomplishing finally what I begin. Always the same; before the dragon, the beast, false prophet, and all foes. An anticipatory consolation to the saints under the coming trials of the Church."
3. "Almighty—Hebrew, 'Shaddai,' and 'Jehovah Sabaoth,' that is, 'of hosts'; commanding all the hosts or powers in heaven and earth, so able to overcome all His Church's foes."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I am Alpha and Omega - These are the first and the last letters of the Greek alphabet, and denote properly the first and the last."
2. "The language here is what would properly denote 'eternity' in the being to whom it is applied, and could be used in reference to no one but the true God."
3. "The object for which this passage referring to the 'first and the last - to him who was, and is, and is to come,' is introduced here evidently is, to show that as he was clothed with omnipotence, and would continue to exist through all ages to come as he had existed in all ages past, there could be no doubt about his ability to execute all which it is said he would execute."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Rabbinical writers used the phrase from Aleph to Tav, to signify completely, from beginning to end."
2. "God, as the old tradition declares, holding in His hand the beginning, middle, and end of all that is."
3. "The Almighty... Constantly in the Septuagint."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The emphasis lies upon the Almighty, thus bringing into prominence that all-powerful might in which Jesus goes forth to be victorious over His enemies."
2. "To suppose that the words are spoken by the Father is to introduce a thought not strictly corresponding to what precedes."
3. "The words are thus highly important as witnessing to the true Divinity of Christ, and in particular to His possessing the same eternity as the Almighty."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Alpha and the Omega (το Αλφα κα το Ο). The first and the last letters of the Greek alphabet, each with its own neuter (grammatical gender) article. This description of the eternity of God recurs in Revelation 21:6 with the added explanation η αρχη κα το τελος (the Beginning and the End) and of Christ in Revelation 22:13 with the still further explanation ο πρωτος κα ο εσχατος (the First and the Last)." 
2. "This last phrase appears also in Revelation 1:17; Revelation 2:8 without το Αλφα κα το Ο."
3. "The eternity of God guarantees the prophecy just made. The Lord God (Κυριος ο θεος). 'The Lord the God.' Common phrase in Ezekiel (Ezekiel 6:3; Ezekiel 6:11; Ezekiel 7:2, etc.) and in this book (Revelation 4:8; Revelation 11:17; Revelation 15:3; Revelation 16:7; Revelation 19:6; Revelation 21:22)."

### John Gill:
1. "Alpha is used by the Jews for the chief of persons or things... so Christ, he is the Alpha, the chief as to his divine nature, being God over all, blessed for ever."
2. "He is the first and last, the chief, the whole of things; as of the covenant of grace, he is the first and last of it, he is the Mediator, surety, and messenger of it, and the ratifier and confirmer of it."
3. "This same phrase is used of God the Father in Revelation 1:4; and is a further proof of the deity of Christ; and which is still more confirmed by the following character, the Almighty."

### John Wesley:
1. "Let his enemies boast and rage ever so much in the intermediate time, yet the Lord God is both the Alpha, or beginning, and the Omega, or end, of all things."
2. "God is the beginning, as he is the Author and Creator of all things, and as he proposes, declares, and promises so great things: he is the end, as he brings all the things which are here revealed to a complete and glorious conclusion."
3. "Therefore God is the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end; that is, one who is all things, and always the same."
