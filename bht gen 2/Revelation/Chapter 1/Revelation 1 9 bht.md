# Revelation 1:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This book is meant for those who are facing hardships, as it was given to a man in exile. It is in times of affliction that faith is strengthened and believers can experience the kingdom of God. Those who are partakers of this kingdom are not afraid to endure suffering for the sake of Jesus. The apostle had a vast perspective, with the known world and all of Christendom before his eyes, as if this island of exile were designed for him to witness the various scenes that would unfold.

1. "For an afflicted Church, and not for a Church in worldly prosperity and ease, [the Apocalypse] has its meaning."
2. "These, too, are in Jesus, not 'of' Jesus as if only His spirit were made ours, nor 'for' Jesus as if only we were suffering and rejoicing and enduring for His sake, but 'in' Him, believers being one with Him, and therefore partakers of His trials, His royalty, and His heavenly strength."
