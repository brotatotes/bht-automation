# Revelation 10:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we encounter another mighty angel who appears with a cloud, symbolizing God's judgment and his role as a messenger of peace. This angel is not just any ordinary being, but one of strength and power, chosen to fulfill a significant mission. The presence of a rainbow upon his head signifies divine favor and the new order of things that would bring light and knowledge to humanity. As his face shines like the sun, we are reminded that the righteous will also shine like the sun.

2. "The symbol would mean that the angel came not for wrath, but for purposes of peace; that he looked with a benign aspect upon people, and that the effect of his coming would be like that of sunshine after a storm."
3. "The symbol would denote that the new order of things would be attended with light; with knowledge; with what would be benign in its influence on human affairs."

### Philip Schaff:

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The opening of the seventh seal was preceded by two visions (chapter Revelation 10:7) and so here the sounding of the seventh trumpet (Revelation 11:15) is preceded by a new series of visions (Revelation 10:1-11)."

2. "And a rainbow upon his head - A lovely token of the divine favour. And yet it is not too glorious for a creature."
