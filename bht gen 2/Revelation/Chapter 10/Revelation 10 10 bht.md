# Revelation 10:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Gospel is like a little book that, when received and devoured, brings both sweetness and bitterness. Just as the contents of the book brought mixed emotions to John, the Gospel can have a dual effect. For faithful ministers, it is a taste of delight as they witness the glorified state of the church and kingdom of Christ. However, the preaching of the Gospel also leads to bitterness, sorrow, and persecution for those who deliver and embrace its message. Despite the hardships, the faithful continue to proclaim the Gospel, guided by their spiritual knowledge and experience of its transformative power.
