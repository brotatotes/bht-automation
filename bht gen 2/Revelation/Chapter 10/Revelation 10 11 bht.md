# Revelation 10:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The obligation lies upon thee to prophesy at His command, making the message of God known. By possessing this little volume of truth, the message of life will be carried before princes and rulers, leading to the conversion of the whole world. The righteous find consolation in the promise that all evil will be put down and righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost will reign. As John prophesies again, he prepares the world for its fate. This prophesying encompasses both words and actions, measuring the temple and referencing great kingdoms and potentates of different times.

"The intimation, and they say unto me, with which these words are introduced, may help us to understand the nature of the prophesying referred to, for these words are hardly equivalent to the formula ‚ÄòIt is said.‚Äô They may be much more naturally referred to the seven thunders which had already spoken."
