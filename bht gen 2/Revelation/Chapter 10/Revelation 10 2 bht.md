## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "a little book‚Äîa roll little in comparison with the 'book' which contained the whole vast scheme of God's purposes."
2. "The New Testament begins with the word 'book' (Greek, 'biblus'), of which 'the little book' (Greek, 'biblaridion') is the diminutive, 'the little bible', the Bible in miniature."
3. "the angel with his right foot on the sea, and his left on the earth, claims both as God's, and as about soon to be cleared of the usurper and his followers."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The natural interpretation...would be, that something was to be accomplished by the agency of a book, or that a book was to be the prominent characteristic of the times - as the bow, the sword, and the balances had been of the previous periods."
2. "No one acquainted with the history of the Reformation can doubt that it is to be traced to the influence of the Bible; that the moving cause, the spring of all that occurred in the Reformation, was the impulse given to the mind of Luther and his fellow-laborers by the study of that one book."
3. "The Bible became, at the Reformation, in fact an 'open' book. it was made accessible. It became the popular book of the world - the book that did more than all other things to change the aspect of affairs, and to give character to subsequent times."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The roll of Ch. 5 was on the hand, being too large to be grasped within it."
2. "The roll was on the right hand; the little book is in the left."
3. "The little book is carried in the left hand."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The size of the angel is colossal, for he bestrides both land and sea. Apparently there is no special point in the right foot being on the sea and the left upon the land. It makes a bold and graphic picture."
2. "Only instance of œâœÉœÄŒµœÅ in the Apocalypse, but œâœÇ in the same sense several times. Present middle indicative of ŒºœÖŒ∫Œ±ŒøŒºŒ±, an old onomatopoetic word from ŒºœÖ or ŒºŒøŒø (the sound which a cow utters), common for the lowing and bellowing of cattle, Latin mugire, but in Theocritus for the roaring of a lion as here."
3. "It does not mean that what the angel said was unintelligible, only loud. Cf. Revelation 1:10; Revelation 5:2; Revelation 5:12; Revelation 6:10; Revelation 7:2; Revelation 7:10, etc."

### John Gill:
1. "By which is meant not the Bible, the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament... but the same book is here designed, which in Revelation 5:1 is represented as in the right hand of him that sat on the throne, as shut and sealed..."
2. "it may be said to be 'a little book', because now not only many of the scenes and visions in it were exhibited, upon the opening of the seals; but because, at the time this vision refers to, many of its prophecies were accomplished..."
3. "and he set his right foot upon the sea, and [his] left [foot] on the earth; which signifies that he was Lord and possessor of both, of the whole terraqueous globe, being the Maker and supporter of it; and that his Gospel should be spread all over the world, both on the continent and in the islands of the sea..." (130 words)

### John Wesley:
1. "And he had in his hand ‚Äî His left hand: he swore with his right. He stood with his right foot on the sea, toward the west; his left, on the land, toward the east: so that he looked southward." 
2. "And so St. John (as Patmos lies near Asia) could conveniently take the book out of his left hand. This sealed book was first in the right hand of him that sat on the throne: thence the Lamb took it, and opened the seals."
3. "From this place the Revelation speaks more clearly and less figuratively than before."
