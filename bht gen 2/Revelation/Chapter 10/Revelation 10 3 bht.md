# Revelation 10:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The angel's cry, representing Christ, resounded like the roaring of a lion, echoing far and wide. This voice, like the seven thunders, proclaimed a message whose full meaning would only be fully understood at the grand consummation of God's plan. The seven thunders, symbolizing the ministers of the Gospel during the Reformation, were like sons of thunder, boldly proclaiming the truth. As the angel cried, the heavenly powers spoke in distinct voices, each uttering their message like the rumbling of thunder.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Christ, whom the angel represents, is often so symbolized ( :-, "the Lion of the tribe of Juda")."
2. "The seven thunders... form part of the Apocalyptic symbolism; and so are marked by the article as well known."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The voice that sounded forth at the Reformation among the nations of Europe, breaking the slumbers of the Christian world, awaking the church to the evil of the existing corruptions and abominations, and summoning princes to the defense of the truth, might well be symbolized by the voice of an angel that was heard afar."
2. "Could we now find a more appropriate symbol to denote the Reformation than the appearance of such an angel; or better describe the impression made by the first announcement of the great doctrines of the Reformation, than by the loud voice of such an angel?"
3. "If we were now to attempt to devise a symbol which would be appropriate to express what actually occurred in the Reformation, we could not think of one which would be better suited to that purpose than to speak of seven thunders bellowing forth from the seven-hilled city."

### Marvin Vincent:
