# Revelation 10:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
John, having heard the voices of the seven thunders, was eager to write down their secrets, believing it could benefit and comfort the church. However, a voice from heaven instructed him to seal up the utterances and keep them hidden for the time being. These mysterious words were meant to be kept secret, separate from the revelations that were to be recorded in the book. We should not dwell on what these thunders uttered, but rather focus on the contents of the opened book and the angel's oath.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Seal up—the opposite command to Revelation 22:20. Even though at the time of the end the things sealed in Daniel's time were to be revealed, yet not so the voices of these thunders."
2. "Though heard by John, they were not to be imparted by him to others in this book of Revelation; so terrible are they that God in mercy withholds them."
3. "The godly are thus kept from morbid ponderings over the evil to come; and the ungodly are not driven by despair into utter recklessness of life."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That is, he was about to record what was uttered, supposing that that was the design for which he hart been made to hear them."
2. "The meaning here is, that he was not to record those things, but what he heard he was to keep to himself as if it was placed under a seal which was not to be broken."
3. "The command not to record what the seven thunders uttered was of the nature of a caution not to regard what was said in this manner; that is, not to be deceived by these utterances as if they were the voice of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. To write. According to the injunction in ch. 1 11.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The thunders must not only have been in themselves intelligible, but they must have been understood by the Seer."
2. "We are not to suppose that the object of this command was to keep the contents of the thunders for ever concealed."
3. "But they learn only by experience. They must pass through trials, whatever they may be, before darkness is dispelled and light in its full brightness shines around them."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I was on the point of beginning to write, as commanded in Revelation 1:11; Revelation 1:19." 
2. "Seal up at once."
3. "It is idle to conjecture what was in the utterances. Compare Paul's silence in 2 Corinthians 12:4."

### John Gill:
1. "John taking particular notice of what they said, and believing it might be for the advantage, comfort, and support of the church of Christ under its suffering circumstances, to be informed of what God had in reserve among the treasures of his wrath for their adversaries, was going to put it down in writing."
2. "Treasure them up in thy mind, keep them within thy breast, hide them from men, for the present, and say nothing of them."
3. "By these 'seven thunders' are meant seven kingdoms which have received the Reformation, and established it by law within their several dominions, whereby the doctrine and worship of the reformers are become the established religion there; and the laws by which it is established are 'the voices' uttered by those supreme authorities."

### John Wesley:
1. "And I heard a voice from heaven — Doubtless from him who had at first commanded him to write, and who presently commands him to take the book; namely, Jesus Christ."
2. "Seal up those things which the seven thunders have uttered, and write them not — These are the only things of all which he heard that he is commanded to keep secret: so something peculiarly secret was revealed to the beloved John, besides all the secrets that are written in this book."
3. "At the same time we are prevented from inquiring what it was which these thunders uttered: suffice that we may know all the contents of the opened book, and of the oath of the angel."
