# Revelation 10:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The angel in Revelation 10:2 is depicted with his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the earth, symbolizing his authority over both realms. His gesture of lifting up his right hand towards heaven is a customary and solemn oath-taking action. This imagery of lifting up the hand in swearing can be seen in other passages, such as Genesis 14:22 and Isaiah 62:8. This manifestation of future events, introduced by the angel speaking for God and Christ speaking for Himself, parallels the dual witness of the angel in Daniel 12:7.
