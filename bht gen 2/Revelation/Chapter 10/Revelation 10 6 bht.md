# Revelation 10:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This solemn oath is reserved for the seventh angel, emphasizing the significance of this trumpet. The angel swears by the eternal and living God, the Creator of all things, showing His supreme power over all His enemies. The absence of time no longer refers to the ceasing of existence, but rather, as in Daniel 12:7, to the fulfillment of the divine purposes. This non-chronos period, identified from the year 800 to 1836, encompasses significant events such as the third woe, the woman in the wilderness, and the duration of the beast. (49 words)

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This detailed designation of God as the Creator, is appropriate to the subject of the angel's oath, namely, the consummating of the mystery of God (Revelation 10:7), which can surely be brought to pass by the same Almighty power that created all things, and by none else."  
2. "The martyrs shall have no longer a time to wait for the accomplishment of their prayers for the purgation of the earth by the judgments which shall remove their and God's foes from it."  
3. "The appointed season or time of delay is at an end."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The reference is to God as 'ever-living'; that is, he is now a witness, and he ever will be; he has now the power to detect and punish, and he ever will have the same power."
2. "The design of referring to these things here is what is just specified to give increased solemnity to the oath by a particular reference to someone of the attributes of God."
3. "The proper sense of this passage, then, according to the above interpretation would be 'And the angel lifted up his hand to heaven, and sware by him that liveth forever and ever, That the time should not yet be; but, in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God shall be finished.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Swear by [ωμοσεν εν] . Lit., 'swear in,' a Hebrew idiom."
2. "The meaning is not, as popularly understood, that time shall cease to exist, but that there shall be no more delay (so Rev., in margin) before the fulfillment of the divine purposes respecting the Church on earth."
3. "Possibly with allusion to the cry how long (ch. 6 10)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The living one for ages of ages" is a common phrase in the Apocalypse for God as eternally existing.
2. This oath proves that this angel is not Christ.
3. But this does not mean that χρονος (time), Einstein's "fourth dimension" (added to length, breadth, height), will cease to exist, but only that there will be no more delay in the fulfillment of the seventh trumpet.

### John Gill:
1. "And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever....to assert the excellency and perfection of his nature, who has life in himself originally, and independently, is the fountain of life to all creatures living, and who are supported in their life and being by him." (54 words)
2. "the thing he swears to is, that there should be time no longer...The true key to this passage is Daniel 12:7; where the man clothed in linen swears, that to the end of wonders should be a time, times, and a half, and here the angel swears that time should be no longer..." (59 words)

### John Wesley:
1. "The six preceding trumpets pass without any such solemnity. It is the trumpet of the seventh angel alone which is confirmed by so high an oath."
2. "Who created the heaven, the earth, the sea, and the things that are therein — And, consequently, has the sovereign power over all: therefore, all his enemies, though they rage a while in heaven, on the sea, and on the earth, yet must give place to him."
3. "The non-chronos here mentioned seems to begin in the year 800, (when Charles the Great instituted in the west a new line of emperors, or of 'many kings,') to end in the year 1836; and to contain, among other things, the 'short time' of the third woe, the 'three times and a half' of the woman in the wilderness, and the 'duration' of the beast."
