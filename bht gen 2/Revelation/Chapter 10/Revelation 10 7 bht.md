# Revelation 10:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the days of the seventh angel's voice, the purpose of God will be finished, revealing the mystery of His redemption. This mystery is in contrast to the mystery of iniquity. The visions speak of the final consummation and changes on earth, declaring the good news and unveiling the mystery of the kingdom. During this time, Christ's kingdom will reign, bringing everlasting light and removing darkness. The Gospel, often called the mystery, contains many mysteries of God. It will be fulfilled in the days of the seventh angel's voice, and the ancient prophecies will be fully accomplished.

3. "The office of the prophets...to receive the glad tidings from God, in order to declare them to others. The final consummation is the great theme of the Gospel announced to, and by, the prophets."
