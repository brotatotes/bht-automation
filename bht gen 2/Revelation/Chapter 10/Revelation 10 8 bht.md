# Revelation 10:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The voice from heaven reiterated its message, providing a divine command. Taking the open book from the angel signifies the importance of aligning one's words with the Scriptures. Just as the Seer had a heavenly mission, those proclaiming God's word must be called by Him. The unfolding events from Revelation 10:8 to 11:13 parallel the fulfillment of the mystery of God. The subsequent verses shed light on the Seer's prophesying again. This passage emphasizes the need to speak in accordance with the Scriptures, as God's messengers follow His divine commission and fulfill His plans.
