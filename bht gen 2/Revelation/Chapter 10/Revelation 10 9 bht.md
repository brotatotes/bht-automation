# Revelation 10:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
John is instructed to eat the book, symbolizing the complete assimilation of its contents. This act represents the importance of thoroughly considering and digesting God's word, just as Ezekiel was commanded to do. While the book is sweet in John's mouth, signifying the many good things that follow, he also experiences bitterness as he comes to understand the hardships and challenges that await. Nonetheless, the sweetness reminds us of the glory and victory that will ultimately triumph through God's eternal plan.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "His finding the roll sweet to the taste at first, is because it was the Lord's will he was doing, and because, divesting himself of carnal feeling, he regarded God's will as always agreeable, however bitter might be the message of judgment to be announced."
2. "The thought that God would be glorified gave him the sweetest pleasure."
3. "The revelation of the secrets of futurity is sweet to one at first, but bitter and distasteful to our natural man, when we learn the cross which is to be borne before the crown shall be won."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The readiness with which God gives his Bible into the hands of human beings, in contradistinction from all human efforts to restrain its use, and to prevent its free circulation, be well symbolized by this act?"
2. "He was to possess himself of the contents of the book; to receive it into his mind; to apply it, as we do food, for spiritual nourishment - truth having, in this respect, the same relation to the mind which food has to the body."
3. "The relish which would exist for the sacred volume, and the happiness which would be found in its perusal; for this very image is frequently employed to denote this."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. I went [απηλθον] . The preposition ajpo has the force of away. I went away from the place where I was standing. Eat it up. Compare Ezekiel 3:1-3; Jeremiah 14:16. 

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The eating of the roll can hardly be anything else than a symbol of the complete assimilation of its contents."
2. "The command is obeyed, and the further instruction is given, 'Take it, and eat it up.'"
3. "For a similar action, comp. Ezekiel 3:1."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "John left his position by the door of heaven."
2. "The book was already open and was not to be read aloud, but to be digested mentally by John."
3. "Deep and bitter sorrows confront John as he comes to understand God's will and way."

### John Gill:
1. "And I went to the angel,... whither should any go knowledge but to him who has the words of eternal life, and is the great prophet of the church?"
2. "so ordinary prophets and ministers of the word should go to Christ, to have their eyes opened, their understandings enlightened, that they may understand the Scriptures, and explain them to others"
3. "for ordinary prophesying, or preaching, the ministers of the word should diligently read the Scriptures, constantly meditate on them, digest the truths of the Gospel in their own minds, and lay them up in the treasury of their hearts, and bring them forth from thence in due season"

### John Wesley:
1. "Eat it up — The like was commanded to Ezekiel. This was an emblem of thoroughly considering and digesting it."
2. "And it will make thy belly bitter, but it will be sweet as honey in thy mouth — The sweetness betokens the many good things which follow, Revelation 11:1,15, etc.; the bitterness, the evils which succeed under the third woe."
