# Revelation 11:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The reed mentioned in this passage symbolizes the Word of God, which serves as our guide and standard for faith and practice. By using the reed to measure, we are called to accurately assess and examine the true Church of God, distinguishing it from other groups. It also signifies the need for a thorough evaluation of our beliefs and actions as individuals, ensuring alignment with the teachings of Scripture. Thus, the reed represents the importance of adhering to God's Word and maintaining the integrity of His Church.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The reed, the canon of Scripture, the measuring reed of the Church, our rule of faith, speaks."
2. "Like a rod, namely, straight: like a rod of iron, unbending, destroying all error, and that cannot be broken."
3. "The measurement of the Holy place seems to me to stand parallel to the sealing of the elect of Israel under the sixth seal. John's accurately drawing the distinction in subsequent chapters between God's servants and those who bear the mark of the beast, is the way whereby he fulfils the direction here given him to measure the temple."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He who is thus addressed is directed to take an accurate estimate of the true church of God; as accurate as if he were to apply a measuring-reed to ascertain the dimensions of the temple at Jerusalem."
2. "Obtain an exact estimate or measurement of what the true church was - as distinguished from all other bodies of people, and as constituted and appointed by the direction of God."
3. "Three things John was directed to do: (a)To take a just estimate of what constitutes the true church, (b)To institute a careful examination into the opinions in the church on the subject of sacrifice or atonement, (c)To take a correct estimate of what constitutes true membership in the church."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A rod. See on ch. Revelation 2:27." 
2. "The temple [œÑŒøŒΩ ŒΩŒ±ŒøŒΩ] . See on Matthew 4:5."
3. "Them that worship. Note the peculiar expressed, measuring the worshippers with a reed."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The reed is for measuring, but it is stronger than a common reed, and is thus more able to effect its purpose: it is like unto a rod."
2. "The last clause alone is a sufficient proof that the three things to be measured are not to be understood literally. How could those who worship in the temple be thus measured with a reed?"
3. "As to the import of the measuring there can be little doubt. It is determined, by the contrast of Revelation 11:2, by the measuring of chap. Revelation 21:15-16, and by the analogy of chap. 7, to be for preservation, not, as sometimes imagined, for destruction."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A reed (Œ∫Œ±ŒªŒ±ŒºŒøœÇ). Old word for a growing reed...a writer's reed...a measuring-rod." 
2. "Rise and measure (ŒµŒ≥ŒµŒπœÅŒµ Œ∫Œ± ŒºŒµœÑœÅŒ∑œÉŒøŒΩ). Present active imperative of ŒµŒ≥ŒµŒπœÅœâ...and first aorist active imperative of ŒºŒµœÑœÅŒµœâ." 
3. "There is a heavenly sanctuary, but here ŒΩŒ±ŒøœÇ is on earth and yet not the actual temple in Jerusalem...Perhaps here it is the spiritual."

### John Gill:
1. "By it seems to be designed the holy Scripture, or the word of God, which is sometimes called a line, a rule, and rod...and it is the rule and measure of all discipline, worship, and practice."
2. "The temple of God" is here meant the church, of which the temple was a type...and the church is built upon the rock Christ Jesus."
3. "The measuring reed of the word was taken in hand, and used; but then it was used chiefly for the restoration of pure doctrine, and with good success, but not so much for the regulating and orderly discipline of the churches...but the time for this was not yet come, but now is."
