# Revelation 11:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The followers of antichrist, those who are consumed by earthly desires, take delight in the end and downfall of the prophets who tormented them with their preaching, testimony for Christ, and stern rebuke of their ways. These prophets foretold the calamities and ruin that would befall them. Now silenced, they rejoice over their absence and exchange gifts in celebration, much like the Philistines did over Samson. This rejoicing is not limited to one group, as it includes Turks, Jews, heathens, and false Christians alike.

3. "Like her Lord, the Church will have her dark passion week followed by the bright resurrection morn."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Those dwelling in the land would rejoice over their fall and ruin."
2. "The meaning is, that while alive they would, by their faithful testimony against existing errors, excite so much hatred against themselves, and would be so great an annoyance to the governing powers, that there would be general exultation when the voice of their testimony should be silenced."
3. "They 'tormented' them, or were a source of annoyance to them, by bearing testimony to the truth; by opposing the prevailing errors; and by rebuking the vices of the age."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They that dwell upon the earth... make merry... Jubilant jollification over the cessation of the activity of the two prophets." 
2. "They shall send gifts to one another... Just as we see it done in Esther 9:19; Esther 9:22; Nehemiah 8:10; Nehemiah 8:12." 
3. "Tormented... This is the reason of the fiendish glee of Jew and Gentile, who no longer will have to endure the prophecies and dread miracles of these two prophets."

3. "But now they are silenced, and they hear and see no more of these things at which they rejoice."

### John Wesley:
1. "Perhaps this expression may peculiarly denote earthly-minded men."
2. "Shall make merry - As did the Philistines over Samson."
