# Revelation 11:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After three days and a half, the same breath of life that brought dry bones in Israel back to life breathed into them, signifying the restoration of the nation. The witnesses' resurrection should not be taken literally, as it refers to their civil resurrection as witnesses. This event inspired great fear and panic among the spectators, as they recognized the power and authority of God on their side. The Spirit of God infused these witnesses with renewed life, zeal, and resolution, embodying their role as powerful agents of divine proclamation.
