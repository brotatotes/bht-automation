The ascension of these witnesses, which will take place in a cloud, is a glorious event that parallels the ascension of Jesus.

This triumph and elevation of the witnesses signifies the beginning of a joyful era, where Christ's spiritual reign and the establishment of His church will be visible to all, even to those who opposed them before. Jerusalem will become a source of praise and joy to many generations, a testament to the power and victory of the Lord.

2. "It may be that this may denote that the first appearance of these happy times, and of Christ's spiritual reign in his church, and their more comfortable enjoyment, will be at first but dim and obscure, and yet such as, in comparison of their former state, will be visible to, and be taken notice of, even by their very enemies."
