## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Six is the number of the world power's greatest triumph, but at the same time verges on seven, the divine number, when its utter destruction takes place." 
2. "Thus, in the Church-historical view, it is hereby implied that one of the ten apostate world kingdoms fall."
3. "Their conversion forms a blessed contrast... These repenting, become in the flesh the loyal subjects of Christ reigning over the earth with His transfigured saints."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "An earthquake is a symbol of commotion, agitation, change; of great political revolutions, etc. The meaning here is, that the triumph of the witnesses, represented by their ascending to heaven, would be followed by such revolutions as would be properly symbolized by an earthquake." 
2. "The word 'tenth' is probably used in a general sense to denote that a considerable portion of the persecuting power would be thus involved in ruin."
3. "All that seems to be meant by this is, that they stood in awe at what God was doing, and acknowledged his power in the changes that occurred. It does not mean, necessarily, that they would repent and become truly his friends, but that there would be a prevailing impression that these changes were produced by his power, and that his hand was in these things."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Earthquake. See on ch. Revelation 6:12."
2. "Of men [ŒøŒΩŒøŒºŒ±œÑŒ± Œ±ŒΩŒ∏œÅœâœÄœâŒΩ] . Lit., names of men See on ch. Revelation 3:4."
3. "Gave glory to the God of heaven. The phrase signifies not conversion, nor repentance, nor thanksgiving, but recognition, which is its usual sense in scripture."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The city is without doubt ‚Äòthe great city‚Äô of Revelation 11:8; but only a tenth part falls because judgment does not yet descend in all its fullness."
2. "Inasmuch, however, as we are here dealing with inhabitants of Jerusalem, the holy city, it is not improbable that the faithless members of the Church, as distinguished from the faithful witnesses, are in the prophet‚Äôs view."
3. "The two witnesses are thus believers who, amidst all the defection of others, remain faithful to their Lord. They are the true Divine seed within the outward Church, the little flock that listens only to the voice of the Good Shepherd and is led astray neither by the world nor hireling shepherds."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Earthquakes are often given as a symbol of great upheavals in social and spiritual order."
2. "A general movement toward Christianity, induced by fear or despair--a prediction fulfilled more than once in ecclesiastical history."
3. "Recognition of God's power."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'the city' is meant the city of Rome, the great city, mentioned in Revelation 11:8."
2. "But I rather think the kingdom of France is meant, the last of the ten kingdoms, which rose up out of the ruins of the Roman empire, which will be conquered, and which will be the means of its reformation from Popery."
3. "These will be affected with the judgments of God upon others, and be made sensible of their danger, and of their deliverance, which will so work upon them, as to reform them from Popery."

### John Wesley:
1. "We have here an unanswerable proof that this city is not Babylon or Rome, but Jerusalem."
2. "And the rest ‚Äî The remaining sixty-three thousand were converted: a grand step toward the fulfilling of the mystery of God. Such a conversion we no where else read of."
3. "Were terrified ‚Äî Blessed terror! And gave glory - The character of true conversion."
