# Revelation 11:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During a period of darkness and corruption, faithful witnesses kept the truth alive and stood against prevailing errors. The triumph of the Church signifies the overthrow of her enemies, with the greater the triumph, the more disastrous their defeat. The second woe, marked by the power of the Saracens, was already past, while the approaching third woe, associated with the Roman see's claim to power and universality, heralded the Parousia. These events serve as a reminder of the Church's triumphant role and the consequences for her adversaries.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Seer is not yet prepared to set forth the nature of this taking of the kingdom, this reward to God‚Äôs servants, this destruction of the destroyers of the earth."
2. "Before he does so, another series of prophetic visions must be given, regarding not merely the dwellers on the earth, but the Church herself, her glory and her shame, her faithfulness and her apostasy."
3. "And now God‚Äôs avenging judgments on the earth, in answer to the prayers of His saints, having reached their final point of accomplishment, and the armies of heaven having given solemn thanks for the hour being come, again the veil is dropt, and again a new procession of visions begins from the beginning."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "Instead of the third woe being detailed, the grand consummation is summarily noticed, the thanksgiving of the twenty-four elders in heaven for the establishment of Christ's kingdom on earth, attended with the destruction of the destroyers of the earth."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "During that long period of apostasy, darkness, corruption, and sin, there would be faithful witnesses for the truth, who, though they were few in number, would be sufficient to keep up the knowledge of the truth on the earth, and to bear testimony against the prevailing errors and abominations."
2. "The design of this portion of the book, therefore, is to describe the character of the faithful witnesses for the truth during this long period of darkness; to state their influence; to record their trials; and to show what would be the ultimate result in regard to them, when their 'testimony' should become triumphant."
3. "The triumph of the Reformation would be well represented by the witnesses ascending to heaven in a cloud, as it was a public proof of the divine favor and a triumph of the truth over the papal power."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The object of the verse, therefore, is to remind us of what we might perhaps have forgotten, that the second woe had closed some time before, but that nothing shall now interrupt the sounding of the seventh trumpet on the coming of the third Woe, the triumph of the Church."
2. "In the meantime it is enough to say that the triumph of the Church implies the overthrow of her enemies, and that the greater and more glorious the one the more disastrous and humiliating must be the other."
