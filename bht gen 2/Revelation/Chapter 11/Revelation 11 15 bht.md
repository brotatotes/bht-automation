# Revelation 11:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the seventh trumpet is sounded, it marks the culmination of a grand celebration, likened to the sounding of trumpets during festal solemnities. Just as there was silence in heaven when the seventh seal was opened, the sounding of the seventh trumpet is met with great voices resounding in joy. However, on earth, there are still ominous events that must unfold before the ultimate fulfillment of this heavenly proclamation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The distinction of worldly and spiritual shall then cease. There will be no beast in opposition to the woman. Poetry, art, science, and social life will be at once worldly and Christian."
2. "The earth-kingdoms are many: His shall be one. The appellation 'Christ,' the Anointed, is here, where His kingdom is mentioned appropriately for the first time used in Revelation. For it is equivalent to KING."
3. "The glorified Son of man shall rule mankind by His transfigured Church in heaven, and by His people Israel on earth: Israel shall be the priestly mediator of blessings to the whole world, realizing them first."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This is the last of the trumpets, implying, of course, that under this the series of visions was to end, and that this was to introduce the state of things under which the affairs of the world were to be wound up."
2. "The grand consummation had come, the period so long anticipated and desired when God should reign on the earth had arrived, and this lays the foundation for joy and thanksgiving in heaven."
3. "A time is to come when, in the proper sense of the term, God is to reign on the earth; when his kingdom is to be universal; when his laws shall be everywhere recognized as binding; when all idolatry shall come to an end; and when the understandings and the hearts of people everywhere shall bow to his authority."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. The kingdoms - are become [εγενοντο αι βασιλειαι] . Read ejgeneto hJ basileia, the kingdom - is become. Of our Lord, etc. Compare Psalms 2:2-9.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Those counsels of the Almighty which had been long since taken, but which had been hitherto concealed from every eye but that of faith, were about to go into open execution."
2. "The kingdom of the world is become the possession of our Lord and of his Christ, and he shall reign for ever and ever."
3. "This dominion is celebrated as given to the Father in the Son and to the Son in the Father; and it shall be theirs for ever and ever, all its enemies being completely overthrown."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "There followed (εγενοντο). 'There came to pass.' There was silence in heaven upon the opening of the seventh seal (Revelation 8:1), but here 'great voices.' Perhaps the great voices are the ζωα of Revelation 4:6; Revelation 5:8."
2. "The kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ (του κυριου ημων κα του Χριστου αυτου). Repeat η βασιλεια from the preceding. God the Father is meant here by κυριου (Lord), as αυτου (his) shows. This is the certain and glorious outcome of the age-long struggle against Satan, who wields the kingdom of the world which he offered to Christ on the mountain for one act of worship... Now the climax has come with Christ as Conqueror of the kingdom of this world for his Father."
3. "He shall reign (βασιλευσε). Future active of βασιλευω. God shall reign, but the rule of God and of Christ is one as the kingdom is one."

### John Gill:
1. "The kingdom of Christ, which is not of this world, and is not supported by any such methods."
2. "The whole government of it, which is his by right of nature, and will be overturned, and overturned again and again, till he comes, whose right it is."
3. "Christ will reign in this spiritual way, more or less, until he comes personally, and then he will reign with his people on earth a thousand years; and when they are ended, he will reign with them in heaven to all eternity."

### John Wesley:
1. "The allusion therefore in this and all the trumpets is to those used in festal solemnities."
2. "At the opening of the seventh seal 'there was silence in heaven;' at the sounding of the seventh trumpet, great voices."
3. "This immediately appears in heaven, and is there celebrated with joyful praise. But on earth several dreadful occurrences are to appear first."
