# Revelation 11:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we discover that the twenty-four elders, who are seated on their thrones and reign over the earth, are enraptured with the prospect before them, the divine presence. Although they have their own thrones, they still fall upon their faces in worship to God and Christ. Their quiet and undisturbed situation shows that they have been restored to their former places. This wonderful change of things in the world leads them to prostrate themselves before God, a profound act of adoration that distinguishes them from angels.
