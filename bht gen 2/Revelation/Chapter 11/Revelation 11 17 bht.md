# Revelation 11:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Lord Jesus Christ, who is truly God and the Almighty, has taken His great power and now reigns with authority over all the kingdoms. He is the only Governor of everything, having all things under His control. The phrase who is, and who was speaks to the eternal and unchanging nature of God, who has now come in His fullness. His power, which has always been present, will no longer be opposed by His enemies. This marks the beginning of the establishment of His kingdom on earth, where His greatness will be known throughout all the heavens.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Thanks—for the answer to our prayers (Revelation 6:10; Revelation 6:11) in destroying them which destroy the earth (Revelation 6:11- :), thereby preparing the way for setting up the kingdom of Thyself and Thy saints."
2. "The consummation having actually come, they do not address Him as they did when it was still future, 'Thou that art to come.' Compare Revelation 11:18, 'is come.' From the sounding of the seventh trumpet He is to His people JAH, the ever present Lord, WHO IS, more peculiarly than JEHOVAH 'who is, was, and is to come.'"
3. "Taken to thee thy great power—'to Thee' is not in the Greek. Christ takes to Him the kingdom as His own of right."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The language here used is an expression of their deep interest in the church, and of the fact that they felt themselves identified with it."
2. "The reference here is to the fact that God, who had thus established his church on the earth, is unchanging."
3. "The setting up of his kingdom all over the world, and causing his laws everywhere to be obeyed, will be among the highest demonstrations of divine power."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. O Lord God, etc. See on ch. Revelation 4:8. And art to come. Omit. Hast taken to Thee. Omit to thee.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Contains the first part of their song of praise and thanksgiving."
2. "The name ‘Lord’ is then followed by three appellations as at chap. Revelation 4:8, first.  God;  secondly,  the Almighty; thirdly,  which art and which wast, the third clause usually belonging to this last appellative."
3. "This part of the song of praise deals with the general statement that the Lord has  taken to Him His  great power. That power had indeed been always His, but for a time He had permitted His enemies to contend against it. He is to permit this no longer."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Thou hast taken (ειληφες). Perfect active indicative of λαμβανω, emphasizing the permanence of God's rule, 'Thou hast assumed thy power.'"
2. "Didst reign (εβασιλευσας). Ingressive first aorist active indicative of βασιλευω, 'Didst begin to reign.'"
3. "See this combination of tenses (perfect and aorist) without confusion in Revelation 3:3; Revelation 5:7; Revelation 8:5."

2. "The phrase is expressive of the eternity and immutability."
3. "He has always had a kingdom on earth, but now the 'greatness' of the kingdom, under the whole heaven, will be his."

### John Wesley:
1. "The Almighty — He who hath all things in his power as the only Governor of them."
2. "Who is, and who was — God is frequently styled, 'He who is, and who was, and who is to come.' but now he is actually come, the words, 'who is to come,' are, as it were, swallowed up."
3. "Thou hast taken thy great power — This is the beginning of what is done under the trumpet of the seventh angel. God has never ceased to use his power; but he has suffered his enemies to oppose it, which he will now suffer no more."
