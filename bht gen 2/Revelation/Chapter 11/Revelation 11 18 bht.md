# Revelation 11:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The nations' anger is insignificant compared to God's wrath. The seventh trumpet announces the judgment and reward at the end of all things. Jesus, who we have longed for, will come and fulfill our hopes. It is the time for God to punish His enemies and reward His faithful servants. This final trumpet signifies the destruction of those who have corrupted the earth, bringing joy and gratitude to the saints for God's righteous judgment.
