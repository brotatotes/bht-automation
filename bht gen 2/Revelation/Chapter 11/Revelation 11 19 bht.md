## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

### Philip Schaff:

2. "No doubt the temple thus spoken of was 'in heaven,' but to the eye of the Seer things in heaven were the type and pattern of the heavenly things on earth.."
3. "The 'ark of God's covenant' is the symbol of God's covenant love to His people; the type of the Incarnate Lord in whose heart the Law of God is laid up, and who is the 'propitiatory' (Romans 3:25) or Mercy-seat."
