# Revelation 11:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The outer court, intended for the worship of Gentiles, signifies a distinct group separate from the internal worshippers of the true church. This court, representing those who have the name but not the true nature of living Christians, will be left to its fate. However, the severe treading upon the holy city, symbolizing the tribulation faced by the church, will not occur until the end of troubled times under the seventh angel's trumpet.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "The different epochs marked by the 2300, 1335, 1290, and 1260 days, will not be fully cleared up till the grand consummation." 
3. "The world power's times never reach the sacred fulness of seven times three hundred sixty, that is, 2520, though they approach to it in 2300."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In forming an estimate of those who, according to the Hebrew notions, were true worshippers of God, only those would be regarded as such who had the privilege of access to the inner court, and to the altar."
2. "The direction to 'measure the temple of God' ... was a direction to take an estimate of what constituted the true church."
3. "The phrase 'should tread under foot' ... would mean that [the Gentiles] would have [the church] under their control or in subjection for the specified time, and that the practical effect of that would be to corrupt and prostrate it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The court which is without the temple... including all that is not within the naov, the Holy and Most Holy places."

2. "At the time when our Lord knew it, and when its condition became to St. John the mould of the future, it contained both true and false members of the Jewish Church."
