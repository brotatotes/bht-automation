# Revelation 11:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The two witnesses mentioned in this passage are seen as symbols of the ministers of the Gospel and the churches of Christ. They have tirelessly borne testimony for Christ and against the forces of evil since the beginning. These witnesses, like select instruments, prophesy with words and actions, testifying to the truth of Jesus as the Son of God and calling people to repentance. In their ministry, they embody deep mourning and concern for the state of the church, which is under the oppression and persecution of the enemy.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The reference is to Zechariah 4:3; Zechariah 4:12, where two individuals are meant, Joshua and Zerubbabel, who ministered to the Jewish Church, just as the two olive trees emptied the oil out of themselves into the bowl of the candlestick."
2. "The actions of the two witnesses are just those of Moses when witnessing for God against Pharaoh, turning the waters into blood, and smiting with plagues; and of Elijah causing fire by his word to devour the enemy, and shutting heaven, so that it rained not for three years and six months."
3. "The two olive trees are channels of the oil feeding the Church, and symbols of peace. The Holy Spirit is the oil in them. Christ's witnesses, in remarkable times of the Church's history, have generally appeared in pairs."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "And I will give power unto my two witnesses... I will grant to my two witnesses the right or the power of prophesying during the time specified... give unto my two witnesses that they may prophesy." 
2. "The word 'two' evidently denotes that the number would be small; and yet it is not necessary to confine it literally to two persons... under the law, two witnesses were required, and were enough, to establish any fact... such a number would during those times be preserved from apostasy as would be sufficient to keep up the evidence of truth."
3. "The word, as used here, refers to those who, during this period of 'forty and two months,' would thus be witnesses for Christ in the world... who would bear their testimony to the truth of his religion... and to what was required of man." (122 words)

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The conception of the Apocalypse is powerfully molded by John's recollections of the life of Jesus; that there is a close parallelism between the Apocalypse and the delineation of the life of Christ contained in the fourth Gospel; and that the Apocalypse is, in the deeper conceptions which pervade it, a repetition of the Gospel."
2. "They shall prophesy... commonly explained of preaching repentance, though some take it in the later sense of foretelling future events."
3. "Clothed in sackcloth. The garb of preachers of repentance."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The use of the word my connected with the two witnesses seems to indicate that it is the Lord who speaks."
2. "The witnesses receive both the words of their prophecy and the power to utter them."
3. "The duty of ‘prophesying’ laid upon them is that of proclaiming the truth of God for the instruction or warning of men."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The idiom that follows is Hebraic instead of either the infinitive after διδωμ as in Revelation 2:7; Revelation 3:21; Revelation 6:4; Revelation 7:2; Revelation 13:7; Revelation 13:15; Revelation 16:8 or ινα with the subjunctive (Revelation 9:5; Revelation 19:8) we have κα προφητευσουσιν (and they shall prophesy)." 
2. "The article seems to point to two well-known characters, like Elijah, Elisha, but there is no possible way to determine who they are. All sorts of identifications have been attempted."
3. "The dress suited the message (Matthew 11:21)."

### John Gill:
1. "By whom are meant, not Enoch and Elias, as some of the ancient fathers thought, who, they supposed, would come before the appearance of Christ, and oppose antichrist, and be slain by him, which sense the Papists greedily catch at."
2. "These witnesses intend the ministers of the Gospel and churches of Christ, who have bore testimony for Christ, and against antichrist, ever since he appeared in the world."
3. "The habit of these witnesses during their time of prophesying follows, clothed in sackcloth; expressive either of their outward state and condition, being poor, mean, and abject, while the followers of the beast are clad in silks, and live deliciously; or else of the inward frame of their minds, as mourning for the sad estate of the church of Christ, groaning under the tyranny and persecutions of antichrist."

### John Wesley:
1. "These seem to be two prophets; two select, eminent instruments."
2. "So long will they prophesy, (even while that last and sharp treading of the holy city continues,) both by word and deed, witnessing that Jesus is the Son of God, the heir of all things, and exhorting all men to repent, and fear, and glorify God."
3. "Clothed in sackcloth — The habit of the deepest mourners, out of sorrow and concern for the people."
