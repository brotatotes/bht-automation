# Revelation 11:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Depicting a scene reminiscent of Zechariah's vision, the mention of two olive trees and candlesticks in this passage serves a new purpose. While Zechariah's imagery referred to specific individuals, here the olive trees symbolize those anointed with divine grace and spiritual gifts. These anointed ones freely share their blessings and proclaim the good news of salvation, acting as representatives of churches and ministers. Their stance before the Lord indicates their complete reliance on Him and recognition of His supreme authority over all things.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The phrase alludes to Zechariah 4:10; Zechariah 4:14, 'the two anointed ones that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.' The article 'the' marks this allusion."
2. "They are 'the two candlesticks,' not that they are the Church, the one candlestick, but as its representative light-bearers... and ministering for its encouragement in a time of apostasy."
3. "The Church in both dispensations has no light in herself, but derives it from the Spirit through the witness of the twofold word, the two olive trees."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "These two 'olive branches' were subsequently declared Revelation 11:14 to be 'the two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.'"
2. "The image is a beautiful one, and expresses a truth of great importance to the world; for God has designed that the lamp of piety shall be kept burning in the churches by truth supplied through ministers and pastors."
3. "The meaning is, that they stood, as it were, in the very presence of God - as, in the tabernacle and temple, the golden candlestick stood 'before' the ark on which was the symbol of the divine presence, though separated from it by a veil."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Two olive trees. See Zechariah 4:0. Candlesticks. See Zechariah 4:0, and note on Matthew 10:15. The God. Read kuriou the Lord. Compare Zechariah 4:14.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The figure is taken from Zechariah 4:0, with this difference, that there we have only one candlestick with an olive tree on either side of it, while here we have two candlesticks as well as two olive trees."
2. "Clear indication is thus given that, whoever the two â€˜witnessesâ€™ may be, each combines in himself the functions both of the olive tree and of the candlestick."
3. "Their â€˜standing before the Lordâ€™ indicates their acceptance in His sight and their readiness to act for Him."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In Zechariah 4:2; Zechariah 4:3; Zechariah 4:14 the lampstand or candlestick is Israel, and the two olive trees apparently Joshua and Zerubbabel, but John makes his own use of this symbolism."
2. "Here the two olive trees and the candlesticks are identical."
3. "Standing (ÎµÏƒÏ„Ï‰Ï„ÎµÏ‚). Masculine perfect active participle agreeing with Î¿Ï…Ï„Î¿ instead of ÎµÏƒÏ„Ï‰ÏƒÎ± agreeing with ÎµÎ»Î±Î¹Î± ÎºÎ± Î»Ï…Ï‡Î½Î¹Î±."

### John Gill:
1. "Who may be compared to olive trees, because of the oil of grace, and the truth of it in them; and because of the gifts of the Spirit of God bestowed on them."
2. "They freely impart their gifts, and the golden oil of the Gospel unto others, and also bring the good tidings of peace and salvation by Christ, of which the olive leaf is a symbol."
3. "This shows that churches, as well as ministers, are designed by the witnesses, since the candlesticks are explained of the churches, Revelation 1:20."

### John Wesley:
1. "These are the two olive trees â€” That is, as Zerubbabel and Joshua, the two olive trees spoken of by Zechariah, were then the two chosen instruments in God's hand, even so shall these be in their season."
2. "Being themselves full of the unction of the Holy One, they shall continually transmit the same to others also."
3. "Standing before the Lord of the earth â€” Always waiting on God, without the help of man, and asserting his right over the earth and all things therein."
