# Revelation 11:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The authority and power of God's witnesses are so great that no one can harm them until they have completed their mission. Just as Moses and Aaron were spared from death by the fire of God's wrath, so too will these witnesses be protected until their work is finished. However, anyone who seeks to harm them will face divine retribution, just like those who opposed Moses and Aaron. The punishment for their actions will mirror the destruction brought forth by devouring fire.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "God makes their inspired denunciations of judgment to come to pass and devour their enemies."
2. "Twice repeated, to mark the immediate certainty of the accomplishment."
3. "Retribution in kind."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'hurt' here means to do 'injury' or 'injustice' - ἀδικῆσαι adikēsai - and may refer to wrong in any form - whether in respect to their character, opinions, persons, or property."
2. "The allusion here, therefore, is to the denunciations which they would utter, or the doctrines which they would preach, and which would have the same effect on their enemies as if they breathed forth fire and flame."
3. "The meaning is fulfilled if their words should in any way produce an effect on their enemies similar to what is produced by fire: that is, if it should destroy their influence; if it should overcome and subdue them; if it should annihilate their domination in the world."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Fire proceedeth. Compare 2 Kings 1:10; Jeremiah 5:14.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There can be no doubt that the allusion is to 2 Kings 1:10; 2 Kings 1:12, although literal fire may not be thought of, but rather those 'words' of the Lord in the mouth of His prophet of which it is said, 'I will make them fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them' (Jeremiah 5:14)." 
2. "In the last half of the verse we have the  lex talionis,  judgment returning in kind upon the oppressors of the just."
3. "These oppressors hurt to the extent of killing, just as the Jews 'went about to kill Jesus' in the days of His flesh. As a consequence,  in this manner must they be killed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is impossible to hurt these two witnesses till they do their work."
2. "The fire proceeding out of the mouths of the witnesses is like Elijah's experience."
3. "The condition is repeated in this changed form, as less likely to happen and with inevitable death."

### John Gill:
1. "by which may be meant the word of God, which they preach and hold forth, which is comparable to fire... both for light... and for the heat of it... and also for the purity in itself... and for its purifying nature... and for its consuming nature..."
2. "the prayers of these witnesses... do not arise from a passionate and revengeful spirit, but from a pure zeal for the glory of God... and which prayers are heard by God, who will avenge his elect..."
3. "the fire out of the mouth of God's faithful servants devours such who introduce divers and strange doctrines... the light of God's word convinces and confounds them, though it may not convert them... there being nothing but a fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery indignation, which shall devour and destroy them, though not corporeally, yet spiritually and eternally..."

### John Wesley:
1. If any would kill them — As the Israelites would have done Moses and Aaron, Numbers 16:41.He must be killed thus — By that devouring fire.
