# Revelation 11:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The witnesses are described as having an authorized power that allows them to shut up the heavens and withhold the rain during the time of their prophesying. This action symbolizes a spiritual drought and a lack of hearing the word of the Lord. Additionally, they have the ability to smite the earth with various plagues, signifying the confusions, wars, and persecutions that arise as a result of their prophecies. These extraordinary powers bestowed upon them cannot be attributed to any ordinary person like Moses or Elijah, highlighting the unique nature of these witnesses.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 6. These . . . power—Greek,
	"authorized power." 
	it rain not—Greek,
	"huetos brechee," "rain shower not,"
	literally, "moisten" not (the earth). 
	smite . . . with all
	plagues—Greek, "with (literally, 'in') every
	plague."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To shut or close up the heavens, therefore, is to restrain the rain from descending, or to produce a drought."
2. "The language, therefore, it seems to me, does not necessarily imply that they would have the power of working miracles."
3. "Anything that would be represented by turning waters into blood, would correspond with all that is necessarily implied in the language."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "To shut up the heaven. As Elijah, 1 Kings 17:1; Luke 4:25; James 5:17. That it rain not [ινα μη βρεχη υετος] . Lit., that the rain may not wet."
2. "To turn them into blood. Compare Exodus 7:19."
3. "To smite [παταξαι] . Used by John only in Revelation, here and Revelation 19:15. Compare Matthew 26:31; Mark 14:27; Luke 22:49, Luke 22:50; Acts 12:7, Acts 12:23. With all plagues [παση πληγη] . Singular number. Rev., correctly, with every plague. See on Mark 3:10. Not merely with the plagues with which Moses smote Egypt."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The power of the witnesses is described in language far stronger than that of the Old Testament."
2. "For three and a half years only was rain kept back by Elijah: the witnesses have power to withhold it during the whole time of their prophecy."
3. "The witnesses may smite the whole earth with 'every plague as often as they shall desire.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "To shut the heaven (κλεισα τον ουρανον). First aorist active infinitive of κλειω. As Elijah did by prayer (1 Kings 17:1; Luke 4:25; James 5:17)."
2. "That it rain not (ινα μη υετος βρεχη). Sub-final use of ινα μη with the present active subjunctive of βρεχω, old verb to rain (Matthew 5:45), here with υετος as subject."
3. "Over the waters (επ των υδατων). 'Upon the waters.' As Moses had (Exodus 7:20)."

### John Gill:
1. "Having the true key of knowledge in matters, both of doctrine and discipline, given them."
2. "The withholding of this rain denotes a famine, not of bread, or a thirst for water, but of hearing the word of the Lord."
3. "Turning of them into blood designs the confusions and wars raised among them on account of the prophesying of these witnesses, and the persecutions and bloodshed which followed upon it."

### John Wesley:
1. "These have power — And they use that power." 
2. "To shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophesying - During those 'twelve hundred and sixty days.'"
3. "To smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will — This is not said of Moses or Elijah, or any mere man besides. And how is it possible to understand this otherwise than of two individual persons?"
