# Revelation 11:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The two witnesses in this passage bear witness to the truth of God until their mission is complete. Even in their death, they serve as a sign that the time of the antichrist's downfall is near. The beast's ultimate victory over them, as foreseen in Daniel, will mark the end of his vicious power. This final war will result in the destruction of the outward religious practices. Though their martyrdom may not be the last, these faithful witnesses remain indomitable until that time.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The same verb is used of Paul's ending his ministry by a violent death."
2. "John at once appropriates the Old Testament prophecies; and also, viewing his whole subject at a glance, mentions as familiar things (though not yet so to the reader) objects to be described hereafter by himself."
3. "It is a proof of the unity that pervades all Scripture."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word may here refer not to 'time,' meaning that these events would occur at the end of the 1260 years, but to the fact that what is here stated would occur when they had completed their testimony... when they had borne full witness for God, and fully uttered his truth." 
2. "The characteristics of the 'beast' are strongly marked... it would seem to have been intended to make it easy to understand what was meant when the power referred to should appear."
3. "This clearly is not intended to be a general statement that they would be persecuted, but to refer to the particular manner in which the opposition would be conducted. It would be in the form of 'war'; that is, there would be an effort to destroy them by arms."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. The beast [Œ∏Œ∑œÅŒπŒøŒΩ] . Wild beast See on ch. Revelation 4:6. A different word from that wrongly translated beast, ch. Revelation 4:6, Revelation 4:7; Revelation 5:6, etc. Compare ch. 13 1; Revelation 17:8, and see Daniel 7:0. Bottomless pit [Œ±Œ≤œÖœÉœÉŒøœÖ] . See on ch. Revelation 9:1.

### Philip Schaff:

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The victory of the beast over the two witnesses is certain, as in Daniel 7:21." 
2. "But his words cover in effect all the martyrdoms and massacres of history in which brute force has seemed to triumph over truth and righteousness."

### John Gill:
1. "Their very death will be a prophesying or foretelling that the ruin of antichrist is at hand."
2. "This will be his last war, and it will be a dreadful one; it will be the last struggle of the beast."
