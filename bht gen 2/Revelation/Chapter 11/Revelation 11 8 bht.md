# Revelation 11:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, the dead bodies of the witnesses are depicted as lying in the street, exposed to contempt and profanation. It is significant because leaving a body unburied was considered dishonorable, and it was treated with contempt. The city referred to here is spiritually and allegorically represented by Jerusalem, which is described as engaging in oppression and wrong towards the people of God. This great city can be understood as symbolizing a corrupted form of Christianity that has succumbed to the ways of the world.
