# Revelation 11:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During the prophetic present, the spectators from all nations come to see the bodies of the witnesses. These bodies are left unburied, exposed for three and a half days. Despite their miserable state, the onlookers show no sympathy. The world seems to delight in their suffering, preventing their burial and adding to the contempt and injury. The time of exposure, while uncomfortable and deplorable, is significant. It may allude to historical events, symbolizing the duration of persecution and the triumph of evil forces. The exactness of the times mentioned in this prophecy emphasizes the fulfillment of God's plan.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The prophetic present."
2. "Three and a half days answer to the three and a half years, the half of seven, the full and perfect number."
3. "Accordingly, in righteous retribution in kind, the flesh of the Antichristian hosts is not buried, but given to all the fowls in mid-heaven to eat."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The essential idea is, that there would be an assemblage of different classes of people to whom their carcasses would be exposed, and that they would come and look upon them."
2. "That is, a state of things will occur as if these witnesses were put to death, and their carcasses were publicly exposed."
3. "This would find a fulfillment if, in a time of persecution, those who had borne faithful testimony were silenced and treated with dishonor and if there should be those who were disposed to show them respect, but who would be prevented by positive acts on the part of their persecutors."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Shall see [βλεψουσιν]. Read, blepousin do men look (Rev.), and see on John 1:29." 
2. "Shall not suffer [ουκ αφησουσιν]. Read ajfiousin do not suffer." 
3. "To be put in graves [τεθηναι εις μνηματα]. Read mnhma a tomb, as Rev. Compare Genesis 23:4; Isaiah 14:19, Isaiah 14:20."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The spectators mentioned in this verse come from the whole world in its fourfold designation of peoples and tribes and tongues and nations."
2. "All look upon the 'dead body' of the witnesses without commiseration for the miserable state in which it lies."
3. "That during this period the world suffers not their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb heightens the picture of contempt and injury."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Three days and a half (ημερας τρεις κα ημισυ). Accusative of extent of time. Hημισυ is neuter singular though ημερας (days) is feminine as in Mark 6:23; Revelation 12:14. The days of the gloating over the dead bodies are as many as the years of the prophesying by the witnesses (Revelation 11:3), but there is no necessary correspondence (day for a year). This delight of the spectators 'is represented as at once fiendish and childish' (Swete)."
2. "This use of αφιημ with the infinitive is here alone in the Apocalypse, though common elsewhere (John 11:44; John 11:48; John 12:7; John 18:8)."
3. "In a country where burial regularly took place on the day of death the time of exposure and indignity would be regarded long"

### John Gill:
1. "It represents their case as being very uncomfortable, and deplorable."
2. "It is made a question, whether this war with the witnesses, and the slaughter of them, and their lying unburied, are over or not."
3. "There may be an allusion, in this space of time, to the time that Antiochus, called Epiphanes, held Jerusalem in his hands, after he had conquered it, which was just three years and six months."

### John Wesley:
1. "Three days and a half - So exactly are the times set down in this prophecy." 
2. "If we suppose this time began in the evening, and ended in the morning, and included (which is no way impossible) Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, the weekly festival of the Turkish people, the Jewish tribes, and the Christian tongues." 
3. "Then all these together, with the heathen nations, would have full leisure to gaze upon and rejoice over them."
