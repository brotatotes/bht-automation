# Revelation 12:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The vision of a woman in the heavens represents the state of the church on earth. She is described as clothed with the sun, depicting her present state on earth rather than her future glory. The crown of twelve stars on her head symbolizes the ministers of the Gospel, likened to stars, and the doctrine they preach. This imagery highlights the important role of the church and its ministers in spreading the light of the Gospel to the world.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Church has the moon, therefore, under her feet; but the stars, as heavenly lights, on her head."
2. "The sun, moon, and twelve stars, are emblematical of Jacob, Leah, or else Rachel, and the twelve patriarchs, that is, the Jewish Church: secondarily, the Church universal."
3. "The characteristic of woman, in contradistinction to man, is her being subject, the surrendering of herself, her being receptive. This similarly is man's relation to God, to be subject to, and receive from, God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The woman, beyond all question, represents the church."
2. "Is the splendor of the sunlight designed to denote the brightness of the gospel? Is the moon designed to represent the comparatively feeble light of the Jewish dispensation?"
3. "That is, there were twelve sparkling gems in the crown which she wore. This would, of course, greatly increase the beauty of the vision; and there can be no doubt that the number twelve here is significant."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Wonder [σημειον] . Better, as Rev., sign."
2. "Clothed [περιβεβλημενη] . Rev., better, arrayed."
3. "The moon under her feet. See Song of Solomon 6:10. The symbol is usually taken to represent the Church."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In order to ascertain the meaning we must take sun, moon, and stars together; and, when we do so, the idea appears to be that the woman is completely enveloped in light."
2. "The stars are not set as jewels in her crown. They are her crown, a crown of victory."
3. "The woman is a conqueror, and twelve is the number of the Church."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The first 'sign in heaven' is a Woman--the earliest appearance of a female figure in the Apocalyptic vision." 
2. "The metaphor of childbirth is common enough."
3. "The figure is a bold one with the moon 'under her feet' and 'a crown of twelve stars,' a possible allusion to the twelve tribes or to the twelve apostles."

### John Gill:
1. "This vision was seen 'in heavens', whither John was called up to ... and which was an emblem of the state of the church on earth."
2. "And who is further described by her habit and attire, clothed with the sun; which does not point at her future state in glory ... but to her then present state on earth."
3. "By 'stars' are meant the ministers of the Gospel, which Christ holds in his right hand, and the church here bears on her head ... the crown, which was composed of these stars, designs the doctrine which they preached."
