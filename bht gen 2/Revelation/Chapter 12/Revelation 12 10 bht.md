# Revelation 12:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Salvation has been obtained through Christ's sufferings and death, and is fully realized for believers in heaven. The power of God is displayed in the defeat of the enemy, casting out the accuser of the saints. This victory is a testament to Christ's authority, which he received from the Father. As the saints continue to battle against Satan on earth, they are encouraged to cry out to God day and night for deliverance.
