# Revelation 12:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As the thread of the discourse is resumed, it becomes evident that the dragon, enraged and filled with wrath, once again persecutes the woman who gave birth to the man. This persecution, distinct from the previous ones, occurs just before the third woe and marks a significant turning point in the history of the church. In later centuries, the church would experience fierce persecution by various heathen powers, symbolizing the ongoing conflict between light and darkness in the visible world. The accounts of those times bear witness to the ferocity with which the dragon pursued the woman and the church.

3.

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "John now, after the 'voice' in Revelation 12:10-13, returns to the narrative in verse Revelation 12:9. The child was caught away in verse Revelation 12:5, and now the woman (the true Israel on earth) is given deadly persecution."

### John Gill:
1. "he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man [child]: he was enraged at the church, and pursued her with great wrath, who had brought forth a Christian emperor, by whom the kingdom of Christ was encouraged and supported in the empire"
2. "this persecution cannot be understood of the persecution raised by the Jews, under the instigation of Satan, against the Christian church, quickly after the ascension of Christ to heaven, for then the dragon had his place and power in the Roman empire, whereas this persecution was not till after the downfall of Paganism in it"
3. "these were Christian emperors in name, but they exercised all the cruelties of the Heathen ones, if they did not exceed them; and a greater regard was shown to Paganism than to the orthodox religion."
