# Revelation 12:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The church, represented figuratively as a woman, is protected and supported during times of persecution and trials. The two wings of the great eagle are symbolic of the means by which the church is upheld. This could refer to the two testaments or the graces of faith and hope. The mention of a place in the wilderness suggests a safe refuge for the church, mirroring God's deliverance and preservation of his people in the past. Amidst various persecutions, Christianity was remarkably propagated, testifying to God's faithfulness in sustaining his church throughout history.
