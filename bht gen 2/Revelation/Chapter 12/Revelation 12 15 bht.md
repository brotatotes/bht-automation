# Revelation 12:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The flood mentioned in this passage could represent the stream of Germanic tribes that threatened to destroy Christianity. Alternatively, it may symbolize the errors and heresies that emerged during a specific time period. The serpent, known for his deceit, seeks to drown the woman and obstruct her escape. However, the earth intervenes and helps her, representing the consolidated and civilized world. This passage reminds us of Satan's relentless attempts to destroy the church and underscores the need for divine and earthly assistance in times of persecution and heresy.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The flood, or river, is the stream of Germanic tribes which, pouring on Rome, threatened to destroy Christianity."
2. "But the earth helped the woman, by swallowing up the flood. The earth, as contradistinguished from water, is the world consolidated and civilized."
3. "Perhaps it includes also, generally, the help given by earthly powers (those least likely, yet led by God's overruling providence to give help) to the Church against persecutions and also heresies, by which she has been at various times assailed."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The woman is represented as having wings, and as being able thus to escape from the serpent."
2. "The figure here would well represent the continued malice of the papal body against the true church, in those dark ages when it was sunk in obscurity... That malice never slumbered, but was continually manifesting itself in some new form, as if it were the purpose of papal Rome to sweep it entirely away."
3. "The truth taught is, that Satan leaves no effort untried to destroy the church."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Cause her to be carried away of the flood: a river-born one."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The serpent could not follow the woman or stop her flight and so sought to drown her."
2. "That he might cause her to be carried away by the stream."
3. "It means simply 'carried away by the river'."

### John Gill:
1. "That flood of errors and heresies, which were poured in between the times of Constantine and the rise of antichrist may be here intended."
2. "And this flood of errors and heresies may be truly said to be cast out of the serpent's mouth; since the old serpent, the devil, is the father of all lies, and errors."
3. "So that this flood is contemporary with the first four trumpets; after which followed the swarms of locusts, the Saracens, which infested, teased, and tormented the 'eastern' empire; and after them the Turks, the four angels bound at the great river Euphrates, were let loose, and like a mighty torrent overflowed, and utterly destroyed it."
