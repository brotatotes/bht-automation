# Revelation 12:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the face of persecution, the earth sympathizes with and interposes to save the woman. It opens itself to receive and protect her from the serpent's attacks. This intervention by the earth is not unprecedented, as Herodotus mentions an example of a river disappearing underground. The earth's assistance to the woman can be seen as a symbolic representation of historical events, such as the Goths' invasion and their attacks on the Arians. These interventions, similar to the Philistines helping David evade Saul, reveal how sometimes even wicked individuals inadvertently serve the purpose of saving the righteous.

3. "During the dark ages many such interventions occurred, saving the church from utter destruction."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
