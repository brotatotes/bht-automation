# Revelation 12:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The woman in this passage, representing the church, endures pain and travail, symbolizing the hardships and struggles faced by believers. Just as a woman in labor cries out, the church cries out in prayer and longing for the coming of God's kingdom. Through these sufferings, the church brings forth many souls to Christ and experiences the fruitful expansion and protection of the Lord. The pains and persecutions endured by the church throughout history are part of the journey towards the ultimate triumph and fulfillment of God's purposes.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "There is a plain contrast between the painful travailing of the woman here, and Christ's second coming to the Jewish Church..."
2. "...she receives (at His second advent), as if born to her, Messiah and a numerous seed."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The woman is evidently designed to symbolize the church; and in this there is a pretty general agreement among interpreters."
2. "The other opinion is, that the woman here refers to the Christian church, and that the object is to represent that church as about to be enlarged...protected in a manner that would be well represented by the saving of the child of the woman, and bearing it up to heaven, to a place of safety - an act implying that, notwithstanding all dangers, the progress and enlargement of the church was ultimately certain."
3. "The design of the whole, therefore, I apprehend, is to represent the peril of the church at the time when it was about to be greatly enlarged, or in a season of prosperity, from the rise of a formidable enemy that would stand ready to destroy it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Travailing in birth...In pain" (from the commentary on Revelation 12:2) 
2. "Compare Isaiah 66:7, Isaiah 66:8; John 16:21" (from the commentary on Revelation 12:2)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To the question, Who is this woman? different answers have been given. We need not dwell upon them."
2. "In one sense or another she must be the Church of God, yet not the mere Jewish Church, but the Church in the largest conception that we can form of it, as first indeed planted in Israel but afterwards extended to all nations."
3. "The Church, therefore, may properly be described by images taken from the history of Christâ€™s own mother and of His own nativity."

3. "'And tormented' (present passive participle of Î²Î±ÏƒÎ±Î½Î¹Î¶Ï‰, for which see already Revelation 9:5; Revelation 11:10), only here in N.T. in sense of childbirth."

### John Gill:

### John Wesley:
1. "The very pain, without any outward opposition, would constrain a woman in travail to cry out."
