# Revelation 12:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Describing a fearsome beast with seven heads and ten horns, adorned with seven crowns, this imagery reveals the representation of the Roman Pagan empire. This empire, influenced by Satan, resembled a cunning and cruel dragon, known for its idolatry and persecution of Christians. The seven heads can be understood as either the hills of Rome or the succession of different government forms within the empire. The ten horns signifies the ten kingdoms that arose from the empire or the ten Roman emperors who oppressed believers. In summary, this portrayal presents a powerful creature embodying wisdom and a fierce nature.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "His representative, the beast, corresponds, having seven heads and ten horns... here, seven crowns (rather, 'diadems,' Greek, 'diademata,' not stephanoi, 'wreaths') are upon his seven heads." 
2. "His universal dominion as prince of this fallen world is implied by the seven diadems (contrast the 'many diadems on Christ's head,' Daniel 7:4-27.7.7- :, when coming to destroy him and his), the caricature of the seven Spirits of God."
3. "His worldly instruments of power are marked by the ten horns, ten being the number of the world. It marks his self-contradictions that he and the beast bear both the number seven (the divine number) and ten (the world number)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There was much that was fabulous respecting this monster, and many notions were attached to the dragon which did not exist in reality, and which were ascribed to it by the imagination at a time when natural history was little understood."
2. "It was a work of vast power, controlling kings and nations for ages, and could have been accomplished only by one to whom the appellation used here could be given."
3. "The creature that John saw was indeed a monster, and we are not to expect entire congruity in the details. It is sufficient that the main idea is preserved."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Red [œÄœÖœÅœÅŒøœÇ] . See on ch. Revelation 6:4."
2. "Dragon [Œ¥œÅŒ±Œ∫œâŒΩ] . Satan. See ver. 9."
3. "Crowns [Œ¥ŒπŒ±Œ¥Œ∑ŒºŒ±œÑŒ±] . The Kingly crown, not the chaplet [œÉœÑŒµœÜŒ±ŒΩŒøœÇ] . See on ch. Revelation 2:10."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The dragon is 'great' in power. He is 'red' with the colour of blood because he kills men."
2. "He has 'seven heads and ten horns,' a figure by which is indicated his rule over all the kingdoms of this world as well as the force with which he rules them."
3. "Even in the greatest lustre of his might the dragon is not a conqueror."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A second tableau following close upon the first and inseparable from it."
2. "Homer uses this old word (probably from Œ¥ŒµœÅŒ∫ŒøŒºŒ±, to see clearly) for a great monster with three heads coiled like a serpent that ate poisonous herbs."
3. "If Christ as Conqueror has 'many diadems,' it is not strange that Satan should wear seven (ten in Revelation 13:1)."

### John Gill:
1. "The Roman Pagan empire, as under the influence of Satan, the god of this world, is fitly compared to a 'dragon', for its policy and cunning in circumventing and ensnaring the professors of Christianity; and for its cruelty and inhumanity in persecuting of them; and for its poison of idolatry, will worship, and superstition."
2. "The 'seven heads' of the Roman empire either design the seven mountains, or hills, on which Rome, the metropolis of the empire, was built, or rather the seven forms of government which successively should obtain in the empire."
3. "By the 'ten horns' are meant either the ten kingdoms which should hereafter arise out of the Roman empire, and whose kings should give their kingdoms to the beast; or the ten Roman emperors, the persecutors of the Christians; or rather the ten provinces, or jurisdictions, which the empire was divided into while Pagan."

### John Wesley:
1. "His fiery-red colour denoting his disposition."
2. "Implying vast wisdom."
3. "Emblems of mighty power and strength, which he still retained."
