# Revelation 12:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The dragon seeks to persuade others to turn away from their heavenly calling and become earthly, like himself. He exercises his power to try to destroy the child born to the woman. This parallels the actions of Pharaoh in the Old Testament, who was referred to as a dragon and sought to kill the male children of Israel. The dragon's attempts to harm the child can be seen as a reflection of the ongoing battle between good and evil, with evil seeking to hinder the spread of Christ's kingdom.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "His dragging down the stars with his tail (lashed back and forward in his fury) implies his persuading to apostatize, like himself, and to become earthy, those angels and also once eminent human teachers who had formerly been heavenly."
2. "About to bring forth, that when she brought forth, he might devour her child."
3. "Antitypically the true Israel, Jesus, when born, was sought for destruction by Herod, who slew all the males in and around Bethlehem."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word rendered 'drew' - συρω surō - means to 'draw, drag, haul.'" 
2. "The main idea here undoubtedly is that of power, and the object of John is to show that the power of the dragon was as if it extended to the stars, and as if it dragged down a third part of them to the earth, or swept them away with its tail, leaving two-thirds unaffected."
3. "A sufficient fulfillment is found if there was a period when the church, bright, glorious, and prosperous, was apparently about to become greatly enlarged, but when the monstrous pagan power still held its sway over a considerable part of the world, exposing the church to persecution."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In these words we have the dragon doing what Pharaoh did to Israel (Exodus 1:15-22), and again and again, in the Psalms and the Prophets, Pharaoh is spoken of as the dragon."
2. "Nor is it without interest to remember that Pharaoh's crown was wreathed with a dragon (the asp or serpent of Egypt), and that just as the eagle was the ensign of Rome, so the dragon was that of Egypt."
3. "Hence the significance of Moses' rod being turned into a serpent."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The woman was pregnant with life, the dragon can do nothing but destroy."
2. "Enough that it designates great influence for evil, yet influence restrained by a power mightier than its own."
3. "The dragon is in direct contrast with the woman. She is to bear a living child: he would destroy it as soon as it was born."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Perhaps only the third is meant to soften the picture as in Revelation 8:7." 
2. "Charles takes this to refer to a war in heaven between the good angels and Satan, with the fall of some angels (Jude 1:6)." 
3. "This is what Pharaoh did to Israel (Exodus 1:15-22; Psalms 85:13; Isaiah 27:1; Isaiah 51:9; Ezekiel 29:3)."

### John Gill:
1. "This is said in allusion to Antiochus Epiphanes...and designs either the subduing of the third part of the principalities, states, and kingdoms of the known world, to the Roman empire, through its great power and strength...or else the influence the dragon should have upon the ministers of the word, who are compared to stars."
2. "Causing them to relinquish their ministry, and drop their heavenly employment, and fall from that high and honorable state in which they were, into a carnal, earthly, and worldly religion; and that either through policy, cunning, and flattery, or through sorcery, magic art, lying oracles, and prophecy."
3. "The instances Brightman produces are appropriate, and to the purpose; as of Maximinus destroying Alexander the son of Mammea, who he saw was inclined to the Christians; and of Decius taking off the two Philips, father and son, who were favorable to their cause."

### John Wesley:
1. "His tail — His falsehood and subtilty.Draweth — As a train." 
2. "The third part — A very large number.Of the stars of heaven — The Christians and their teachers, who before sat in heavenly places with Christ Jesus."
3. "And the dragon stood before the woman, that when she had brought forth, he might devour the child — That he might hinder the kingdom of Christ from spreading abroad, as it does under this trumpet."
