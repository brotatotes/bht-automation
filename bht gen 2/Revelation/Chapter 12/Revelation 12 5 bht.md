# Revelation 12:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The birth of the male child signifies Christ's kingdom, not just Christ himself. As members of the church, we are united with Christ, carrying his name and reflecting his image. This birth also represents the growth of the Christian faith, with many nations and rulers being added to the church. It is a reminder of Christ's future reign over all nations when the time comes for him to rule with power and authority.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The male son's birth cannot be the origin of the Christian state... which was not a divine child of the woman, but had many impure worldly elements."
2. "The ascending of the witnesses up to heaven answers to Christ's own ascension, 'caught up unto God, and unto His throne'."
3. "What took place primarily in the case of the divine Son of the woman, shall take place also in the case of those who are one with Him, the sealed of Israel, and the elect of all nations, about to be translated and to reign with Him over the earth at His appearing."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The church thus represented was destined to reign in all the earth, or all the earth was to become subject to its laws."
2. "The ascendency of religion over the understandings and consciences of people would be irresistible - as firm as a government administered under a scepter of iron."
3. "The old pagan power was concentrated in Maximin, who was emperor from the Nile to the Bosphorus, and who raged against the gospel and the church 'with Satanic enmity.' The last struggle of pagan Rome to destroy the church by persecution, before the triumph of Constantine, and the public establishment of the Christian religion, might be well represented by the attempt of the dragon to destroy the child; and the safety of the church, and its complete deliverance from pagan persecution, by the symbol of a child caught up to heaven, and placed near the throne of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The correct reading is arsen, the neuter, not agreeing with the masculine individual [œÖŒπŒøŒΩ œÉŒøŒΩ] but with the neuter of the genus. The object is to emphasize, not the sex, but the quality of Masculinity - power and vigor." 
2. "To rule [œÄŒøŒπŒºŒ±ŒπŒΩŒµŒπŒΩ] . Lit., to shepherd or tend."
3. "A rod of iron. Compare Psalms 2:9."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The object is not simply to tell us that the 'son' is a male, which as a son he must be, but to impress upon us the thought of his manhood, power, and force."
2. "He is already more than a child; the properties of manhood belong to Him from His birth."
3. "The function of this Son is as a shepherd to tend all the nations with a sceptre of iron. He is to subdue and rule the hostile world."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "She bore a son... A man child... The word is old... only in this chapter in the Apocalypse."
2. "Who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron... His rule will go beyond the Jews."
3. "First aorist passive indicative of Œ±œÅœÄŒ±Œ∂œâ, old verb for seizing or snatching away... Reference to the ascension of Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ mystically, or Christ in his members, who are called by his name, because he is formed in them, and they are the seed of the woman, the church."
2. "This may be applied to Christ mystical, the seed of the church, and members of Christ...relate to their reign with Christ on earth, when they shall sit on thrones, and judge the world."
3. "The church in Constantine's time: and this may also take in the accession of Constantine himself to the imperial throne, which was the throne of God; for kings have their sceptres, thrones, and kingdoms from him, they his viceregents."

### John Wesley:
1. "And she brought forth a man child ‚Äì Even Christ, considered not in his person, but in his kingdom."
2. "In the ninth age, many nations with their princes were added to the Christian church."
3. "Who was to rule all nations ‚Äì When his time is come."
