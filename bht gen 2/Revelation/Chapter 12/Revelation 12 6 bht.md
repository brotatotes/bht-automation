# Revelation 12:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During her pilgrimage, the Church faced challenges and sought refuge in the wilderness. This refuge symbolizes a place of obscurity where the true Church could find shelter and nourishment. Just as the woman in Revelation fled to the wilderness, God's people have historically found solace and protection during times of opposition and persecution. The wilderness represents a safe and secluded place, prepared by God, where the Church can find sustenance and be cared for by faithful ministers of the Gospel. This symbolism reminds us that even in the darkest times, God provides for and protects His people.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The woman, the Church, fled into the wilderness." 
2. "The heathen world, the wilderness, could not nourish the Church, but only afford her an outward shelter."
3. "The deeper the Church penetrated into heathendom, the more she herself became heathenish."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Having briefly referred to this, the writer Revelation 12:7-13 gives an account of the efforts of Satan consequent on the removal of the child to heaven."
2. "The true church became for a time obscure and unknown - as if it had fled away from the habitations of people, and had retired to the solitude and loneliness of a desert."
3. "The true church, though obscure and almost unknown, would be the object of the divine protection and care - a beautiful representation of the church during the corruptions of the papacy and the darkness of the middle ages."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Of God [Î±Ï€Î¿ Ï„Î¿Ï… Î¸ÎµÎ¿Ï…] . Lit., from God, the preposition marking the source from which the preparation came. For a similar use, see James 1:13, "tempted of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The flight of Elijah into the wilderness, perhaps even the temptation of our Lord there, is present to the writerâ€™s mind; and the words are applicable to the condition of the Church during her whole pilgrimage state in the present world."
2. "The first is ideal, the second actual. Strictly speaking, the woman in Revelation 12:1-6 is neither the Jewish nor the Christian Church. She is light from Him 'who is light, and with whom there is no darkness at all,' light which had been always shining before it was partially embodied either in the Church of the old or the new covenant."
3. "As the woman is ideal light, light before it appears in the Church upon earth, so the dragon is ideal darkness, the power of sin before it begins its deadly warfare against the children of God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The phrases used here seem to be reminiscent of Deuteronomy 8:2 (wanderings of Israel in the wilderness), 1 Kings 17:2 and Revelation 19:3 (Elijah's flight), I Macc. 2:29 (flight of the Jews from Antiochus Epiphanes), Matthew 2:13 (flight of Joseph and Mary to Egypt), Mark 13:14 (the flight of Christians at the destruction of Jerusalem)." 
2. "Hebrew redundancy (where--there) as in Revelation 3:8; Revelation 8:9; Revelation 8:9; Revelation 13:8; Revelation 13:12; Revelation 17:9; Revelation 20:8."
3. "This anticipatory symbolism is repeated in Revelation 12:13."

### John Gill:
1. "God has had, and will have a church in the worst of times; as he reserved a number in Elijah's time, so he did in the times of the antichristian apostasy, who bowed not the knee to idolatry."
2. "The wilderness is a place of retirement and safety, as well as obscurity."
3. "The church in the wilderness is fed and nourished with the Gospel, and the ordinances of it, by the faithful ministers of the word, the two witnesses that prophesy in sackcloth."

### John Wesley:
1. "And the woman fled into the wilderness - This wilderness is undoubtedly on earth...in a part of it where the woman had not been before." 
2. "In this wilderness, God had already prepared a place; that is, made it safe and convenient for her...those countries of Europe which lie on this side the Danube."
3. "So long the woman enjoyed a safe and convenient place in Europe...where she was fed, till God provided for her more plentifully at the Reformation."
