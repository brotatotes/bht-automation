# Revelation 12:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Satan's opposition to the kingdom of God led to war in heaven, but his ability to accuse the saints before God came to an end. Michael, a created angel, encountered Satan in a dispute but showed humility by refraining from making a railing accusation, instead saying, The Lord rebuke you. The name Michael itself signifies reverence and distance from self-exaltation, reflecting his deep respect for God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In the O. T. we find the adversary Satan in heaven. In Job 1:2 , he appears before God as the Tempter of His saints: in Zechariah 3:0 we have him accusing Joshua the High-priest in God’s presence. Again our Lord in Luk 10:18 exclaims, 'I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven,' where see note. Cf. also John 12:31 . So that this casting down of Satan from the office of accuser in heaven was evidently connected with the great justifying work of redemption." 
2. "The war here spoken of appears in some of its features in the book of Daniel, ch. Daniel 10:13 ; Daniel 10:21 , Daniel 12:1 . In Jud 1:9 also we find Michael the adversary of the devil in the matter of the saints of God)" 
3. "Their victory over Satan was grounded in, was a consequence of, His having shed his precious blood: without that, the adversary’s charges against them would have been unanswerable."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "When Christ appeared before God as our Advocate, Satan, the accusing adversary, could no longer appear before God against us, but was cast out judicially."
2. "It was fittingly ordered that, as the rebellion arose from unfaithful angels and their leader, so they should be encountered and overcome by faithful angels and their archangel, in heaven."
3. "The conflict in heaven, though judicially decided already against Satan from the time of Christ's resurrection and ascension, receives its actual completion in the execution of judgment by the angels who cast out Satan from heaven."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There was a state of things existing in regard to the woman and the child - the church in the condition in which it would then be - which would be well represented by a war in heaven; that is, by a conflict between the powers of good and evil, of light and darkness."
2. "All the analogies which throw any light on the subject, as well as the uniform statements of the Bible, lead us to suppose that good beings of other worlds feel an interest in the welfare of the redeemed church below."
3. "What weapons Satan may use to destroy the church, and in what way his efforts may be counteracted by holy angels, are points on which we can have little knowledge. It is sufficient to know that the fact of such a struggle is not improbable, and that Satan is successfully resisted by the leader of the heavenly host."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "War in heaven. Compare 1 Kings 22:0; Job 1:2; Zechariah 3:0; Luke 10:18." 
2. "Michael. See Daniel 10:13, Daniel 10:21; Daniel 12:1; and on Jude 1:9."
3. "Fought [επολεμησαν]. The correct reading is tou polemhsai to fight. So Rev., 'going forth to war against the dragon [κατα του δρακοντος].' The correct reading is meta with."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The birth and rapture of the Woman's Son issue in a war which invades the επουρανια" (Swete).
2. "We are not to visualize it too literally, but certainly modern airplanes help us to grasp the notion of battles in the sky even more than the phalanxes of storm-clouds" (Swete).
3. "Michael is the champion of the Jewish people and is called the archangel in Jude 1:9" (Swete).

### John Gill:
1. "Not in the third heaven, the habitation of God, the seat of the angels and glorified saints, there is no discord, jars, and contentions there, nothing but peace, love, and joy."
2. "The war refers not to the dispute between Michael the archangel and the devil about the body of Moses...nor to the of the angels when they rebelled against God...nor to that ancient and stated enmity between the seed of the serpent and the seed of the woman...nor to the combats which Christ personally had with Satan and his powers...but rather to the conflict which Christ and his people had with the rulers of the darkness of this world."
3. "Jesus Christ...is the Archangel, the first of the chief princes, the head of all principality and power, who is on the side of the Lord's people, pleads their cause, defends their persons, and saves them."

### John Wesley:
1. "And there was war in heaven — Here Satan makes his grand opposition to the kingdom of God; but an end is now put to his accusing the saints before God."
2. "That Michael is a created angel, appears from his not daring, in disputing with Satan, Jude 9, to bring a railing accusation; but only saying, 'The Lord rebuke thee.'"
3. "And this modesty is implied in his very name; for Michael signifies, 'Who is like God?' which implies also his deep reverence toward God, and distance from all self-exaltation."
