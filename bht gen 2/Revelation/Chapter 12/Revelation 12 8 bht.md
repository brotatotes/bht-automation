# Revelation 12:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The downfall of Satan and his angels is evident in the fact that they were unable to prevail against Michael and his angels. Their defeat led to the complete removal of their place and authority in heaven. This expulsion of Satan from his heavenly position is a profound and mysterious event, which is similar to other passages in the Bible that depict his defeat and ultimate downfall.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "There are four gradations in the ever deeper downfall of Satan."
2. "He is deprived of his heavenly excellency, though having still access to heaven as man's accuser, up to Christ's first coming."
3. "From Christ, down to the millennium, he is judicially cast out of heaven as the accuser of the elect, and shortly before the millennium loses his power against Israel, and has sentence of expulsion fully executed on him and his by Michael."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Satan and his angels failed in their purpose."
2. "They were cast out, and were seen there no more."
3. "The idea is, that they were defeated and driven away, though for a time they were suffered to carry on the warfare elsewhere."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Prevailed [ισχυσαν] . See on Luke 14:30; Luke 16:3; James 5:16.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "And they prevailed not (κα ουκ ισχυσαν). Here κα equals "and yet" or "but." A few MSS. read the singular ισχυσεν like επολεμησεν, but wrongly so."
2. "Neither was their place found any more (ουδε τοπος ευρεθη αυτων ετ). First aorist passive indicative of ευρισκω, to find. Probably αυτων is the objective genitive (place for them), just as in Revelation 20:11 αυτοις (dative, for them) is used with τοπος ουχ ευρεθη."
3. "The dragon is finally expelled from heaven (cf. Job 1:6), though to us it seems a difficult conception to think of Satan having had access to heaven."

### John Gill:
1. "the dragon, or the devil, and his angels, prevailed not against Michael and his angels; but, on the other hand, were conquered by them"
2. "neither was their place found any more in heaven; in the Roman empire; or 'his place'"
3. "Satan the prince of the world, who had long governed in it, was now cast out of all power and authority in it"

### John Wesley:
1. "The dragon himself is principally mentioned; but his angels, likewise, are to be understood."
2. "Neither was this place found any more in heaven — So till now he had a place in heaven."
3. "How deep a mystery is this! One may compare this with Luke 10:18; Ephesians 2:2; 4:8; 6:12."
