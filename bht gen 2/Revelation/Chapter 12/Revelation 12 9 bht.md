# Revelation 12:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
And the great dragon, that old serpent, was cast out of heaven, marking a glorious consummation of his fall from power and authority in the Roman empire. He deceives the whole world, just as he deceived Adam and Eve in the form of an ancient serpent, leading them and all of mankind into unbelief and wickedness. This expulsion from heaven demonstrates the greatness of his fall and the lowliness of those he subsequently influences, including savage people and the followers of the antichrist.
