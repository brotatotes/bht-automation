# Revelation 13:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Beware of the imminent danger that lies ahead, both from external force and internal deceit. Arm yourself with the full armor of God to withstand these threats. The beast, representing a powerful empire or kingdom, is not only a secular ruler but also a deceitful false prophet. This can be seen in the context of the Romish Papacy, a dominion that has endured for centuries. Take heed and stay vigilant in the face of this formidable adversary.
