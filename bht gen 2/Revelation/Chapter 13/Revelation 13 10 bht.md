# Revelation 13:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In facing captivity and persecution, the saints are reminded that justice will be served. The ones who lead others into captivity and shed blood will face a similar fate themselves, as the devil who leads people captive will ultimately be cast into the lake of fire. The beast, symbolizing the antichrist, will receive just retaliation for the bloodshed of the saints. In light of these trials, the patience and faith of the saints are tested, requiring them to believe in the ultimate destruction of the antichrist and to wait patiently for that time to come.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Herein, in bearing their appointed sufferings, lies the patient endurance of the saints."
2. "As of old, so now, those to be persecuted by the beast in various ways have their trials severally appointed them by God's fixed counsel."
3. "As the first beast is to be met by patience and faith, the second beast must be opposed by true wisdom."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The general truth is, that people will, in the course of things, be dealt with according to their character and their treatment of others; that nations characterized by war and conquests will be subject to the evils of war and conquest - or that they may expect to share the same lot which they have brought on others."
2. "This is strikingly descriptive of Rome, considered in any and every point of view, whether under the republic or the empire, whether secular or ecclesiastical, whether pagan or papal."
3. "Such a power as that of Rome will not be likely to be overcome but by the force of arms; and the probability is that it will ultimately be overthrown in a bloody revolution, or by foreign conquest."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity if any man is for captivity into captivity he goeth." 
2. "The persecutors of the Church shall suffer that which they inflict on the saints." 
3. "The thought that God judgeth in the earth."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If any one is for captivity, into captivity he goeth: if any one shall kill with the sword, with the sword must he be killed." - In a climax of two clauses, consolation is afforded to the righteous amidst all their trials. There is a lex talionis in the dealings of God. They who lead His people into captivity, they who kill them with the sword, shall experience a similar fate.
2. "Here is the patience and the faith of the saints." - For surely there is enough to nerve our patience and to stimulate our faith in the thought that ‘God judgeth in the earth,’ and that it is a righteous thing with Him ‘to recompense tribulation’ to them that trouble His people.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "John means this as a warning to the Christians not to resist force with force, but to accept captivity as he had done as a means of grace."
2. "The text is not certain, however."
3. "The killer is killed."

### John Gill:
1. "He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity.... the devil, by whom men are led captive...shall be taken and cast into the lake which burns with fire and brimstone."
2. "He that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword.... there will be a just retaliation made to the antichristian beast...because he has shed much blood of the saints, blood shall be given him to drink."
3. "Here is the patience and the faith of the saints; meaning either that hereby, through the cruelties and barbarities of the Romish antichrist, the patience and faith of the saints are tried...or else the sense is, that it requires both faith and patience in the saints, to believe that antichrist will be thus destroyed, and to wait quietly till the time comes."
