# Revelation 13:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The second beast, although related to the first beast, presents itself in a different manner, with a false appearance of righteousness and humility. It performs deceitful signs and powers, forcing people into idolatry and subjecting those who resist to its cruel rule. While it may present itself as meek and gentle like a lamb, its true nature is that of a fierce and prideful dragon, driven by ambition and tyranny disguised behind a facade of servitude.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The sacerdotal persecuting power, pagan and Christian; the pagan priesthood making an image of the emperors which they compelled Christians to worship, and working wonders by magic and omens; the Romish priesthood, the inheritors of pagan rites, images, and superstitions, lamb-like in Christian professions, dragon-like in word and act."
2. "The second [beast's] manifold character is marked by the Lord, 'Many false prophets shall rise,' where He is speaking of the last days."
3. "The first beast is physical and political; the second a spiritual power, the power of knowledge, ideas… and scientific cultivation. Both alike are beasts, from below, not from above; faithful allies, worldly Antichristian wisdom standing in the service of the worldly Antichristian power."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The former - the secular power that sustained the papacy - rose out of the agitated state of the nations in the invasions of the northern hordes, and the convulsions and revolutions of the falling empire of Rome; and that the latter, the spiritual power itself - represented by the beast coming up from the land - grew up under the more settled and stable order of things."
2. "In some respects he resembled a lamb; that is, he seemed to be a mild, gentle, inoffensive animal...even when deposing kings, and giving away crowns, and driving thousands to the stake, or throwing them into the dungeons of the Inquisition."
3. "The general sense is, that while this 'beast' had, in one respect in its resemblance to a lamb - the appearance of great gentleness, meekness, and kindness, it had, in another respect, a haughty, imperious, and arrogant spirit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is characterized by the same general term as the second enemy or the first beast; and although therefore, as afterwards mentioned, it resembles a lamb, this in no degree diminishes the fierceness of its nature." 
2. "The ‘sea’ represents the nations as opposed to God. The ‘earth’ is the Jews, as God’s prophetic and priestly people. That this beast comes up out of the earth is therefore a token that it springs out of a religious, not a secular, source; and this trait corresponds, as we shall see, to the whole description of it."
3. "The beast professed to teach religious truth; but his mode of teaching was fierce and murderous, the very opposite of that of Him who did not strive nor cry aloud, neither did any one hear His voice in the streets."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Another beast (αλλο θηριον). Like the first beast (verse Revelation 13:1), not a ετερον θηριον (a different beast)."
2. "Like unto a lamb (ομοια αρνιω). Usual construction. Only the two horns of a young lamb and without the ferocity of the other beast, but 'he spake as a dragon' (ελαλε ως δρακων)."
3. "But Swete thinks that he had the roar of a dragon with all the looks of a lamb (weakness and innocence)."

### John Gill:
1. "The same antichrist, but appearing in another light and view."
2. "Pretending great humility and holiness, showing signs and lying wonders, obliging to idolatry, and exercising tyranny and cruelty on all that will not profess his religion."
3. "He affected a lamb-like disposition, pretended to great humility and meekness, calling himself 'servus servorum', the servant of servants, to cover his pride, ambition, and tyranny."
