# Revelation 13:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The second beast, associated with the papacy, carries on the authority and power of the first beast, representing Pagan Rome. It exercises its dominion by making war against the saints, both through persecution and through silencing them. It rules over the consciences of people in a tyrannical manner, exerting control over all nations and languages. Those under the papacy are called to submit to its temporal power, giving homage and tribute to support its worldly grandeur.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The non-existence of the beast embraces the whole Germanic Christian period. The healing of the wound and return of the beast is represented [in regard to its final Antichristian manifestation though including also, meanwhile, its healing and return under Popery, which is baptized heathenism] in that principle which, since 1789, has manifested itself in beast-like outbreaks" [AUBERLEN].
2. "The beast is the bodily, the false prophet the intellectual, the harlot the spiritual power of Antichristianity [AUBERLEN]."
3. "But in the last days all these God-opposed powers which have succeeded each other shall co-operate, and raise each other to the most terrible and intense power of their nature: the false prophet causes men to worship the beast, and the beast carries the harlot" [AUBERLEN].

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This shows a remarkable relationship between these two beasts; and proves that it was intended to refer to the same power substantially, though manifested in a different form."
2. "The papacy, considered as a spiritual dominion...the dominion was as widespread; the authority was as absolute and arrogant."
3. "A state of things occurred, on the rise of that new power, as if a wound in the head, otherwise fatal, was healed...the Roman dominion - the prolongation of Daniel’s fourth kingdom - has continued to the present time."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The words ‘before him’ are to be connected with ‘exerciseth;’ and they are again a travesty of that ‘before God’ which we find predicated of the Son, of the Spirit, and of the saints..."
2. "This second beast is ‘before’ the first, in his presence, sustained by him, ministering to him, doing his pleasure..."
3. "We have here an unmistakeable description of the first beast, not as he appeared in the earlier stages of his manifestation under the first five heads, but as he appeared under the sixth, after he had been slain and had risen to life."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The second beast carries on the succession of authority from the dragon and the first beast."
2. "It has been a common Protestant interpretation since the Reformation of Luther to see in the first beast Pagan Rome and in the second beast Papal Rome."
3. "Ramsay takes the first beast to be the power of imperial Rome and the second beast to be the provincial power which imitated Rome in the persecutions."

### John Gill:
1. "Making war with the saints by preaching and writing against them, by anathemas, excommunications, and bulls, and so overcame and silenced them, or delivered them over to the secular arm to be put to death."
2. "Ruling over the consciences of men in a tyrannical way, in all nations, kindreds, and tongues, in the empire."
3. "To be subject to the temporal power of the Papacy, or to submit to the pope as a temporal lord, to give homage and tribute to him, and the like, in order to support his worldly power and grandeur."
