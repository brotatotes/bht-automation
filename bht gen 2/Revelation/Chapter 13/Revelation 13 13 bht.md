# Revelation 13:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The second beast, in its pursuit of power, relies on false miracles and wonders to deceive the people. These signs, though not actual miracles, are meant to create the illusion of divine power. The imagery of calling down fire from heaven, reminiscent of Elijah's miraculous act, serves as a symbol of the false prophet's attempt to imitate divine authority. These signs, whether in the form of fabricated miracles or the fires of persecution, aim to mislead and manipulate the masses.
