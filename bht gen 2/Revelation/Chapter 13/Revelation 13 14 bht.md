# Revelation 13:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
False teachings have a deceptive power that operates only among those who are destined to perish. The secular power of the Papacy compels belief in its doctrines and practices, utilizing various methods such as images and idols in order to solidify its authority. The beast and its image are intricately linked, representing the entirety of the Papal religion. It is astonishing how easily the public can be deceived by new charlatans who promote their pipe-dreams, but those who are grounded in righteousness are not swayed by their deceitful tactics.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The main fact here stated, that the papacy would endeavor to sustain itself by pretended miracles, is confirmed by an incidental remark of Mr. Gibbon, when speaking of the pontificate of Gregory the Great; he says: 'The credulity or the prudence of Gregory was always disposed to confirm the truths of religion by the evidence of ghosts, miracles, and resurrections.'" 
2. "This implies that there would be authority, and that this authority would be exercised to secure this object."
3. "All this in fact occurred in the decline of the Roman power after the time of Constantine, and its final apparent extinction, as if 'wounded to death,' in the exile of the last of the emperors, the son of Orestes, who assumed the names of Romulus and Augustus..."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "An image to the beast [ŒµŒπŒ∫ŒøŒΩŒ± œÑœâ Œ∏Œ∑œÅŒπœâ] . Eijkwn is a figure or likeness."
