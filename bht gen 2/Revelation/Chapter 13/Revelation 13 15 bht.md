# Revelation 13:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The second beast has the power to give life to the image, confirming and establishing a new religion. This power is often associated with the papacy, whose decrees, anathemas, and doctrines speak on its behalf. Refusal to worship the image or embrace the Popish religion may result in persecution and the shedding of innocent blood. Historical examples, like Pliny's letter to Trajan, demonstrate that rejection of the established religion led to capital punishment. Through its actions, the second beast enforces its authority and maintains control over its followers, creating a deceptive and false system reminiscent of the Antichrist.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He had power... to give life." 
2. "The three Hebrews who refused to worship the image were cast into a burning furnace... All this typifies the last apostasy."
3. "False doctrine will give a spiritual, philosophical appearance to the foolish apotheosis of the creaturely personified by Antichrist."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The second beast, however, had power to impart life to it, so that it would be invested with authority, and would exercise that authority in the manner specified."
2. "The power by which this was done was derived from the second beast; the obedience and homage demanded was of the most entire and submissive character; the nature of the government was in a high degree arbitrary; and the penalty enforced for refusing this homage was death."
3. "It is true, also, that the empire was revived - the very 'image' or copy, so far as it could be, of the former Roman power, in the time of Charlemagne, and that the power which was wielded in what was called the 'empire,' was what was, in a great measure, derived from the papacy, and was designed to sustain the papacy, and was actually employed for that purpose."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Speak. This is supposed by some to refer to the tricks of pagan priests in making pictures and statues appear to speak

### Philip Schaff:
1. "These words are commonly understood to refer to the lying wonders of pagan priests in making pictures and statues appear to speak... But such pictures and images, however they might seem to move and speak, were never able to put to death." 
2. "It seems better, therefore, to think first it may be of the persons in whom civil power was centred... who demanded that Divine honours should be paid them, and who persecuted to the death such as refused the homage."
3. "After them come all who, having any worldly power, are persuaded to use it against the saints of God... making them bring it about that they who worship not the image of the first beast... 'should be killed.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This second beast, probably a system like the first (not a mere person), was endowed with the power to work magical tricks, as was true of Simon Magus and Apollonius of Tyana and many workers of legerdemain since."
2. "Ventriloquism like that in Acts 16:16."
3. "That refusal to worship the image of the emperor carried with it capital punishment in Trajan's time is clear from Pliny's letter to Trajan (X. 96)."

### John Gill:
1. "He breathed into it, and animated it; he gave this new religion a sanction, he confirmed and established it."
2. "It speaks by the decrees, canons, anathemas, curses, threatenings, persuasions, doctrines, and blasphemies of the pope and his clergy."
3. "That as many as will not embrace and profess the Popish religion shall be put to death; the blood of all the saints and prophets is found in Rome Papal, and will be avenged."
