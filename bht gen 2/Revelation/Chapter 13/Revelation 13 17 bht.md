# Revelation 13:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The mark, whether visible or symbolic, signifies allegiance and submission to the beast. This marks a desire for control over religious and secular realms, seen historically in the papacy's pursuit of dominance and control over wealth. The mark is closely tied to the papal power, as it represents a pledge or profession of the Popish religion. The name or number on the mark holds significant meaning, hinting at a defiance and opposition to the true faith. It may have been represented by words or numerals, symbolizing the antichristian spirit propagated by the beast.
