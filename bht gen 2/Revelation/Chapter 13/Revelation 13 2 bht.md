# Revelation 13:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The beast mentioned in the passage rises up out of the sea, combining the characteristics of the beasts from Daniel's vision. It represents the world power throughout history, opposing God. The qualities attributed to the beast include activity, bloodthirstiness, strength, and ferocity. The leopard, bear, and lion are also mentioned as symbols of the offensive qualities possessed by the beast. It is seen as the symbol of the world power in its absolute and universal form, serving as Satan's agent. The battle between the beast and Christ is one characterized by cunning, deception, malice, and cruelty.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It rises up out of the sea, as Daniel's four beasts, and has ten horns, as Daniel's fourth beast, and seven heads, as Daniel's four beasts had in all, namely, one on the first, one on the second, four on the third, and one on the fourth." 
2. "Thus it represents comprehensively in one figure the world power (which in Daniel is represented by four) of all times and places, not merely of one period and one locality, viewed as opposed to God."
3. "Satan appears as a serpent, as being the archetype of the beast nature (Revelation 12:9)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In this description, it is observable that John has combined in one animal or monster, all those which Daniel brought successively on the scene of action as representing different empires."
2. "John has thus brought together the qualities of activity, bloodthirstiness, strength, ferocity, all as symbolical of the power that was intended to be represented."
3. "If, therefore, as the whole connection leads us to suppose, this refers to the Roman secular power, considered as the support of the papacy, there is the most evident propriety in the representation."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A leopard [œÄŒ±œÅŒ¥Œ±ŒªŒµŒπ] . The ancients do not seem to have distinguished between the leopard, the panther, and the ounce. The word stands for either."
2. "Leopard is leo - pard, the lion - pard, which was supposed to be a mongrel between a panther and a lioness."
3. "Bear. Compare Daniel 7:5. Lion. Compare Daniel 7:4."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The qualities represented are the most offensive of their kind, the swift cruel spring of the leopard, the brutish relentlessness of the bear, and the devouring power of the lion."
2. "The objects represented by the heads of the beast must be kingdoms, not personal kings like the Emperors of Rome."
3. "The 'beast' before us is thus the symbol of the world-power in its absoluteness and universality. Yet it is not identical with the world-power in any one of its seven single and successive forms."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The leopard (ŒªŒµŒø, œÄŒ±œÅŒ¥) was considered a cross between a panther and a lioness." 
2. "The strength and brutality of the Babylonian, Median, and Persian empires appeared in the Roman Empire."
3. "The beast is simply Satan's agent. Satan claimed this power to Christ and Christ called Satan the prince of this world. So the war is on."

### John Gill:
1. "And may be, in this form, compared to a leopard for its swiftness, Habakkuk 1:8; because this beast, as soon as he arose and got power, quickly, and in a very short time, extended it over all emperors, kings, princes, bishops, and over all kingdoms and churches."
2. "It lies in wait for its prey, and suddenly falls upon it, and devours it; and is a lively picture of the cunning sleight of the antichristian party, who lie in wait to deceive, and of their blood thirstiness and barbarity."
3. "He gave him his cunning and subtlety, as the old serpent, and taught him his arts and tricks to deceive mankind; and gave him a power to do signs and lying wonders, as well as communicated his malice and cruelty to persecute and oppress the saints."
