# Revelation 13:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The given description portrays a situation where Rome, the empire, and the emperors were seemingly struck with a wound that appeared deadly. Astonishingly, this wound was ultimately healed, signifying the revival of Popery in specific areas where it had been forcefully removed. It is crucial to recognize that the claim of universality by the Papists, regarding it as a criterion for the true church, is indeed a distinct trait of the beast or antichrist.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Germanic empire, the seventh head (revived in the eighth), as yet future in John's time... the world kingdom which this head represents does not truly turn to God, but for a time its God-opposed character remains paralyzed..."
2. "No essential change is noticed in Daniel as effected by Christianity upon the fourth kingdom; it remains essentially God-opposed to the last. The beast, healed of its temporary and external wound, now returns, not only from the sea, but from the bottomless pit, whence it draws new Antichristian strength of hell."
3. "A new and worse heathenism breaks in upon the Christianized world, more devilish than the old one of the first heads of the beast. The latter was an apostasy only from the general revelation of God in nature and conscience; but this new one is from God's revelation of love in His Son."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The general idea here is, that a state of things would exist in regard to that power, at the time referred to, as if one of the seven heads of the monster should receive a wound which would be fatal, if it were not healed in some way."
2. "John saw a wound inflicted on that mighty power which would have been fatal if it had not been marvelously healed."
3. "The waning Roman secular power was restored by its connection with the spiritual power - the papacy."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word occurs eight times in Revelation, and in seven of these it must be rendered slain or slaughtered."
2. "In both cases there had been actual death, and in both revival."
3. "A pregnant construction for wondered at and followed after."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The statement in the verse is the counterpart of that in chap. Revelation 5:6, where we read of the â€˜Lamb as though it had been slaughtered.â€™ In both cases there had been actual death, although in both there had also been a revival, a resurrection, to life."
2. "The words â€˜as thoughâ€™ before â€˜it had been slainâ€™ no more imply that there had not been a real death than they imply this in chap. Revelation 5:6, where they are used of the slain Lamb."
3. "That power received a mortal stroke by the work of Christ. The world was then ideally and really overcome. It revived, and resumed its working."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "As though it had been smitten, as though slain."
2. "The stroke of death."
3. "All the earth wondered at and followed after the beast."

### John Gill:
1. "This seemed to be a deadly wound to Rome, to the empire and emperors." 
2. "His deadly wound was healed...Popery recovering itself again in some countries where it was driven out." 
3. "The universality the Papists boast of, as a note of the true church, is manifestly a mark of the beast, or of antichrist."
