# Revelation 13:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The worship directed towards the dragon and the beast illustrates the worshipping of Satan himself. This parallels the worship of idols and false gods, including the historical worship of emperors and even the modern phenomenon of self-worship. The act of worshiping such an evil figure as the beast is a distorted imitation of true worship, a mere parody. The immense power and strength of the beast is shown, overpowering emperors and kings. However, it is crucial to recognize that this worship and authority are based on brute force, aligning with Nietzsche's belief that might determines right.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The very language appropriated to God" 
2. "A parody of the name 'Michael', meaning, 'Who is like unto God?'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They in fact worshipped him. The word 'worship' is not always, however, used in a religious sense. It means, properly, 'to kiss'; to kiss toward anyone; that is, to kiss his own hand and to extend it toward a person, in token of respect and homage."
2. "Can anyone doubt that this was the case under papal Rome; that the power which was set up under that entire domination, civil and ecclesiastical, was such as Satan approved, and such as he sought to have established on the earth?"
3. "Nothing was able to resist that absolute despotism; and the authority of princes and rulers that were allied with the papal rule was of the most absolute kind, and the subjugation of the world was complete."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Because he gave." 
2. "A parody on a similar ascription to God."
3. "Who is like unto the beast?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This verse contains a parody of the ascriptions of praise given to the true God in many passages of the Old Testament."
2. "It is unnecessary to spend time in showing that it is to the beast as healed, and not before it was slain, that the song is raised."
3. "As invariably happens when a tyrant dies, the sentiment of the masses underwent an immediate and profound revulsion."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They worshipped the dragon... They really worshipped Satan (the dragon) when 'they worshipped the beast'... The beast is merely the tool of the devil for worship." 
2. "Emperor-worship, like all idolatry, was devil-worship. The same thing is true today about self-worship (humanism or any other form of it)."
3. "The worship of such a monster as Nero was indeed a travesty of the worship of God."
4. "Worship of the devil and the devil's agent is justified purely on the ground of brute force. It is the doctrine of Nietzsche that might makes right."

### John Gill:
1. "And they worshipped the dragon... which gave power unto the beast..." (Revelation 13:4). 
2. "But woe to them that worship this beast..." (Revelation 14:9). 
3. "Who is able to make war with him? And indeed, such was his power and strength once, that he was more than a match for emperors and kings..." (Revelation 13:4).
