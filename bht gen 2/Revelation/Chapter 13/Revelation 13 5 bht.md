# Revelation 13:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The beast is given a mouth that speaks great things and blasphemies, expressing both arrogance and false assertions of divinity. This power to speak in such a manner is not of his own, but is ultimately from Satan. The characteristics described here resemble those of the Little Horn in Daniel and Antiochus Epiphanes. This power is granted to continue for forty-two months, either in terms of performing signs during that time or more likely in the sense of blaspheming and speaking great things throughout that duration.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "blasphemies—So ANDREAS reads. B reads 'blasphemy.' A, 'blasphemous things' (compare Daniel 7:8; Daniel 11:25)."
2. "power—'authority'; legitimate power (Greek, 'exousia')."
3. "to continue—Greek, 'poiesai,' 'to act,' or 'work.' B reads, 'to make war' (compare Daniel 11:25). But A, C, Vulgate, Syriac, and ANDREAS omit 'war'."
4. "forty . . . two month—(See on Revelation 13:1; Revelation 13:1-:)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "These arrogant claims consisted in the assertion of a divine right; in the power assumed over the liberty, the property, and the consciences of the people; in the arbitrary commands that were issued; and in the right asserted of giving absolute law."
2. "The duration of the existence of this power is the same as what is everywhere ascribed to the papacy, in the passages which refer to it; and all the circumstances, as before remarked, show that the same general power is referred to by the two 'beasts' which are described in this chapter."
3. "The meaning in the passage before us I take to be, that the papal power, considered as a civil or secular institution, will have, from the time when that properly commenced, a duration of twelve hundred and sixty years."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "To continue forty and two months [ποιησαι μηνας τεσσερακοντα δυο]. Lit., to make forty and two months."
2. "The best expositors, however, render poihsai absolutely, to work, and the following accusative as the accusative of duration, 'during forty and two months.'"
3. "Rev., margin to do his works during, etc. See Daniel 11:28."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And there was given him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies." 
2. "The description is taken from Daniel 8:8; Daniel 8:20; Daniel 8:25, where similar language is used of the 'Little Horn.'"
3. "The second thing 'given' is authority to work forty and two months."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The ultimate source of power is God, but the reference seems to be Satan here." 
2. "The words are like Daniel's description of the Little Horn and like the description of Antiochus Epiphanes." 
3. "Either in the sense of working (signs), as in Daniel 8:12-14, with the accusative of duration of time (months), or more likely in the sense of doing time, with months as the direct object."

### John Gill:
1. "The beast is said to have a mouth before, like the mouth of a lion, but now he was moved and stirred up by the dragon, the devil, to open it, not only in a cruel and voracious way, but in a haughty, lying, and blasphemous manner." 
2. "speaking great things, and blasphemies; great swelling words of vanity; calling himself by high and lofty titles."
3. "And power was given unto him to continue forty [and] two months; to continue in being, or to continue blaspheming and speaking great things; and indeed, as long as he continues, he will continue blaspheming."
