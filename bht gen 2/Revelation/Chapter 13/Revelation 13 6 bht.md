# Revelation 13:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The described blasphemies in Revelation 13:6 range from assuming divine authority and demanding worship to promoting idolatry and claiming to forgive sins. The offender boldly takes on the power of God by binding consciences, disregarding divine laws, and granting indulgences. Furthermore, this figure arrogantly asserts the ability to transform bread and wine into Christ's body and blood, reaffirming this sacrificial act in the Mass. Ultimately, the blasphemy extends to both God's name and the true church, as the offender seeks to establish their own authority and persecute those who oppose them.
