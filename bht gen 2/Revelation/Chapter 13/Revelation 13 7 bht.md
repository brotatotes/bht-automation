# Revelation 13:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The antichrist is given great authority, with power over all people, tribes, tongues, and nations. This includes not only spiritual influence but also temporal rule, as seen in the persecution of the saints and the wielding of the temporal sword against them. The dominion of the antichrist extends over the Roman empire and those who worship and follow him, enabling him to exercise both temporal and spiritual control. But the saints, through their faithful testimony and martyrdom, ultimately overcome Satan, the world, and the antichrist, emerging as victorious conquerors through their love for Christ.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "To make war with the saints and to overcome them" - This clause with two epexegetical first aorist active infinitives (πολεμησα and νικησα) is omitted in A C P, but probably by ομοεοτελευτον (like ending) because of the repetition of εδοθη. 
2. "The words seem to come from Daniel 7:21; Daniel 7:23. There was no escape from the beast's rule in the Mediterranean world." 
3. "See Revelation 5:9 for the phrases here used, there for praise to the Lamb."

### John Gill:
1. "The war of antichrist, with the saints, may be understood not merely spiritually, of his anathemas, excommunications, bulls, and the like, but literally, of his drawing the temporal sword against them."
2. "And power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations; in the Roman empire, which wondered after him, and worshipped him, and over whom he has reigned, and has exercised both a temporal and spiritual jurisdiction."
3. "By dying in the faith and cause of Christ, [the saints] overcome Satan, get the victory over the world, and antichrist, and are more than conquerors through him that has loved them."
