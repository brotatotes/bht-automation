# Revelation 13:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The distinction is made between those who dwell upon the earth and those who dwell in heaven, representing the ungodly and godly respectively. The book of life, attributed to the Lamb who was slain, contains the names of those who obtain everlasting life. The intention to offer Christ as a sacrifice was formed from the foundation of the world, and the act of election and the gift of life are centered in Him. Those whose names are not written in the book of the Lamb are followers of the antichrist, destined for condemnation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "All that dwell upon the earthâ€”being of earth earthy; in contrast to 'them that dwell in heaven.'"
2. "The elect. The former is in the Greek more obvious and simple."
3. "Whatsoever virtue was in the sacrifices, did operate through Messiah's death alone. As He was 'the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world,' so all atonements ever made were only effectual by His blood."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The representation here is, that the Lord Jesus keeps a book or register, in which are recorded the names of all who shall obtain everlasting life."
2. "The meaning here is, not that he was actually put to death 'from the foundation of the world,' but that the intention to give him for a sacrifice was formed then, and that it was so certain that it might be spoken of as actually then occurring."
3. "Either construction makes good sense; but it seems to me that what is found in our common version is the most simple and natural."

### Marvin Vincent:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "These dwellers upon the earth are in contrast with those who â€˜tabernacle in heaven.â€™ They are the ungodly as distinguished from the godly; and again they are not confined to the Roman Empire, but include all who anywhere worship the beast."
2. "Every one whose name hath not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the lamb that hath been slain."
3. "The connection of the last clause is doubtful. It may be joined, as in the Authorised Version, with the â€˜Lamb that hath been slain;â€™ but chap. Revelation 17:8 seems to determine in favour of connecting it with the word â€˜written.â€™ Besides which, the clause is less appropriate to the slaying of the Lamb, an act which took place in time, than to those counsels of the Almighty which are from eternity."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Whose...thus calling attention to the responsibility of the individual in emperor-worship." 
2. "In the book of life of the Lamb...the Divine Register is represented as belonging to 'the Lamb that was slain'." 
3. "Either makes sense, and here the most natural use is with ÎµÏƒÏ†Î±Î³Î¼ÎµÎ½Î¿Ï…. At any rate the death of Christ lies in the purpose of God, as in John 3:16."

### John Gill:
1. "The act of election was made in him [Christ], and stands sure in him; and he is the author and giver of that life, which men are chosen unto both here and hereafter."
2. "Something like this the Jews say of the Messiah upon Genesis 49:11, 'he washed from the day that the world was created'; who is he? this is the King Messiah."
3. "Now such whose names are not written in this book of the Lamb, who have no interest in electing grace, nor in redemption by Christ, the slain Lamb of God, nor any right unto eternal life, who are reprobate persons, vessels of wrath fitted for destruction, who are foreordained to condemnation, and are given up to believe a lie, that they might be damned, these are the followers and worshippers of antichrist."
