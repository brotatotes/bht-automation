# Revelation 14:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The terrifying punishment awaiting the wicked is likened to the undiluted wine of God's wrath, devoid of any cooling water. This severe threat should inspire believers to fear God more than the threats of man. As God's enemies are also the enemies of the saints, they will rejoice when they witness the vindication of God's righteousness through the visible judgment and punishment of sinners. The angels will bear witness to this punishment, intensifying the agony experienced by the wicked. This punishment represents the unmitigated wrath of God, leaving no room for mercy or hope.
