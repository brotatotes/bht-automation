## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

3. "The lost have no rest from sin and Satan, terror, torment, and remorse."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This does not indeed affirm that their individual sufferings would be eternal, since it is only a declaration that 'the smoke of their torment ascends,' but it is such language as would be used on the supposition that they would suffer forever, and as can be explained only on that supposition."
2. "The meaning here is, that they never have any rest - any interval of pain. This is stated as a circumstance strongly expressive of the severity of their torment."
3. "And oh how sad and strange that any of our race will persevere in sin, and go down to those unmitigated and unending sorrows!"
