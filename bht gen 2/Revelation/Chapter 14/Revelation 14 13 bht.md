# Revelation 14:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the judgment on the beast and the harvest gatherings of the elect are imminent, those who die in the Lord are considered blessed or happy. Their death in union with Christ allows them to rest from their toils and enter into a blessed rest, not experiencing pain or purgatory but pure and unmixed happiness. Their Christian character and life, demonstrated through their faith and works, follow with them as proof that they belong to Christ. This rest and blessedness come as a result of their laborious life, and they will enjoy it for all eternity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Their full blessedness is now 'from henceforth,' that is, FROM THIS TIME, when the judgment on the beast and the harvest gatherings of the elect are imminent."
2. "They rest from their toils because their time for toil is past; they enter on the blessed rest because of their faith evinced by their works which, therefore, 'follow WITH (so the Greek) them.'"
3. "His works do not go before the believer, nor even go by his side, but follow him at the same time that they go with him as a proof that he is Christ's."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Blessed are the dead - That is, the condition of those who die in the manner which is immediately specified, is to be regarded as a blessed or happy one."
2. "Assuredly we should be grateful for any system of religion which will enable us thus to speak of those who are dead; which will enable us, with corresponding feeling, to look forward to our own departure from this world."
3. "And their works do follow them - That is, the rewards or the consequences of their works will follow them to the eternal world, the word works here being used for the rewards or results of their works."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Those that ‚Äòdie in the Lord‚Äô are obviously in contrast with the followers of the beast spoken of in Revelation 14:11..."
2. "It rather brings out the fact that in Him His people meet persecution and death; and that, although they are not all actually martyrs, they have the martyr spirit."
3. "Those who thus die are blessed because ‚Äòthey rest from their labours;‚Äô they have that rest from toil and suffering which they cannot obtain here below. And how comes it that they thus rest? Because their ‚Äòworks (an entirely different word from ‚Äòlabours‚Äô) follow with them.‚Äô Their Christian character and life, giving them a meetness for the rest, follow with them. They enter into heaven fitted for its joys."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This new beatitude (ŒºŒ±Œ∫Œ±œÅŒπŒø, Blessed) for the Christian dead goes farther than Paul's words (1 Thessalonians 4:14-16; 1 Corinthians 15:18)."
2. "Probably 'from henceforth' (Œ±œÄ' Œ±œÅœÑ) goes with 'those who die in the Lord,' giving comfort to those facing persecution and death."
3. "There is this to comfort us for all our growth here. Even if cut short, it can be utilized in heaven, which is not a place of idleness, but of the highest form of spiritual service."

### John Gill:
1. "Merely to die is not an happiness, for death is common to all, good and bad; it is a disunion of soul and body, and cannot be in itself desirable."
2. "To suffer death for the sake of Christ and his Gospel is a gift and an honour, and what glorifies Christ; and there is a glory consequent upon it, which such shall enjoy."
3. "To die in the Lord is to die interested in him, in union to him; which union is not dissolved by death, and which preserves from all condemnation, at death or at judgment, and secures the soul's immediate entrance into happiness, and the resurrection of the body at the last day, and therefore such must be blessed."

### John Wesley:
1. "And I heard a voice - This is most seasonably heard when the beast is in his highest power and fury."
2. "Happy are the dead - From henceforth particularly: 1. Because they escape the approaching calamities: 2. Because they already enjoy so near an approach to glory."
3. "For they rest - No pain, no purgatory follows; but pure, unmixed happiness. From their labours - And the more laborious their life was, the sweeter is their rest."
