# Revelation 14:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Under the imagery of a harvest and a vintage, two general visitations are represented. The harvest symbolizes the favor and grace bestowed upon the righteous, as many good men are taken from the earth. On the other hand, the vintage signifies a penal visitation, as sinners are gathered and face judgment. In this vision, Christ appears with a golden crown, representing His glorious and righteous reign. Holding a sharp sickle in His hand, He stands ready to welcome the righteous and separate them from the wicked. His arrival brings both judgement and victory.
