# Revelation 14:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The angel's message to the Son of Man is a divine revelation from God the Father, signifying the end of the world and impending judgment. The harvest represents the gathering of the elect righteous, while the vintage symbolizes the removal of Antichristian offenders. These events mark the culmination of earthly affairs and the coming of Christ to judge both the living and the dead. The angel's directive to thrust in the sickle now emphasizes the urgency of the moment. These events will unfold in accordance with the appointed seasons and divine timing, as foretold in the Scriptures.
