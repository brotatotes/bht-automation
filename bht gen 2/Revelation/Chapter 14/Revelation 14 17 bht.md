# Revelation 14:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The temple in heaven sends an angel who wields a sharp sickle to gather the vintage. This angel, commissioned by God, is sent to cut off the enemies of God. The vintage symbolizes the perdition of ungodly men by fire, which will occur at the beginning of the thousand years' reign. Christ himself, often referred to as an Angel, gathers the vine of the earth and casts it into the winepress, just as the angel does in this passage.
