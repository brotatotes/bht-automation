# Revelation 14:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The imagery in this passage involves an angel coming from the altar, which is associated with sacrifices and prayers of the saints. This angel, who has power over fire, represents God's judgment upon the earth. The mention of lopping off the clusters of the vine of the earth refers to the destruction of the wicked, whose wickedness has reached its full extent and who are now ripe for punishment. All these elements combine to show that the time has come for the divine judgment and the ultimate destruction of evil.

2. "fully ripe—Greek, 'come to their acme'; ripe for punishment."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "As the work now to be done was a work of destruction, this was an appropriate place in the representation."
2. "Fire is the usual emblem of destruction; and as the work now to be done was such, it was proper to represent this angel as engaged in it."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "Fire. In the Greek with the article, the fire."
3. "Grapes [σταφυλαι] . The noun in the singular means also a bunch of grapes."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The third of the second group of three angels comes not merely from the temple, but out from the altar, the most sacred part of it that altar over which the angel stands who presents the prayers of the saints to God, and who casts its fire upon the earth. It is this fire, not fire in general, that is referred to when the angel is described as he that hath power over the fire. The fire is the judgments of God upon the earth."
2. "The angel next cries to him that had the sharp sickle that he should gather the clusters of the vine of the earth. As in Revelation 14:16 we were told only of the harvest of the good, so here we are told only of the vintage of the wicked."
3. "The figure is often used in the Old Testament (comp. Isaiah 63:1-4; Joel 3:13)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He responds to the call of the sixth angel here as Christ does to the call of the fourth angel in verse Revelation 14:15."
2. "If it is the altar of burnt offering, we are reminded of the blood of the martyrs, but if the altar of incense, then of the prayers of the saints."
3. "Useful for vintage as for harvesting. So 'send forth' as in verse Revelation 14:15."

### John Gill:
1. "The allusion seems to be to the altar of burnt offerings, where the sacrifices were slain, and on which they were burnt with fire; and which was an emblem of the strict justice of God, showing, that those persons, for whom these sacrifices were offered, deserved to be treated in like manner."
2. "Fire is to be taken here, not for the Spirit, and his gifts, but rather the wrath of God, which in Scripture is often compared to fire, of which this angel was an executioner."
3. "And the clusters of it may denote the great multitude of the wicked now to be cut down, gathered in, and destroyed, the reason given, for her grapes are fully ripe; their wickedness very great, their iniquity full, the measure of their sins filled up, and they fitted for destruction, and ripe for ruin."

### John Wesley:
1. "And another angel from the altar — Of burnt offering; from whence the martyrs had cried for vengeance."
2. "Who had power over fire — As 'the angel of the waters,' Revelation 16:5, had over water."
3. "Cried, saying, Lop off the clusters of the vine of the earth — All the wicked are considered as constituting one body."
