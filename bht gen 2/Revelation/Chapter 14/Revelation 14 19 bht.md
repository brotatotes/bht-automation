# Revelation 14:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The vine of the earth, representing the wicked, will be gathered and cast into the great winepress, which symbolizes the destruction of the wicked in the last day. This winepress is described as great, as it will hold the vine of the whole earth, all the wicked in the world. The torments of the wicked will be comparable to a fire that cannot be quenched and a worm that never dies. It is a deep and large place, signifying the magnitude of the judgment that awaits them.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The vine" is what is the subject of judgment because its grapes are not what God looked for considering its careful culture, but "wild grapes."
2. The apostate world of Christendom, not the world of heathendom who have not heard of Christ, is the object of judgment.
3. Compare the emblem, Revelation 19:15; Isaiah 63:2; Isaiah 63:3; Joel 3:13.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "And cast it into the great wine-press of the wrath of God -...the wine-press where the grapes are crushed, and where the juice, resembling blood, flows out, may be used as a symbol to denote the destruction of the wicked in the last day..."
2. "That is, the wine-press where the grapes are crushed, and where the juice, resembling blood, flows out, may be used as a symbol to denote the destruction of the wicked in the last day..."
3. "The symbol appears to be used here alike with reference to the color of the wine resembling blood, and the pressure necessary to force it out; and thus employed it is one of the most striking emblems conceivable to denote the final destruction of the wicked."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Greek student will note the masculine adjective with the feminine noun, possibly because the gender of the noun is doubtful."
2. "The Rev., in rendering more literally, is more forcible: the wine-press, the great wine-press."
3. "See on Matthew 21:33."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Not merely the grapes but the vine of the earth itself is gathered, the vine being wholly rooted out according to the words of the Lord..." 
2. "Every plant which My Heavenly Father planted not shall be rooted up." 
3. "After this the vine is cast into the great winepress of the wrath of God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Cast (εβαλεν). As in verse Revelation 14:16. Gathered (ετρυγησεν). Like εθερισθη in verse Revelation 14:16, in obedience to the instructions in verse Revelation 14:18 (τρυγησον)." 
2. "The vintage of the earth (την αμπελον της γης). 'The vine of the earth.' Here αμπελος is used for the enemies of Christ collectively pictured."
3. "And cast it (εβαλεν). Repeating εβαλεν and referring to αμπελον (vintage) just before. Into the winepress the great winepress (εις την ληνον τον μεγαν). Ληνος is either feminine as in verse Revelation 14:20; Revelation 19:15, or masculine sometimes in ancient Greek. Here we have both genders, a solecism frequent in the Apocalypse (Revelation 21:14 το τειχος εχων)."

### John Gill:
1. "The torments of the wicked will lie in the wrath of God being poured forth upon them, and into them, which will be that fire that cannot be quenched, and that worm that never dies..."
2. "...this winepress will be trod by the Lord God Almighty: and it is said to be a great one, as it must needs be, to hold the vine of the whole earth, or all the wicked of the world, who will be like the sand of the sea, innumerable..."
3. "...and they will all be cast into it at once. Tophet is deep and large, Isaiah 30:33."
