# Revelation 14:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A heavenly voice was heard, growing clearer and clearer. At first, it sounded like the roar of many waters or thunders in the distance. Then, as it moved closer, it became like the sweet melodies of harpers playing their harps. The voice was a harmonious blend of vocal and instrumental sounds, a powerful and awe-inspiring proclamation from heaven.
