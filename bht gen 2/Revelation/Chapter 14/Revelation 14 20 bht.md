# Revelation 14:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The winepress being trodden represents the Son of God Himself, as mentioned in Revelation 19:15. The blood flowing out of the winepress symbolizes a great depth, even reaching to the horses' bridles. It signifies a vast extent, covering at least two hundred miles, throughout the whole land of Palestine. The scene of destruction mentioned takes place outside the city of Jerusalem, a familiar location for the readers at the time. This vivid imagery emphasizes the magnitude of the events and the triumph of God over His enemies.
