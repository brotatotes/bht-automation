# Revelation 14:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The song of victory after conflict with the dragon, beast, and false prophet is a new song, never sung before. It is sung in anticipation of Christ's blood-bought kingdom with His saints. The redeemed, the 144,000, sing this new song as an act of praise and worship before the throne. Only they can fully understand and enter into the feelings and sympathies of those who have been redeemed. To truly appreciate this song of redemption, one must have personally experienced salvation through faith in Jesus Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The song is that of victory after conflict with the dragon, beast, and false prophet: never sung before, for such a conflict had never been fought before; therefore new: till now the kingdom of Christ on earth had been usurped; they sing the new song in anticipation of His blood-bought kingdom with His saints." 
2. "The harpers and singers evidently include the 144,000: so the parallel proves, where the same act is attributed to the general company of the saints, the harvest from all nations."
3. "Not even the angels can learn that song, for they know not experimentally what it is to have 'come out of the great tribulation, and washed their robes white in the blood of the Lamb'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "And they sung as it were a new song - See the notes on Revelation 5:9. It was proper to call this 'new,' because it was on a new occasion, or pertained to a new object."
2. "None could understand it but the redeemed. That is, none who had not been redeemed could enter fully into the feelings and sympathies of those who were."
3. "To appreciate fully the songs of Zion; to understand the language of praise; to enter into the spirit of the truths which pertain to redemption; one must himself have been redeemed by the blood of Christ."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Beasts [ζωων] . Rev., living creatures. See on ch. Revelation 4:6. Redeemed [ηγορασμενοι] . Rev., correctly, purchased.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The song referred to is not said to be sung by the 144,000, and perhaps we ought to think simply of a great body of praise going up before the throne."
2. "And no one could learn the song save the hundred and forty and four thousand, even they that had been purchased out of the earth."
3. "They are described as ‘purchased out of the earth,’ a designation which, like that of Revelation 14:4, ‘from among men,’ must be accepted in a general sense, there being nothing to suggest the idea of Judaism alone."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They sing as it were a new song...here 'before' them and so apparently by the throng who were themselves redeemed by the Lamb."  
2. "No man could learn the song save...the angels join in the song."  
3. "Even they that had been purchased out of the earth...The 144,000 are not yet separated from the earth...they must embrace both men and women."

### John Gill:
1. "The song of redeeming grace [...] is to be understood of the 144,000, who sung it before the throne." 
2. "Of these [144,000], none but these is it given to know spiritually and experimentally the mysteries of electing and redeeming grace." 
3. "The natural and carnal man neither knows nor receives the things of the Spirit of God; nor can he learn them by hearing, reading, study, and conversation, unless it be only in a notional and speculative way."

### John Wesley:
1. "Sing a new song - and none could learn that song - To sing and play it in the same manner." 
2. "But the hundred forty-four thousand who were redeemed from the earth — From among men; from all sin."
