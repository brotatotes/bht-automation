# Revelation 14:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Gospel is to be proclaimed as a witness to all nations, giving every person the opportunity to choose Christ. This proclamation will be made before the end, during a last season of grace before judgment falls. The Gospel message announces the good news of Christ's everlasting kingdom, encouraging the Church in the midst of persecution. The rapid spread of the Gospel is depicted through the imagery of flying. It is a message of equality, reaching people of every rank, character, and complexion. These divine messages bring glad tidings to all who make the right use of them.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He flies in mid-heaven...for his voice is to reach over the whole earth." 
2. "He has an eternal gospel to proclaim, usually understood as the Gospel of glad tidings now to be proclaimed for the last time to a sinful world." 
3. "It is not 'the eternal Gospel' of Christ, then, that is spoken of, but the condemnation which alone remains for those by whom that Gospel has been despised and rejected."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
