# Revelation 14:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This message urges us to have a reverential fear of God, recognizing His authority and power, and giving Him the glory He deserves. It also emphasizes the importance of worshiping the one true God, the Creator of heaven, earth, and everything in them. By doing so, we separate ourselves from the worship of false gods and idols. Those who faithfully worship Him will find deliverance and protection from the judgments that will be poured out on the earth and its inhabitants.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Fear Godâ€”the forerunner to embracing the love of God manifested in the Gospel."
2. "Give glory to himâ€”and not to the beast."
3. "Worship him that made heavenâ€”not Antichrist."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Saying with a loud voice - As if all the nations were summoned to hear."
2. "The main idea is, that when God shall be about to cause his gospel to spread through the world, there will be, as it were, a solemn judgment on that anti-Christian power which had so long resisted his truth and persecuted his saints, and that on the fall of that power his own kingdom will be set up on the earth."
3. "The ground of consolation then was, that a time was predicted when the 'everlasting gospel' would be made to fly speedily through the earth, and when it would be announced that a final judgment had come upon the anti-Christian power which had prevented its being before diffused over the face of the world."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Fear God, and give glory to him, because the hour of his judgment is come." - The 'fear' and the 'giving glory' spoken of are those of unbelief and hardness of heart.
2. "And worship him that made the heaven and the earth and sea and fountains of waters." - For the 'worshipping' of God spoken of.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Fear God. It is a call to judgment with no hope offered except by implication."
2. "Give him glory. For the phrase see Revelation 11:13."
3. "Worship. Solemn call to the pagan world to worship God as Creator."

### John Gill:
1. "These ministers shall lift up their voice like a trumpet, and cry aloud, and deliver out the Gospel fully and faithfully, with great authority and power, and with much vehemence, zeal, and fervency."
2. "Fear God...not with a servile fear, or a fear of punishment, of wrath, hell, and damnation; nor with a distrust of his grace, love, power, and providence, much less with an hypocritical fear; but with a godly fear, which has the goodness of God for its object, and springs from a sense of the love of God, and is a reverential affection for him, and is attended with faith and spiritual joy."
3. "Give glory to him...on account of the perfections of his nature, and the works of his hands...ascribe greatness to him, praise his works of creation, and acquiesce in those of Providence, acknowledging the power, goodness, and wisdom of God in all."

### John Wesley:
1. "Fear God and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come â€” The joyful message is properly this, that the hour of God's judgment is come. And hence is that admonition drawn, Fear God and give glory to him."
2. "They who do this will not worship the beast, neither any image or idol whatsoever. And worship him that made â€” Whereby he is absolutely distinguished from idols of every kind."
3. "The heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and fountains of water â€” And they who worship him shall be delivered when the angels pour out their phials on the earth, sea, fountains of water, on the sun, and in the air."
