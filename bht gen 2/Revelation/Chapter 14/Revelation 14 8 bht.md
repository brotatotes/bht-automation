# Revelation 14:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Amidst the proclamation of Babylon's fall, we're reminded of the distinction between Babylon, the apostate Church, and the beast. Babylon's fall signifies its permanent destruction and the arrival of happier times. This great enemy, once head of the pagan world, rose to spiritual greatness in the 5th century and continued to flourish through the ages. Its fall is certain and imminent, symbolizing the overthrow of all enemies of Christ. Babylon's fornication represents its idolatry and corrupt practices, including the worship of saints and angels, the use of images, and adherence to human traditions.

2. "that great cityâ€”A, B, C, Vulgate, Syriac, and Coptic omit 'city.' Then translate, 'Babylon the great.' The ulterior and exhaustive fulfilment of Isaiah 21:9."
3. "the wine of the wrath of her fornicationâ€”the wine of the wrath of God, the consequence of her fornication. As she made the nations drunk with the wine of her fornication, so she herself shall be made drunk with the wine of God's wrath."

### Albert Barnes:

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Another. Add deuterov a second. Is fallen [ÎµÏ€ÎµÏƒÎµÎ½] . Lit., fell. The prophetic aorist expressing the certainty of the fall. Compare Isaiah 21:9; Jeremiah 51:7, Jeremiah 51:8.

### Philip Schaff:

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The English participle 'fallen, fallen' is more musical and rhythmical than the literal rendering 'fell, fell.' The language is an echo of Isaiah 21:9."

2. "Then it began, but it will not cease to be Babylon till it is finally destroyed. Its spiritual greatness began in the fifth century, and increased from age to age."
