# Revelation 14:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The third angel's proclamation exposes the inevitability of the destruction awaiting the worshippers of the beast and his image. These individuals are entangled in gross idolatry, facing the judgements imposed upon them. They willingly submit to the beast, outwardly revering both the beast and its image. This warning also cautions against yielding to the pressures and threats posed by the second beast, as it exposes the wrath of God awaiting those who embrace the doctrines of the Popish religion. These individuals are deemed guilty of an eternal sin, believing that salvation resides exclusively within their own church.
