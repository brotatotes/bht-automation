# Revelation 15:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The vision of the Seven Bowls is a sign, a significant representation of future events such as the coming of Christ, the destruction of antichrist, and the glory of the church and kingdom of Christ. The seven bowls, also called plagues, serve as instruments to convey these judgments. They are labeled as the last plagues because through them, the wrath of God is fulfilled. However, it is important to note that even after these plagues, God's holy wrath against his other enemies continues.
