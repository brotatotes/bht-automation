# Revelation 15:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As the angels come out with their plagues, they sing a song, demonstrating the connection between the two events. In this vision, there is a sea of glass, previously clear as crystal but now mingled with fire. This symbolizes the judgment and destruction of God's enemies. The victorious ones who have come out of the beast, its image, and its name are represented in this sea. They are further described as having the harps of God, which were given to them by Him for the purpose of praise and worship.

2. "Their happiness is heightened by the retrospect of the dangers through which they have passed."
3. "Harps of God—in the hands of these heavenly virgins, infinitely surpassing the timbrels of Miriam and the Israelitesses."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The sea of glass here means a sea clear, pellucid, like glass: an expanse that seemed to be made of glass."
2. "The very sight of the pavement, therefore, on which they stood when worshipping God, would keep before their minds impressive views of his character and dealings."
3. "In times of general error and corruption... they remained unmoved, and adhered firmly to the truth. The number of such in the aggregate was not small; and with great beauty and propriory they are here represented as rejoicing and giving thanks to God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "As it were a glassy sea (ως θαλασσαν υαλινην). Accusative case after ειδον and ως here, not in Revelation 4:6, which see for the symbol."
2. "Mingled with fire (μεμιγμενην πυρ). Perfect passive participle of μιγνυμ, to mix, and the associative instrumental case πυρ. This item not in Revelation 4:6 (a vision of peace), but here it adds to the splendour of the vision."
