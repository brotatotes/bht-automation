# Revelation 15:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The conversion of all nations will occur when Christ returns, signified by His manifested judgments that prepare hearts to receive His mercy. The present preaching of the Gospel gathers the elect remnant while the mystery of iniquity persists. The destruction of the apostates and their confederacy against Christ will result in the nations that were not part of the Antichristian league coming to worship and submit themselves to Him. Through these events, the fear and reverence for God will be instilled in all places, and His righteous acts will be revealed and accepted universally.
