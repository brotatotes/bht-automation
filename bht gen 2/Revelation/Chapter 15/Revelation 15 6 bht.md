# Revelation 15:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The seven angels were entrusted with executing divine judgment upon the earth, holding the authority of priests or ministers of the church. Their clothing, resembling that of the high priest, symbolized their holiness and the presence of God with them. They were adorned in precious stones, illustrating their rank and condition. With breasts girded with golden girdles, they displayed their readiness to demonstrate love and execute God's judgments upon the enemies of the saints.

Revelation 15:7), but they are by
anticipation described according to their office.
2. "a stone pure ('and' is omitted in A, B, C, and
ANDREAS), brilliant"

the Lord in this respect (Revelation 1:13).
