# Revelation 15:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The seven golden bowls, broader at the top than at the bottom, are presented by the living creatures, representing the ministry of the Church, filled with the wrath of God. This pouring out of His wrath signifies the overwhelming suddenness of the judgments upon antichrist. However, amidst this dreadfulness, the vials full of odors, symbolizing the prayers of the saints, provide a sweet contrast, demonstrating the power of the Church's prayers in the midst of God's righteous judgment.
