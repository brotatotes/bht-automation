# Revelation 15:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the temple was filled with smoke, it represented God's powerful and gracious presence. This smoke served as a symbol of God's glorious manifestation, just like the cloud of glory in the tabernacle and temple. The purpose of this smoke was to keep out any individuals who would attempt to enter, whether due to their blindness and obduracy or the execution of divine judgment. As the seven plagues were being fulfilled, the gospel churches were growing purer and purer under the watchful eye of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Temple . . . filled—( :-); compare Exodus 40:34; 2 Chronicles 5:14, as to the earthly temple, of which this is the antitype."
2. "The glory of God and . . . power—then fully manifested."
3. "No man was able to enter . . . the temple—because of God's presence in His manifested glory and power during the execution of these judgments."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The purpose here seems to have been, partly to represent the smoke as the proper symbol of the divine presence, and partly to represent it as so filling the temple that no one could enter it until the seven plagues were fulfilled."
2. "The meaning here seems to be, that no one would be permitted to enter to make intercession - to turn away his wrath - to divert him from his purpose."
3. "The point, therefore, at which this vision leaves us is, that where all the preparations are made for the infliction of the threatened punishment on the grand anti-Christian power which had so long stood up against the truth; where the agents had prepared to go forth; and where no intercession will ever avail to turn away the infliction of the divine wrath."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "God cannot be approached at the moment when He is revealing Himself in all the terrors of His indignation." (Milligan)
2. "Smoke." (Compare Exodus 40:34; 1 Kings 8:10; Psalms 18:8; Isaiah 6:4; Ezekiel 10:2-4)
3. "None was able to enter." (See Exodus 19:21)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This smoke is no smoke of incense, nor is it simply the thick cloud of the majesty of God. It is the smoke by which He is surrounded as the righteous Lawgiver, that which proceeds from the fire of His wrath."
2. "And no one was able to enter into the temple till the seven plagues of the seven angels should be finished. The meaning of these words is perhaps best to be ascertained by comparing them with Exodus 19:21. God cannot be approached at the moment when He is revealing Himself in all the terrors of His indignation."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Smoke is here the symbol of God's presence."
2. "Till should be finished  ... a metaphorical and symbolic 'smoke screen' to keep all out of the sanctuary for the time being."

### John Gill:
1. "Gospel churches will grow purer and purer, while the seven angels are pouring out the vials."
2. "God's powerful and gracious presence in his church, in allusion to the cloud which filled the tabernacle, so that Moses could not enter; and which filled the temple, so that the priests could not minister."
3. "None of the anti-Christian party will attempt to enter in, because of their blindness and obduracy; nor can they get in to do any mischief, because the glorious and powerful presence of God is a defence against them."

### John Wesley:
1. "The cloud of glory was the visible manifestation of God's presence in the tabernacle and temple."
2. "So proper is the emblem of smoke from the glory of God, or from the cloud of glory, to express the execution of judgment, as well as to be a sign of favour."
3. "Till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled — Which did not take up a long time, like the seven trumpets, but swiftly followed each other."
