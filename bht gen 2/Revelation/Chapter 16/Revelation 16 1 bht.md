# Revelation 16:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A powerful voice emerges from the heavenly temple, directly from God, instructing the seven angels to pour out the vials of His wrath upon the earth. These vials, distinct from the previous trumpets, carry a swift and forceful impact, primarily targeting the beast and its followers. The plagues unleashed through these vials reflect the punishments inflicted in the plagues of Egypt, symbolizing a significant overthrow of worldly kingdoms. With the pouring out of the vials, God's judgment is executed, demonstrating His authority over all creation and His intervention in human affairs.

1. "These seven vials (the detailed expansion of the vintage, Revelation 14:18-20) being called 'the last,' must belong to the period just when the term of the beast's power has expired..."
2. "The first four are more general, affecting the earth, the sea, springs, and the sun, not merely a portion of these natural bodies, as in the case of the trumpets, but the whole of them; the last three are more particular, affecting the throne of the beast, the Euphrates, and the grand consummation."
3. "Some of these particular judgments are set forth in detail in the seventeenth through twentieth chapters."

### Albert Barnes:

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A great voice (Î¼ÎµÎ³Î±Î»Î·Ï‚ Ï†Ï‰Î½Î·Ï‚). Not an angel as in Revelation 5:2; Revelation 7:2; Revelation 10:3; Revelation 14:7; Revelation 14:9; Revelation 14:15; Revelation 14:18, but of God as Revelation 15:8 shows..."
2. "Pour out (ÎµÎºÏ‡ÎµÎµÏ„Îµ). Second aorist active imperative of ÎµÎºÏ‡ÎµÏ‰ (same form as present active imperative). Blass would change to ÎµÎºÏ‡ÎµÎ±Ï„Îµ (clearly aorist) as in verse Revelation 16:6."
3. "The seven bowls (Ï„Î±Ï‚ ÎµÏ€Ï„Î± Ï†Î¹Î±Î»Î±Ï‚). The article points to verse Revelation 16:7."

1. "These seven vials are not contemporary, much less the same with the seven trumpets; there is indeed a likeness between them in some things, especially in the first four."
2. "Antichrist did not appear until the fifth trumpet sounded, whereas the first vial is poured out upon his followers and worshippers."
3. "It is easy to observe, that there is in many of these vials an allusion to the plagues of Egypt; in the first, to the plague of boils, in the second and third, to that of turning the waters of Egypt into blood, in the fourth, to the darkness that was over all the land of Egypt, and in the fifth there is a manifest reference to the frogs that distressed the Egyptians, and in the seventh, to the plague of hail."

### John Wesley:
1. "The trumpets gradually, and in a long tract of time, overthrow the kingdom of the world."
2. "The phials destroy chiefly the beast and his followers, with a swift and impetuous force."
3. "The four first affect the earth, the sea, the rivers, the sun; the rest fall elsewhere, and are much more terrible."
