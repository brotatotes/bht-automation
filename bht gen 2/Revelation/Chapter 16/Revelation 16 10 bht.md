# Revelation 16:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The pouring out of the fifth vial directly targets the throne of the beast, symbolizing the ultimate destruction and desolation of Rome. As a result, Rome's glory, riches, and authority will be greatly diminished, causing it to be despised by the rulers of the earth. Those who have aligned themselves with the beast will experience intense internal anguish, unable to execute their revenge and filled with fear. Overall, the first four phials and trumpets cover the entire earth, while the last three focus on specific groups such as the Mahometans and the heathens.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Upon the throne of the beast (επ τον θρονον του θηριου). That is Rome."
2. "They gnawed their tongues (εμασωντο τας γλωσσας αυτων). Imperfect middle of μασαομα, old verb (to chew), from μαω (to knead), only here in N.T."
3. "For pain (εκ του πονου). 'Out of distress' (cf. εκ in Revelation 8:13), rare sense of old word (from πενομα to work for one's living), in N.T. only here, Revelation 21:4; Colossians 4:13. See Matthew 8:12."

3. "These will gnaw their tongues, which expresses their inward anguish and distress, their anger, wrath, and fury, their being filled with revenge, and yet in an incapacity to execute it, and will even be afraid to express it."

### John Wesley:
1. "The four first phials are closely connected together; the fifth concerns the throne of the beast, the sixth the Mahometans, the seventh chiefly the heathens."
2. "The four first phials and the four first trumpets go round the whole earth; the three last phials and the three last trumpets go lengthways over the earth in a straight line."
3. "The fifth poured out his phial upon the throne of the wild beast — It is not said, 'on the beast and his throne.' Perhaps the sea will then be vacant. And his kingdom was darkened — With a lasting, not a transient, darkness. However the beast as yet has his kingdom. Afterward the woman sits upon the beast. and then it is said, 'The wild beast is not,' Revelation 17:3,7,8."
