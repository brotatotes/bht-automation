# Revelation 16:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The unrepentant ones will curse Him, their rightful King and God, looking upwards to heaven where He resides.

Just like the Egyptians experienced guilt and darkness simultaneously, so these individuals will be overwhelmed by their multiplied and aggravated pains and ulcers.
