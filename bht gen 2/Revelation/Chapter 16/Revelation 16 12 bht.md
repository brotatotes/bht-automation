# Revelation 16:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The drying up of the Euphrates signifies the decline of the spiritual and temporal powers of the apostate Church, particularly the Roman Church. The kings from the East, possibly referring to Israel and other nations, will accompany the King of kings in His return. The drying up of the Euphrates is also linked to the ultimate downfall of the anti-Christian power represented by the beast. The pouring out of the vial affects the Turkish empire, which paves the way for the spread of Christ's kingdom and the conversion of nations from the East.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And the sixth poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates: and its water was dried up, that the way of the kings which come from the rising of the sun might be prepared." (notice, but not to be blindly led by it, the analogy of the sixth trumpet, also having reference to the river Euphrates. In order to understand what we here read, we must carefully bear in mind the context.)
2. "From what follows under this same vial, we learn that the kings of the whole earth are about to be gathered together to the great battle against God, in which He shall be victorious, and they shall utterly perish."
3. "The time is now come for this gathering and by the drying up of the Euphrates, the way of those kings who are to come to it from the East is made ready."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The drying up of the Euphrates (compare Isaiah 8:7; Isaiah 8:8) are spiritual Babylon's, that is, the apostate Church's (of which Rome is the chief, though not exclusive representative) spiritual and temporal powers."
2. "The phrase, 'way may be prepared for,' is that applied to the Lord's coming (Isaiah 40:3; Matthew 3:3; Luke 1:76)."
3. "Israel secondarily may be meant by 'the kings from the East' who shall accompany the 'King of kings' returning 'from the way of the East' to reign over His ancient people."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There is every reason, therefore, to suppose that this passage has reference to something in the future history of the Turkish dominions, and to some bearing of the events which are to occur in that history on the ultimate downfall of the anti-Christian power referred to by the 'beast.'"
2. "The natural interpretation is, that they are the kings that reign in the East, or that preside over the countries of the eastern hemisphere."
3. "All that is fairly implied in the language used here is, that the kings of the East would be converted to the true religion, or that they were, at the time referred to, in a state of readiness to be converted, if there were no hindrance or obstruction."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Euphrates. See on ch. Revelation 9:14. Of the east [απο των ανατολων ηλιου] . Lit., as Rev., from the sunrising. See on Matthew 2:2; and dayspring, Luke 1:78.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Euphrates is the river of Babylon, the seat of antichristian power, from which proceed assaults upon the people of God."
2. "The figure of drying up waters is one often met with in the prophets, where it is used to express the steps by which God prepares the way for the deliverance of His people and the destruction of their enemies."
3. "They are representatives of all Christ’s faithful ones who are not only priests but kings unto God, and for whom the waters of the Euphrates are dried up that their march to the destruction of Babylon may be easy and triumphant."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Was dried up (εξηρανθη). First aorist (prophetic) passive...Zechariah 10:11."
2. "That may be made ready (ινα ετοιμασθη). Purpose clause with ινα and the first aorist passive of ετοιμαζω."
3. "The way for the kings (η οδος των βασιλεων). Objective genitive βασιλεων. That come from the sunrising (των απο ανατολης ελιου). 'Those from the rising of the sun,' the kings from the east (cf. Matthew 2:2) in their march against Rome."

### John Gill:
1. "...the drying up of this river designs the withdrawing of nations and kingdoms...from its jurisdiction and power, which will bring on its ruin."
2. "...rather the eastern antichrist, the Turks are meant...the pouring out of this sixth vial affects the same empire, and brings it to ruin."
3. "...through the fall of the Ottoman empire, way will be made for the kings and princes of the east, literally understood, to have and embrace the Gospel of Christ...so that the ruin of this monarchy will pave the way for the spread of Christ's kingdom from sea to sea."

### John Wesley:
1. "The far greater part of the Turkish empire lies on this side the Euphrates. The Romish and Mahometan affairs ran nearly parallel to each other for several ages."
2. "And here the phial, poured out on the throne of the beast, is immediately followed by that poured out on the Euphrates; that the way of the kings from the east might be prepared."
3. "Those who lie east from the Euphrates, in Persia, India, etc., who will rush blindfold upon the plagues which are ready for them, toward the Holy Land, which lies west of the Euphrates."
