# Revelation 16:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The three enemy powers known as the dragon, the beast, and the false prophet play distinct roles in opposing God's people. The dragon primarily opposes God Himself, while the beast is against Christ, and the false prophet resists the Spirit of truth. Despite their different aims, they all share a common goal of hindering the work of God. Like frogs dwelling in unclean places, these adversaries are impure, loud, and troublesome, causing disturbance and spreading deceit.
