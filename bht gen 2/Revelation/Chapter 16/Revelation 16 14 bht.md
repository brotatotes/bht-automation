# Revelation 16:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These lying spirits, allowed by God, work what seemed to be miracles in order to deceive the world. They are influenced by Satan and have the power to lead people astray. They will go forth to gather the kings of the world to a great battle, similar to the battle described in Revelation 19:17-21. This battle, also known as the battle of that great day of God, will be a day of vengeance upon all the enemies of God and His church. It is a day of judgment upon the remains of Pagan, Papal, and Mahometan power.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "God, in permitting Satan's miracles, as in the case of the Egyptian magicians who were His instruments in hardening Pharaoh's heart, gives the reprobate up to judicial delusion preparatory to their destruction."
2. "Aaron's rod was changed into a serpent, so were those of the Egyptian magicians. Aaron turned the water into blood, so did the magicians. Aaron brought up frogs, so did the magicians. With the frogs, their power ceased. So this, or whatever is antitypical to it, will be the last effort of the dragon, beast, and false prophet."
3. "The battle - the final conflict for the kingship of the world described in Revelation 19:17-21."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Working what seemed to be miracles; that is, such wonders as to deceive the world with the belief that they were miracles."
2. "No class of people have been more under the influence of pagan superstition, Muhammedan delusion, or the papacy, than kings and princes."
3. "There would be a combined struggle against the truth, and in that God would appear by his providence and Spirit on the side of the church, and would give it the victory."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "World. See on Luke 2:1."
2. "Battle is mach."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They thus show at once their hellish origin, and the power lent them in order that they may be the better enabled to effect their end."
2. "It is that Satanic might and deception may be exerted to their utmost, so that the enemies of God from all parts of the world may be led to go up to the war in which they shall be destroyed."
3. "These lying spirits in like manner persuade the kings of the whole godless world to rush upon the fate prepared for them in the last great judgment of God ‘His day.’"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Working signs (ποιουντα σημεια). 'Doing signs'... Houdini claimed that he could reproduce every trick of the spiritualistic mediums."
2. "Which go forth (α εκπορευετα)... The three evil spirits... spur on the kings of the whole world to a real world war."
3. "Unto the war of the great day of God, the Almighty (εις τον πολεμον της ημερας της μεγαλης του θεου του παντοκρατορος)... it is more likely war against God (Psalms 2:2) and probably the battle pictured in Revelation 17:14; Revelation 19:19."

### John Gill:
1. "They are acted and influenced by him, he works effectually in them, and leads them captive at his will; they do his lusts, and are murderers and liars, and false teachers, like him."

3. "And this is called 'the battle of that great day of God'; not of the day of judgment, for it will be before that time; but of that day of vengeance upon all the remains of his and his church's enemies, both Pagan, Papal, and Mahometan, who will for this purpose be gathered together."
