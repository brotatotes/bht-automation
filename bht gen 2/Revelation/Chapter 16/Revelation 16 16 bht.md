# Revelation 16:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The battle of Armageddon, which takes place in the city or on the mountain of Megiddo, is a symbolic event representing the idea of swift and overwhelming destruction for those who gather against the Lord. This battle involves the Papal, Pagan, and Mahometan powers, as well as all nations. The significance of this event is exemplified through historical occurrences, such as the defeat of the Canaanite kings and the slaughter of Sisera's army. It may occur in Judea, potentially in the valley of Jehoshaphat, where a multitude will face their demise. This narrative continues in Revelation 19:19.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Armageddon‚ÄîHebrew, 'Har,' a mountain, and 'Megiddo' in Manasseh in Galilee, the scene of the overthrow of the Canaanite kings by God's miraculous interposition under Deborah and Barak; the same as the great plain of Esdraelon."

3. "Probably some great plain, antitypical to the valleys of Megiddo and Jehoshaphat, will be the scene."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There will be a mustering of spiritual forces; there will

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "If that mysterious book proceeded from the hand of a Galilean fisherman, it is the more easy to understand why, with the scene of those many battles constantly before him, he should have drawn the figurative name of the final conflict between the hosts of good and evil, from the 'place which is called in the Hebrew tongue Harmagedon'" (Stanley, " Sinai and Palestine ").
2. "Jews, Gentiles, Saracens, Christian crusaders, and anti Christian Frenchmen; Egyptians, Persians, Druses, Turks, and Arabs, warriors of every nation that is under heaven, have pitched their tents on the plain of Esdraelon, and have beheld the banners of their nation wet with the dews of Tabor and Hermon" (" Clarke's Travels, "cit. by Lee).
3. "The word, like Euphrates, is the expression of an idea; the idea that swift and overwhelming destruction shall overtake all who gather themselves together against the Lord" (Milligan).

### Philip Schaff:

2. "The simple meaning of the word is ‚Äòthe mountain of destruction.‚Äô"
3. "The word, like Euphrates, is the expression of an idea, the idea that swift and overwhelming destruction shall overtake all who gather themselves together against the Lord."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They gathered (œÉœÖŒΩŒ∑Œ≥Œ±Œ≥ŒµŒΩ). Second aorist active indicative of œÉœÖŒΩŒ±Œ≥œâ, singular (the three unclean spirits), like ŒµŒ∫œÄŒøœÅŒµœÖŒµœÑŒ± in verse Revelation 16:14."
2. "Har-Magedon (HŒ±œÅ-ŒúŒ±Œ≥ŒµŒ¥œâ). John proceeds now after the interruption in verse Revelation 16:15. Perhaps 'the mountains of Megiddo' though not certain. Megiddo is in the valley of Esdraelon, and by the waters of Megiddo (the Kishon) Israel gained a decisive victory over Sisera (Judges 5:19), celebrated in Deborah's song."
3. "See also Revelation 20:8; Revelation 20:4."

### John Gill:
1. "These [spirits] will gather them together; will persuade the Papal, Pagan, and Mahometan powers, the remains of them in the several parts of the world, to join together, and make one effort for the reviving of their declining, and almost ruined interests" (Commentary).
2. "This refers either to the slaying of Josiah in the valley of Megiddo, which occasioned such mourning, that it became proverbial for any great sorrow; or rather to the slaughter of Sisera's army at the waters of Megiddo, by Barak, suggesting that the same would be the fate of these united powers" (Commentary).
3. "It may lead us to conclude it will be somewhere in Judea, and very likely no other than the valley of Jehoshaphat, where all nations will be gathered; and which is called the valley of decision, where will be the day of the Lord, and multitudes will be slain" (Commentary).

### John Wesley:
1. "Armageddon signifies the city or the mountain of Megiddo; to which the valley of Megiddo adjoined."
2. "This was a place well known in ancient times for many memorable occurrences; in particular, the slaughter of the kings of Canaan..."
3. "Here the narrative breaks off. It is resumed, Revelation 19:19."
