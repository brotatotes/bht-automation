# Revelation 16:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings - These are the accompanying phenomena and are intended to add to the grandeur and awe of the scene. The earthquake was a literal one, unlike the preceding plagues which were symbolic in nature. The severity of the earthquake was unprecedented, like none that had been experienced before, emphasizing the magnitude of the judgment being unleashed. This could be interpreted as representing the tremendous and awe-inspiring judgments of God upon the remains of the antichristian party or the significant impact of the Reformation on the division of Christendom.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This is the same close as that of the seven seals and the seven thunders; but with the difference that they do not merely form the conclusion, but introduce the consequence, of the last vial, namely, the utter destruction of Babylon and then of the Antichristian armies."
2. "earthquake—which is often preceded by a lurid state of air, such as would result from the vial poured upon it."
3. "men were—so B, Vulgate, Syriac, and ANDREAS. But A and Coptic read, 'A man was.' so mighty—Greek, 'such.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings - Accompanying the voice that was heard from the throne."
2. "And there was a great earthquake... The meaning is, that a judgment followed as if the world were shaken by an earthquake."
3. "So mighty an earthquake, and so great - All this is intensive, and is designed to represent the severity of the judgment that would follow."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The 'lightnings,' etc., are those which usually accompany the judgments of God."
2. "The earthquake spoken of in the second half of the verse is the second particular, and its terrors are magnified in language of much sublimity."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "For this list of terrible sounds and lightnings, and for the great earthquake."
3. "So great an earthquake, so mighty."


### John Gill:
1. "And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings...may intend either the pure ministry of the Gospel in the spiritual reign, the voices of Christ's ministers, and the effects of them...or rather, the tremendous and awful judgments of God upon the remains of the antichristian party."
2. "There was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great...designed by this."
3. "Mr. Daubuz applies the whole of this vial to the Reformation, when such a revolution was made in a short time, as has not been known since the world was, or men became worshippers of the beast; at which time Christendom was divided into three parts, the eastern or Greek church, the western or Latin church, and the reformed churches."

### John Wesley:
1. A great earthquake, such as had not been since men were upon the earth — It was therefore a literal, not figurative, earthquake.
