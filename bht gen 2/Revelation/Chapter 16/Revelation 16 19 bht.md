# Revelation 16:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The division of the city into three parts refers to its destruction. One part could have been smitten while the others remained, or different forms of destruction may have come upon each part. Babylon, viewed as Jerusalem in a lesser sense, is called the great city. Its complete ruin and overthrow are predicted. The city, known as Rome, has reigned over the kings of the earth. Its utter destruction is imminent, as God has bided His time. Babylon, or Rome, is remembered before God, and the vengeance that is due will not be forgotten.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. ". . . the city (Babylon) "became (Greek) into three parts" by the earthquake."
2. "The last call to escape from Babylon is given to God's people in her (Revelation 18:4)."
3. "Fierceness—the boiling over outburst of His wrath."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The division mentioned here in three parts was manifestly with reference to its destruction - either that one part was smitten and the others remained for a time, or that one form of destruction came on one part, and another on the others."
2. "The meaning is, that 'the city was severed and broken in pieces, so that the whole was reduced to a ruinous state.'"
3. "The certain and entire ruin of the power is predicted by this, but still it is not improbable that it will be by such divisions, or such successions of judgments, that it is proper to represent the city as divided into three portions."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The meaning [of the city being divided into three parts] is that the city was broken up and overthrown."
2. "The 'great city' would therefore seem to be Jerusalem viewed in a less extensive sense than in chap. 11, as the principle and essence of what St. John in his Gospel calls 'the world.'"
3. "'Babylon the great' is not essentially distinct from 'the great city' of the first clause of the verse, yet it is not exactly the same. We have already seen that the latter is degenerate Jerusalem viewed in a less extensive sense than in chap. 11. Now it is viewed in its widest meaning, as embracing not only the essence and principle of 'the world' once exhibited among 'the Jews,' but that principle as it appears in the Gentile not less than in the Jew."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Babylon (Rome) is meant (Revelation 17:18)."

3. "The cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath."

### John Gill:
1. "The whole Romish jurisdiction, which is the great city, that reigns over the kings of the earth, as it will now be."
2. "The utter ruin of the Romish antichrist, in all its branches and remains."
3. "As a just retaliation for the wine of her fornication, with which she has intoxicated the kings and inhabitants of the earth."

### John Wesley:
1. "And the great city — Namely, Jerusalem, here opposed to the heathen cities in general, and in particular to Rome."
2. "And the cities of the nations fell — Were utterly overthrown."
3. "And Babylon was remembered before God — He did not forget the vengeance which was due to her, though the execution of it was delayed."
