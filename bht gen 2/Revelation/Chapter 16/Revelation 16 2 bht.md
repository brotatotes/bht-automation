# Revelation 16:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The pouring out of the vials by the angels represents a swift and urgent judgment upon antichrist. Each vial brings a specific plague, serving to advance Christ's kingdom and glory. The sore that afflicts those with the mark of the beast and worshippers of his image may not be a literal plague. It could signify internal afflictions like remorse, despair, madness, and envy. These plagues bear resemblance to the plagues of Egypt, occurring in rapid succession without a specific timeframe. The vials are symbolic of the swift and powerful judgment of God upon the enemies of His kingdom.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And the first departed and poured out his vial into the earth...and there came an evil and painful sore upon the men that had the mark of the beast and that worshipped his image."
2. "The allegorical and historical interpretations have been very various."
3. "Notice the parallel with the sixth Egyptian plague."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The reason why the sixth Egyptian plague is the first here is because it was directed against the Egyptian magicians, Jannes and Jambres, so that they could not stand before Moses; and so here the plague is sent upon those who in the beast worship had practiced sorcery." 
2. "As they submitted to the mark of the beast, so they must bear the mark of the avenging God."
3. "Therefore this first vial is subsequent to the period of the beast's rule."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The symbol would properly denote that 'tremendous outbreak of social and moral evil, of democratic fury, atheism, and vice, which was specially seen to characterize the French revolution: that of which the ultimate source was in the long and deep-seated corruption and irreligion of the nation...'" 
2. "Of this sad chapter in the history of man, it is unnecessary to give any description here. For scenes of horror, pollution, and blood, its parallel has never been found in the history of our race..."
3. "But it is unnecessary to describe those scenes further. The 'world has them by heart,' and they can never be obliterated from the memory of man. In the whole history of the race there has never been an outbreak of evil that showed so deep pollution and corruption within."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "There fell [ŒµŒ≥ŒµŒΩŒµœÑŒø] . Lit., there came to pass. Rev., it became. Elliott, very aptly, there broke out."
2. "Noisome and grievous [Œ∫Œ±Œ∫ŒøŒΩ Œ∫Œ±Œπ œÄŒøŒΩŒ∑œÅŒøŒΩ] . Similarly the two cognate nouns kakia and ponria malice and wickedness occur together in 1 Corinthians 5:8."
3. "Sore [ŒµŒªŒ∫ŒøœÇ] . See on Luke 16:20. Compare the sixth Egyptian plague, Exodus 9:8-12, where the Septuagint uses this word elkov boil."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The first angel poured out his bowl into the earth. The whole earth is thought of, and no more only a third part of it as at chap. Revelation 8:7."
2. "And there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast and which worshipped his image."
3. "The idea of the plague is taken from that of Egypt in Exodus 9:8-12, but it cannot be literally understood, for literal interpretation is wholly inapplicable to the sixth bowl, and all the bowls must be interpreted on the same principles."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Each angel 'went off' to perform his task." 
2. "There came a noisome and grievous sore." 
3. "The magicians were attacked in Egypt and the worshippers of Caesar here."

### John Gill:
1. "Though these vials are so many plagues upon antichrist, they are each of them so many steps to the advancement of Christ's kingdom and glory."
2. "There fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and upon them which worshipped his image. [...] By which may be meant, either literally something external, but not the plague in Dioclesian's time, for then the beast was not risen; and there were none that could have his mark or worship his image."
3. "This may design something internal, either the remorse of their consciences, reflections on their past practices, and black despair and horror of mind; and their madness, wrath, and fury, their malice and envy at the success of the preachers of the Gospel, and of Protestant states and princes against them."

### John Wesley:
1. "And the first went ‚Äî So the second, third, etc., without adding angel, to denote the utmost swiftness; of which this also is a token, that there is no period of time mentioned in the pouring out of each phial."
2. "They have a great resemblance to the plagues of Egypt, which the Hebrews generally suppose to have been a month distant from each other."
3. "And poured out his phial upon the earth ‚Äî Literally taken.And there came a grievous ulcer ‚Äî As in Egypt, Exodus 9:10,11.On the men who had the mark of the wild beast ‚Äî All of them, and them only. All those plagues seem to be described in proper, not figurative, words."
