# Revelation 16:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
At the final judgment, the great and terrible judgments will cause every mountain and island to be moved out of its place, signifying the dissolution of the world. This dramatic event is even described as the earth and the heaven fleeing away. It is a complete and utter extirpation of all antichristian powers on the islands and continent. It is a truly awe-inspiring event, yet it is not the end of the world.
