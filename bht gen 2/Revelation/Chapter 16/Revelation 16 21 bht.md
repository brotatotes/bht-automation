# Revelation 16:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The hailstorm described in this passage brings to mind the plagues that befell Egypt. It signifies the severe and intolerable judgments of God upon the antichristian party. No one can escape from these divine judgments, and seeking refuge in houses will provide no safety. The hailstones themselves are tremendous in size, each weighing an astonishing sixty pounds. This hailstorm serves as a powerful reminder that no one can defy the mighty wrath of God.
