# Revelation 16:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The second pouring out of the phial causes the sea to become like the blood of a dead man, thick and putrid. This plague is reminiscent of the Bible's account of the Nile turning into blood during the time of Moses and the Egyptians. Not only does this affect the physical creatures in the sea, but it also signifies the destruction and end of false doctrines and powers, such as the papal system. This plague will bring about a complete and drastic change.
