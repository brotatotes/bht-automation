# Revelation 16:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The third angel poured out his phial on the rivers and fountains of water, causing contamination and becoming blood. The desolation and destruction that will follow this event is likened to the invasion of the Roman empire by Attila, with similar desolations being expected in Europe. The rivers and fountains becoming blood symbolize the bloody battles that will be fought, leading to a reformation and the destruction of the principal orders and chief men. The potency of this event is emphasized, as it signifies a significant change from the previous trumpet judgments.
