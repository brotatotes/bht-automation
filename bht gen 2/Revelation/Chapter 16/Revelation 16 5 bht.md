The Lord is righteous, presiding over the waters and exercising judgment. As the angel of the waters, he is set over them, just as other angels are set over the winds and the fire. In his righteous judgment, the Lord brings retribution upon the guilty, exemplifying his purity and holiness. These judgments reveal the power and mercy of the Gracious one, who is praised for his authority in times of patience and revered for his mercy in times of vengeance.
