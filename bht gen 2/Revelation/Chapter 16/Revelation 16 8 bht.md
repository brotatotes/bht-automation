# Revelation 16:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The intensification of judgment continues with the pouring out of the fourth vial. Unlike the previous trumpet judgment that brought darkness upon a third of the sun, moon, and stars, this vial brings an even greater catastrophe in the form of scorching heat. Interpreters suggest various symbolic meanings, such as the sun representing Christ or the ministry of the word, or the sun representing the pope and the angel representing earthly powers. Regardless, the pouring out of this vial signifies a severe judgment and serves as a reminder of the previous trumpet judgments' effects.
