# Revelation 16:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The heat of affliction caused men to curse and reproach God for the plagues that had befallen them. Despite these calamities, the people remained unrepentant and refused to glorify God through acknowledgment of their sins. This serves as a reminder that affliction can either soften or harden the hearts of individuals. The consequence of their hardened hearts was their refusal to repent and give glory to God, as they continued in their wicked ways, including idolatry, murder, sorcery, fornication, and theft. God's power and control over these plagues were undeniable, yet the people still chose to blaspheme Him.
