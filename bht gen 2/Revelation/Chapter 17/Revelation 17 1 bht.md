## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The whore is the apostate Church, just as 'the woman' is the Church while faithful."
2. "Satan having failed by violence, tries too successfully to seduce her by the allurements of the world."

3. "It is not uncommon in the Scriptures to represent a city under the image of a woman - a pure and holy city under the image of a virgin or chaste female; a corrupt, idolatrous, and wicked city under the image of an abandoned or lewd woman."
