# Revelation 17:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage alludes to the fall of powerful empires, particularly the Roman empire. The identification of the seven kings or powers mentioned remains unclear, but they symbolize different forms of government in the Roman empire. These heads encompass a compound meaning, including both hills and kings. The term fallen signifies the violent overthrow of rulers or kingdoms. The mention of an eighth empire indicates its close connection to the previous seven. The duration of this transitional period is relatively short in the grand scheme of things, compared to the everlasting kingdom of Christ and his people.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "Rome was 'the one' existing in John's days."
3. "The time when it is said of it, 'it is not' (Daniel 11:4), is the time during which it is 'wounded to death,' and has the 'deadly wound' (Daniel 11:4)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "An eighth is mentioned in Revelation 17:11, but it is, at the same time, said that this one so pertains to the seven, or is so properly in one sense of the number seven, though, in another sense, to be regarded as an eighth, that it may be properly reckoned as the seventh."
2. "The word 'kings' may be understood... as denoting one of distinguished honor - a viceroy, prince, leader, chief."
3. "The notion of ruling, or of authority, is undoubtedly in the word [kings], for the verb Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπŒªŒµœÖÃÅœâ basileuoÃÑ means 'to rule,' but the word may be applied to anything in which sovereignty resides."

### Marvin Vincent:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The heads are seven kings or powers, the world-power being thus again regarded in the sevenfoldness of its unity."
2. "Every attempt to understand by these ‚Äòkings‚Äô Roman Emperors or Procurators, or Roman forms of government of any kind, is shattered either on the facts of the case, or on the extreme improbability of supposing that a book like the Apocalypse would enter into minute details of the internal government of heathen nations."
3. "The word ‚Äòis used in the Septuagint constantly, and in Daniel, of the violent fall, the overthrow, either of kings or of kingdoms: it is a word belonging to domination overthrown, to glory ruined, to empire superseded."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The identification of these seven kings is one of the puzzles of the book."
2. "The difficulty about counting these emperors is that Galba, Otho, Vitellius reigned so briefly that they hardly merit being included."
3. "Swete takes this to be Titus, who died September 13, 81, after a short reign."

### John Gill:
1. "By the seven heads are meant so many forms of government which took place successively in the Roman empire, and were all of them idolatrous heads, as kings, consuls, dictators, decemvirs, tribunes, emperors, and popes."
2. "But these emperors, though in religion they differed from the others, yet their form of government and title were the same, and therefore must be included in the sixth head."
3. "And when he cometh he must continue a short space; forty two months, or 1260 days; that is, so many years, which, though a long time in itself, and in the account of man, yet with God, with whom a thousand years is as one day, and in comparison of the everlasting kingdom of Christ, and his people, it is but a short space."

### John Wesley:
1. "Not that the seven heads mean hills distinct from kings; but they have a compound meaning, implying both together."
2. "The fall of those five kings seems to imply, not only the death of the Popes who reigned on those hills, but also such a disannulling of all they had done there, that it will be said, The beast is not; the royal power, which had so long been lodged in the Pope, being then transferred to the city."
3. "In this second period, one is, at the same time that the beast is not. Even then there will be a Pope, though not with the power which his predecessors had."
