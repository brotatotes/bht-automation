# Revelation 17:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Antichrist, a figure of intense opposition to God, emerges as a personal embodiment of evil. This power, originating from the abyss, concentrates and combines the characteristics of its predecessors, symbolizing a consolidated and continued force. It is likened to the tyrant, whose end represents the trajectory of the beast. Additionally, some interpretations suggest that the Papacy embodies this power, functioning as the eighth king and seventh head, with both temporal and ecclesiastical authority. The name beast denotes its connection to the Roman empire. This multifaceted government exemplifies a unique blend of civil and ecclesiastical rule.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Antichrist manifested in fullest and most intense opposition to God." 
2. "That a personal Antichrist will stand at the head of the Antichristian kingdom, is likely from the analogy of Antiochus Epiphanes, the Old Testament Antichrist."
3. "The eighth is not merely one of the seven restored, but a new power or person proceeding out of the seven, and at the same time embodying all the God-opposed features of the previous seven concentrated and consummated."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is evident that, by the 'beast' here, there is some one power, dominion, empire, or rule, whose essential identity is preserved through all these changes, and to which it is proper to give the same name."
2. "The eighth in the succession. This form of sovereignty...appears in such a novelty of form, that, in one sense, it deserves to be called the eighth in order, and yet is so essentially a mere concentration and continuance of the one power..."
3. "It was to be a power emanating from the 'abyss,' or that would seem to ascend from the dark world beneath...being under the control of the prince of that world."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The 'beast' here is, therefore, identical with that of Revelation 17:8; that is, with the beast as it was thought of at a time prior to any mention, in Revelation 17:9, of the successive forms of its manifestation."
2. "It is spoken of as an eighth simply because it follows the seven, and because in its final condition all the malice and evil of its previous conditions are concentrated."
3. "The beast is the essence, the concentrated expression, of the seven, the embodiment of their spirit; and it was necessary to mention this, lest we should think that it belongs to a wholly different category."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Is himself also an eighth and is of the seven" - This is the angel's interpretation and it looks like a reference to Domitian as the eighth, who is regarded as one of the seven because he was considered a second Nero (Nero redivivus).
2. "John may have used ÎµÎº Ï„Ï‰Î½ instead of ÎµÎ¹Ï‚ ÎµÎº Ï„Ï‰Î½ to avoid absolute identity between Domitian and Nero (Beckwith)."
3. "The tyrant's end was a symbol of the end to which the Beast which he personated was hastening" (Swete).

### John Gill:
1. "This is the Papacy, which takes the name of the beast, because it is the head of the beast, and the only surviving head of the beast, or Roman empire, now become Papal."
2. "The pope of Rome is the eighth king, and seventh head, the latter with respect to his temporal power, and the former with respect to his ecclesiastical authority."
3. "His government is quite of a different sort from the rest, being of a mixed kind, partly civil, and partly ecclesiastical."
