# Revelation 17:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The ten kings mentioned here are believed to be the same as the ten toes of Nebuchadnezzar's image and the ten horns of the fourth beast in Daniel 2:42. These kingdoms were likely established by the year 450 at the latest. Interestingly, these kingdoms initially unite and give their allegiance to the beast. However, some of them later turn against the whore - representing Rome - and destroy her, while others mourn her destruction. This passage highlights the volatile nature of these kingdoms and their shifting allegiances.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Hence and from Revelation 17:14; Revelation 17:16, it seems that these ten kings or kingdoms, are to be contemporaries with the beast in its last or eighth form, namely, Antichrist."
2. "The ten kingdoms are not, therefore, ten which arose in the overthrow of Rome (heathen), but are to rise out of the last state of the fourth kingdom under the eighth head."
3. "Antichrist is in existence long before the fall of Babylon; but it is only at its fail he obtains the vassalage of the ten kings."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The ten horns...represent or denote ten kings - that is, kingdoms or powers."
2. "During the period under review they would arise, and would become connected, in an important sense, with the power here represented by the 'beast.'"
3. "The meaning clearly is, that this would be brief and temporary; that is, it was a form of administration which would be succeeded by one more fixed and permanent."

### Marvin Vincent:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The number is as usual symbolical, denoting all the antichristian powers of earth which were to arise after the sixth head had fallen or the great Roman Empire been broken up."
2. "The meaning of Revelation 17:11-12 of this chapter, then, is simply this, that, after the fall of the Roman power, there shall arise a number of powers, symbolically ten, exhibiting the same ungodly spirit as that which had marked Rome and the powers of the world that had preceded Rome."
3. "In them the beast shall consolidate all its rage: they shall be the last and readiest instruments of its will. But it shall be in vain. The beast and they have their ‘hour.’ They continue their ‘short while,’ and then they perish."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The heads are emperors and the horns are kings."
