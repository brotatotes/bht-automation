# Revelation 17:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through the ages, there has been a relentless war against the followers of Christ, the members of his body who faithfully testify to his truth. However, this war is not one that the Lamb will ultimately lose, for he is the Lord of lords and King of kings. In fact, by his power, Christ will effect a reformation and bring about victories for his people in various kingdoms. These victories serve as a testimony to the divine nature of Christ, who bears the same titles as God himself.

1. "And this war is not to be understood of a war with him personally, or of that last and decisive, battle at Armageddon, in which will be the kings of the earth; but of a war with his members, of their persecuting of the saints, and faithful witnesses of Christ in all ages, within their jurisdictions."
