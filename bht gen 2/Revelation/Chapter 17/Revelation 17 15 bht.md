# Revelation 17:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The waters where the whore sits are symbolic of the vast multitude of people from different nations and languages under the jurisdiction of Rome Papal. Drawing from the imagery used in the Old Testament, these waters represent the various kingdoms and people of the Babylonian monarchy, serving as an emblem of the antichristian state. The fluctuating nature of the waters mirrors the instability and fickleness of the people, who may eventually turn against the whore they once embraced, ultimately leading to their downfall.

1. The waters. The explanation of the symbol given here is in accordance with Isaiah 8:7; Psalms 18:4, Psalms 18:16; Psalms 124:14. Peoples and multitudes, etc. See on 1 Peter 2:9; Mark 12:37.

### John Gill:
1. "The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues; denoting the vast multitude of people, of which the several kingdoms, of divers languages, consist, which belong to the jurisdiction of Rome Papal." 
2. "It is an eastern way of speaking, and is particularly used to express the various kingdoms, and infinite number of people belonging to the Babylonish monarchy, which was an emblem of the antichristian state." 
3. "because, like waters, they are continually upon the flux, one generation succeeding another; and because of their instability, fickleness, and inconstancy, as in religion, so in their constitution, they will hate the whore they love; and as they frequently change and alter in their form, at last they will utterly cease."
