# Revelation 17:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Church will face judgment from the world power, followed by Christ's judgment on them. The downfall of the Church, symbolized as a harlot, represents its spiritual fornication. The retribution faced by the Church, having gained dominion but being stripped of it, is striking. The ten governments will turn against the Church with extreme hostility, leading to its complete destruction. Rome's fall will come from a change in subject peoples and illustrates St. John's prophecy. The ten kings and states, once allied with the Church, will hate its wicked practices, repent, and seize its possessions. (100 words)

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Church, having apostatized to the world, shall have judgment executed on her first by the world power, the beast and his allies; and these afterwards shall have judgment executed on them by Christ Himself in person."
2. "The judgment on the harlot is again and again described, originally said of Israel, but further applicable to the New Testament Church when fallen into spiritual fornication."
3. "How striking a retribution, that having obtained her first temporal dominions, the exarchate of Ravenna, the kingdom of the LOMBARDs, and the state of Rome, by recognizing the usurper Pepin as lawful king of France, she should be stripped of her dominions by another usurper of France, the Napoleonic dynasty!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "These shall hate the whore - There seems to be some incongruity between this statement and what was previously made. In the former Revelation 17:12-14, these ten governments are represented as in alliance with the beast; as 'giving all their power and strength' unto it; and as uniting with it in making war with the Lamb."
2. "This statement will be accomplished if these same powers, represented by the ten horns, that were formerly in alliance with the papacy, shall become its enemy, and contribute to its final overthrow."
3. "That is, it will be accomplished if the nations of Europe, embraced within the limits of those ten kingdoms, shall become hostile to the papacy, and shall combine for its overthrow."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Shall eat her flesh. A token of extreme hostility." 
2. "Burn [ÎºÎ±Ï„Î±ÎºÎ±Ï…ÏƒÎ¿Ï…ÏƒÎ¹Î½] . Rev., giving the force of kata down, burn utterly."
3. "According to some interpreters the figure is changed from the woman to a city; but this is unnecessary, as the language is probably taken from the punishment of fornication on the part of a priest 's daughter (Leviticus 21:9; compare Leviticus 20:14)."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The bond which in prosperity had bound the wicked co-labourers together is dissolved, the partners in evil fall out, the one section turns round upon the other, and she who had found ready instruments in the beast and its heads for accomplishing the work to which she had spurred them on sees them, in the hour of common despair, fall upon herself and mercilessly destroy her."
2. "The thought of thus eating flesh is taken from the Old Testament; â€˜when the wicked came upon me ... to eat up my fleshâ€™ (Psalms 27:2); â€˜who also eat the flesh of my peopleâ€™ (Micah 3:3)."
3. "The whole is a picture of complete destruction."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The downfall of Rome will come from the sudden change in subject peoples."
2. "Shall make her desolate and naked."
3. "No reader of the Decline and Fall can be at a loss for materials which will at once illustrate and justify the general trend of St. John's prophecy."

### John Gill:
1. "These [ten kings and states] shall hate the whore; her principles and sentiments, her doctrines, which are doctrines of devils, her wicked practices, her idolatries, adulteries, murders, and thefts."
2. "They will repent of their fornications with her, and cease from them; their love will be turned to hatred, and the latter will be greater than ever the former was."
3. "They shall take that to themselves, and make use of, which have fattened her, as bishoprics, and other benefices, lands, endowments belonging to abbeys, and monasteries, and other religious houses."
