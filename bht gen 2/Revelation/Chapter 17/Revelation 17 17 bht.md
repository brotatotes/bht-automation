# Revelation 17:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God has the power to control the hearts of kings and princes, using them as instruments to accomplish His will. In the case of the beast, God will put it into their hearts to have the same purpose and act harmoniously. These powerful kingdoms will eventually withdraw their support, leading to the downfall of the mighty beast. This is all part of God's plan, as He works through these nations to fulfill His purposes. The words of God will be accomplished, just as He has foretold, bringing about the ultimate fulfillment of His will.
