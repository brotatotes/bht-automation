# Revelation 17:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The harlot mentioned in this passage cannot simply be a physical city, but is referred to in a spiritual sense. Based on the context, it becomes clear that Rome, in some form of its dominion, is intended. Rome, with its power and influence over the kings of the earth, is a likely candidate for the city being discussed here. The woman, referred to as a great city, is often mentioned in this book, and is associated with Rome, a city that had jurisdiction over all the kings of the empire.
