# Revelation 17:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The depiction of a harlot seducing kings and people symbolizes the apostate Church, encompassing various branches of Christianity that have deviated from true faith. This includes historical Rome, as well as other influential powers throughout history. The harlot's actions represent the Church's unfaithfulness, idolatry, and corruption. The passage emphasizes the dangers of straying from a genuine relationship with God and becoming ensnared by worldly temptations. It serves as a warning against compromising one's faith and succumbing to the allurements of false teachings.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I incline to think that the judgment and the spiritual fornication, though finding their culmination in Rome, are not restricted to it, but comprise the whole apostate Church, Roman, Greek, and even Protestant, so far as it has been seduced from its 'first love' to Christ, the heavenly Bridegroom, and given its affections to worldly pomps and idols."
2. "The woman is the congregation of God in its purity under the Old and New Testament, and appears again as the Bride of the Lamb, the transfigured Church prepared for the marriage feast."
3. "The woman, the invisible Church, is latent in the apostate Church and is the Church militant; the Bride is the Church triumphant."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The meaning is, that papal Rome, unfaithful to God, and idolatrous and corrupt, had seduced the rulers of the earth, and led them into the same kind of unfaithfulness, idolatry, and corruption."
2. "How true this is in history need not be stated. All the princes and kings of Europe in the dark ages, and for many centuries were, and not a few of them are now, entirely under the influence of papal Rome."
3. "What could better describe the influence of Rome on the people of the world, in making them, under these delusions, incapable of sober judgment, and in completely fascinating and controlling all their powers?"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The figure of a harlot committing fornication with kings and peoples occurs frequently in the prophets, representing the defection of God's Church and its attachment to others."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "â€˜Kingsâ€™ are the representatives of all authority; and â€˜the earthâ€™ is the guilty world."
2. "Not the kings only but all â€˜the inhabiters of the earth,â€™ all who belong to the world in its evil sense, have been betrayed by the harlot. The description is again unlimited."

2. "The kings of the inhabited earth... either for human rulers in general or the vassal kings absorbed by the Roman Empire."

### John Gill:
1. "These are the ten kings, who being of the same mind, and of one religion, the Popish religion, gave their power, strength, and kingdom to the beast."
2. "They have been enticed by the whore of Rome to commit spiritual fornication with her; that is, idolatry."

### John Wesley:
1. "With whom the kings of the earth... have committed fornication - By partaking of her idolatry and various wickedness."
2. "And the inhabitants of the earth... have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication - No wine can more thoroughly intoxicate those who drink it, than false zeal does the followers of the great whore."
