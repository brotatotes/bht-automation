# Revelation 17:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The woman in this description is portrayed as a sojourner in the world, looking towards the future city. This symbolism can be associated with the state of Rome during that time, which was described as a wilderness. The scarlet-colored beast she sits upon represents the Roman Empire, specifically in its Papal form, manifesting imperial power and cruelty. The woman's control over the beast demonstrates her influence and guidance over the Roman Empire. This vivid portrayal of the woman and the beast highlights the connection between them and sheds light on the dynamics of power during that era.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Contrast her in Revelation 12:6; Revelation 12:14, having a place in the wilderness-world, but not a home; a sojourner here, looking for the city to come."
2. "Rome, resting on the world power and ruling it by the claim of supremacy, is the chief, though not the exclusive, representative of this symbol."
3. "The seven heads in the view of many are the seven successive forms of government of Rome: kings, consuls, dictators, decemvirs, military tribunes, emperors, the German emperors."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Why this scene is laid in a wilderness or desert is not mentioned...the state of Rome at this time, as described by Mr. Gibbon, would show with what propriety the term 'wilderness' or 'desert' might be then applied to it."
2. "Does not this language look as if the author of the Apocalypse and the author of the Decline and Fall meant to play into each otherâ€™s hands?"
3. "It is applicable in the description of papal Rome because this is a favorite color there...Those who are familiar with the descriptions given of papal Rome by travelers will see at once the propriety of this description, on the supposition that it was intended to refer to the papacy."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. sitting. To manage and guide the beast. A scarlet - colored beast. The same as in ch. 13 1. This beast is ever after mentioned as to qhrion the beast. For scarlet, see on Matthew 27:6.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The expression â€˜he carried me away in spiritâ€™ is found only here and at chap. Revelation 21:10, where the vision of the New Jerusalem is introduced. It denotes spiritual ecstasy, not bodily removal." 
2. "The dwelling-place of Babylon is always ideally desolate: the fact shall afterwards correspond to the idea."
3. "The attitude of the woman towards the beast, both in this verse and in Revelation 17:7, ought to be marked. In the one she â€˜sitsâ€™ upon it; in the other it â€˜carriesâ€™ her: and the meaning is, not so much that her movements are facilitated by the beast, as that she is the beastâ€™s directress and guide."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He carried me away...In the Spirit."

3. "The harlot city (Rome) sits astride this beast with seven heads and ten horns (Roman world power)."

### John Gill:
1. "Not in body, as if he was removed from the isle of Patmos to some other place; but in a visionary way, just as Ezekiel was carried between earth and heaven, in the visions of God, to Jerusalem." 
2. "And I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast; the beast is the same with that in Revelation 13:1 as the description shows, and is no other than the Roman empire as Papal."
3. "The 'scarlet' colour is expressive of its imperial dignity, its power and authority, it received from the dragon; and also of this beast's cruelty and tyranny, and of its shedding the blood of the saints."

### John Wesley:
1. "The campagna di Roma, the country round about Rome, is now a wilderness, compared to what it was once."
2. "Both the scripture and other writers frequently represent a city under this emblem."
3. "This woman is the city of Rome, with its buildings and inhabitants; especially the nobles. The beast, which is now scarlet-colored, (bearing the bloody livery, as well as the person, of the woman,) appears very different from before."
