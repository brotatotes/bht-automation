# Revelation 17:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The woman mentioned in the passage is lavishly dressed in purple and scarlet garments, adorned with gold, precious stones, and pearls. This opulence signifies her regal position and authority, ruling over kingdoms and nations. However, beneath her outward magnificence lies moral decay and hypocrisy. Her golden cup, a symbol of allure, presents a superficial appeal, masking the abominable practices that occur within her worship. These despicable teachings and actions make her a deceitful and corrupt force, leading many astray.
