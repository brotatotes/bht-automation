# Revelation 17:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Church of Rome openly declares and promotes its idolatrous worship, inviting and ensnaring people to join. Its name, mystery, represents the mystery of iniquity that opposes the true mystery of godliness. It may be called Babylon because of its confused mixture of Paganism, Judaism, and Christianity, its pride, tyranny, cruelty, sorceries, and idolatry. In contrast, the saints bear the name of God and the Lamb on their foreheads, while the Church of Rome is the mother of various harlotries and abominations, both spiritual and fleshly.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "As the union of Christ and the Church is a 'great mystery,' so the Church conforming to the world and becoming a harlot is a counter 'mystery.'"
2. "The invisible Church of true believers is hidden and dispersed in the visible Church. The boundary lines which separate harlot and woman are not denominational nor drawn externally, but can only be spiritually discerned."
3. "Still, the Romish Church is not only accidentally and as a matter of fact, but in virtue of its very PRINCIPLE, a harlot, the metropolis of whoredom, 'the mother of harlots'; whereas the evangelical Protestant Church is, according to her principle and fundamental creed, a chaste woman; the Reformation was a protest of the woman against the harlot."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The meaning in both places is substantially the same, that it was prominent, and unmistakable."
2. "Here it seems to be used to denote that there was something hidden, obscure, or enigmatical, under the title adopted; that is, the word 'Babylon,' and the word 'mother,' were symbolical."
3. "Babylon the great - papal Rome, the nominal head of the Christian world, as Babylon had been of the pagan world."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Mystery. Some understand this as a part of the name, others as implying that the name is to be interpreted symbolically."
2. "The sect of the Fraticelli...familiarized the common mind with the notion that Rome was the Babylon, the great harlot of the Apocalypse."
3. "The harlot is the corrupted Church of Rome; the seven heads are the seven hills on which the city is built...the ten horns are the ten commandments."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word ‘mystery’ may be understood either as a part of the name, or as an intimation of the writer that the name is to be understood symbolically. The latter interpretation is to be preferred."
2. "It is unnecessary, in illustration of this verse to refer to the fact that in the pagan world harlots had their names attached to their foreheads."
3. "More particularly the name thus borne upon the forehead is a parody of the name borne upon the forehead of the high priest."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Roman harlots wore a label with their names on their brows, and so here."
2. "There is undoubtedly a contrast between this woman here and the woman in chapter Revelation 17:12."
3. "The Metropolis of the Empire is the mother of harlotry and of the world's idolatries."

### John Gill:
1. "And this is expressive of the openness and impudence of the church of Rome, in her idolatrous worship; she openly declares it, and pleads for it, and invites and ensnares persons to join with her in it."
2. "Her name is 'mystery'; not the mystery of godliness, that she dislikes and opposes, but the mystery of iniquity; which is the name antichrist went by in the Apostle Paul's time."
3. "The church of Rome may well be called Babylon, because of the signification of it, confusion, its doctrine and worship being a confused mixture of Paganism, Judaism, and Christianity; and because of the pride and haughtiness of it, its tyranny and cruelty, and its sorceries and idolatry."

### John Wesley:
1. "Whereas the saints have the name of God and the Lamb on their foreheads."
2. "The mother of harlots — The parent, ringleader, patroness, and nourisher of many daughters, that loosely copy after her."
3. "And abominations — Of every kind, spiritual and fleshly."
