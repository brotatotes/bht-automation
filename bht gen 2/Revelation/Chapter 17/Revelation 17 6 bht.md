# Revelation 17:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To see a woman drunk, not with wine, but with blood, is a monstrous and shocking sight. Rome, often referred to as the slaughter-house of the martyrs, has shed much Christian blood throughout history, to the point of becoming intoxicated by it. It is astonishing to witness her cruelty and the patience of God in allowing such a bloodthirsty creature to exist on earth.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Elsewhere (Revelation 17:8; Revelation 13:3), all the earthly-minded ('they that dwell on the earth') wonder in admiration of the beast. Here only is John's wonder called forth; not the beast, but the woman sunken into the harlot, the Church become a world-loving apostate, moves his sorrowful astonishment at so awful a change."
2. "That the world should be beastly is natural, but that the faithful bride should become the whore is monstrous."
3. "It is striking that in Revelation 13:3- :, 'woman' has not the article, 'the woman,' as if she had been before mentioned: for though identical in one sense with the woman, Revelation 13:3- :, in another sense she is not."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The meaning here is, that the persecuting power referred to had shed the blood of the saints; and that, in its fury, it had, as it were, drunk the blood of the slain, and had become, by drinking that blood, intoxicated and infuriated."
2. "The meaning is, that the warfare, in which so much blood was shed, was directed against the saints as such, and that, in fact, it terminated particularly on those who, amidst cruel sufferings, were faithful witnesses for the Lord Jesus, and deserved to be called, by way of eminence, 'martyrs'."
3. "I was astonished at her appearance, at her apparel, and at the things which were so significantly symbolized by her."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Saints - martyrs. The saints include the martyrs or witnesses, but the latter word emphasizes the testimony of the saints which has been the cause of their death. For martyr; see on 1 Peter 5:1.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The description of the ungovernable fierceness of the woman’s spirit is continued."
2. "He is overwhelmed with astonishment at the spectacle, yet not so much probably at the royal magnificence of the woman, as that, being a woman, she should exhibit such tokens of a cruel and bloodthirsty spirit, denying the nature that properly belonged to her."
3. "At this point it might have been well to inquire into the meaning of ‘Babylon’ in these verses, but so much has still to be said of that city that it seems better to delay the inquiry until we have finished the exposition of the whole passage."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Drunken with the blood of the saints" (μεθυουσαν εκ του αιματος των αγιων). 
2. "Of the martyrs of Jesus" (των μαρτυρων Ιησου).
3. "Drunk with blood" is a common idea with the ancients (Euripides, Josephus, Philo, Cicero, Pliny).

### John Gill:
1. "To see a woman drunk is a shameful sight; but to see one drunk, not with wine, but with blood, is monstrous, cruel, and shocking."
2. "The woman being drunk with their blood, denotes the blood thirstiness of the church of Rome, her greedy and insatiable desire after the blood of the saints, and her delight in it."
3. "He wondered at her inhumanity and cruelty, being as savage as the beast she rode on; and also at God's forbearance of her, that he, who is a pure and holy Being, a lover of his saints, an avenger of his elect, should suffer such a brutish, barbarous, and bloodthirsty creature, to live upon earth."

### John Wesley:
1. "Rome may well be called, 'The slaughter-house of the martyrs.'"
2. "She hath shed much Christian blood in every age; but at length she is even drunk with it."
3. "I wondered exceedingly — at her cruelty and the patience of God."
