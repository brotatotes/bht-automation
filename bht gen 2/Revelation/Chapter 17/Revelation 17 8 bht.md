# Revelation 17:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This passage reveals the three stages of the beast's existence: it was, it is not, and it will ascend from the abyss and be destroyed. The beast's transformation is depicted in a fourfold manner, emphasizing these distinct periods. In the first stage, the beast represents the former Roman empire. The second stage signifies a temporary absence of its beastly nature. Lastly, the beast emerges as the eighth, yet remains part of the original seven, meeting its ultimate demise.

2. "The beast, or Antichristian world power, returns worse than ever, with satanic powers from hell, not merely from the sea of convulsed nations."
3. "The continuance of this revived seventh (that is, the eighth) head is short: it is therefore called 'the son of perdition,' who is essentially doomed to it almost immediately after his appearance."
