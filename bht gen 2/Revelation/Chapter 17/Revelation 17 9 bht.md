# Revelation 17:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The connection between mountains and kings goes beyond the mere fact that Rome is built on seven hills. This symbolism extends to the contrast between Mount Zion, representing the Lord's house, and the worldly influence and hindrances represented by the woman sitting on the seven hills. The mention of these hills alludes to Rome, a city known for its seven hills. This imagery suggests that the woman represents the Church, resting and conforming to the power of the world throughout history.

3. "This confirms that the beast...is the Roman empire, since she is here said to sit on the seven mountains, on which Rome, the metropolis of that empire, was built; and this shows the pope of Rome to be antichrist, the great whore, Babylon, the mother of harlots."

1. Here is the mind that hath wisdom â€” Only those who are wise will understand this. The seven heads are seven hills.
