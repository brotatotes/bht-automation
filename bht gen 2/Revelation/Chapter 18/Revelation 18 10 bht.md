# Revelation 18:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Rome, known for its strength, stands in fearful anticipation of the torment that awaits the great city. The fear is so great that even those standing afar off have no desire to approach and offer any assistance. In the destruction of Rome, the mighty kings and governments that once supported her now lament, realizing that their own power has crumbled alongside hers. The judgment upon the great whore is swift and sudden, bringing an end to her reign of vengeance.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "God's judgments inspire fear even in the worldly, but it is of short duration."
2. "The kings and great men soon attach themselves to the beast in its last and worst shape, as open Antichrist."
3. "Rome in Greek means strength; though that derivation is doubtful."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Standing afar off for the fear of her torment - Not daring to approach, to attempt to rescue and save her."
2. "Alas, alas, that great city Babylon - The language of lamentation that so great and so mighty a city should fall."
3. "For in one hour is thy judgment come - See the notes on Revelation 18:8. The general sentiment here is, that, in the final ruin of papal Rome, the kings and governments that had sustained her, and had been sustained by her, would see the source of their power taken away, but that they would not, or could not attempt her rescue."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Standing afar off (απο μακροθεν εστηκοτες). Perfect active (intransitive) participle of ιστημ. Vivid picture of the terrible scene, fascinated by the lurid blaze (cf. Nero's delight in the burning of Rome in A.D. 64), and yet afraid to draw near." 
2. "There is a weird charm in a burning city. They feared the same fate (cf. verse Revelation 18:7 for βασανισμου, torment).Woe, woe, the great city (ουαι, ουαι, η πολις η μεγαλη). Only example in the Apocalypse of the nominative with ουα except verses Revelation 18:16; Revelation 18:19, though in Luke 6:25 and common in LXX (Isaiah 5:7; Isaiah 5:11, etc.)."
3. "In one hour (μια ωρα). Repeated in verses Revelation 18:16; Revelation 18:19, and like μια ημερα (in one day) in verse Revelation 18:8. Some MSS. have here μιαν ωραν, like ποιαν ωραν (accusative of extent of time) in Revelation 3:3. See verse Revelation 18:8 (ο κρινας) for η κρισις σου (thy judgment). This is the dirge of the kings."

### John Gill:
1. "Le stpls afar off for the fear of her torment.... Lest they themselves should share in it." 
2. "The mount of Esau in Obadiah 1:21 is interpreted ית כרכא רבא, 'that great city' of Esau, which is Rome."
3. "Her vengeance was suddenly come upon her; this is the judgment of the great whore."

### John Wesley:
1. "Thou strong city — Rome was anciently termed by its inhabitants, Valentia, that is, strong."
2. "And the word Rome itself, in Greek, signifies strength."
3. "This name was given it by the Greek strangers."
