# Revelation 18:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The wailing and mourning of the merchants of the earth is a response to the sudden halt of trade and the decline in demand for their goods. While the merchandise mentioned may still find buyers in other places, it is clear that these particular items will be universally rejected and despised. The merchants' sorrow over the fall of Rome and the loss of their prosperous trade is justified, as it signifies the end of their lucrative business and a major shift in the global market.
