# Revelation 18:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Gold, fine linen, and thyine wood were highly prized and sought after in ancient times. These valuable items were used as a form of currency and for adornment in both religious ceremonies and everyday life. Fine linen, in particular, was known for its exceptional quality and high cost, making it a luxury item for the wealthy. Silk, on the other hand, was a precious and expensive fabric that could only be afforded by the privileged few. The allure of these riches and the associations with wealth and beauty were used to symbolize the opulence and allure of the apostate Church.
