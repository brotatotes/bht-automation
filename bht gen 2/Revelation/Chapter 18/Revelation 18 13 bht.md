# Revelation 18:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Cinnamon, odours, ointments, frankincense...things for delight and pleasure, gratifying the senses. They are mentioned alongside beasts, with cows and oxen. The usage of souls of men is fitting for spiritual harlotry, apostate Christendom. The trafficking of slaves in ancient times can be compared to the buying and selling of souls by the Roman traffickers, a gainful and destructive merchandise.
