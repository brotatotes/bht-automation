# Revelation 18:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The merchants, who were made rich by the city, will stand far away, filled with fear because of the city's torment. They know that they were partners in her crimes and fear that they will share in her punishment. Outwardly, they will deny their association with her and embrace the reformed religion, but inwardly, they will weep and mourn for the destruction of the city and the loss of their riches.
