# Revelation 18:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The great city, adorned with fine linen, purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, precious stones, and pearls, brings to mind the image of a rich and frivolously clad woman. In a single hour, the city's wealth and prosperity are utterly destroyed, just as the kings of the earth lament. This is the dirge of the merchants, whose trade and luxury are ruined by the downfall of the city. The description of the city's splendor and subsequent desolation echoes the imagery used in Ezekiel 27:32.
