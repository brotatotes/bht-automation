# Revelation 18:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In just a short span of time, the immense riches of Rome will be completely wiped out. Rome has always been renowned for its great wealth and prosperity. The ships mentioned refer figuratively to dioceses, abbeys, priories, and monasteries, and the masters or governors of these institutions represent the bishops, abbots, priors, and heads of various orders within the church. This points to the swift and thorough destruction that will befall the apostate Christendom.
