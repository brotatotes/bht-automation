# Revelation 18:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The destruction of the great city invoked great lamentation from those who witnessed it. As the smoke rose from its burning, they cried out, acknowledging that there was no city like it in all its greatness. This city, renowned for its power, authority, pride, luxury, and idolatry, was unmatched in its level of blasphemy, superstition, and impenitence. This mourning echoes the sentiments expressed by the sailors when they witnessed the downfall of Tyre, illustrating the magnitude of the calamity that had befallen this city.
