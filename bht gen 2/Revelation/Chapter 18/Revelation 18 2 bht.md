# Revelation 18:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
And he cried mightily with a strong voice, declaring the fall of Babylon. Babylon is fallen and has become a habitation of devils, a prison for every unclean spirit, and a dwelling place for unclean beasts and hateful birds. The judgment of the great day is depicted here, signifying the eternal fate of those who dwell in spiritual Babylon. This fall was mentioned before but is now declared at large. Let us consider the true nature of Babylon and the consequences that await its inhabitants.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "mightily . . . strongâ€”not supported by manuscripts. But A, B, Vulgate, Syriac, and Coptic read, 'with (literally, 'in') a mighty voice.'" 
2. "is fallen, is fallenâ€”so A, Vulgate, Syriac, and ANDREAS. But B and Coptic omit the second 'is fallen' (Isaiah 21:9; Jeremiah 51:8). This phrase is here prophetical of her fall, still future, as Jeremiah 51:8 proves." 
3. "devilsâ€”Greek, 'demons.' the holdâ€”a keep or prison."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The language here is taken from the description of Babylon in Isaiah 13:20-22; and for a full illustration of the meaning, see the notes on that passage." 
2. "The idea is that of utter desolation; and the meaning here is, that spiritual Babylon - papal Rome Revelation 14:8 - will be reduced to a state of utter desolation resembling that of the real Babylon."
3. "It is the papacy, represented under the image of the city, and having its seat there. That is to be destroyed as utterly as was Babylon of old; that will become as odious, and loathsome, and detestable as the literal Babylon, the abode of monsters is."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Mightily with a strong voice [ÎµÎ½ Î¹ÏƒÏ‡Ï…Î¹ Ï†Ï‰Î½Î· Î¼ÎµÎ³Î±Î»Î·]. Omit megalh great, and read ijscura fwnh with a mighty voice."
2. "Fallen, fallen is Babylon."
3. "Devils [Î´Î±Î¹Î¼Î¿Î½Ï‰Î½]. Properly, demons, which Rev., strangely commits to the margin."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In chap. Revelation 19:6 we read of â€˜mighty thundersâ€™ and it is impossible to doubt, therefore, that this voice is described in a similar way, not because all men are to hear it, but because it is to strike all with awe and terror."
2. "Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen. These words have already met us at chap. Revelation 14:8 (comp. Isaiah 21:9), but the description is now enlarged, Old Testament passages such as Isaiah 13:21, Jeremiah 51:37, supplying the particulars."
3. "Everything about the city is changed into a wild and hateful desert. The unclean beasts and birds themselves that are driven into her ruins regard them as a prison."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great. Prophetic aorists of Ï€Î¹Ï€Ï„Ï‰ repeated like a solemn dirge of the damned."
2. "A habitation of devils. Late word, in N.T. only here and Ephesians 2:22. Devils should be demons, of course."
3. "A hold of every unclean and hateful bird. The evil spirits, watching over fallen Rome like night-birds or harpies that wait for their prey, build their eyries in the broken towers which rise from the ashes of the city."

### John Gill:
1. "And he cried mightily with a strong voice...which shows the vehemence and affection of the ministers of the Word." 
2. "Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen...this is said to be fallen, because, in a very little time after this declaration, it will fall." 
3. "And is become the habitation of devils...the pope and his cardinals, the priests, Jesuits, monks, and friars, are the spirits of devils, and their doctrines the doctrines of devils."

### John Wesley:
1. "And he cried, Babylon is fallen â€” This fall was mentioned before, Revelation 14:8; but is now declared at large."
2. "And is become an habitation â€” A free abode. Of devils, and an hold â€” A prison. Of every unclean spirit â€” Perhaps confined there where they had once practised all uncleanness, till the judgment of the great day."
3. "How many horrid inhabitants hath desolate Babylon! of invisible beings, devils, and unclean spirits; of visible, every unclean beast, every filthy and hateful bird. Suppose, then, Babylon to mean heathen Rome; what have the Romanists gained, seeing from the time of that destruction, which they say is past, these are to be its only inhabitants for ever."
