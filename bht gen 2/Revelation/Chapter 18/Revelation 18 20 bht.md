# Revelation 18:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The angel's call for heaven and God's holy ones to rejoice at her fall is a stark contrast to the mourning of those who benefited from her corruption. The destruction of the wicked city brings joy to the righteous, as it signifies the removal of a great hindrance to the spread of the gospel. This judgment on the guilty city is seen as a fulfillment of what the righteous have proclaimed and desired. It is a reminder that God is the ultimate judge, executing justice on behalf of the righteous.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There is a strong contrast between this language and what precedes. Kings, merchants, and seamen, who had been countenanced and sustained by her in the indulgence of corrupt passions, or who had been enriched by traffic with her, would have occasion to mourn. But not so they who had been persecuted by her." 
2. "The great oppressor of the church, and the corrupter of the world, was now destroyed; the grand hindrance to the spread of the gospel was now removed, and all the holy in heaven and on earth would have occasion to rejoice."
3. "All the redeemed, therefore, in earth and in heaven, are interested in whatever tends to retard or to promote the cause of truth. All have occasion to mourn when the enemies of the truth triumph; to rejoice when they fall."

3. "For God hath judged your judgment upon her. The meaning is that that judgment on the wicked which the righteous have passed is regarded as executed for them by God Himself."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Rejoice over her (Ευφραινου επ' αυτη). Present middle imperative of ευφραινω, for which verb see Revelation 11:10, used there of the joy of the wicked over the death of the two witnesses, just the opposite picture to this."
2. "The song of doom" (Charles) here seems to be voiced by John himself.
3. "God hath judged your judgment (εκρινεν ο θεος το κριμα). First aorist (prophetic) active of κρινω and cognate accusative κριμα, here a case for trial (Exodus 18:22; 1 Corinthians 6:7), not a sentence as in Revelation 17:1. God has approved the case of heaven."

1. "Heaven may be literally understood, which sometimes is addressed when anything of very considerable note and moment is done or spoken of."
2. "[...] the true church of Christ upon earth, which in this book often goes by the name of heaven, in opposition to the apostate church, called the earth, because its members, doctrines, and ordinances, are from heaven, and its happiness lies there."
3. "By 'saints' may be meant private members of churches, who are sanctified by the Spirit of God, and live holy lives and conversations; and by 'apostles', not the twelve apostles, or persons in such an office as they were, but ordinary ministers of the word, who are sent forth to preach the Gospel, and will be upon the spot at the destruction of Babylon, and will be such as shall have preached and defended the pure apostolic doctrine."

### John Wesley:
1. Rejoice over her, thou heaven — That is, all the inhabitants of it; and more especially, ye saints; and among the saints still more eminently, ye apostles and prophets.
