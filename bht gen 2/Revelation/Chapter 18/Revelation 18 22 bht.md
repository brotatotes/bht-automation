# Revelation 18:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The destruction of Babylon, symbolizing papal Rome, will bring an end to the desecration of art and worship. The festivities and joy expressed through music will cease, along with the flutes, harps, and other musical instruments. This imagery reflects the complete decay and desolation that will come upon Babylon. Even the sounds of the city, like the bells and the millstone, will be silenced forever, leaving no one to inhabit the once bustling city. (55 words)

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The idea, in this verse and the following, is substantially the same as in the previous parts of the chapter, that the mystical Babylon - papal Rome - would be brought to utter desolation."

3. "The female flute-players, usually dissolute characters, were indispensable attendants at the Greek banquets."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The voice (φωνη). Cf. Ezekiel 26:13. Or 'sound' as in 1 Corinthians 14:8 with σαλπιγξ (trumpet)."
2. "Of harpers (κιθαρωιδων). Old word (from κιθαρα, harp, and ωιδος, singer) as in Revelation 14:2."
3. "Of minstrels (μουσικων). Old word (from μουσα, music), here only in N.T., one playing on musical instruments."

### John Gill:
1. "There will be no more bells, nor organs, or any other instruments of music; no more chanters, and sub-chanters, choristers, singing men and boys."
2. "It is threatened to Judah, that the cunning artificer should be taken from her... and this judgment may fall on Rome for her worshipping idols of gold, silver, brass, stone, and wood, the works of men's hands, artificers and craftsmen."
3. "There will be a famine at the time that Rome is besieged... and after it is destroyed, there will be no corn to grind, nor inhabitants to eat it, and so no use of the millstone."

### John Wesley:
1. "Arts of every kind, particularly music, sculpture, painting, and statuary, were there carried to their greatest height. No, nor even the sound of a mill-stone shall be heard any more in thee - Not only the arts that adorn life, but even those employments without which it cannot subsist, will cease from thee for ever."
2. "Music was the entertainment of the rich and great; trade, the business of men of middle rank; preparing bread and the necessaries of life, the employment of the lowest people: marriages, in which lamps and songs were known ceremonies, are the means of peopling cities, as new births supply the place of those that die."
3. "Neither rich nor poor, neither persons of middle rank, nor those of the lowest condition, should be able to live there any more. Neither shall it be repeopled by new marriages, but remain desolate and uninhabited for ever." (87 words)
