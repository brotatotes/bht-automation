# Revelation 18:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The city of Babylon, or Rome, will be totally deprived of any comforts, even the smallest ones, as indicated by the absence of any candlelight in Revelation 22:5. In contrast, the heavenly city is described as having the light of the Lord God. Unlike the heavenly city, Babylon will lack any brightness or illumination. The downfall of Babylon is attributed to its merchants, who were once powerful and influential figures. The merchants' association with the city brought about their sinfulness and indulgence in pride and luxury.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "What a blessed contrast is Revelation 22:5, respecting the city of God: 'They need no candle (just as Babylon shall no more have the light of a candle, but for a widely different reason), for the Lord God giveth them light.'"
2. "Contrast the heavenly city, with its Bridegroom, Bride, and blessed marriage supper (Revelation 19:7; Revelation 19:9; Revelation 21:2; Revelation 21:9; Isaiah 62:4; Isaiah 62:5)."
3. "The great men of... were thy merchants."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee - Another image of desolation, as if every light were put out, and there were total darkness."
2. "For thy merchants were the great men of the earth - Those who dealt with thee were the rich, and among them were even nobles and princes; and now that they trade with thee no more there is occasion for lamentation and sorrow."
3. "For by thy sorceries were all nations deceived - This is stated as a reason for the ruin that had come upon her. It is a common representation of papal Rome that she has deceived or deluded the nations of the earth, and no representation ever made accords more with facts as they have occurred."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Bridegroom - bride." 
2. "By thy sorceries...more literally, with thy sorcery." 
3. "Were deceived...led astray."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is not known whether Rome had street lights or not." 
2. "Even the occasional flash of the torches carried by bridal processions is seen no more."
3. "True medical science has had a hard fight to shake off chicanery and charlatanry."

### John Gill:
1. "This shows that Babylon, or Rome, shall be deprived of everything, even of the least thing that is comfortable in life."
2. "There will be no marrying, nor giving in marriage; no procreation of children, or propagation of posterity, in this place; which denotes the utter extirpation of the inhabitants of it."
3. "Meaning her false doctrines, traditions, idolatry, superstition, and will worship, with which, as another Jezebel, she has bewitched, allured, and deceived the nations of the empire, and the kings thereof."

### John Wesley:
1. "For thy merchants were the great men of the earth."
2. "A circumstance which was in itself indifferent, and yet led them into pride, luxury, and numberless other sins."
