# Revelation 18:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The destruction of the faithless Church, represented by Babylon the harlot, is not solely due to its luxury and idolatry. The shedding of the blood of prophets and saints also contributes to its demise. This includes the martyrdom of countless believers, from the time of Nero to the present. Rome, in particular, bears the weight of this guilt, as it has been responsible for the shedding of Catholic blood throughout history. The city's role in the persecution of the faithful is immense, making it unparalleled in its blood-guiltiness among all cities in the annals of human civilization.
