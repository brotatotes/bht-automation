# Revelation 18:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Another voice was heard, warning the scattered people of Christ to come out of the Apostate Church and not participate in her sins. This call to separate themselves from the darkness and corruption of the world is imperative for those who desire to avoid the plagues and punishments that will befall the harlot. The Revelation, with its striking message, was providentially preserved and printed before the Reformation, challenging the Papists to confront the remarkable truths within it.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "So also in every apostate or world-conforming church there are some of God's invisible and true Church, who, if they would be safe, must come out."
2. "The harlot is not Rome alone (though she is pre-eminently so), but every Church that has not Christ's mind and spirit."
3. "The first justification of the woman is in her being called out of Babylon the harlot, as the culminating stage of the latter's sin, when judgment is about to fall."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That they might not participate in her sins..."
2. "This is an universal truth in regard to iniquity, and hence it is the duty of those who would be pure to come out from the world, and to separate themselves from all the associations of evil."
3. "There never was any duty plainer than that of withdrawing from papal Rome; there never has been any act attended with more happy consequences than that by which the Protestant world separated itself forever from the sins and the plagues of the papacy."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Come out of her." - Compare Jeremiah 51:6, Jeremiah 51:45; Isaiah 48:20; Isaiah 52:11; Numbers 16:26.
2. "Have fellowship with [συγκοινωνησητε]." - This compound verb is not of frequent occurrence in the New Testament. It is found only in Ephesians 5:11, Philippians 4:14, and here.
3. "On the kindred noun sugkoinwnov companion, see on ch. Revelation 1:9."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Come forth out of her, my people, that ye may have no communion with her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues."
2. "The voice is that of an angel although, as coming out of heaven, we are to hear in it the voice of God or of Christ."
3. "Two reasons are assigned for this departure; first, that God’s people may have no communion with the sins of Babylon, and secondly, that they may escape participation in her punishment."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Come forth, my people, out of her" - Like Isaiah 48:20; Isaiah 52:11; Jeremiah 50:8; Jeremiah 51:6, (about Babylon). See also the call of Abram (Genesis 12:1). The rescue of Lot (Genesis 19:12).
2. "That ye have no fellowship with her sins" - Purpose clause with ινα μη and the first aorist active subjunctive of συνκοινωνεω, old compound (συν, together, κοινωνος, partner), in N.T. only here, Philippians 4:14; Ephesians 5:11. With associative instrumental case αμαρτιαις.
3. "And that ye receive not of her plagues" - Another purpose clause dependent on the preceding, with ινα μη and the second aorist active subjunctive of λαμβανω, and with proleptic emphatic position of εκ των πληγων αυτης before ινα μη.

### John Gill:
1. "Come out of her, my people; meaning either his elect ones, till now uncalled, being such whom God had chosen for his people, and were so by virtue of the covenant of grace."
2. "That ye be not partakers of her sins: by conniving at them, or committing the same; and all such are partakers of them, and have fellowship with these unfruitful works of darkness, that are in the communion of that church."
3. "And that ye receive not of her plagues; or punishments; the seven last plagues, which belong to her, the vials of which will be poured out upon one or other of the antichristian states, and the fifth particularly will fall upon Rome, the seat of the beast, and is what is here referred to."

### John Wesley:
1. "And I heard another voice — Of Christ, whose people, secretly scattered even there, are warned of her approaching destruction."
2. "That ye be not partakers of her sins — That is, of the fruits of them."
3. "What a remarkable providence it was that the Revelation was printed in the midst of Spain, in the great Polyglot Bible, before the Reformation! Else how much easier had it been for the Papists to reject the whole book, than it is to evade these striking parts of it."
