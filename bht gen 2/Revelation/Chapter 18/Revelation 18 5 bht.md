For a city's sins to reach unto heaven signifies the magnitude of guilt. The phrase denotes not only the multitude of sins committed, but also God's knowledge and notice of each one. The sins are like a chain, soldered together, and joined as one solid mass, crying out for vengeance. As the city's iniquities are remembered, her punishment draws near. This expression signifies the highest level of guilt.
