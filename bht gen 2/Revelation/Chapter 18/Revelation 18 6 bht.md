# Revelation 18:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The call is made to those who have suffered under her influence to retaliate and bring about the deserved vengeance. They are instructed to repay her in the same way she has treated others, specifically the saints of God. The idea is to administer double the measure of what she has inflicted, in accordance with the principle of just retribution.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "She had not rewarded or repaid the world power for some injury which the world power had inflicted on her; but she had given the world power that which was its due, namely, spiritual delusions, because it did not like to retain God in its knowledge."
2. "Contrast with this the double of joy which Jerusalem shall receive for her past suffering; even as she has received double punishment for her sins."
3. "Fill to her double of the Lord's cup of wrath."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Reward her even as she rewarded you" - Applied to mystical Babylon - papal Rome - it would seem to be a call on the nations that had been so long under her sway, and among whom, from time to time, so much blood had been shed by her, to arise now in their might, and to inflict deserved vengeance.
2. "And double unto her double according to her works" - That is, bring upon her double the amount of calamity which she has brought upon others; take ample vengeance upon her.
3. "Fill to her double" - Let her drink abundantly of the wine of the wrath of God - double what she has dealt out to others. That is, either let the quantity administered to her be doubled, or let the ingredients in the cup be doubled in intensity.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Double [διπλωσατε] . Only here in the New Testament. Compare Isaiah 40:2; Jeremiah 16:18; Zechariah 9:19. The Levitical law insisted on the double recompense. See Exodus 22:4, Exodus 22:7, Exodus 22:9.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Render unto her even as she rendered, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she filled fill to her double." The same voice is continued, but is now addressed to the ministers of judgment, the kings and the beast who have turned round upon the harlot... Judgment is administered according to the lex talionis."
2. "The doubling seems to be founded on the law of Exodus 22:4; Exodus 22:7; Exodus 22:9, and on the threatening of Jeremiah 16:18."
3. "Her sins have been so great that there has been a double mention of them, and the punishment shall be proportioned to the sin."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Render as she rendered..." (αποδοτε ως απεδωκεν). 
2. "Double the double" (διπλωσατε τα διπλα). 
3. "Mingle unto her double" (κερασατε αυτη διπλουν).

### John Gill:
1. "These are called upon to take vengeance, by way of retaliation, for what she had done to them."
2. "They shall utterly burn her with fire; and as she has shed the blood of the righteous, and drank it, and been drunk with it, they shall give her blood to drink."
3. "They should use her with double severity to that she had used them with; seeing her sins deserved a severer treatment than even they had had from her."

### John Wesley:
1. "Reward her — This God speaks to the executioners of his vengeance."
2. "Even as she hath rewarded — Others; in particular, the saints of God."
3. "And give her double — This, according to the Hebrew idiom, implies only a full retaliation."
