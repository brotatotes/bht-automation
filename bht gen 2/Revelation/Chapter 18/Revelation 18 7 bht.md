## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But A, B, and C prefix 'that.' I . . . am no widow—for the world power is my husband and my supporter."
2. "I am seated (this long time) . . . I am no widow . . . I shall see no sorrow," marks her complete unconcerned security as to the past, present, and future.
3. "As Babylon was queen of the East, so Rome has been queen of the West, and is called on Imperial coins 'the eternal city.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "How much she hath glorified herself - Been proud, boastful, arrogant. This was true of ancient Babylon, that she was proud and haughty; and it has been no less true of mystical Babylon - papal Rome."
2. "So much torment and sorrow give her - Let her punishment correspond with her sins. This is expressing substantially the same idea which occurs in the previous verse."
3. "And shall see no sorrow - This is indicative of a state where there was nothing feared, notwithstanding all the indications which existed of approaching calamity. In this state we may expect to find papal Rome, even when its last judgments are about to come upon it; in this state it has usually been; in this state it is now."

### Marvin Vincent:

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Herself (αυτην). Reflexive pronoun, accusative also with εδοξασεν."
2. "Waxed wanton (εστρηνιασεν). First aorist (ingressive) active indicative of στρηνιαω (to live luxuriously), verb in late comedy instead of τρυφαω (James 5:5), from στρηνος (Revelation 18:3), only here in N.T."
3. "I sit a queen (καθημα βασιλισσα). Predicate nominative for the old form βασιλεια (βασιλις), as in Matthew 12:42."

### John Gill:
1. "How much she hath glorified herself....exalting herself above all emperors, kings, and princes, above all kingdoms and states."
2. "In a very luxuriant manner, as the popes, cardinals, archbishops, bishops, priests, monks, and friars have done..."
3. "By pulling down her pride, which goes before a fall, than which nothing could more torment and afflict her; by stripping her of her fine clothes and rich apparel; and by taking away her fat benefices from her, which will cut her to the heart; and by burning her with fire, which will be very excruciating."
