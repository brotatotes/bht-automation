# Revelation 18:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The judgment upon the city of Rome will be an overwhelming and swift destruction. This judgment will be executed upon her in a very short span of time, one plague after another, leaving her unable to bear more children. It will bring immense sorrow and various forms of suffering, including famine that will replace the luxurious plenty she once enjoyed. The punishment of Rome, determined by the Lord God Almighty, will be an inevitable consequence of her arrogance, crimes, and presumption.
