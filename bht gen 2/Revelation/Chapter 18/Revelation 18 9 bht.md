# Revelation 18:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The downfall of the faithless Church, which had condoned and practiced self-indulgent luxury, will elicit mourning and lament from the kings of this world. Indulging in sensual and idolatrous practices, the kings will inwardly mourn and outwardly express their sorrow at the desolation they witness. This will serve as a reminder of the consequences faced by those who align themselves with corrupt and immoral ways.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The faithless Church, instead of reproving, connived at the self-indulgent luxury of the great men of this world, and sanctioned it by her own practice."
2. "Men's carnal mind relishes a religion like that of the apostate Church, which gives an opiate to conscience, while leaving the sinner license to indulge his lusts."
3. "Contrast the world's rejoicing over the dead bodies of the two witnesses who had tormented it by their faithfulness, with its lamentations over the harlot who had made the way to heaven smooth, and had been found a useful tool in keeping subjects in abject tyranny."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The kings of the earth seem to be represented as among the chief mourners, because they had derived important aid from the power which was now to be reduced to ruin."
2. "Europe might have been long since free if it had not been for the support which despotic governments have derived from the papacy."
3. "The fall of the papacy will be the signal for a general overturning of the thrones of Europe."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Shall weep (ÎºÎ»Î±Ï…ÏƒÎ¿Ï…ÏƒÎ¹Î½). Future active of ÎºÎ»Î±Î¹Ï‰, middle ÎºÎ»Î±Ï…ÏƒÎ¿Î½Ï„Î± in Attic, as in John 16:20." 
2. "And wail over her (ÎºÎ± ÎºÎ¿ÏˆÎ¿Î½Ï„Î± ÎµÏ€' Î±Ï…Ï„Î·Î½). Future direct middle of ÎºÎ¿Ï€Ï„Ï‰, old verb, to beat, to cut, middle to beat oneself (Revelation 1:7)."
3. "When they look upon (Î¿Ï„Î±Î½ Î²Î»ÎµÏ€Ï‰ÏƒÎ¹Î½). Indefinite temporal clause with Î¿Ï„Î±Î½ and the present active subjunctive of Î²Î»ÎµÏ€Ï‰."

### John Gill:
