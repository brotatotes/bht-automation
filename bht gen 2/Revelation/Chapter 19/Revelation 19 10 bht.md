# Revelation 19:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
John, overwhelmed by the angel's glorious message of the conversion of the Jews, was about to worship the angel out of reverence. However, the angel swiftly interrupts and reminds John that worship is to be reserved for God alone. The angel emphasizes their shared role as fellow servants, both tasked with bearing testimony to Jesus. This rebuke signifies the end of idolatrous worship of any creature or image and underscores the significance of bearing witness to Jesus through the Spirit of prophecy.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It forms a marked contrast to the sorrowful wonder with which
he had looked on the Church in her apostasy as the harlot. It exemplifies the corrupt tendencies of our fallen nature."
2. "That even John, an apostle, should have all but fallen into 'voluntary humility and worshipping of angels,' which Paul warns us against."
3. "We angels, and you apostles, all alike have the testimony of (bear testimony concerning) Jesus by the operation of one and the same Spirit, who enables me to show you these revelations and enables you to record them: wherefore we are fellow servants, not I your lord to be worshipped by you."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "John was entirely overcome with the majesty of the heavenly messenger, and with the amazing truths that he had disclosed to him, and in the overflowing of his feelings he fell upon the earth in the posture of adoration."
2. "This may be regarded as an admonition to be careful in our worship; not to allow our feelings to overcome us; and not to render that homage to a creature which is due to God alone."
3. "The sentiment is, that in promoting religion in the world, we are associated with angels. It is no condescension in them to be engaged in the service of the Redeemer, though it seems to be condescension for them to be associated with us in anything."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "See thou do it not [ορα μη] . See not (to do it)." 
2. "The testimony of Jesus [η μαρτυρια του ιησου] . Some explain as the testimony which proceeds from Jesus."
3. "The way of bearing this witness, the substance and essence of this testimony is the Spirit of prophecy."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The angel reminds the Apostle that worship is due to God alone; that he himself is only his fellow-servant." 
2. "For the witness of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy." 
3. "I, because I prophesy, and because the witness of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy, am also a witness of Jesus; thou and I therefore occupy the same footing before God, and we must worship God alone."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "John either felt that the angel represented God or he was beside himself with excitement over the glorious consummation."

3. "The possession of the prophetic spirit shows itself in witness to Jesus."

### John Gill:
1. "Being transported with the news he brought him of the marriage, or conversion of his countrymen the Jews, and struck with reverence and awe of the glory and majesty in which the angel appeared to him..."
2. "...spoken in an abrupt manner, and in great haste; as fearing he would be guilty of idolatry, before he could speak all his mind, and use the arguments that were necessary to dissuade from it..."
3. "...this excludes all creatures, angels, and men, things animate or inanimate, and images of them; the worshipping of which will now be no more, or at least will be quickly at an end."

### John Wesley:
1. "To pray to or worship the highest creature is flat idolatry."
2. "I am thy fellowservant and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus — I am now employed as your fellowservant, to testify of the Lord Jesus, by the same Spirit which inspired the prophets of old."
