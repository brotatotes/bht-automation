# Revelation 19:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
And with many diadems on his head, representing his universal rule, Christ's eyes, like flames of fire, show his omniscience, penetrating into the depths of all things. His name, hidden and unknown except to himself, signifies his divine nature and incomprehensibility to all creatures.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Christ's diadem comprises all the diadems of the earth and of heavenly powers too."
2. "These usurpers claim the diadems which belong to Christ alone."
3. "The Lord's own 'new name' is to be theirs, and to be 'in their foreheads'; whence we may infer that His as yet unknown name also is written on His forehead."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "And on his head were many crowns - Many diadems, indicative of his universal reign."
2. "That no man knew but he himself - This cannot here mean that no one could read the name, but the idea is, that no one but himself could fully understand its import."
3. "It involved a depth of meaning, and a degree of sacredness, and a relation to the Father, which he alone could apprehend in its true import."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Crowns [διαδηματα] . See on 1 Peter 5:4; James 1:12.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The many diadems are in token of His rule over the many nations of the world."
2. "This cannot be the name of either Revelation 19:13 or Revelation 19:16, for both these names are known."
3. "It must be some name which shall be fully understood only when the union between the Redeemer and His Church is perfected."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A flame of fire (φλοξ πυρος). As in the opening vision of Christ in Revelation 1:14 (Revelation 2:18)."
2. "Many diadems (διαδηματα πολλα). A new feature, but the dragon has a diadem on each of his seven heads (Revelation 12:3) and the first beast one upon each of his ten horns (Revelation 13:1). So the victorious Messiah will wear many royal diadems and not mere crowns, because he is King of kings (Revelation 19:16)."
3. "A name written (ονομα γεγραμμενον). Perfect passive participle of γραφω as in Revelation 2:17 (cf. Revelation 3:12)."

### John Gill:
1. "Which denotes the perspicuity and penetration of them, the omniscience of Christ to look into and discover the secret machinations, schemes, and devices of his enemies against his people..."
2. "And on his head were many crowns; for he has not only a crown, as the Creator and Governor of the universe, in right of nature, but he has one which his Father has put upon his head, when he set him as King over his holy hill of Zion..."
3. "And he had a name written that no man knew but he himself; which seems to be his name, the Son of God, as the unknown name of the overcomer, in Revelation 2:17 is a child of God..."

### John Wesley:
1. "And his eyes are a flame of fire — They were said to be as or like a flame of fire, before, Revelation 1:14; an emblem of his omniscience."
2. "And upon his head are many diadems — For he is king of all nations."
3. "And he hath a name written, which none knoweth but himself — As God he is incomprehensible to every creature."
