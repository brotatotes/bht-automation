# Revelation 19:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The vivid imagery of the figure clothed in a blood-dipped vesture highlights the righteous retribution upon the enemies conquered by this powerful figure. This image of a garment stained with blood is reminiscent of treading in a winepress and signifies the act of conquering. The mention of The Word of God further emphasizes the greatness and glory of Christ, who is the perfect revelation of God. This gentle Lamb symbolizes Christ's gentleness and approachability, inviting even children to desire to caress rather than fear.
