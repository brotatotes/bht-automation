# Revelation 19:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The name mentioned in Revelation 19:12 was probably written on the garment where it covers the thigh to which the sword is bound. It is expressed as King of kings and Lord of lords, a title indicating the eminence and conspicuousness of Christ's kingdom. This name, written on the vesture, symbolizes the manifestation of Christ's kingly office and his reign over all the earth. Such inscriptions on garments were not uncommon in ancient times and signified the greatness and magnificence of the person.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "His name written on His vesture and on His thigh," was written partly on the vesture, partly on the thigh itself, at the part where in an equestrian figure the robe drops from the thigh. The thigh symbolizes Christ's humanity as having come, after the flesh, from the loins of David, and now appearing as the glorified "Son of man." 
2. "On the other hand, His incommunicable divine name, 'which no man knew,' is on His head."
3. "KING OF KINGS—Compare Revelation 17:14, in contrast with Revelation 17:14- :, the beast being in attempted usurpation a king of kings, the ten kings delivering their kingdom to him."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The name was conspicuously written on his garment - probably his military robe."
2. "The name was conspicuously written...on the other parts of his dress, so that it must be conspicuous."
3. "The custom here alluded to of inscribing the name or rank of distinguished individuals on their garments, so that they might be readily recognized, was not uncommon in ancient times."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The name mentioned in Revelation 19:12 was probably written on the forehead. The place of this name is different. It seems to have been written on the garment where it covers the thigh to which the sword is bound (Psalms 45:3)."
2. "For the name itself comp. chap. Revelation 17:14. What was there indicated in prophecy is here realized."
3. "The warfare of the Lord is ended: ‘All kings shall fall down before Him: all nations shall serve Him’(Psalms 72:11)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
