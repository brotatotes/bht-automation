# Revelation 19:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The followers of the beast will partake in the consumption of the flesh of those who meet their demise in the battle at Armageddon. This includes kings, captains, mighty men, and individuals from all walks of life. The act of consuming their flesh symbolizes the severe destruction resulting from the conflict. It serves as a just retribution for their refusal to show respect to the bodies of Christ's witnesses by denying them proper burial.
