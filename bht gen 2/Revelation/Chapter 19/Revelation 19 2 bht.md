# Revelation 19:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The judgments of God are true and righteous, fulfilled and according to the demerit of sin. God has executed judgment on the great whore, causing kings to hate and destroy her. This whore corrupted the earth with her fornication, leading people into idolatry and destruction. The cries for vengeance are answered, and the souls under the altar now sing praises to God for His righteous judgments.
