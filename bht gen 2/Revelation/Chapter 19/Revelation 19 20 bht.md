## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Many expositors represent the first beast to be the secular, the second beast to be the ecclesiastical power of Rome; and account for the change of title for the latter from the 'other beast' to the 'false prophet,' is because by the judgment on the harlot, the ecclesiastical power will then retain nothing of its former character save the power to deceive."
2. "The first beast is a political power; the second is a spiritual power—the power of ideas. But both are beasts, the worldly Antichristian wisdom serving the worldly Antichristian power."
3. "Between the judgment on the harlot and the Lord's destruction of the beast, will intervene that season in which earthly-mindedness will reach its culmination, and Antichristianity triumph for its short three and a half days during which the two witnesses lie dead."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The general idea is, that these armies were overcome, and that the Messiah was victorious."
2. "The beast here, as all along, refers to the papal power; and the idea is that of its complete and utter overthrow."
3. "The whole representation is that of an alliance to prevent the spread of the true religion, as if the papacy and Mohammedanism were combined, and the one was sustained by the pretended miracles of the other."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Was taken [επιασθη] . See on Acts 3:7. Mark. See on ch. Revelation 13:16. Lake [λιμνην] . See on Luke 5:1. Brimstone. See on ch. Revelation 14:10.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The description given in this verse can leave no doubt that we have here the two enemies of chap. 13, the beast and the lamb-like beast with the two horns."
2. "The 'lake of fire' is again mentioned in chaps. Revelation 20:10; Revelation 20:14, and Revelation 21:8."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The false prophet...practised all kinds of magic and imposture to beguile men to worship the Beast."
2. "He deceived 'them that had received' the mark of the beast and them that worshipped his image."
3. "They fall together as they fought together. 'The day that sees the end of a false statecraft will see also that of a false priestcraft'."

### John Gill:
1. "And with him the false prophet; that is, the second beast in Revelation 13:11 as appears by the characters by which he is here described, or antichrist in his ecclesiastic capacity; that is, the pope with his clergy."
2. "The severe punishment of antichrist, considered in both his capacities, civil and ecclesiastic, is expressed by being 'cast into a lake of fire', not material fire, but the wrath of God, which will be poured out like fire, and will be intolerable."
3. "The phrase ['cast alive into it'] denotes the awfulness, inevitableness, and severity of their punishment; there seems to be some reference to the earth's swallowing up Korah and his company alive, Numbers 16:33."

### John Wesley:
1. "These two ungodly men were cast alive - Without undergoing bodily death."
2. "After several repeated strokes of omnipotence, he is gone alive into hell."
3. "Surely, none but the beast of Rome would have hardened himself thus against the God he pretended to adore, or refused to have repented under such dreadful, repeated visitations!"
