# Revelation 19:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Lord God is recognized as the Omnipotent, with His reign firmly established. A great multitude, consisting of His servants, lifts their voices in praise to Him. This multitude, composed of individuals from all walks of life, both small and great, acknowledges the Almighty's authority and power. The voices of this multitude resound like the roar of mighty waters or the thunderous shouts of a crowd. Their unified praise signifies the grandeur and glory of the Lord's reign, surpassing all previous manifestations of His sovereignty.
