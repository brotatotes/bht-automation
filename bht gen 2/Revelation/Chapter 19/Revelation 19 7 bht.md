# Revelation 19:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The marriage of the Lamb brings joy and excitement to the saints, who eagerly anticipate the glorious display of Christ's power and authority. This union, symbolizing the relationship between God and His people, is not yet fully realized, as it awaits the establishment of the new Jerusalem church. The details of this future event are still unknown, but the thought of it should inspire a desire for purity of heart and a deep meditation on the wonderful things that are yet to come.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The elect-Church, the heavenly Bride, soon after the destruction of the harlot, is transfigured at the Lord's coming, and joins with Him in His triumph over the beast."
2. "Perfect union with Him personally, and participation in His holiness; joy, glory, and kingdom, are included in this symbol of 'marriage'."
3. "Besides the heavenly Bride, the transfigured, translated, and risen Church, reigning over the earth with Christ, there is also the earthly bride, Israel, in the flesh, never yet divorced, though for a time separated, from her divine husband, who shall then be reunited to the Lord, and be the mother Church of the millennial earth, Christianized through her."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Let all in heaven rejoice - for all have an interest in the triumph of truth; all should be glad that the government of God is set up over an apostate world." 
2. "The relation of God, and especially of the Messiah, to the church, is often in the Scriptures represented under the image of marriage."
3. "Between the church under the papacy, and the church in its true form, there is all the difference which there is between an abandoned woman gaily decked with gold and jewels, and a pure virgin chastely and modestly adorned, about to be led to be united in bonds of love to a virtuous husband."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. The marriage of the Lamb. For the figure, compare Isaiah 54:1-8; Ezekiel 16:7-14; Hosea 2:19; Matthew 9:15; John 3:29; Ephesians 5:25.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Up to this time the actual marriage of the Redeemer to His people has not taken place."
2. "The two parties have only been betrothed to one another."
3. "At length the hour has come when the marriage shall be completed, the Lord Himself being manifested in glory and His bride along with Him."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Let us rejoice and be exceeding glad" (χαιρωμεν κα αγαλλιωμεν). Present active subjunctive (volitive) of χαιρω and αγαλλιαω. For both verbs together see Matthew 5:12.
2. "The marriage of the Lamb" (ο γαμος του αρνιου). In the O.T. God is the Bridegroom of Israel. In the N.T. Christ is the Bridegroom of the Kingdom. In the Gospels Christ appears as the Bridegroom.
3. "Made herself ready" (ητοιμασεν εαυτην). First aorist active indicative of ετοιμαζω and the reflexive pronoun. There is something for her to do, but the chief preparation is the act of Christ.

### John Gill:
1. "The saints particularly...express their gladness at the glorious display of Christ's kingly power and authority."
2. "The public and general solemnization of the nuptials will not be until the new Jerusalem church state takes place."
3. "And now the time will be come for the accomplishment of it."

### John Wesley:
1. "The marriage of the Lamb is come — Is near at hand, to be solemnized speedily."
2. "What this implies, none of 'the spirits of just men,' even in paradise, yet know. O what things are those which are yet behind!"
3. "And what purity of heart should there be, to meditate upon them!"
