# Revelation 19:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The presentation of a glorious, spotless, and holy Church to Christ is depicted. The bride is adorned in a dress symbolizing innocence and purity, a gift from Christ. The righteousness of the saints, obtained through faith, is compared to fine linen, unblemished and pure. It encompasses both their justification and sanctification. This righteousness is not their own, but a gracious bestowment from their Lord. It enables them to enter into the eternal marriage bond with Him, making them unblamable and irreprovable before the throne of God.
