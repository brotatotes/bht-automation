# Revelation 19:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Blessed are those who are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb, for they are truly fortunate. This invitation to partake in the Gospel ministry, ordinances, and communion is not to be taken lightly, as it entails being chosen and receiving the effectual calling of God. It is a privilege to be part of the bride, the Lamb's wife, and to be adorned with his righteousness and partake in his benefits. St. John, in the midst of the awe-inspiring sights, is reminded to write down this declaration of happiness for those invited to share in eternal glory.
