# Revelation 2:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He who holds the seven stars in his right hand empowers the church to shine as stars in purity and holiness. He walks with them, fulfilling his promise to be present. Standing amidst the golden candlesticks, he observes all their actions and thoughts. If there is no repentance, he is willing to remove the candlestick. The church in Ephesus should find solace in his presence and remain faithful to his teachings.
