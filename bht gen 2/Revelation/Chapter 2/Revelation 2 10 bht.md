# Revelation 2:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God urges His people not to fear the suffering that lies ahead, likely from the hands of false Jews. No matter the trials we face, we are called to remain faithful in our devotion to the Lord, even if it means giving our lives for our faith. The crown of life is the special reward promised to those who remain steadfast and unyielding, even in the face of death, as exemplified by the early martyrdom of Polycarp.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Fear not the things which thou art about to suffer...behold, the devil is about to cast (some) of you into prison, that ye may be tried." 
2. "And ye shall have tribulation ten days...Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life." 
3. "The crown of life...the life itself being the crown."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Captain of our salvation never keeps back what those who faithfully witness for Him may have to bear for His name's sake never entices recruits by the promise they shall find all things easy and pleasant there."
2. "The conflict of the latter was not with mere flesh and blood, but with the rulers of the darkness of this world."
3. "The same event is often both a temptation from the devil, and a trial from God—God sifting and winnowing the man to separate his chaff from his wheat, the devil sifting him in the hope that nothing but chaff will be found in him."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We need not dread suffering if we can hear the voice of the Redeemer encouraging us, and if he assures us that in a little while we shall have the crown of life." 
2. "That ye may be tried - That the reality of your faith may be subjected to a test to show whether it is genuine. The design in the case is that of the Saviour, though Satan is allowed to do it."
3. "Affliction in this life, however severe, can be but brief; and in the hope that it will soon end, why should we not bear it without complaining or repining?"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "There is nothing more remarkable in the records which have come down to us of the early persecutions, than the sense which the confessors and martyrs and those who afterwards narrate their sufferings and their triumphs entertain and utter, that these great fights of affliction through which they were called to pass, were the immediate work of the Devil."
2. "There is to be a succession of trials demanding an increase in the power and a variety in the direction of faith. With reference to these trials, faithfulness is to be not only existent but becoming, developing with new strength and into new applications."
3. "Not faithful until the time of death, but faithful up to a measure which will endure death for Christ's sake. 'It is an intensive, not an extensive term.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Strength and comfort are to be found in other thoughts."
2. "God proves His people. Satan tries them; and this trial shall come from his hands, to be the means, if possible, of effecting his Satanic purposes."
3. "'So should desert in arms be crowned.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Fear not. Worse things are about to come than poverty and blasphemy... for the devil 'is about to cast', 'is going to cast'." (μη φοβου. [Fear not.]) 
2. "Ye shall have [tribulation]... It is unwise to seek a literal meaning for ten days. Even ten days of suffering might seem an eternity while they lasted." (θλιψιν ημερων δεκα. [Tribulation ten days.]) 
3. "Be thou faithful. 'Keep on becoming faithful'... 'keep on proving faithful unto death' as the martyrs have done." (γινου πιστος. [Be thou faithful.])

### John Gill:
1. "God's people undergo sufferings of various sorts...nor should they indulge a slavish fear about them."
2. "Suffering times are trying times, whether men are real Christians or not; whether they have the true grace of God or not; and whether the principles they hold are right and true, and are worth, and will bear suffering for."
3. "Be thou faithful unto death...and I will give thee a crown of life."

### John Wesley:
1. "Fear none of those things which thou art about to suffer — Probably by means of the false Jews."
2. "Be thou faithful — Our Lord does not say, 'till I come,' as in the other letters, but unto death - Signifying that the angel of this church should quickly after seal his testimony with his blood; fifty years before the martyrdom of Polycarp, for whom some have mistaken him."
3. "And I will give thee the crown of life — The peculiar reward of them who are faithful unto death."
