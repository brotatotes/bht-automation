# Revelation 2:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He that conquereth shall not be injured because the one who is not intimidated by trials, tribulations, and even death itself, but remains steadfast in Christ, is more than a conqueror. In this victory, there is assurance that the saints will never be hurt, as eternal life has been ordained for them by Christ. However, the second death belongs to the wicked, specifically the lake of fire mentioned in Revelation 21:8. This serves as a warning to those who do not overcome, emphasizing the importance of remaining faithful and steadfast in Christ.
