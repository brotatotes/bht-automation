# Revelation 2:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The sword mentioned in Revelation 2:16 is symbolic of cutting and penetrating words that convict and convert some, while condemning others to punishment. The city of Pergamum, known for its wealth, learning, art, and varied worship of many deities, served as a center for emperor-worship and the flourishing of the Nicolaitans. In this context, the sword represents the Word of God, the only defense against the corruptions of antichrist and the power of Satan dwelling in Pergamum. Those who reject the message of repentance will face the judgment and the cutting off by the sharp sword.
