# Revelation 2:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Pergamos, a city known for its idolatry, was where Satan set up his throne. The Christians in Pergamos faced great temptations and dangers. Despite this, they held fast to the name of Jesus, openly confessing their faith. One of them, Antipas, was a faithful witness and martyr. The testimony of Jesus, the faithful and true witness, was upon him. It is a great honor to receive such a commendation from the Lord himself.

### Albert Barnes:

2. "The true explanation seems to be that of one of the oldest commentators on the Apocalypse, that in Pergamos persecution first culminated, reaching even to the shedding of Christian blood."
3. "Even in such a city, however, the church had been found faithful, for it is said to it, 'Thou boldest fast My name.' The word ‘name’ is used here, as elsewhere in the writings of St. John, for the fulness of that revelation of the Father which is given in the Son."
