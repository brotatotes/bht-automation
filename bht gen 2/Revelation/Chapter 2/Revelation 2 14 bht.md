# Revelation 2:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The church in Pergamos faced the challenge of tolerating those who held to pernicious practical error, similar to the doctrine of Balaam. This led to a temptation for the Gentile converts to partake in idol-meats, which often involved fornication. Refusing to eat these idol-meats meant withdrawing from the social life of the time. These seducers of erroneous doctrine and advocates of sin were members of the church. Therefore, the church needed to address these defects and resist the influence of idolatry and immorality.

2. "The meaning here is, that it was through the instructions of Balaam that Balak learned the way by which the Israelites might be led into sin."
3. "The attitude of Balaamâ€™s mind in the matter was this: I. He had a strong desire to do what he knew was wrong, and which was forbidden expressly by God. II. He was restrained by internal checks and remonstrances, and prevented from doing what he wished to do. III. He cast about for some way in which he might do it, notwithstanding these internal checks and remonstrances, and finally accomplished the same thing in fact, though in form different from that which he had first prepared."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The act of sacrifice, among all ancient nations, was a social no less than a religious act."
2. "Thus, for the Gentile, refusal to partake of the idol-meats involved absence from public and private festivity, a withdrawal, in great part, from the social life of his time."
3. "The eating of things sacrificed to idols was more and more a crucial test, involving a cowardly shrinking from the open confession of a Christian's faith."
