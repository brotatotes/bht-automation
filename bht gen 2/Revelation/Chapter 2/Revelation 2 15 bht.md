# Revelation 2:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a similar vein, it is brought to attention that the church being discussed has individuals who adhere to the teachings of the Nicolaitans. This is seen as a cause for concern, as these false teachings are allowed to persist within the church. The need for action against these teachings is emphasized, as they go against the true teachings of the faith.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Thus thou also hast (as well as those of old: not, as the Church at Ephesus...men holding...the teaching of the Nicolaitans" 
2. "So Victorin, Andr, Areth, Ribera, Calov., Beng., Heinr. (doubtfully), Ewald, De W., Hengst., Ebrard, DÃ¼sterd., Trench, al." 
3. "The mere existence of the etymological relation is extremely doubtful...even granting it, to suppose the two identical, would be to destroy the historical illustration by which the present existing sect is described"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "THOU also hast them that hold the same Balaamite or Nicolaitane doctrine spiritually or symbolically."
2. "So TRENCH explains. But I prefer taking it, 'THOU also,' as well as Ephesus ('in like manner' as Ephesus; see below the oldest reading), hast... Nicolaitans, with this important difference, Ephesus, as a Church, hates them and casts them out, but thou 'hast them,' namely, in the Church."
3. "It is sin not to hate what God hates. The Ephesian Church had this point of superiority to Pergamos. But the three oldest manuscripts, and Vulgate and Syriac, read instead of 'which I hate,' 'IN LIKE MANNER.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Nicolaitanes held the same doctrine, and taught the same thing as Balaam."
2. "The more natural and obvious construction, it seems to me, is to suppose that the speaker means to say that the Nicolaitanes taught the same things which Balaam did - to wit, that they led the people into corrupt and licentious practices."
3. "If this be the correct interpretation, then we have, in fact, a description of what the Nicolaitanes held, agreeing with all the accounts given of them by the ancient fathers."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. So. Even as Balak had Balaam for a false teacher, so hast thou the Nicolaitan teachers. Nicolaitans. See on verse 6. Which thing I hate. Omit.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The chief point of inquiry connected with these words is, whether they introduce a second group of erroneous teachers, or whether they constitute a second description of the Balaamites already mentioned."
2. "The addition of the words â€˜in like mannerâ€™ is important, showing, as they do, that the second class of false teachers is really identical with the first."
3. "They are a mystical name for those who in the church at Pergamos imitated the example and the errors of that false prophet of the Old Testament."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Thou and the church at Pergamum as Israel had the wiles of Balaam."
2. "They followed Balaam in not obeying the decision of the Conference at Jerusalem about idolatry and fornication, with the result that they encouraged a return to pagan laxity of morals."
3. "Some wrongly hold that these Nicolaitans were Pauline Christians in the face of Colossians 3:5-8; Ephesians 5:3-6."

### John Gill:
1. "These impure heretics sprung up in the time of the apostolic church, but their doctrines were not received, and their deeds were hated..."
2. "This seems to design the doctrines of the church of Rome, which in this period took place; which forbid marriage to the priests, and recommended celibacy and virginity to others also; which were the source of all uncleanness and abominable lusts..."
3. "Which thing I hate; the doctrine of these men, as well as their deeds."

### John Wesley:
1. In like manner thou also â€” As well as the angel at Ephesus.Hast them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans â€” And thou sufferest them to remain in the flock.
