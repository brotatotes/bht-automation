# Revelation 2:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The church in Pergamos is called to repentance, for although they did not hate the Nicolaitans like the church in Ephesus, they still tolerated them. They had committed the sin of lukewarmness, negligence, and sinful compliances by allowing the false teaching and practices to persist in their midst. Christ issues a warning, stating that if they do not repent, they will not escape the punishment that will come upon the Nicolaitans. He declares that He will come, not against the church, but against the offenders, fighting against them with the sword of His mouth, symbolizing His just and fierce displeasure.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The command is addressed not only to the Nicolaitans, but to the church, which did not, like that of Ephesus, hate them, but apparently tolerated them."
2. "This making war must not be understood as Grotius, 'Prophetas excitabo in Ecclesia, qui id faciant quod Episcopus negligit, et fortiter se opponant Nicolaitis' (similarly Calov.) with the sword of my mouth."
3. "Seeing that the connexion with ch. Rev 1:16 is so plainly asserted by our Revelation 2:12, it seems better to confine the allusion to that sword, and not to stretch it to what after all is a very doubtful analogy."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Repent, therefore." Not only the Nicolaitanes, but the whole Church of Pergamos is called on to repent of not having hated the Nicolaitane teaching and practice.
2. I will comeâ€”I am coming. 
3. with the sword of my mouthâ€”resumed from Revelation 1:16, but with an allusion to the drawn sword with which the angel of the Lord confronted Balaam on his way to curse Israel: an earnest of the sword by which he and the seduced Israelites fell at last.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The church would excite his displeasure by retaining them in its bosom, but it was in its power to save them from destruction."
2. "The church always suffers when it has offenders in its bosom; it has the power of saving them if it will repent of its own unfaithfulness, and will strive for their conversion."
3. "To see the force of this, we are to remember the power which Christ has to punish the wicked by a word of his mouth. By a word in the last day he will turn all the wicked into hell."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "I will make war. The words war and make war occur oftener in Revelation than in any other book of the New Testament."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Repent therefore, as in Revelation 2:5 to Ephesus, or else I come onto thee quickly." 
2. "The Lord will come to war against the Nicolaitans, not against the church. Against His Church, even in her declension, He cannot war."
3. "Her threatened punishment (and is it not enough?) is, that the Lord will make war upon His enemies without her; and that, not taking part in His struggle, she shall lose her part in His victory."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Repent therefore...as a result of their sin."
