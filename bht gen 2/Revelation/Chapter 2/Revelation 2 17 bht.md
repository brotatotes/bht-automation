# Revelation 2:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The hidden manna represents the full, glorious, everlasting fruition of God that believers in Christ will experience. The church, symbolized by the heavenly ark of the covenant, is nourished by this hidden manna, which refers to the Gospel - soul quickening, comforting, strengthening, and satisfying food. Just as the ancients used small stones as a way of voting in judgment, the white stone with one's name on it symbolizes acquittal and admission to the heavenly banquet. Like Jacob receiving a new name after his victory, believers will be given a new name signifying their triumph through overcoming.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Christ’s gifts may all be summed up in the gift of Himself."
2. "The most probable view is that the figure is derived from the practice of using small stones, inscribed with writing, for various purposes, and that, further than this, the imagery belongs to the occasion itself only."
3. "It should be the recipient’s own name, a new name however; a revelation of his everlasting title, as a son of God, to glory in Christ, but consisting of, and revealed in, those personal marks and signs of God’s peculiar adoption of himself, which he and none else is acquainted with."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The manna which is hidden." As the manna hidden in the sanctuary was by divine power preserved from corruption, so Christ in His incorruptible body has passed into the heavens, and is hidden there until the time of His appearing.
2. "Believers are now hidden, even as their meat is hidden. As the manna in the sanctuary, unlike the other manna, was incorruptible, so the spiritual feast offered to all who reject the world's dainties for Christ is everlasting: an incorruptible body and life for ever in Christ at the resurrection."
3. "The 'new name' is Christ's: some new revelation of Himself which shall hereafter be imparted to His people, and which they alone are capable of receiving. The connection with the 'hidden manna' will thus be clear, as none save the high priest had access to the 'manna hidden' in the sanctuary."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The attributes which he fixes on here are, that his eyes are like a flame of fire - as if they would pierce and penetrate to the recesses of the heart; and that his feet are like fine brass - perhaps indicative of majesty as he moved among the churches."
2. "A severe reproof of the church, notwithstanding, for their tolerating a teacher of dangerous doctrine, whom he calls Jezebel, with the assurance that she and her children should not go unpunished."
3. "The town is located in a plain of considerable size, and is hardly visible on being approached, by reason of the profusion of foliage."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Christ as the bread from heaven, the nourishment of the life of believers, the true manna, of which those who eat shall never die..."
2. "The hidden manna shall not remain for ever hidden. We shall see Christ as He is, and be like Him..."
3. "The seeing of Christ as He is, and, through this beatific vision, being made like to Him, is identical with the eating of the hidden manna..."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The promise contained in this verse has always occasioned much difficulty to interpreters." 
2. "This ‘living bread’ is the Lord Jesus Christ Himself, who is now ‘hidden,’ but will at length be revealed to the perfect satisfaction and joy of them that wait for Him."
3. "Those referred to receive a stone, an ordinary stone of acquittal, but glistering with heavenly brightness, and bearing upon it the motto or legend spoken of in the next clause."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Christ is the true bread from heaven and that may be the idea here. Those faithful to Christ will have transcendent fellowship with him."
2. "The white stone with one's name on it was used to admit one to entertainments and also as an amulet or charm."
3. "The true Christian has a charmed life."

### John Gill:
1. "The allusion is to the manna which the Israelites ate of in the wilderness, which may be called 'hidden'".
2. "The church... is nourished with this hidden manna; by which may be meant the Gospel, which is soul quickening, comforting, strengthening, and satisfying food".
3. "The church, though in the wilderness, is regarded by Christ, is bore upon his heart and cared for by him; and also its spotless purity in him, and justification by him".

### John Wesley:
1. "The heavenly ark of the covenant appears under the trumpet of the seventh angel, Revelation 11:19, where also the hidden manna is mentioned again. It seems properly to mean, the full, glorious, everlasting fruition of God." 
2. "The ancients, on many occasions, gave their votes in judgment by small stones; by black, they condemned; by white ones they acquitted. Sometimes also they wrote on small smooth stones. Here may be an allusion to both."
3. "So Jacob, after his victory, gained the new name of Israel. Wouldest thou know what thy new name will be? The way to this is plain,-overcome. Till then all thy inquiries are vain. Thou wilt then read it on the white stone."
