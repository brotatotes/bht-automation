2. "Thyatira's last works are more than the first. Not that 'ministry' and 'patience' are greater than 'love' and 'faith,' or that they alone deserve the designation 'works.' That term is as applicable to the latter as to the former. The fact commended is that there is progress in them all."
3. "The path of the church has been as the morning light shining unto the perfect day. She has not fallen back like Ephesus; she has advanced."

2. "Charity; by which is meant not a relieving the wants of the poor; much less such a charity as connives at the errors and heresies of men; but the divine grace of love to God and Christ, and the saints."
3. "Their works or acts of love to God and Christ and one another, and of service to God and to the saints, and of faith and faithfulness in the cause of God, and of patience in suffering for the Gospel of Christ, were more in quantity, and greater in quality, toward the close of this period, which brought on the Reformation, than at the beginning of it."
