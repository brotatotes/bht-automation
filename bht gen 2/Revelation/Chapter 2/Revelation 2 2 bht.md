# Revelation 2:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
I know your works and your perseverance; you have labored diligently and endured patiently. You have borne the burden of evil men and have faithfully sought a pure ministry. You have not only tried those who claim to be apostles but also diligently examined their claims to ensure they were truly sent by the Lord. Jesus, as the omniscient God, sees and acknowledges all that you do, both good and bad. He commends your endurance and promises to dispense rewards or administer justice accordingly.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I know thy works—expressing His omniscience. Not merely 'thy professions, desires, good resolutions'... thy labor unto weariness. Patience—persevering endurance."
2. "Bear—evil men are a burden which the Ephesian Church regarded as intolerable."
3. "Tried—by experiment; not the Greek for 'test'... The apostolic churches had the miraculous gift of discerning spirits."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is designed to impress upon them deeply the conviction that he was intimately acquainted with all that they did, good and bad, and that therefore he was abundantly qualified to dispense rewards or administer punishments according to truth and justice."
2. "They had patiently borne the opposition made to the truth, they had manifested a spirit of firm endurance amidst many arts of those opposed to them to draw them off from simple faith in Christ."
3. "The point here commended in the Ephesian church is, that they had sought to have a 'pure ministry,' a ministry whose claims were well founded. They had felt the importance of this, had carefully examined the claims of pretenders, and had refused to recognize those who could not show, in a proper manner, that they had been designated to their work by the Lord Jesus."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Patience [υπομονην] . See on 2 Peter 1:6; James 5:1. Compare Paul's exhortation to Timothy in Ephesus, 2 Timothy 2:25, 2 Timothy 2:26." 
2. "Bear [βαστασαι] . See on John 10:31; John 12:6. Compare Galatians 6:2, where the word is used of Christians bearing each others' burdens." 
3. "Hast tried [επειρασω] Rev., didst try. See on tried, 1 Peter 1:7; and compare 1 John 4:1; 1 Corinthians 12:10."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I know thy works, and thy toil and patience... The meaning would be better expressed by ‘endurance,’ the strong, firm, and manly bearing of all suffering inflicted by a hostile world for the sake of Christ."
2. "The Ephesian church had a holy impatience of those who, by their evil deeds, brought disgrace upon the Christian name, and she is commended for it."
3. "The Ephesian Christians had 'tried,' and in trying had discovered their false pretensions... The distinction seems rather to lie in this, that 'try' expresses simply the trial, with the superadded thought of disinclination to the persons tried; that 'prove' expresses the bringing forth of solid worth by trial."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I know. Rather than γινωσκω and so 'emphasizes better the absolute clearness of mental vision which photographs all the facts of life as they pass' (Swete)." 
2. "And thy toil and patience (κα τον κοπον κα την υπομονην σου). 'Both thy toil and patience,' in explanation of εργα, and see 1 Thessalonians 1:3, where all three words (εργον, κοποσ, υπομονη) occur together as here."
3. "Which call themselves apostles (τους λεγοντας εαυτους αποστολους). Perhaps itinerant missionaries of these Nicolaitans who posed as equal to or even superior to the original apostles, like the Judaizers so described by Paul (2 Corinthians 11:5; 2 Corinthians 11:13; 2 Corinthians 12:11)."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ, as the omniscient God, knows all the works of his people, and the springs, and principles, and ends, and views of them."
2. "The work of the ministry is a laborious work to the mind in studying, and to the body in the outward discharge of it...and such as are diligent and laborious deserve respect, even double honour...And though they may not have it from men, yet Christ takes notice of them and their labours, and commends them for them, and will reward them."
3. "And thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars."

### John Wesley:
1. "I know — Jesus knows all the good and all the evil, which his servants and his enemies suffer and do."
2. "Happy is he that conceives less good of himself, than Christ knows concerning him."
3. "And thou hast tried those who say they are apostles, and are not — For the Lord hath not sent them."
