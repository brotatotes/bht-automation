# Revelation 2:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The symbolic figure of Jezebel represents an influential and deceptive woman within the Thyatiran church. She leads others astray, promoting idolatry and sinful practices. The church is admonished for tolerating her influence, despite the biblical prohibition against women teaching. This Jezebel is reminiscent of the infamous wife of Ahab and is associated with the apostate church of Rome. Her presence underscores the need for discernment and a firm commitment to truth and holiness within the church community.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The figure of 'Jezebel thy wife' being once recognized in its historical import, it would not be needful that an individual woman should be found to answer to it: the conscience of the Thyatiran church could not fail to apply the severe reproof to whatever influence was being exerted in the direction here indicated." 
2. "The denunciation of such a teacher under such a title would be at once startling and decisive."
3. "This specification of the mischief done shews us that this influence at Thyatira was in the same direction as the evil works of the Nicolaitans at Pergamum."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The symbolical Jezebel was to the Church of Thyatira what Jezebel, Ahab's 'wife,' was to him. Some self-styled prophetess, as closely attached to the Church of Thyatira as a wife is to a husband, and as powerfully influencing for evil that Church as Jezebel did Ahab."
2. "Like her father, she was swift to shed blood. Wholly given to Baal worship, like Eth-baal, whose name expresses his idolatry, she, with her strong will, seduced the weak Ahab and Israel beyond the calf-worship to that of Baal. She seems to have been herself a priestess and prophetess of Baal."
3. "By a false spiritualism these seducers led their victims into the grossest carnality, as though things done in the flesh were outside the true man, and were, therefore, indifferent."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel - Thou dost tolerate, or countenance her...The kind of character, therefore, which would be designated by the term as used here, would be that of a woman who was artful and persuasive in her manner...and the tendency of whose influence was to lead the people into the abominable practices of idolatry."
2. "The opinions which she held, and the practices into which she led others, appear to have been the same which are referred to in Revelation 2:6 and Revelation 2:14-15 of this chapter."
3. "Every sentiment of our nature makes us feel that it is right to expect that if a woman teaches at all in a public manner, she should inculcate only what is true and holy - she should be an advocate of a pure life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The very head and front of the churchâ€™s sin was, not that it merely tolerated false teaching and sinful practices in its midst, but that it had allied itself with them."
2. "The sins into which the persons alluded to sought to betray the church are now mentioned. They are the sins already spoken of in the case of Pergamos; yet there is at the same time an important distinction. At Pergamos the evil came from an outward source, Balaam; at Thyatira from an inward source, Jezebel."
3. "The former was a Gentile Prophet; the latter was the wife of the King of Israel. Mark the progress."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Thou sufferest. Late vernacular present active indicative second person singular as if from a form Î±Ï†ÎµÏ‰ instead of the usual Î±Ï†Î¹Î·Î¼ forms."
2. "Symbolical name for some prominent woman in the church in Thyatira, like the infamous wife of Ahab who was guilty of whoredom and witchcraft and who sought to drive out the worship of God from Israel."
3. "This woman was not a real prophetess, but a false one with loud claims and loose living."

### John Gill:
1. "The impartiality of Christ may be observed in taking notice of the bad deeds, as well as of the good ones of his people, and his tenderness in representing them as few."
2. "By her is meant the apostate church of Rome, comparable to Jezebel, the wife of Ahab; as she was the daughter of an Heathen, so is Rome Papal the daughter of Rome Pagan..."
3. "What is complained of in the true members and followers of Christ is, that they suffered this woman to teach; when it was insufferable for a woman to teach, and especially such a strumpet."

### John Wesley:
1. "But thou sufferest that woman Jezebel â€” who ought not to teach at all, 1 Timothy 2:12."
2. "Many of the ancients have delivered, that this was the wife of the pastor himself."
3. "Jezebel of old led the people of God to open idolatry. This Jezebel, fitly called by her name, from the resemblance between their works, led them to partake in the idolatry of the heathens."
