# Revelation 2:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ's power is truly remarkable. He gave her time to repent, perhaps through the witnesses who spoke against her idolatry and warned of God's judgment. But sadly, she stubbornly refused to repent, indicating that without the grace of repentance, people will persist in their sins. Although repentance is a gift from God, it is ultimately a choice that individuals have to make; God will not force anyone to repent.
