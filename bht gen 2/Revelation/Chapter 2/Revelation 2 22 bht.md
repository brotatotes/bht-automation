# Revelation 2:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The consequences of the harlot's sins will be a great affliction, not only for her but also for those who have been enticed to commit adultery with her, whether physically or spiritually. These individuals will face the wrath of God unless they repent. It is important to note that the angel of the church at Thyatira, who had allowed her presence, is not specifically urged to repent, but the implication is clear that allowing her influence was a fault that ceased when God's vengeance was executed.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
