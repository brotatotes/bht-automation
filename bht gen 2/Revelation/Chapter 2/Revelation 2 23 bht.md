# Revelation 2:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who follow her teachings and embrace her ways will be destroyed. The Lord's judgment upon her children will be so severe that it serves as a powerful warning to all. Every church will witness the divine discernment of God, who knows the deepest thoughts and desires of the heart. This judgment will reveal the wickedness and expose the true intentions of those who claim to be godly.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Her children—her proper adherents; not those who suffer her, but those who are begotten of her." 
2. "Kill with death is a Hebraism for slay with most sure and awful death; so 'dying thou shalt die'." 
3. "So palpably shall God's hand be seen in the judgment on Thyatira, that the whole Church shall recognize it as God's doing."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A strong Hebraistic mode of expression, meaning that he would certainly destroy them."
2. "The reference in the word 'death' here would seem to be to some heavy judgment."
3. "The design of this judgment will be so apparent that it will convince all that I know what is in the hearts of people."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The truth is that the two classes are the same: they are in both cases those who partake of her spirit, and who follow her example."
2. "And all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts... The wicked are not in the Lord’s thought, 'for God’s judgments are far above out of their sight, but all who ponder these things and lay them to heart'."
3. "The Lord tries the 'reins and hearts,' the most inward parts of men. From these the 'works' of men cannot be separated. His 'works' are the whole of man. The inward manifests itself in the outward: the value of the outward is dependent upon the inward."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I will kill with death (αποκτενω εν θανατω)."
2. "Her children (τα τεκνα αυτης). Either her actual children, like the fate of Ahab's sons (2 Kings 10:7) or 'her spiritual progeny' (Swete) who have completely accepted her Nicolaitan practices."
3. "Searcheth (εραυνων). Present active articular participle of εραυναω, to follow up, to track out, late form for ερευναω, from Jeremiah 17:10."

### John Gill:
1. "Her popes, cardinals, priests, Jesuits, monks, friars, and all that join in the Romish apostasy, they shall be killed with death… there shall be an utter extirpation of them in God's own time."
2. "They shall receive the righteous reward of their evil practices… they have coloured over, and glossed with specious pretences of religion and holiness, and a zeal for God and his glory."
3. "Christ is omniscient… he is righteous in judging and in punishing, which will be according as men's works are; and not one shall escape his righteous judgment, nor the due desert of their sins."

### John Wesley:
1. "And I will kill her children - Those which she hath borne in adultery, and them whom she hath seduced. With death." 
2. "Probably the remarkable vengeance taken on her children was the token of the certainty of all the rest."
3. "And all the churches - To which thou now writest. Shall know that I search the reins - The desires. And hearts - Thoughts."
