# Revelation 2:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who have not known the depths of Satan, as they call them, should consider themselves blessed to be ignorant of such abominable errors and corruptions. The doctrines associated with Jezebel and her followers are not only a burden to bear, but they are also the very depths of Satan himself. Therefore, our primary focus should be on holding fast to what we have and resisting the allure of these pernicious teachings.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "As many as have not known the depths of Satan, as they call them... we may safely refer the expression to the heretics spoken of." 
2. "If we remember some of the expressions used in the apostolic decree... this act of simple obedience, and no deep matters beyond their reach, was what the Lord required of them."
3. "That which you have, hold fast until the time when I shall come... it sets forth not so much the continuing habit, as the renewed and determined grasp of every intervening moment of the space prescribed."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Spirit here declares their so-called 'depths,' (namely, of knowledge of divine things) to be really 'depths of Satan'; just as in Revelation 2:9, He says, instead of 'the synagogue of God,' 'the synagogue of Satan.'"
2. "The original sin of Adam was a desire to know EVIL as well as good, so in HENGSTENBERG'S view, those who professed to know 'the depths of Satan.' It is the prerogative of God alone to know evil fully, without being hurt or defiled by it."
3. "Exaggerating and perfecting Paul's doctrine of grace without the law as the source of justification and sanctification, these false prophets rejected the law as a rule of life, as though it were an intolerable 'burden.' But it is a 'light' burden."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "But I say unto you, the remainder in Thyatira, so many as hold not this doctrine... he addresses now all the members of the church who were not involved in the charges already made." 
2. "As many as have not this doctrine - To all who have not embraced it, or been contaminated with it... There are doctrines of error, and arguments for sin, to originate which seems to lie beyond the power of people, and which would appear almost to have exhausted the talent of Satan himself."
3. "He had not approved their conduct for suffering these persons to remain in the church, and he threatens to punish all those who had become contaminated with these pernicious doctrines... The trouble which would grow out of that would be a sufficient expression of his displeasure."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They have not this teaching; that is, they have it not as their possession, they do not make it their own." 
2. "The prevalent idea is, that these persons spoke only of 'the depths' or of 'the depths of God,' and that in bitter irony the Lord of the Church either adds here the words 'of Satan,' or substitutes the name of Satan for the name of God."
3. "The church at Thyatira 'suffered' Jezebel. The 'burden' of that part of it which remained true to its Lord was that this was done. Jezebel ought to have been put away: the alliance with the world ought to have been broken."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Those who hold out against Jezebel, not necessarily a minority."
2. "The Ophites and other later Gnostics boasted of their knowledge of 'the deep things.'"
3. "Probably referring to the heretics who ridicule the piety of the other Christians."

### John Gill:
1. "The pastor and his colleagues, with others, were free from the abominable errors and corruptions before spoken of."
2. "Notwithstanding the large pretensions of the Romish church to antiquity, her doctrine is but a novel doctrine."
3. "To speak in the language of the pure and faithful professors of the Gospel, [the doctrines of antichrist] are no other than the depths of Satan, or doctrines of devils."

### John Wesley:
1. "Who have not known the depths of Satan — O happy ignorance!"
2. "Our Lord owns they were deep, even deep as hell: for they were the very depths of Satan."
3. "I will lay upon you no other burden - Than that you have already suffered from Jezebel and her adherents."
