# Revelation 2:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The angel and the church both have something significant, which is the faithful word, the form of sound words, the mystery and doctrine of faith. They have received this from Christ and his apostles, storing it in their hearts and experiencing the truth and power within it. This plays a crucial role in their lives.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is important to notice the change of expression in the original for the 'coming' spoken of."
2. "These 'comings' therefore referred not so much to the final coming as to special judgments in which it was foreshadowed: this refers rather to that in which all special judgments culminate, the Second and final Coming."
3. "Again we see another trace of the climactic nature of these Epistles."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Hold fast (κρατησατε). First aorist active imperative of κρατεω, either ingressive (get a grip on) or constative (hold on as a single decisive effort)."
2. "See present imperative κρατε in Revelation 3:11 (keep on holding)."
3. "Till I come (αχρ ου αν ηξω). Indefinite temporal clause with αχρ ου (until which time) with modal αν and either the future active indicative or the first aorist active subjunctive of ηκω (usual idiom with αχρ in Revelation as in Revelation 7:3; Revelation 15:8; Revelation 20:3; Revelation 20:5)."

### John Gill:
1. "Which was something good, even the faithful word, the form of sound words, the mystery and doctrine of faith; this they had received from Christ and his apostles; they had it in their hearts, and a comfortable experience of the truth and power of it."
2. "Hold fast till I come; meaning the coming of Christ, either at the Reformation by Luther, Calvin, and others, which began at the close of this church state... or to judge Jezebel, destroy antichrist, which will be by the brightness of his coming."
3. "Till which time the doctrine of the Gospel is to be held fast: and such an exhortation will be always necessary, since, till then, there will be always more or less an opposition to it, and attempts made to wrest it out of the hands of its professors."

### John Wesley:
1. What ye — Both the angel and the church have.
