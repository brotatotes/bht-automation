# Revelation 2:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He who conquers and stays faithful will be given authority over the nations. This promise is closely connected to the exhortation to conquer. The works to be kept are the works commanded by Christ and the fruit of the Spirit. The power given is not exclusive, but it involves being associated with Christ in His future glory. The believers will share in His triumph and be given rightful authority over those who oppose the true Israel of God. They will bravely stand against false doctrines and idolatrous practices while converting sinners through the power of the Gospel.
