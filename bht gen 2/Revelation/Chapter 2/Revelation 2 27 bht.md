# Revelation 2:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ's ruling with a rod of iron does not entail harsh and tyrannical sway, but a firm and invincible power. He will shepherd both His own and His enemies. The iron rod signifies judgment, as vessels of the potter are broken to shivers. The Gospel enlarges Christ's kingdom, while the man of sin will be subject to the saints' strictness and severity. This points to the irreparable ruin and destruction of Antichrist, resulting from the saints' consuming and destroying him.
