# Revelation 2:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The conqueror will shine like the morning star, reflecting the perfect brightness of Christ himself, who is referred to as 'the morning star' (Revelation 22:16). This symbolizes the kingly glory that the conqueror will share and serves as a herald, announcing the coming of the day and the faithfulness of God. This reward is comparable to the morning planet, sparkling like a gem on the conqueror's brow, signifying victory, beauty, and splendor. It fulfills the promise in Revelation 2:17 of receiving the hidden manna, which represents the truth and presence of Christ given to the faithful.
