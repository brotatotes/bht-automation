# Revelation 2:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ's message begins with a rebuke, stating that he has something against the church at Ephesus. This something is of great concern, as it is not a small matter, but rather something significant. What is this concern? It is that the church has let go of its first love, the love that was once fervent and passionate. The church had become more focused on orthodoxy and doctrinal purity, neglecting their love for Christ and one another. This decline in love is significant and needs to be addressed.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I have against thee (this) that...It is not a mere somewhat, it is everything." 
2. "How characteristic of our gracious Lord, that He puts foremost all He can find to approve, and only after this notes the shortcomings!" 
3. "Their warmth of love had given place to a lifeless orthodoxy."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Because thou hast left thy first love - Thou hast 'remitted' or let down thy early love; that is, it is less glowing and ardent than it was at first."
2. "The love here referred to is evidently love to the Saviour; and the idea is, that, as a church, they had less of this than formerly characterized them. In this respect they were in a state of declension."
3. "Not a little of the ardor of young converts is often nothing more than the excitement of animal feeling, which will soon die away of course, though their real love may not be diminished, or may be constantly growing stronger."


### Marvin Vincent:
1. "It is indeed a somewhat which the Lord has against the Ephesian Church; it threatens to grow to be an everything; for see the verse following" (Trench).
2. "Hast left [Œ±œÜŒ∑Œ∫Œ±œÇ] Rev., more correctly, rendering the aorist, didst leave. The verb originally means to send, away or dismiss."
3. "First love. Compare Jeremiah 2:2. The first enthusiastic devotion of the Church to her Lord, under the figure of conjugal love."

### Philip Schaff:

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Thy first love (œÑŒ∑ŒΩ Œ±Œ≥Œ±œÄŒ∑ŒΩ œÉŒøœÖ œÑŒ∑ŒΩ œÄœÅœâœÑŒ∑ŒΩ). 'Thy love the first.' This early love, proof of the new life in Christ (1 John 3:13), had cooled off in spite of their doctrinal purity."
2. "They had remained orthodox, but had become unloving partly because of the controversies with the Nicolaitans."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ has nothing against his people, his faithful ministers, and true churches, in a judicial way, or to their condemnation, for there is none to them that are in him but he has often many things to complain of in them, and to rebuke and chastise them for, in a way of providence."
2. "[...] what he had against the church at Ephesus, and against the churches in the period which that represents, follows, because thou hast left thy first love."
3. "Now this, though it was not lost, for the true grace of love can never be lost, yet it was left; it abated in its heat and fervour; there was a remissness in the exercise of it."

### John Wesley:
1. "But I have against thee, that thou hast left thy first love ‚Äî That love for which all that church was so eminent when St. Paul wrote his epistle to them."
2. "He need not have left this. He might have retained it entire to the end."
3. "But he had not kept, as he might have done, the first tender love in its vigour and warmth."
