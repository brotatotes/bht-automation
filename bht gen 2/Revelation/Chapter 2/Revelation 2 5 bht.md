# Revelation 2:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are capable of falling into sin and losing some of the grace they have received, but they cannot completely and permanently fall away from it. They must remember and reflect on the level of faith, love, and holiness they had before their decline. By returning to their initial commitment and renewing their actions and attitudes, they can hope to regain the fervent love they once had. Although there is a warning of possible consequences, there is also an implicit promise of restoration for those who truly repent.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Its candlestick has been for centuries removed out of his place; the squalid Mohammedan village which is nearest to its site does not count one Christian in its insignificant population; its temple is a mass of shapeless ruins; its harbor is a reedy pool; the bittern booms amid its pestilent and stagnant marshes; and malaria and oblivion reign supreme over the place where the wealth of ancient civilization gathered around the scenes of its grossest superstitions and its most degraded sins." 
2. "They appear to have been characterized by sensuality, seducing Christians to participate in the idolatrous feasts of pagans, and to unchastity."
