# Revelation 2:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Despite the Ephesian Christians' decline in their first love, they still held a deep disdain for the wicked practices of the Nicolaitans. These false teachers were known for their corrupt doctrines and immoral lifestyles, including engaging in lewdness, adultery, and idol worship. While the church had its flaws, it is clear that divine grace sought to help them regain their standing and steer them away from the grievous errors of the Nicolaitans. The Lord commends the church for their hatred of these sinful works that He Himself abhors.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We may notice the tender compassion of our blessed Lord, who, in his blame of a falling church, yet selects for praise one particular in which His mind is yet retained. This is for our comfort: but let us not forget that it is for our imitation also."
2. "The prevailing opinion among the fathers was, that they were a sect founded by Nicolaus the proselyte of Antioch, one of the seven deacons."
3. "There is nothing repugnant to verisimilitude in what Clem.-Alex [25] relates of the error of Nicolaus; nor need all of those, who were chosen to aid the Apostles in distributing alms, have been, even to the end of their lives, spotless and infallible."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "We should hate men's evil deeds, not hate the men themselves."
2. "Revelation abounds in such duplicate Hebrew and Greek names: as Apollyon, Abaddon: Devil, Satan: Yea (Greek, 'Nai'), Amen."
3. "These symbolical Nicolaitanes, or followers of Balaam, abused Paul's doctrine of the grace of God into a plea for lasciviousness."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans - Greek, 'works'...From the two passages, compared with each other, it would seem that they were alike corrupt in doctrine and in practice..."
2. "Vitringa supposes that the word is derived from νίκος nikos, 'victory,' and λαός laos, 'people,' and that thus it corresponds with the name Balaam, as meaning either בּצל צם bàal ̀am, 'lord of the people,' or בּלץ צם baalà ̀am, 'he destroyed the people'..."
3. " Irenaeus (Adv. Haeres. i., 26) says that their characteristic tenets were the lawfulness of promiscuous sexual intercourse with women, and of eating things offered to idols. Eusebius (Hist. Eccl. iii., 29) states substantially the same thing..."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Lord cannot leave them without a fresh word of commendation."
2. "But this thou hast, that thou hatest the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate."
3. "Notwithstanding the declension of the Ephesian Christians, there was still one point on which their Lord and they were similarly minded."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "That thou hatest (οτ μισεις). Accusative object clause in apposition with τουτο (this). Trench tells of the words used in ancient Greek for hatred of evil (μισοπονηρια) and μισοπονηρος (hater of evil), neither of which occurs in the N.T., but which accurately describe the angel of the church in Ephesus."
2. "Of the Nicolaitans (των Νικολαιτων). Mentioned again in verse Revelation 2:15 and really meant in verse Revelation 2:2. Irenaeus and Hippolytus take this sect to be followers of Nicolaus of Antioch, one of the seven deacons (Acts 6:5), a Jewish proselyte, who is said to have apostatized."
3. "Which I also hate (α καγω μισω). Christ himself hates the teachings and deeds of the Nicolaitans (α, not ους, deeds, not people), but the church in Pergamum tolerated them."

### John Gill:
1. "Though these Christians had left their first love, yet they bore an hatred to the filthy and impure practices of some men, who were called 'Nicolaitans'." 
2. "He had used to advise παραχρησθαι τη σαρκι, by which he meant a restraining of all carnal and unlawful lusts; but these men interpreted it of an indulgence in them, and so gave themselves up to all uncleanness."


### John Wesley:
1. "Divine grace seeks whatever may help him that is fallen to recover his standing."
2. "Their doctrines and lives were equally corrupt. They allowed the most abominable lewdness and adulteries, as well as sacrificing to idols; all which they placed among things indifferent, and pleaded for as branches of Christian liberty."
