# Revelation 2:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The message to the church in Smyrna reminds the believers of Christ's triumph over death as they face persecution. In describing himself as the first and the last, who was dead and is alive, Christ offers direct reassurance against the fear of death. This comforting message echoes the experience of St. John and encourages the Smyrna believers, as they find solace in the assurance that, just as Christ conquered death, they too can overcome their own afflictions for the sake of Christ.
