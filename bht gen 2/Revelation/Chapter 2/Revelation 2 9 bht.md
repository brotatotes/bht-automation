# Revelation 2:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The angel at Philadelphia had little strength, but they were highly esteemed by the Lord. They were rich in faith and love, which held greater value than any worldly possessions. On the other hand, the opposition and unbelief of the Jews had turned them into a synagogue of Satan, who is known for being a liar and a murderer.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "There are both poor rich-men, and rich poor-men in God's sight" [TRENCH].
2. "The Jews blaspheme Christ as 'the hanged one.' As elsewhere, so at Smyrna they bitterly opposed Christianity; and at POLYCARP'S martyrdom they joined the heathens in clamoring for his being cast to the lions; and when there was an obstacle to this, for his being burnt alive; and with their own hands they carried logs for the pile."
3. "The Jews, who might have been 'the Church of God,' had now, by their opposition and unbelief, become the synagogue of Satan."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Poverty is no hindrance to the favor of God, and there are some things in it which are favorable to the promotion of a right spirit toward God which are not found where there is abundant wealth."
2. "The poor should always be cheerful and happy, if they can hear their Saviour saying unto them, “I know thy poverty - but thou art rich.”"
3. "That spirit of bitter opposition was indeed often manifested in their treatment of Christians, as it had been of the Saviour, but still it was foreign to the true nature of their religion."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Referring to the persecutions of Jewish and heathen oppressors."
2. "The enmity of the Jews against Christians is a familiar fact to all readers of the book of Acts."
3. "The use of the word here in an honorable sense, so different from John's custom, has been urged against his authorship of Revelation. But John here only quotes the word, and, further, employs it without the article."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I know thy tribulation. The word 'tribulation' is to be understood in the general sense of affliction, suffering, but with a special reference to persecution brought upon believers for stedfastness in their Master’s cause." 
2. "Like all the churches of that early time, the church at Smyrna was composed of members for the most part poor. 'Not many rich, not many noble, were called.' But in the possession of a better inheritance it was 'rich,' 'rich in faith, and an heir of the kingdom which the Lord promised to them that love Him.'"
3. "The ‘blasphemy’ referred to probably includes not simply reviling against Christians, but against their Lord. Then, as now, the Jews were notorious for the fierceness of their language against Christ, to whom they did not hesitate to apply every epithet of contempt and hatred."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The tribulation was probably persecution, which helped to intensify the poverty of the Christians."
2. "Rich in grace toward God and in good deeds."
3. "These are Jews in name only, not spiritual Jews."

### John Gill:
1. "He knew their souls in adversity, and remarked their patience under it, and their constancy, and close adherence to him."
2. "They were rich, in faith, and heirs of a kingdom, though poor in this world; they were rich with the riches of Christ, with the blessings of the covenant, with the graces of the Spirit, and in good works."
3. "They were men of bad principles and practices, and both blasphemed the ways and doctrines of Christ themselves, and caused them to be blasphemed by others also; they were false Christians, nominal professors, and shunned persecution for the Gospel."

### John Wesley:
1. "The angel at Philadelphia likewise had in their sight but 'a little strength.' And yet these two were the most honourable of all in the eyes of the Lord."
2. "But thou art rich — In faith and love, of more value than all the kingdoms of the earth."
3. "But a synagogue of Satan — Who, like them, was a liar and a murderer from the beginning."
