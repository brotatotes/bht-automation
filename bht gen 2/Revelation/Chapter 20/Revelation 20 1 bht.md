# Revelation 20:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The powerful angel, not Constantine, is none other than the Lord Jesus Christ himself. His descent from heaven should not be seen as his incarnation, but rather as his second coming. The key of the abyss, entrusted to the angel, signifies the authority of the one who possesses the keys of hell and death. With all power in heaven and earth, he holds the power to open and shut the depths of darkness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The destruction of his representatives, the beast and the false prophet, to whom he had given his power, throne, and authority, is followed by the binding of Satan himself for a thousand years." 
2. "The key of the bottomless pit—now transferred from Satan's hands, who had heretofore been permitted by God to use it in letting loose plagues on the earth; he is now to be made to feel himself the torment which he had inflicted on men."
3. "But his full torment is not until he is cast into 'the lake of fire' (Revelation 20:10)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The whole character of the composition of the book leads us to suppose that different angels were employed to make these communications to John."
2. "The fact that he has the key of that underworld is designed to denote here, that he can fasten it on Satan so that it shall become his prison."
3. "The chain only appears to have been in his hand. Perhaps the key was suspended to his side."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Of the bottomless pit. See on ch. Revelation 9:1. This is to be distinguished from the lake of fire."
2. "Chain [αλυσιν]. See on Mark 5:4. Only here in John's writings."
3. "In his hand [επι]. Lit., upon: resting on or hanging upon."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He has the key of the ‘abyss,’ which can be no other than that of chaps. Revelation 9:1-2, Revelation 11:7, and Revelation 17:8. It is the abode of Satan, the home and source of all evil." 
2. "By Him it is entrusted to the angel for the execution of His purposes. At chap. Revelation 9:2 the angel opened the abyss; here he locks it."
3. "The chain is ‘great’ because of the end to which it is to be applied and its fitness to secure it."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Coming down out of heaven (καταβαινοντα εκ του ουρανου). As in Revelation 10:1; Revelation 18:1."
2. "The key of the abyss (την κλειν της αβυσσου). As in Revelation 9:1."
3. "A great chain (αλυσιν μεγαλην). Paul wore a αλυσις (alpha privative and λυω, to loose) in Rome (2 Timothy 1:16;, as did Peter in prison in Jerusalem (Acts 12:6)."

### John Gill:
1. "By the 'angel' John saw, is not to be understood Constantine the great... but the Lord Jesus Christ himself is this angel."
2. "And his coming down from heaven is not to be understood of his incarnation, or of his coming from thence by the assumption of human nature; but of his second coming."
3. "The key of this becomes no hand so well as his who has the keys of hell and death, who has all power in heaven and in earth, and has the power of hell, of opening and shutting it at his pleasure."
