# Revelation 20:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The destiny of the wicked is a terrifying one, as they will be cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where they will be tormented day and night without any respite or hope of escape. This eternal torment is reserved for the devil, the beast, the false prophet, and all those who have chosen to oppose God and His people. It serves as a solemn reminder of the everlasting consequences of rejecting God's truth and embracing evil.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "lake of fire—his final doom: as 'the bottomless pit' was his temporary prison."
2. "the same phrase is used of the external state of the blessed. As the bliss of these is eternal, so the woe of Satan and the lost must be."
3. "Satan shall not be permitted to enter this Paradise regained, to show the perfect security of believers, unlike the first Adam whom Satan succeeded in robbing of Paradise; and shall, like Pharaoh at the Rod Sea, receive in this last attempt his final doom."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Satan, on the other hand, instead of being doomed at once to that final ruin, was confined for a season in a dark abyss." 
2. "All the great enemies of the church are destroyed, and henceforward there is to be no array of hostile forces."
3. "In that long duration, who can estimate the numbers that shah be redeemed and saved?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The last great enemy of the Church is now overcome and destroyed as the beast and the false prophet have already been."
2. "He is cast into the lake of fire, where all three are tormented for ever and ever."
3. "It is presupposed in this everlasting torment that they have made their final and unchangeable choice of evil."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Into the lake of fire and brimstone" - As in Revelation 19:20 with the two beasts, as he adds, "where are also the beast and the false prophet" (οπου κα το θηριον κα ο ψευδοπροφητης).
2. "They shall be tormented" - Return to the prophetic future of verses Revelation 20:7; Revelation 20:8. For βασανιζω see Revelation 9:5; Revelation 14:10. For "day and night" (ημερας κα νυκτος) see Revelation 4:8; Revelation 7:15; Revelation 12:10; Revelation 14:11.
3. "For ever and ever" - For "for ever and ever" (εις τους αιωνας τον αιωνων) see Revelation 1:6; Revelation 1:18; Revelation 4:9; Revelation 4:10; Revelation 5:13; Revelation 7:12; Revelation 10:6; Revelation 11:15, etc. The devil was cast down from heaven (Revelation 12:9), then imprisoned (Revelation 20:2), now he received his final doom.

### John Gill:
1. "And the devil that deceived them,.... Both before death, in the present life, by tempting and drawing them into immorality and profaneness, or idolatry, superstition, and will worship, or persecution of the saints."
2. "and this will be his full torment, in which he is not as yet; and this will not be until the judgment is finished hereafter described; though it is here mentioned to issue the account of Satan at once, and to show what will be his final state and condition: where the beast and false prophet are."
3. "and this will be the case of all wicked men, of all whose minds are enmity to God and Christ, and to his people; and is a proof of the eternity of hell torments."

### John Wesley:
1. And they — All these.Shall be tormented day and night — That is, without any intermission. Strictly speaking, there is only night there: no day, no sun, no hope!
