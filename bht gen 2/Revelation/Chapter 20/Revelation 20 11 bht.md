# Revelation 20:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The vision of the great white throne reveals an awe-inspiring moment of divine judgment. This event unfolds after the Gospel dispensation, where the books of Scripture are opened and the book of life is revealed. The magnitude of this judgment is reflected in the description of the throne as great. As the wicked face this judgment, the earth and heaven flee away, unable to withstand the overwhelming presence of the Almighty. The dissolution of the wicked is attributed to the sheer majesty and dignity of the Lord Jesus, whose presence leaves no place for them to hide.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "greatâ€”in contrast to the 'thrones,' Revelation 20:4."
2. "whiteâ€”the emblem of purity and justice."
3. "earth and heaven fled awayâ€”The final conflagration, therefore, precedes the general judgment."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The things that are specified in regard to it are, that it was 'great,' and that it was 'white.' The former expression means that it was high or elevated. The latter expression - white - means that it was 'splendid or shining.'"
2. "The earth and the heaven fled away - That is, as the stars, at the rising of the sun, seem to flee to more remote regions, and vanish from human view, so when the Son of God shall descend in his glory to judge the world, the earth and all other worlds shall seem to vanish."
3. "And there was found no place for them - They seemed to flee 'entirely away,' as if there was 'no' place where they could find a safe retreat, or which would receive and shelter them in their flight."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The throne that is seen is â€˜great,â€™ not so much in contrast with the thrones of Revelation 20:4, as in correspondence with the Great Being who sits upon it."
2. "It is also â€˜white,â€™ emblematic of His perfect purity and righteousness."
3. "From before His face the earth and the heavens flee away, they are completely removed, time aid earth and all that belongs to them coming to an end."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A great white throne."
2. "The absolute purity of this Supreme Court is symbolized by the colour of the Throne."
3. "The name of God is not mentioned, but the Almighty Father sits upon the throne and the Son sits there with him and works with the Father."
4. "From whose face the earth and the heaven fled away."
5. "The non-eternity of matter is a common teaching in the O.T. as in the N.T."

### John Gill:
1. "This vision refers not to the Gospel dispensation, from the exaltation of Christ to his second coming...when the books of the Scriptures were opened and explained, and the book of life was also opened; and by the conversion of some, and not others, it was known who were written in it and who were not, and men were judged to be alive or dead in a spiritual sense..."
2. "...this affair will be over, and all God's elect gathered in by the preaching of the Gospel, before this vision takes place..."
3. "...it seems only to regard the judgment of the wicked, for no other are made mention of in it: the "throne" here seen is a throne of judgment; it is called a 'great' one...because of the great work that will be transacted upon it, the judgment of all the wicked..."

### John Wesley:
1. "A great white throne â€” How great, who can say? White with the glory of God, of him that sat upon it,-Jesus Christ."
2. "And there was found no place for them - But they were wholly dissolved, the very 'elements melting with fervent heat.'"
3. "And all this, not at the strict command of the Lord Jesus; not at his awful presence, or before his fiery indignation; but at the bare presence of his Majesty, sitting with severe but adorable dignity on his throne."
