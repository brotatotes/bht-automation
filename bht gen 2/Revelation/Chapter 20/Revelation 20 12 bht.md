# Revelation 20:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the final judgment, all the dead, regardless of their status or size, will stand before God. This includes not only those who physically died, but also those who experienced a transformation equivalent to death. At this moment, hidden deeds and intentions will come to light, revealing the true nature of actions and hearts. The records in the books of God's omniscience and conscience will align, and each person will have a clear understanding of themselves and the impartial history of their lives.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The wicked who had died from the time of Adam to Christ's second advent, and all the righteous and wicked who had died during and after the millennium, shall then have their eternal portion assigned to them."
2. "The saints having been first pronounced just themselves by Christ out of 'the book of life,' shall sit as assessors of the Judge."
3. "We are justified by faith, but judged according to (not by) our works. For the general judgment is primarily designed for the final vindication of God's righteousness before the whole world."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The fair meaning in this place therefore is, that all the dead would be there, and of course this would preclude the idea of a 'previous' resurrection of any part of the dead."
2. "None can judge the secrets of the heart; none can pronounce on the moral character of all mankind, of all countries and ages, and determine their everlasting allotment, but he who is divine."
3. "He will be safe whose name is found in the book of life; no one will be safe who is to have his eternal destiny determined by his own deeds."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Before God. Read qronou throne for Qeou God. So Rev., before the throne. The books [βιβλια] . No article. Read books. Compare Daniel 7:10. Book of life. See on ch. Revelation 3:5.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "All the dead, not only the wicked, but (as some think) certain classes of the righteous who had had no part in the ‘first resurrection,’ or (as others think) the righteous without exception, are supposed to be included."
2. "The ‘dead,’ therefore, are here the wicked alone; and the ‘books’ contain a record of no deeds but theirs."
3. "The latter, too, are obviously the only books out of which judgment is pronounced."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The record of each human being has been kept in God's books."
2. "The books are 'the vouchers for the book of life.'"
3. "We are saved by grace, but character at last (according to their works) is the test as the fruit of the tree."

### John Gill:
1. "In the world of souls, the great and the small, stand before God." 
2. "The book of God's omniscience, which contains all the actions of the wicked, in which all their sins are taken notice of, and will now be brought to light."
3. "The dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works; that is, they were sentenced to everlasting condemnation and death, according to the just demerit of their wicked works."

### John Wesley:
1. "And I saw the dead, great and small — Of every age and condition. This includes, also, those who undergo a change equivalent to death."
2. "O how many hidden things will then come to light; and how many will have quite another appearance than they had before in the sight of men! With the book of God's omniscience, that of conscience will then exactly tally."
3. "Then, particularly, shall every man know himself, and that with the last exactness. This will be the first true, full, impartial, universal history."
