# Revelation 20:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Death and Hades, representative enemies of Christ and His Church, are cast into the lake of fire, signifying the eternal victory over death and the end of separation between body and soul. The second death, which reigns in hell, showcases a different type of death than the earthly form, an everlasting destruction in the absence of the Lord. The state of the wicked in this second death is a constant testimony to the conqueror, Jesus Christ. However, for the righteous, death is abolished indefinitely, eradicating any separation between their body and soul.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Death and Hades, as personified representatives of the enemies of Christ' and His Church, are said to be cast into the lake of fire to express the truth that Christ and His people shall never more die, or be in the state of disembodied spirits."
2. "In hell the ancient form of death, which was one of the enemies destroyed by Christ, shall not continue, but a death of a far different kind reigns there, 'everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord': an abiding testimony of the victory of Christ."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The righteous will live forever, and the wicked will linger on in a state never to be terminated by death."
2. "There might be what would be properly called death, but it would not be death in this form; the soul would live forever, but it would not be in that condition represented by the word Œ±ÃîÃÅÕÖŒ¥Œ∑œÇ hadeÃÑs - 'hades.'"
3. "Death, in any form, is the penalty of law; it is attended with pain; it cuts off from hope, from friends, from enjoyment; it subjects him who dies to a much-dreaded condition, and in all these respects it was proper to call the final condition of the wicked 'death,' though it would still be true that the soul would live."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. This is the second death. Add even the lake of fire.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death, even the lake of fire."
2. "The second part explains that the second death is ‚Äòthe lake of fire,‚Äô clearly showing that the second death is a state."
3. "It is the state of those who have chosen and confirmed to themselves the death which came upon man by sin, from which Christ redeems, but which becomes to those who wilfully reject His redemption a still more fearful, even the second, death."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Death is personified and is disposed of, 'the last enemy'..."
2. "Hades has no more terrors, for the saints are in heaven."
3. "There is no more fear of death, for death is no more."

### John Gill:
1. "Either by these the devil is meant, who has the power of death, and is the prince of hell, were it not that the casting of him into this lake is mentioned before in Revelation 20:10."
2. "It denotes the destruction and abolition of death and the grave, that from henceforth they should no more have power over men, nor have any under their dominion."
3. "The wicked dead, which they shall have delivered up, and will be judged and sentenced to eternal death, Revelation 20:13. This is the second death, or the destruction of the soul and body in hell, which will consist in an eternal separation of both from God, and in a continual sense of his wrath and displeasure."

### John Wesley:
1. "And death and hades were cast into the lake of fire ‚Äî That is, were abolished for ever; for neither the righteous nor the wicked were to die any more: their souls and bodies were no more to be separated."
