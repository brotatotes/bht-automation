# Revelation 20:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The wicked, who are not found written in the book of life, will perish in hell forever and ever. They will follow the devil and the two beasts into the lake of fire, with no chance of soul sleeping, an intermediate state, second chance, or annihilation. The book of life makes a distinction between the righteous and the wicked, as seen in Daniel and Acts, and serves as a warning to all who do not have their names written in it. The imagery of the sulphurous lake alludes to the everlasting punishment that awaits the wicked.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 15. The blissful lot of the
	righteous is not here specially mentioned as their bliss had
	commenced before the final judgment. Compare, however, Matthew 25:34;
	Matthew 25:41; Matthew 25:46.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The single condition here stated, as being what would save any from being cast into the lake of fire, is, that they are 'found written in the book of life.'"
2. "All besides these, princes, kings, nobles, philosophers, statesmen, conquerors; rich men and poor men; the bond and the free; the young and the aged; the frivolous, the vain, the proud, and the sober; the modest and the humble, will be doomed to the lake of fire."
3. "The wicked will be destroyed, in what may be properly called the 'second' death. As remarked in the notes, this does not mean that this death will in all respects resemble the first death, but there will be so many points of resemblance that it will be proper to call it 'death'."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. And whosoever [ει τις] . Lit., if any. So Rev. 

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It was searched in order that it might be seen if any one’s name was not written in it; and he whose name could not be discovered in its pages was cast into the lake of fire."
2. "The passage, as a whole, is occupied with judgment upon the enemies of the Church."
3. "Add to all this the use and meaning in St. John’s writings of such words as ‘the dead,’ ‘judged,’ ‘the sea,’ ‘death,’ and ‘Hades,’ and it appears impossible to adopt any other conclusion than that in the vision now before us we have a judgment of the wicked, and not a general judgment."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In this short sentence the doom is told of all who are out of Christ, for they too follow the devil and the two beasts into the lake of fire."
2. "There is no room here for soul sleeping, for an intermediate state, for a second chance, or for annihilation of the wicked."
3. "In Daniel 12:2 there is a resurrection to death as well as to life and so in John 5:29; Acts 24:15."

### John Gill:

2. "It is said of the false prophets, 'that in the writing of eternal life (or in the book of eternal life), which is written for the righteous of the house of Israel, they shall not be written.'"
3. "There seems to be some allusion in the phrase used here, and in the preceding verse, and elsewhere in this book, to the lake Asphaltites, a sulphurous lake, where Sodom and Gomorrah stood, which the Jews call the salt sea, or the bituminous lake."
