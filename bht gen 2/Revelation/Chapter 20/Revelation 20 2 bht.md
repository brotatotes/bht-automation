# Revelation 20:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The dragon, representing Satan, is bound, signifying the defeat of the Church's greatest enemy. Bound by a superior power, the dragon's cunning and ancient existence are emphasized. The thousand years mentioned in the passage indicate a period of respite from evil, as the sources of wickedness are removed. It is crucial to avoid interpreting this timeframe in a literal and materialistic way, but rather to understand its spiritual significance. During this period, the deceptive influence of false worship is subdued, although there are still those who remain under its sway.
