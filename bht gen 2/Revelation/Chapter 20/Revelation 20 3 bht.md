# Revelation 20:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After the downfall of the papacy and cessation of the Muhammadan power, Satan's binding is not arbitrary but a necessary consequence. During this period, his influences will be suspended, allowing the principles of virtue and religion to prevail. This prolonged duration, akin to a mocking caricature of Christ's passion, signifies the unchristian world's inability to deceive the nations. As a result, the uninterrupted course of God's kingdom brings relief after previous visions of conflict. Despite objections, what has been foretold will come to pass, as there is no counsel that can stand against the Lord.
