# Revelation 20:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The vision shows thrones where faithful members of Christ's Church, including the apostles, sit as kings, receiving judgment and authority. These saints, who were martyred or suffered for their devotion to Jesus, are now vindicated and rewarded. Their lives and reign are not earthly, but spiritual, being raised from the death of sin by vivifying faith. This includes all the saints under the reign of Rome Pagan and Papal until Christ's kingdom is established. Through their union with Christ, their souls and bodies are restored, and they enter into a glorious reign with Him in heaven.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The office of judging was given to them."
2. "The life and reign being that of the soul raised in this life from the death of sin by vivifying faith."
3. "The martyrs are put first, because most like Jesus in their sufferings and death, therefore nearest Him in their life and reign."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The â€˜personsâ€™ on whom this judgment is to pass are specified, in the course of the verse, as those who were â€˜beheaded for the witness of Jesus, who had the Word of God, who had not worshipped the beast,â€™ etc."
2. "John seems to have assumed that it would be understood who were meant. And yet to us it is not entirely clear; for John has not before this given us any such intimation that we can determine with certainty what is intended."
3. "By no possible construction can it mean the â€˜bodiesâ€™ of the saints. If John had intended to state that the saints, as such, would be raised as they will be at the last day, it is clear that he would not have used this language, but would have employed the common language of the New Testament to denote it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Thrones. See on ch. Revelation 2:13. They sat. All the faithful members of Christ's Church."
2. "They reigned with Christ."
3. "Beheaded [Ï€ÎµÏ€ÎµÎ»ÎµÎºÎ¹ÏƒÎ¼ÎµÎ½Ï‰Î½]. From pelekuv an ax. Only here in the New Testament. They lived. Equivalent to lived again."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The thrones before us are thrones of kings. Those that â€˜sat upon themâ€™ are certainly neither angels nor God; nor are they the twenty-four Elders, for it is the invariable practice of the Seer to name the latter when he has them in view."
2. "The most natural meaning will be that the result of judgment was in such a manner given them that they did not need to come into the judgment. As they had victory before they fought, so they were acquitted before they were tried."
3. "In all the clauses of the verse only a single class is spoken of, that of Christâ€™s faithful ones, and they are described first by their fate and next by their character. Every attempt to distinguish between actual martyrs and other true followers of Jesus must in the very nature of the case be vain."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "No subject is given for this plural verb. Apparently Christ and the Apostles (Matthew 19:28; Luke 22:30) and some of the saints (1 Corinthians 6:3), martyrs some hold." 
2. "Picture of the heavenly court of assizes."
3. "Others also besides martyrs shared in Christ's victory, those who refused to worship the beast or wear his mark as in Revelation 13:15; Revelation 14:9; Revelation 16:2; Revelation 19:20."

### John Gill:
1. "There will be thrones set, or pitched, for all the saints, who will sit on them, in the character of kings, and as conquerors, and shall sit quiet, and undisturbed, and be in perfect ease, and peace."
2. "But now righteous judgment will be given for them, and against their enemies; their persons will be openly declared righteous; their characters will be cleared of all false imputations fastened on them; and their works and sufferings for Christ will be taken notice of in a way of grace, and rewarded in a very glorious manner."
3. "And so this, with the preceding character, includes all the saints that lived under Rome Pagan, and Rome Papal, to the destruction of antichrist, and the setting up of Christ's kingdom."

### John Wesley:
1. "And I saw thrones â€” Such as are promised the apostles, Matthew 19:28; Luke 22:30.And they â€” Namely, the saints, whom St. John saw at the same time, Daniel 7:22, sat upon them; and Judgment was given to them1Corinthians6:2."
2. "And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded â€” With the axe: so the original word signifies. One kind of death, which was particularly inflicted at Rome, is mentioned for all."
3. "And they lived â€” Their souls and bodies being re-united.And reigned with Christ â€” Not on earth, but in heaven. The 'reigning on earth' mentioned, Revelation 11:15, is quite different from this."
