# Revelation 20:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage emphasizes the sequential nature of time, as the small time and the second thousand years commence immediately after the first thousand. However, the exact beginning of these time periods remains unknown to those on earth, as the events unfold in the unseen realm. By acknowledging these distinct thousand-year periods, we can resolve apparent conflicts in prophecy and gain a deeper understanding of the future of the church. This interpretation harmonizes expectations of the church's flourishing state alongside warnings of mankind's increasing complacency in the end times.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Lived" is used for lived again, as in :-. John saw them not only when restored to life, but when in the act of reviving.
2. The millennial reign on earth does not rest on an isolated passage of the Apocalypse, but all Old Testament prophecy goes on the same view.
3. Jesus, while opposing the carnal views of the kingdom of God prevalent among the Jews in His day, does not contradict, but confirms, the Old Testament view of a coming, earthly, Jewish kingdom of glory: beginning from within, and spreading itself now spiritually, the kingdom of God shall manifest itself outwardly at Christ's coming again.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The phrase 'rest of the dead' here would most naturally refer to the 'same general class' which was before mentioned - the pious dead."
2. "The 'rest of the dead' - the pious dead - would indeed be raised up and rewarded, but they would occupy comparatively humble places..."
3. "This will be...in the honor done to the martyrs, in the restoration of their principles as the great actuating principles of the church, and perhaps in the increased happiness conferred on them in heaven, and in their being employed in promoting the cause of truth in the world."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Lived - again [ανεζησαν] . Read ezhsan lived, as in ver. 4

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Believers without exception have been included among those enumerated in the previous verse."
2. "May it be that they are viewed as the counterpart of the faithful remnant which we have met in chaps. Revelation 2:24 and Revelation 12:17?"
3. "The contrast that he has in view is not between a first and a second resurrection, but between a ‘first resurrection’ and a ‘second death.’"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "To infer from this statement, as many expositors have done, that the εζησαν of v. Revelation 20:4 must be understood of bodily resuscitation, is to interpret apocalyptic prophecy by methods of exegesis which are proper to ordinary narrative" (Swete).
2. "According to this view the first resurrection is a special incident in the present life before the Parousia. It has no parallel with 1 Thessalonians 4:16, where the dead in Christ are raised before those living are changed." 
3. "No effort is here made to solve this problem, save to call attention to the general judgment out of the books in Revelation 20:12 and to the general resurrection in John 5:29; Acts 24:15."

### John Gill:
1. "This clause is left out in the Syriac version."
2. "the resurrection of the righteous will be the first at the coming of Christ"
3. "this resurrection will be, η πρωτη, "the first", that is, the best, as the word is used in Luke 15:22 the chief, the principal"

### John Wesley:
1. "The small time, and the second thousand years, begin at the same point, immediately after the first thousand."
2. "But neither the beginning of the first nor of the second thousand will be known to the men upon earth, as both the imprisonment of Satan and his loosing are transacted in the invisible world."
3. "By observing these two distinct thousand years, many difficulties are avoided. There is room enough for the fulfilling of all the prophecies, and those which before seemed to clash are reconciled; particularly those which speak, on the one hand, of a most flourishing state of the church as yet to come; and, on the other, of the fatal security of men in the last days of the world."
