# Revelation 20:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who have part in the first resurrection are truly blessed and holy. The second death holds no power over them, as they are recipients of spiritual blessings, forgiveness, and regeneration. They will be completely blessed and holy, saved from the eternal torment faced by the wicked. These believers will serve as priests of God and Christ, dedicating themselves to their service and offering sacrifices of praise. They will also reign with Christ for a thousand years, sharing in His authority and glory.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "On such the second death hath no power‚Äîeven as it has none on Christ now that He is risen."
2. "As individual regeneration goes on now, so there shall be a 'regeneration' of nations then."
3. "The Mosaic ceremonial law corresponds to Israel's priestly office; the civil law to its kingly office: the Gentile Church adopts the moral law, and exercises the prophetic office by the word working inwardly."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Blessed - That is, his condition is to be regarded as a happy or a favored one. This is designed apparently to support and encourage those who, in the time of John, suffered persecution, or who might suffer persecution afterward."
2. "On such the second death hath no power - The 'second death' is properly the death which the wicked will experience in the world of woe. See Revelation 20:14. The meaning here is, that all who are here referred to as having part in the first resurrection will be secure against that."
3. "Their memory will then be sacredly cherished, and they will be honored on the earth with the honor which is due to their names, and which they should have received when in the land of the living."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Hath part [ŒµœáœâŒΩ ŒºŒµœÅŒøœÇ] . A phrase peculiar to John as referring to a person. Compare John 13:8. Second death. See on ch. Revelation 2:11.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection... the word 'holy' denotes the consecration that is given not to a few only but to all the saints of God."
2. "Over these the second death hath no power... It is the death of the whole man, body and soul together, the 'eternal punishment' denounced by our Lord against those who refuse to imitate His example, and to imbibe His spirit."
3. "But they shall be priests of God and of the Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years...These words again mention privileges that are common to all believers, and that continue not for a thousand years merely, but forever."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The second death. The spiritual death of Revelation 2:11; Revelation 20:14; Revelation 21:8 in contrast to the first or physical death." 
2. "This language raises a question about the interpretation of the first and the second resurrections, whether both are of the body or one of the spirit. There seems no way to reach a solid conception about it." 
3. "Priests of God and of Christ. As in Revelation 1:6; Revelation 5:10; Revelation 22:3; Revelation 22:5. Shall reign with him. As promised in the same passages."


### John Gill:
1. "Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection,... they are only such who are blessed with spiritual blessings, with a justifying righteousness, with pardon of sin, and regenerating grace, and who are sanctified by the Spirit of God..." 
2. "they shall be perfectly blessed in soul and body, and perfectly holy in both... they shall escape everlasting burnings, the fire of hell, the torment and misery of the wicked; they shall be delivered from wrath to come..."
3. "they will be wholly devoted to and employed in the service of God and of Christ... offering up the sacrifices of praise, or singing the song of the Lamb, adoring the grace and goodness of God and Christ unto them both in providence and in grace..."

### John Wesley:
1. They shall be priests of God and of Christ ‚Äî Therefore Christ is God.And shall reign with him ‚Äî With Christ, a thousand years.
