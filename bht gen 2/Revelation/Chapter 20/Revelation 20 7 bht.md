# Revelation 20:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the thousand years are fulfilled, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, coinciding with the beginning of the first resurrection. This event bears resemblance to the casting out of the dragon in Revelation 12:12, where there was joy in heaven but woe on earth. In a similar fashion, when Satan is released, the saints reign with Christ while the nations on earth are deceived.
