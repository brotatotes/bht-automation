# Revelation 20:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Satan, who had previously deceived various nations, will now deceive all the nations throughout the earth, acting with greater earnestness and urgency as he knows his time is limited. Gog and Magog, representing the countless northern nations to the east, will form an immense army alongside the wicked dead and the forces of demons under Satan. This vast multitude, likened to the sand of the sea, will engage in a great deception, attacking the immortal saints who are like the undying angels and are led by Christ, the King of kings and Lord of lords.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Gog and Magog is a general name for northern nations of Japheth's posterity, whose ideal head is Gog."
2. "A has but one Greek article to 'Gog and Magog,' whereby the two, namely, the prince and the people, are marked as having the closest connection."
3. "HILLER [Onomasticon] explains both words as signifying 'lofty,' 'elevated.' For 'quarters' the Greek is 'corners.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The meaning here is, that he would again, for a time, act in his true character, and in some way delude the nations once more."
2. "It is implied here that the deception or apostasy referred to would not be confined to one spot or portion of the world, but would extend afar."
3. "The fact that the names Gog and Magog are, in Ezekiel, associated with Meshech and Tubal, seems to determine the locality of these people, for those two countries lie between the Euxine and Caspian Seas, or at the southeast extremity of the Euxine Sea."

### Marvin Vincent:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "'Gog and Magog' are in apposition with 'the nations,' so that the two names represent the same thing."
2. "It is not necessary to inquire what particular people this may be, although they are generally regarded as the nations north of the Caucasus. Enough that, wherever they dwell, they are the enemies of God, that they march against Israel after the latter has been established in its own land, and that they are overthrown with a swift and terrible and final destruction."
3. "These 'nations' assemble under the leadership of Satan, who comes forth out of his prison 'to deceive the nations, to gather them together to the war.' The deception is not the general deception practiced by Satan over the hearts of men, and continued during the whole period of human history. It is one act of deception committed at the last, and consisting of the particular influence referred to." (149 words)

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "To deceive the nations, Satan's chief task." 
2. "Clearly the reign with Christ, if on earth, was not shared in by all on earth, for Satan finds a large and ready following on his release."

2. "the wicked dead, the rest of the dead, who lived not again until the thousand years are ended, when will be the second resurrection, the resurrection of all the wicked that have been from the beginning of the world; and these, with the posse of devils under Satan, will make up the Gog and Magog army"
3. "the deception will be very great, to attack saints in an immortal state, who are like the angels that die not, nor will these die any more, and especially since Christ, the King of kings and Lord of lords, who rules the nations with a rod of iron, will be at the head of them"

### John Wesley:
1. "And shall go forth to deceive the nations in the four corners of the earth — (That is, in all the earth)-the more diligently, as he hath been so long restrained, and knoweth he hath but a small time."
