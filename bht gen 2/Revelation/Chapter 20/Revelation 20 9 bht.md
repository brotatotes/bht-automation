# Revelation 20:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The invading army covered the entire land, spreading out and dominating. They encircled and defended the city, surrounding the camp of the saints. This camp, possibly representing the gentile church, was situated around Jerusalem. The beloved city, a reference also found in other scriptures, may signify the people of God. The imagery used suggests a complete and devastating destruction, possibly through the pouring out of God's fiery wrath.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "Ezekiel's prophecy of Gog and Magog refers to the attack made by Antichrist on Israel before the millennium, but this attack is made after the millennium."
3. "Even during the millennium there is a separation between heaven and earth, transfigured humanity and humanity in the flesh."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The image is that of an invading army that seems, in its march, to spread all over a land."
2. "The fact that the foes were able to 'compass this camp about,' and to encircle the city at the same time, shows the greatness of the numbers of the invaders."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The two appellations here used are evidently intended to express only two different aspects of the same thing, although we are probably to think of the camp not as within the city, but as round about it and defending it."
2. "As ‘the nations’ denote the enemies, ‘the beloved city’ denotes the people, of God; and surely not a select number, but all the ‘saints;’ all to whom the term ‘Jerusalem’ in its best sense may be properly applied."
3. "The destruction is complete even without mention of a battle being fought... The imagery is taken from Ezekiel 38:22; Ezekiel 39:6, with allusion also to such a destruction as that of 2Ki 1:10; 2 Kings 1:12; 2 Kings 1:14."

2. "The allusion is to the encampment of the children of Israel in the wilderness, about the tabernacle..."
3. "Not material fire... but the fiery indignation of God, or his wrath, which will be poured out like fire... the lake of fire, or second death, into which they will be cast..."
