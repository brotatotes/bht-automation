# Revelation 21:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The vision of a new heaven and a new earth represents the blissful state of the saints, surpassing the current physical world. This is not a mere renovation of the earth, but a complete transformation. It is not referring to any particular time in history, whether the apostolic age, the era of Constantine, or the future restoration of the Jews. The vision reaches into eternity, describing a new and eternal state where all former things are done away with and all becomes new.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The sea is the type of perpetual unrest... It symbolized the political tumults out of which 'the beast' arose... The absence of sea... answers to the unruffled state of solid peace which shall then prevail."
2. "The sea, though severing lands from one another, is now, by God's eliciting of good from evil, made the medium of communication between countries through navigation."
3. "Then man shall possess inherent powers which shall make the sea no longer necessary, but an element which would detract from a perfect state."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Such transformations, and such changes in their appearance, that they seemed to be just created."
2. "If the earth is to be renovated by fire, such a renovation will give an appearance to the globe as if it were created anew, and might be attended with such an apparent change in the heavens that they might be said to be new."
3. "In the future state, it would seem, the present arrangement will be unnecessary; and if man dwells upon the earth at all, or if he visits it as a temporary abode, these vast wastes of water will be needless."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "New [καινον] . See on Matthew 26:29. Compare Isaiah 65:17." 
2. "There was no more sea [η θαλασσα ουκ εστιν επι] . Lit., as Rev., the sea is no more. Here as in Revelation 20:13." 
3. "Some explain the sea as the ungodly world. I cannot help thinking this interpretation forced. According to this explanation, the passage is in the highest degree tautological. The first earth was passed away, and the ungodly world was no more."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is  a new heaven and a new earth  that the Seer beholds,  for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away." 
2. "Yet it is not necessary to think of an entirely new creation, as if the first had disappeared, and a second were called into existence by a fresh creative act of the Almighty."
3. "The ‘heavens,’ the ‘earth,’ and the ‘Jerusalem’ here spoken of are in this sense ‘new.’ They are the ‘new heavens and new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness’."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A new heaven and a new earth... is the picture of the bliss of the saints."
2. "The old physical world is gone in this vision. It is not a picture of renovation of this earth, but of the disappearance of this earth and sky."
3. "The symbolism in neither case is to be pressed too literally, but a stern and a glorious reality exists behind it all."

### John Gill:
1. "This vision relates to a glorious state of the church, not in the times of the apostles, or first dispensation of the Gospel...but death did not then cease, it has reigned over men in common ever since."
2. "Nor does this vision refer to the times of Constantine, when the old Pagan idolatry was removed out of the empire...the Christian doctrine and worship were soon corrupted, being mixed with Judaism and Paganism."
3. "Nor has this vision anything to do with the conversion and restoration of the Jews...for this will be over before this vision takes place."


### John Wesley:
1. "All these several representations follow one another in order: so the vision reaches into eternity."
2. "St. John is not now describing a flourishing state of the church, but a new and eternal state of all things."
3. "All the former things will be done away, that all may become new."
