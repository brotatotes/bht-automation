# Revelation 21:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The city is described as having the glory of God and its own light, which is not external but radiates from within. This light is not limited to the city but shines out to a great distance. Just as the glory of God dwells within the city, so too does His light, which is a reflection of His eternal presence.
