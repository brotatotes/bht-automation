## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Peter is not the only apostolic rock on whose preaching Christ builds His Church."
2. "Christ Himself is the true foundation: the twelve are foundations only in regard to their apostolic testimony concerning Him."
3. "As architects often have their names inscribed on their great works, so the names of the apostles shall be held in everlasting remembrance."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The former would seem to be the most probable, as the latter would indicate comparative feebleness and liability to fall."
2. "The names of the apostles were cut or carved in them so as to be conspicuous."
3. "Of the Lamb of God; the Messiah."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Foundations [θεμελιους]: See on the kindred verb qemeliwsei shalt settle, 1 Peter 5:10."
2. "In them the names [εν αυτοις ονοματα]: The correct reading is ejp' aujtwn dwdeka ojnomata, on them twelve names."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We are not to think of foundations buried in the earth, but of great and massive stones rising above the soil as a pediment sustaining the whole structure."
2. "The main point of the figure is that the city rested on the twelve Apostles of our Lord."
3. "The whole passage is symbolical; the Jewish imagery could not have admitted thirteen instead of twelve foundations, and St. Paul is no more excluded from the number of Apostles than are Gentile Christians from the happiness of the city."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Twelve foundations (θεμελιους δωδεκα). Foundation stones, old adjective (from θεμα, from τιθημ), here as in 1 Corinthians 3:11; 2 Timothy 2:19, with λιθους (stones understood), though often neuter substantive to θεμελιον (Luke 6:48; Acts 16:26)."
2. "Twelve because of the twelve apostles as foundation stones (Ephesians 2:20)."
3. "Names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb (ονοματα των δωδεκα αποστολων του αρνιου). Jesus had spoken of twelve thrones for the apostles (Matthew 19:28); names of all twelve are here written, not just that of Peter, as some would argue from Matthew 16:18."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ is the one and only foundation of his church and people, of the covenant of grace, and of salvation; and of faith, hope, peace, and joy, and of eternal happiness..."
2. "He will be the light and temple of it, the glory and safety of it; he will be all in all in it..."
3. "This may denote the firm and immovable state of the church at this time, it being a city which has foundations, or is well founded..."

### John Wesley:
1. "And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb" - Figuratively showing that the inhabitants of the city had built only on that faith which the apostles once delivered to the saints.
