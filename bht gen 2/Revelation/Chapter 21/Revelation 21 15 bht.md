# Revelation 21:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The city is being measured using a golden reed, indicating its rich and costly nature, and the measurements signify the consecration and exact dimensions of every part of the city. This measuring is done by an angel, highlighting the divine and precise guardianship over the city. The purpose of the measurement is to reveal the proper architectural proportions of the city, reflecting its noble and fair nature. The use of a golden reed, comparable to the city's pure gold materials, and the reference to a measuring reed in Ezekiel further emphasize the significance of this measuring.

2. "Had a golden reed; not a common measuring reed, or rod, as in Ezekiel 40:4 but one covered with gold, denoting the present glorious state of the church, being without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing."
3. "To show how exactly conformable this church state will be to the rule of God's word, even to perfection: and the gates thereof; to signify who had a right to enter into it, and who not: and the wall thereof; its height, it being exceeding high."

### John Wesley:
1. "By this measure is understood the greatness of the city, with the exact order and just proportion of every part of it; to show, figuratively, that this city was prepared for a great number of inhabitants."
2. "The city is twelve thousand furlongs high; the wall, an hundred and forty-four reeds. This is exactly the same height, only expressed in a different manner."
3. "In treating of all these things a deep reverence is necessary; and so is a measure of spiritual wisdom; that we may neither understand them too literally and grossly, nor go too far from the natural force of the words."
