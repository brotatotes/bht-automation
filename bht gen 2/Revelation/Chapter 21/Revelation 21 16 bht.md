# Revelation 21:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The New Jerusalem is described as a perfect cube, symbolizing its regularity, uniformity, and immovableness. Its four-square shape represents its reach to the four corners of the world, encompassing people from all directions. The measurement of twelve thousand furlongs, or fifteen hundred miles, serves as a symbolic representation of its immense size, emphasizing the abundant space available for all the elect of God. This imagery highlights the perfect harmony and uniformity of the city, with its equal dimensions of length, breadth, and height. The description invites readers to envision a celestial dwelling place that transcends earthly limitations.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The stupendous height, length, and breadth being exactly alike, imply its faultless symmetry, transcending in glory all our most glowing conceptions."
2. "one thousand furlongs being the space between the several twelve gates."
3. "BENGEL makes the length of each side of the city to be twelve thousand stadii."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The New Jerusalem, on the contrary, had been built according to a plan of the utmost regularity, which had not been modified by the circumstances, or varied as the city grew."
2. "The idea intended to be conveyed by this immense height would seem to be that it would contain countless numbers of inhabitants."
3. "The idea of vastness and of capacity is the main idea designed to be represented. The image before the mind is, that the numbers of the redeemed will be immense."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The description seems to be that of a vast cube, which may have been suggested by the Holy of Holies of the tabernacle, which was of that shape."
2. "But opinions differ as to whether the twelve thousand furlongs are the measure of the four sides of the city taken together, in which ease each side will measure three thousand furlongs; or whether the twelve-thousand furlongs are intended to represent the length of each side."
3. "These are enough to show how utterly futile are attempts to reduce these symbolic visions to mathematical statement. Professor Milligan aptly remarks: 'Nor is it of the smallest moment to reduce the enormous dimensions spoken of. No reduction brings them within the bounds of verisimilitude; and no effort in that direction is required. The idea is alone to be thought of.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It was thus a perfect cube; and, remembering the general imagery of this book, there can be no doubt that the Seer has the Holy of Holies of the Tabernacle in his eye."
2. "The symbolism which marks the general shape marks also the details, each dimension measuring 12,000 furlongs, 12 the number of the people of God multiplied by 1000 the heavenly number."
3. "No reduction brings them within the bounds of verisimilitude, and no effort in that direction is required. The idea is alone to be thought of."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is a tetragon or quadrilateral quadrangle (Revelation 21:12)."
2. "This same measurement (Ï€Î»Î±Ï„Î¿Ïƒ, Î¼Î·ÎºÎ¿Ïƒ, Ï…ÏˆÎ¿Ï‚) is applied to Christ's love in Ephesians 3:18, with Î²Î±Î¸Î¿Ï‚ (depth) added."
3. "Surely the meaning is that heaven will be large enough for all, as Jesus said (John 14:1) without insisting on the materialistic measurement of a gorgeous apartment house full of inside rooms."

### John Gill:
1. "And the city lieth four square,.... To the four corners of the world, from whence its inhabitants come, and denotes the regularity, uniformity, perfection, and immovableness of it."
2. "And he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs; or fifteen hundred miles; a monstrously large city indeed! such an one as never was upon earth... and which shows, that this is not to be understood literally, but mystically; and intends the capaciousness of it, here being room enough for all the twelve tribes of Israel; that is, for all the elect of God."
3. "The length, and the breadth, and the height of it are equal. A perfectly uniform state! according to the Ethiopic version, it is in length twelve thousand furlongs, and every measure equal, so that it is so many furlongs in length, breadth, and height."
