# Revelation 21:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The measurement of the wall, one hundred and forty-four cubits, has significant symbolic meaning. It is a multiple of twelve, representing the complete and perfected state of the Church. This number is intertwined throughout the Book of Revelation, seen in the twelve tribes, twelve gates, twelve angels, and twelve foundations. Despite being measured by an angel, the standard used is that of a man, emphasizing the equal status of humans and angels in the perfect New Jerusalem.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "hundred . . . forty . . . four cubits—twelve times twelve: the Church-number squared." 
2. "The wall is far beneath the height of the city."
3. "measure of a man, that is, of the angel—The ordinary measure used by men is the measure here used by the angel, distinct from 'the measure of the sanctuary.' Men shall then be equal to the angels."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "As the walls of a city are designed to protect it from external foes, the height mentioned here gives all proper ideas of security; and we are to conceive of the city itself as towering immensely above the walls."
2. "According to the measure of a man - The measure usually employed by men. This seems to be added in order to prevent any mistake as to the size of the city."
3. "It was, indeed, an angel who measured the city, but the measure which he employed was that in common use among people."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Cubits [πηχων] . The word originally means that part of the arm between the hand and the elbow - joint, the forearm."
2. "Some take the one hundred and forty - four cubits as representing the height of the wall; others the thickness."
3. "The most inconsiderable wall" remarks Dusterdieck, "is sufficient to exclude all that is impure."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "Its length and height had been measured, and its thickness is now added to complete the description of its strength."
3. "The New Jerusalem is not framed according to angelic ideas or for angelic purposes. It is to be the dwelling-place of men; and even, therefore, when an angel measures it, he measures it ‘according to the measure of a man.’"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A hundred and forty and four cubits (εκατον τεσσερακοντα τεσσαρων πηχων). Another multiple of 12 (12x12=144) as in Revelation 7:4; Revelation 14:1."
2. "It is not clear whether it is the height or the breadth of the wall that is meant, though υψος (height) comes just before."
3. "Though measured by an angel, a human standard was employed, man's measure which is angel's (Bengel)."

### John Gill:
1. "The root of [one hundred and forty-four] is twelve, for twelve times twelve is a hundred and forty-four; which number is mystical and apostolical, and suited to the perfect state of this church."
2. "Hence twelve gates, and twelve angels at them, and the names of the twelve tribes on them, and twelve foundations of the wall, and twelve thousand furlongs, the measure of the city."
3. "According to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel; who talked with John, and measured the city, gates, and wall, and who appeared in the form of a man; and his reed might be, as some have supposed, the length of a man, six cubits, or six feet."
