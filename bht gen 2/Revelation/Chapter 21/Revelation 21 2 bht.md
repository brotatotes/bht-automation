# Revelation 21:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The new Jerusalem, depicted as coming down from heaven, represents the church of God, its citizens being the saints and the elect of God. The vision was seen by John, who was sent by God an angel to signify what would come to pass. This new Jerusalem, described as wholly new and not belonging to this world or the millennium, reflects the perfection and eternal nature of the church. It is a city that descends, embracing the complete peace and prosperity of the future.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The descent of the new Jerusalem out of heaven is plainly distinct from the earthly Jerusalem...and follows on the creation of the new heaven and earth." 
2. "John in his Gospel always writes...of the old city; in the Apocalypse always...of the heavenly city."
3. "There is no longer merely a Paradise as in Eden...but now the city of God on earth, costlier, statelier, and more glorious, but at the same time the result of labor and pains."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is here represented as 'coming down from God out of heaven.' This, of course, does not mean that this great city was 'literally' to descend upon the earth...but it is a symbolical or figurative representation, designed to show that the abode of the righteous will be splendid and glorious."
2. "The idea of a city literally descending from heaven, and being set upon the earth with such proportions...is absurd. No man can suppose that this is literally true, and hence this must be regarded as a figurative or emblematic description."
3. "The purpose here is, to represent it as exceedingly beautiful. The comparison of the church with a bride, or a wife, is common in the Scriptures...It is a beautiful city that seems to descend, and this city is itself compared with a richly-attired bride prepared for her husband."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. I John. Omit John. New Jerusalem. Others join new with coming down, and render corning down new out of heaven. A bride. Compare Isaiah 61:10; Isaiah 61:5.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Apostle beholds the metropolis of the renovated world under the figure of that metropolis which was so intimately associated with the memories and aspirations of the people of God, a New Jerusalem."
2. "Her newness will be afterwards more particularly described, but even now we are told enough to convey to us a lofty idea of her grandeur and beauty."
3. "She comes down out of heaven, from God, and she is prepared as a bride adorned for her husband."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The New Earth must have a new metropolis, not another Babylon, but another and greater Jerusalem."
2. "This heavenly Jerusalem of hope, this Jerusalem above where our real citizenship is."
3. "The Wife of the Lamb made herself ready in her bridal attire."

### John Gill:
1. "The church of God: sometimes the church militant is called a city, of which the saints are now fellow citizens, governed by wholesome laws, and enjoying many privileges; but here the general assembly and church of the firstborn, or all the elect of God, are intended, the whole body and society of them, being as a city, compact together."
2. "and John, for the more strong ascertaining the truth of this vision, expresses his name, who saw it, to whom God sent his angel, and signified to him by these Apocalyptic visions what should be hereafter;"
3. "the Gospel church state in its imperfection is called the heavenly Jerusalem, and the Jerusalem above, which is free, and the mother of all; and here the church in its perfect state is called the new Jerusalem, where will be complete peace and prosperity."

### John Wesley:
1. "The new heaven, the new earth, and the new Jerusalem, are closely connected."
2. "This city is wholly new, belonging not to this world, not to the millennium, but to eternity."
3. "Coming down — In the very act of descending."
