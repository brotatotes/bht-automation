# Revelation 21:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The mentioned stones in the text have significant attributes. The sardonyx, a blend of red and white, resembles a man's nail and conveys a sense of mixture. The chrysolite, with its golden color resembling topaz or amber, emanates warmth and brilliance. Additionally, the jacinth, with its purple hue, carries an intense color. These gemstones bear their individual significance, contributing to the depth and richness of the passage.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Sardonyx - a gem having the redness of the cornelian, and the whiteness of the onyx."
2. "Chrysolite - described by Pliny as transparent and of a golden brightness, like our topaz: different from our pale green crystallized chrysolite."
3. "Jacinth - The flashing violet brightness in the amethyst is diluted in the jacinth."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The “name” is derived from 'Sardis,' a city in Asia Minor and ὄνυξ onux, a nail - so named, according to Pliny, from the resemblance of its color to the flesh and the nail."
2. "It is a stone of a blood-red or flesh color, and is commonly known as a 'carnelian'."
3. "It denotes a gem of a deep purple or violet color. The word is derived from α a, the alpha privative ('not'), and μεθύω methuō, to be intoxicated, because this gem was supposed to be an antidote against drunkenness."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The most beautiful and rarest variety of onyx."
2. "Chrysolite described as translucent with golden luster."
3. "Amethyst supposed to avert intoxication."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Sardonyx (σαρδονυξ), here only in N.T., white with layers of red, from sardion (red carnelian) and onyx (white)."
2. "Chrysolite (χρυσολιθος), here only in N.T., stone of a golden colour like our topaz or amber or a yellow beryl or golden jasper."
3. "Beryl (βηρυλλος), again here only in N.T., much like the emerald according to Pliny."


### John Gill:
1. "The fifth, sardonyx,.... Which is partly of the sardian, and partly of the onyx stone, which resembles a man's nail, from whence it has its name; it is reddish, bordering on white; it may be thought to answer to the onyx in the breastplate, on which was written the name of Joseph."
2. "The ninth, a topaz; a stone very hard and transparent, of a beautiful yellow, or gold colour: the topaz of Ethiopia was counted the best, Job 28:19. Some say it is so called from the island "Topazus"; on this stone Simeon's name was engraved."
3. "The eleventh, a jacinth; or 'hyacinth': a stone of a purple, or violet colour, from whence it has its name; though what the moderns so call is of a deep reddish yellow, pretty near a flame colour. Zabulon's stone was the diamond."

### John Wesley:
1. "A sardonyx is red streaked with white; a sardius, of a deep red; a chrysolite, of a deep yellow; a beryl, sea-green."
2. "A chrysoprase is greenish and transparent, with gold specks; a jacinth, of a red purple; an amethyst, violet purple."
