# Revelation 21:21 Commentary Help Text

The heavenly city, with its magnificent gates and streets, is described as adorned with pearls and paved with gold. The pearls symbolize the purity and preciousness of Christ and the saints who enter through them, while the gold signifies the splendor and glorification of the future abode. The streets, made of gold transfigured and glorified, represent not just physical roads, but the preciousness and delightfulness of the saints' conversations and the sincerity and openness of their interactions. This image emphasizes the purity, preciousness, and beauty of the eternal dwelling place of the saints.
