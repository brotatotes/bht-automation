# Revelation 21:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the future state, the concept of a physical temple or external rituals of worship will no longer be necessary, as the Lord God and the Lamb themselves will embody the very essence of the temple. They will permeate the new heaven and earth, enveloping and sanctifying the entire city. In this divine dwelling place, God will be the ultimate source of all things, encompassing and fulfilling every aspect of existence.
