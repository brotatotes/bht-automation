# Revelation 21:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The glorious light of God, brighter than any earthly sun or moon, illuminates the heavenly city. This divine radiance, described as the Shekinah Glory of God, will be an everlasting light for all who dwell within the city. It is through the light of the Lamb, Jesus Christ, that the saints will behold the very face of God and experience the fullness of divine presence. The imagery employed here vividly conveys the spiritual and supernatural nature of the New Jerusalem, where the physical elements of this world are surpassed by the divine brilliance that permeates every aspect of existence.
