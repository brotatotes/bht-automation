## BHT:
In the heavenly city, the gates shall not be shut, indicating that there will always be free access to its inhabitants.

This means that there will be no need for the passage of time, as the residents of this city will be in a state of perfect peace and security. Not only will there be no physical darkness, but also no darkness of the soul, no spiritual darkness or error. In this heavenly abode, there will be continual light and constant communion with God.
