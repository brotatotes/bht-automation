# Revelation 21:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he shall tabernacle with them. This imagery recalls the sacred tent of the Israelites, where God's presence dwelled. In the new creation, God will dwell among his people, not in weakness, but in the glory of his manifested Godhead. This signifies the fulfillment of God's promise to be Immanuel, God with us. And as a result, there will be no doubt that God is with them, actively manifesting himself as their God.
