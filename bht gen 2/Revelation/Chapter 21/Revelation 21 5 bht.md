# Revelation 21:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The one who sits upon the throne declares, not only to John, but to all, Behold, I make all things new. This declaration encompasses not only the renewal of heaven and earth, but also the transformation of souls, as God graciously grants the water of life to satisfy thirsty hearts. The fulfillment of these promises extends to the overcomers, as seen in the repeated assurances given in Revelation 2:7. These divine pronouncements are not only faithful, but also true, for they are grounded in the eternal truth and trustworthiness of God Himself.
