# Revelation 21:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He that overcometh goes beyond simply having a desire for salvation, encompassing the victory over sin, Satan, and worldly temptations. The promise of inheriting these things refers to the new heaven and new earth, the divine presence, and freedom from all evils, all fulfilled in the glorious state of believers. In this state, it will be abundantly clear that they truly are the sons of God and the seed of Christ, and the fulfillment of the promise of God being their God and they being His sons will be evident.
