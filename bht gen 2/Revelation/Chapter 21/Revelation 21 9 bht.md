# Revelation 21:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
One of the angels who had poured out the bowls of judgment now appeared to John, representing the fulfillment of God's plan. This angel had also shown John the wickedness of Babylon, which stands in stark contrast to the pure and glorious bride, the redeemed Church. Through these visions, John is given a clear contrast between the wickedness of the world and the ultimate blessedness of the Church, united with its Lord as a bride to her husband.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The same angel who had shown John Babylon the harlot, is appropriately employed to show him in contrast new Jerusalem, the Bride."
2. "The angel so employed is the one that had the last seven plagues, to show that the ultimate blessedness of the Church is one end of the divine judgments on her foes."
3. "The Lamb's wife is in contrast to her who sat on many waters, intrigued with many peoples and nations of the world, instead of giving her undivided affections, as the Bride does, to the Lamb."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Why one of these angels was employed to make this communication is not stated. It may be that as they had been engaged in bringing destruction on the enemies of the church, and securing its final triumph, there was a propriety that that triumph should be announced by one of their number." 
2. "I will show you what represents the redeemed church now to be received into permanent union with its Lord - as a bride about to be united to her husband." 
3. "See the notes on ver. 2. Compare Revelation 19:7-8."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Unto me. Omit. Vials. Properly bowls. See on ch. Revelation 5:8.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The fuller description of the angel brings out more completely the fact that the last 'plagues' were over, and that nothing remained to be exhibited to the Seer but the glory of the redeemed in heaven."
2. "The combination of the terms 'bride' and 'Lamb's wife' is remarkable."
3. "The Church is not only espoused but married to her Lord, yet she remains for ever in a virgin purity."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "The bride, the wife of the Lamb.[...] mentioned proleptically as in Revelation 19:7 if the marriage is not yet a reality."
3. "For the use of the same metaphor elsewhere in the N.T. see on Revelation 19:7."

### John Gill:
1. "The bride, his wife, is not any particular believer, nor any particular church; not the Gentile church, nor the Jewish church only, but all the elect of God..."
2. "...consisting of the raised and living saints at the coming of Christ; who will make up one body, one general assembly, and be as a bride, prepared and adorned for her husband..."
3. "...the marriage is consummated, and they are declared publicly to be the bride, the Lamb's wife."

### John Wesley:
1. "And there came one of the seven angels that had the seven phials — Whereby room had been made for the kingdom of God."
