# Revelation 22:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ's words to John in the book of Revelation command him to leave the prophecies unsealed and accessible to all. This is to ensure that the persecuted church can find comfort and reassurance in the midst of their trials. By reading the prophecies, they can be prepared for the coming afflictions, persevere through them, and find hope in the ultimate triumph of Christ over all evil. The nearness of these events is emphasized, urging believers to remain vigilant and faithful in their journey with the Lord.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The New Testament is the time of the end and fulfilment."
2. "The Gentile Church, for which John wrote his Revelation, needs more to be impressed with the shortness of the period, as it is inclined, owing to its Gentile origin, to conform to the world and forget the coming of the Lord."
3. "The Revelation points, on the one hand, to Christ's coming as distant, for it shows the succession of the seven seals, trumpets, and vials; on the other hand, it proclaims, 'Behold, I come quickly.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book... to leave them open, so that a persecuted church might have access to them, and might, in times of persecution and trial, have the assurance that the principles of their religion would finally triumph."
2. "The idea in their being commanded to seal them was, that they should make the record sure and unchangeable; that they should finish it, and lay it up for future ages; so that, in far-distant times, the events might be compared with the prophecy, and it might be seen that there was an exact correspondence between the prophecy and the fulfillment."
3. "The events which John had predicted... were about to begin to be fulfilled, and were to be of immediate use in consoling a persecuted church."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Seal [σφραγισης] . Rev., seal up. This word occurs eighteen times in Revelation and twice in the Gospel, and only five times elsewhere in the New Testament. It means to confirm or attest (John 3:33); to close up for security (Matthew 27:66; Revelation 20:3); to hide or keep secret (Revelation 10:4; Revelation 22:10); to mark a person or thing (Revelation 7:3; Ephesians 1:13; Ephesians 4:30)."
2. "Time [καιρος] . See on Matthew 12:1."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Seal not up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is at hand." 
2. "The Apocalypse was not to be a sealed and hidden book like that of Daniel... It was to be opened for the instruction and the guidance of the Church."
3. "There was not a moment to be lost. The Lord was at hand. Let all who believed that truth prepare themselves for His coming."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Seal not up...This book is to be left open for all to read."
2. "The angel resumes as in Revelation 19:9."
3. "At hand...As in Revelation 1:3."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ would have the things John saw and heard, written, and made public, sent in an open book, unsealed, to the churches, that they might be seen and read of all."
2. "That so the afflictions and persecutions of the people of God, both under Rome Pagan, and Rome Papal, might be known, and the saints not be offended at them when they came, but be prepared for them, to endure them patiently."
3. "And that they might have some assurance of the destruction of antichrist, and of the glorious state of the church, both in the spiritual and personal reign of Christ, and so be comforted in the midst of their tribulations, and rejoice in the faith and hope of these things."

### John Wesley:
1. "Seal not the sayings of this book — Conceal them not, like the things that are sealed up."
2. "The time is nigh — Wherein they shall begin to take place."
