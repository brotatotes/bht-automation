# Revelation 22:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
At the close of time, at the second coming of Christ, there will be a final judgment where the condition of all mankind will be eternally fixed. Those who are unjust and unrighteous will remain in their wickedness, with no possibility of regeneration or repentance. Likewise, those who are defiled and unholy will continue in their impurity without any hope of sanctification or change. This underscores the significance of the present moment and the importance of striving for righteousness and holiness in our lives.
