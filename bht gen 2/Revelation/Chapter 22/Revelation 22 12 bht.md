# Revelation 22:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Behold, I come quickly, declares the Lord, emphasizing the impending judgment of the world. Along with His second coming, Christ also affirms that He brings rewards to both the righteous and the wicked. These rewards are given at His coming and are assigned based on each person's actions and character, reflecting the justice and righteousness of God. Thus, every individual will receive their appropriate recompense according to their deeds, both inward and outward.

1. "My reward is with me." (ο μισθος μου μετ εμου). Misqov reward is strictly wages. Compare Isaiah 40:10; Isaiah 61:11. See on 2 Peter 2:13.
2. "To give [αποδουναι]." Lit., to give back or in return for, thus appropriate to misqov reward. Hence Rev., better, render. See on give an account, Luke 16:2; and gave, Acts 4:33.
3. "Shall be [εσται]. Read ejstin is."
