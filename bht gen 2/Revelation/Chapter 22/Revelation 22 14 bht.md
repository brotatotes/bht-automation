# Revelation 22:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Happy are those who faithfully carry out God's commandments, for by doing so, they obtain the privilege of approaching the tree of life. This is not a right earned through their own efforts, but rather a right bestowed upon them through the grace and righteousness of Christ. It is a blessed state indeed to have the authority to partake in the eternal life given by God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "(Blessed are they that) wash their robes," namely, in the blood of the Lamb (compare Revelation 7:14). This reading takes away the pretext for the notion of salvation by works.
2. But even English Version reading is quite compatible with salvation by grace; for God's first and grand Gospel "commandment" is to believe on Jesus.
3. Thus our "right" to the tree of life is due not to our doings, but to what He has done for us. The right, or privilege, is founded, not on our merits, but on God's grace.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That they may have right - That they may be entitled to approach the tree of life; that this privilege may be granted to them." 
2. "It is not a right in the sense that they have merited it, but in the sense that the privilege is conferred on them as one of the rewards of God."
3. "They would not be forbidden to approach that tree as Adam was, but would be permitted always to partake of it, and would live forever."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "They that wash their robes." 
2. "That they may have right to the tree of life."
3. "In order that theirs shall be authority over the tree of life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Blessed are they that wash their robes, that they may have the right to the tree of life, and may enter in by the gates into the city." 
2. "Those who are to enjoy that reward are evidently conceived of as one class, the Church of Christ as a whole, not two classes, Jewish and Gentile Christians."
3. "In the two last clauses of the verse their blessedness is presented under two points of view: first, they have 'a right to,' literally, they have authority over, 'the tree of life,' so that they may eat continually of its fruit; secondly, they 'enter in by the gates into the city.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Blessed (μακαριο). This is the last beatitude of the book and 'deals with the issues of the higher life."
2. "That they may have the right (ινα εστα η εξουσια αυτων). Purpose clause with ινα and the future middle of ειμ...that there may be their right."
3. "To come to the tree of life (επ το ξυλον της ζωης). 'Over the tree of life.' On εξουσια επ = 'power over'...On 'the tree of life' see Revelation 2:7; Revelation 22:2."

### John Gill:
1. "Such as regard them in a right way and manner are blessed; they have much pleasure and delight in the observance of them; these commandments are not grievous, especially when they have the presence of Christ, the discoveries of his love, and are under the gracious influences of his Spirit." 
2. "And happy are those who enjoy such a privilege!"
3. "And they must be happy persons, indeed, who enter there; and their right to it is from, and lies in Christ, his blood, righteousness, and grace, under a sense of which they yield a ready obedience to his will, which makes their right to appear."

### John Wesley:
1. "Happy are they that do his commandments."
2. "That they may have right."
3. "To the tree of life."
