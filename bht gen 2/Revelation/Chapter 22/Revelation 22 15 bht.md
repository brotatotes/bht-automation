# Revelation 22:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Without are the impure and vile, who are compared to dogs in their filthiness and voraciousness. These wicked individuals, including sorcerers, fornicators, murderers, idolaters, and those who love and practice lies, will not be admitted into the heavenly city. Instead, they will be cast out into outer darkness, separated forever from the righteous who dwell within the city. The term dogs is a general appellative used to describe all these sinful classes, representing their contemptible and unclean nature. Ultimately, these characteristics align them with the antichristian party, who will find no place in the glorious kingdom of Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "dogs—Greek, 'the dogs'; the impure, filthy"
2. "maketh—including also 'whosoever practiceth a lie'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "For without are dogs - The wicked, the depraved, the vile..."
2. "The word “without” means that they would not be admitted into the heavenly city..."
3. "The only change is, that those who 'love and make a lie' are added to the list; that is, who delight in lies, or what is false."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "This was the term of reproach with which the Judaizers stigmatized the Gentiles as impure."
2. "Here the word is used of those whose moral impurity excludes them from the New Jerusalem."
3. "The herds of dogs which prowl about Eastern cities, without a home and without an owner, feeding on the refuse and filth of the streets, quarreling among themselves, and attacking the passer-by, explain both applications of the image."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Without are the dogs, and the sorcerers, and the fornicators, and the murderers, and the idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie." These words appear to be added, not so much for the sake of telling us what shall be the fate of the sinful classes mentioned, as for the sake of enhancing by contrast that description of the blessedness of the righteous which had been given in the previous verse.
2. The latter are within the city, separated forever from the classes now described, the very mention of which awakens pain and horror in the mind.
3. The word 'dogs' is a general appellative applicable to all these classes, and is to be explained by remembering the light in which such animals were regarded by the Jews (Psalms 22:16; Psalms 22:20; comp. Matthew 7:6; Philippians 3:2). This general appellation is then subdivided (comp. chap. Revelation 21:8).

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Without (εξω). Outside the holy city, with which compare Revelation 21:8; Revelation 21:27."
2. "Dogs in the Oriental cities are the scavengers and excite unspeakable contempt."
3. "Satan is the father of lying (John 8:44) and Satan's home is a congenial place for those who love and practice lying (2 Thessalonians 2:12)."

### John Gill:
1. "Without the holy city are such persons who are comparable to dogs for their filthiness, impudence, and voraciousness."
2. "All wicked men, who will be cast out into outer darkness, may be signified hereby."
3. "Characters of the antichristian party, who will have no place in this city, or glorious kingdom of Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. Without are dogs — The sentence in the original is abrupt, as expressing abhorrence. The gates are ever open; but not for dogs; fierce and rapacious men.
