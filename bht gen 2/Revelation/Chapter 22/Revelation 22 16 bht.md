# Revelation 22:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, the Savior and Lord of all, personally affirms the messages in this book by declaring, I Jesus. His authority and divinity are evident, for He is the root and origin of David's lineage, the promised Messiah. As the bright and morning star, He brings light, hope, and the dawning of a new day. His role as the star out of Jacob, foretold in Numbers, signifies His power to dispel darkness and bring about a glorious future. Through His words, Jesus extends His testimony and blessings to the churches, both present and future, ensuring the truth reaches all believers.
