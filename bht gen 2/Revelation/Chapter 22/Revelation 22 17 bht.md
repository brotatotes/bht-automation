## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The invitation, 'Come,' only holds good while the Church is still but an affianced Bride, and not the actually wedded wife."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The design of this whole verse is, evidently, to show the freeness of the offers of the gospel; to condense in a summary manner all the invitations of mercy to mankind; and to leave on the mind at the close of the book a deep impression of the ample provision which has been made for the salvation of a fallen race."
2. "Nothing, it is clear, could be more appropriate at the close of this book, and at the close of the whole volume of revealed truth, than to announce, in the most clear and attracting form, that salvation is free to all, and that whosoever will may be saved."
3. "The church on earth and the church in heaven unite in the invitation, saying, Come. The living father, pastor, friend, invites - and the voice of the departed father, pastor, friend, now in heaven, is heard re-echoing the invitation."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. The Spirit. In the Church. The Bride. The Church. Heareth. The voice of the Spirit and the Bride.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "What more natural than that at such a moment they should exchange their sentiments in the blessed fellowship of a common joy?"
2. "The Spirit working in the Church, and teaching her to long and cry for that Coming with which all her hopes are associated, together with the Church herself, no sooner think of the testimony of Christ as ended than they can restrain themselves no longer, and by the voice of the Church they both cry 'Come'."
3. "The thirst referred to is not the first thirst of the sinner after salvation. It is the constant longing of one who has already been refreshed for deeper and fuller draughts; and to each one who so thirsts the Lord says 'Come'."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "After the picture of heaven...there is intense longing of God's people for the consummation of the marriage of the Lamb and the Bride." 
2. "The call for Christ is to be repeated by every hearer...Let him come himself before it is too late." 
3. "The door of mercy still stands wide open today, for the end has not yet come."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'the Spirit' may be meant the Spirit of God in the hearts of his people, who not only convinces them of, and acquaints with the coming of Christ to judgment, and gives them reason to expect it, but fills their souls with the love of his appearance, so that they look and long for it, and hasten in the breathings of their souls after it." 
2. "The Spirit and the bride signify one and the same; namely, the spiritual bride of Christ, who is sanctified by the Spirit of God; even all the elect of God, whom Christ loved from all eternity, and who are espoused to him as a chaste virgin."
3. "These seem to be the words of Christ inviting such who thirst after him, his grace and righteousness, after more knowledge of him, and communion with him, to come unto him, by faith, and partake thereof."

### John Wesley:
1. "The Spirit and the bride — The Spirit of adoption in the bride, in the heart of every true believer."
2. "Say — With earnest desire and expectation."
3. "And whosoever will, let him take the water of life — He may partake of my spiritual and unspeakable blessings, as freely as he makes use of the most common refreshments; as freely as he drinks of the running stream."
