## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I testify." 
2. "I testify unto these things." 
3. "Just retribution in kind."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I bear this solemn witness, or make this solemn affirmation, in conclusion."
2. "Perhaps he felt, too, that as this book would be necessarily regarded as obscure from the fact that symbols were so much used, there was great danger that changes would be made by well-meaning persons with a view to make it appear more plain."
3. "For it is obvious that no one has a right to change any part of a revelation which God makes to man; to presume to add to it, or to take from it, or in any way to modify it."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Swete properly holds these verses to be from Jesus himself, still bearing solemn witness to this book, with warning against wilful perversion of its teachings." 
2. "This warning is directed against perversions of this book, not about the New Testament or the Bible as a whole, though it may be true there also."
3. "Surely no warning was more needed when we consider the treatment accorded the Apocalypse, so that Dr. Robert South said that the Apocalypse either found one crazy or left him so."

### John Gill:
1. "To 'add' to the things contained in this book, is not to deliver, or write an exposition of it, in a modest manner, with a sincere view to give light into it, agreeably to the analogy of faith."
2. "But then may it be said to be added unto, and so this book, when it is wrested and perverted, and a false gloss is put upon it."
3. "The punishment of such a crime follows, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book; the things threatened to the antichristian party, the seven last plagues in which the wrath of God is filled up, the lake of fire and brimstone." (Total word count: 149)
