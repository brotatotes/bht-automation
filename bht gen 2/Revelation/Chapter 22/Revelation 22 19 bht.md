# Revelation 22:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Whoever takes away from the prophecy of this book denies its authority and perverts its true meaning. Their part in the book of life, representing eternal election and salvation, will be taken away by God. Such individuals, not written in the book of life, shall be cast into the lake of fire, which is the second death. Their denial and corruption of the divine truth leads to their ultimate punishment.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "(take away his part, that is, portion) from the tree of life," that is, shall deprive him of participation in the tree of life.
2. "then 'which are written in this book' will refer to 'the holy city and the tree of life.'"
3. "As in the beginning of this book (Revelation 1:3) a blessing was promised to the devout, obedient student of it, so now at its close a curse is denounced against those who add to, or take from, it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The whole book was to be received - with all its fearful truths - as a revelation from God; and however obscure it might seem, in due time it would be made plain; however faithfully it might depict a fearful apostasy, it was important, both to show the truth of divine inspiration and to save the church, that these disclosures should be in their native purity in the possession of the people of God."
2. "Perhaps there is here an intimation that this would be most likely to be done by those who professed to be Christians, and who supposed that their names were in the book of life. In fact, most of the corruptions of the sacred Scriptures have been attempted by those who have professed some form of Christianity."
3. "Such corruption of the divine oracles would show that they had no true religion, and would be excluded from heaven."

### John Gill:
1. "And if any man shall take away from the prophecy of this book... he may be said to do, who denies the authority of this book... or takes it away from, or denies the reading of it to the people... and who willfully pervert the sense of it." 
2. "God shall take away his part out of the book of life... by which is meant eternal election... in which whoever are written shall certainly be saved."
