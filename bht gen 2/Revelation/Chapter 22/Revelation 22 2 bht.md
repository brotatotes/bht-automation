The tree of life, representing Christ, is situated in the midst of the city streets, symbolizing close communion with the saints. Its twelve fruits emphasize abundant and varied blessings. The leaves preserve the well-being of God's people, offering spiritual healing. This imagery reflects the fulfillment of God's promises, where sin and death cease. (Based on Revelation 22:2, Revelation 22:14, Ezekiel 47:1-12, Joel 3:18, Zechariah 14:8)

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "How striking it is that, as in the beginning we found Adam and Eve, his bride, in innocence in Paradise, then tempted by the serpent, and driven from the tree of life, and from the pleasant waters of Eden, yet not without a promise of a Redeemer who should crush the serpent; so at the close, the old serpent cast out forever by the second Adam, the Lord from heaven, who appears with His Bride, the Church, in a better Paradise, and amidst better waters."
2. "The antitype exceeds the type: in the first Paradise was only one tree of life; now there are 'very many trees at the bank of the river, on the one side and on the other.'"
3. "But in the final and heavenly city on earth, sin and death shall utterly cease."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The more common interpretation, however, is doubtless admissible, and would give a more beautiful image; that in the street, or streets of the city, as well as on the banks of the river, the tree of life was planted. It abounded everywhere."
2. "The writer undoubtedly conceives of a single river running through the city - probably as meandering along - and that river lined on both sides with the tree of life. This gives great beauty to the imagery."
3. "The tree was the common tree in this blessed Paradise - of which all might partake, and which was everywhere the emblem of immortality."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In the midst of the street thereof."
2. "Twelve manner of fruits... Lit., twelve fruits."
3. "On these two verses compare Ezekiel 47:1-12; Joel 3:18; Zechariah 14:8."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The picture presented to us is that of a clear stream flowing down the middle of each street of the city, bordered with trees on either side. Yet these trees are one tree." 
2. "A good sense may be obtained from the latter interpretation, which will point us to the variety, ever new, of the enjoyments provided for the inhabitants of the city."
3. "Finally, the thought has direct reference to that upon which the believer lives, and this is always one and the same: ‚ÄòChrist‚Äô liveth in us."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The tree of life (ŒæœÖŒªŒøŒΩ Œ∂œâŒ∑œÇ). For the metaphor see Genesis 1:11 and Revelation 2:7; Revelation 22:14." 
2. "Twelve manner of fruits (Œ∫Œ±œÅœÄŒøœÖœÇ Œ¥œâŒ¥ŒµŒ∫Œ±). 'Twelve fruits.'"
3. "Spiritual healing, of course, as leaves (œÜœÖŒªŒªŒ±) are often used for obtaining medicines."

### John Gill:
1. "By the tree of life is meant not the Gospel, nor godliness, nor eternal life, nor any other of the divine Persons, but Christ, who is the author of life, natural, spiritual, and eternal."
2. "The situation of the tree of life between the street of the city, where the saints commune and converse together, and the river of God's everlasting love, shows that Christ will be seen and enjoyed by all in the most delightful and comfortable manner that can be wished for."
3. "The leaves of the tree were for the preserving and continuing the health of the people of God in this state, as the tree of life in Eden's garden was for the preservation of the health and life of Adam, had he continued in a state of innocence."

### John Wesley:
1. "Here is the paradise of God, mentioned, Revelation 2:7."
2. "Every month - That is, in inexpressible abundance... the abundance of the fruits of the Spirit, may be intimated thereby."
3. "And the leaves are for the healing of the nations - For the continuing their health, not the restoring it; for no sickness is there."
