## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Even so, comeâ€”The Song of Solomon (Song of Solomon 8:14) closes with the same yearning prayer for Christ's coming."
2. "A, B, and Aleph omit 'Even so,' Greek, 'nai': then translate for Amen, 'So be it, come, Lord Jesus'; joining the 'Amen,' or 'So be it,' not with Christ's saying (for He calls Himself the 'Amen' at the beginning of sentences, rather than puts it as a confirmation at the end), but with John's reply."
3. "Christ's 'I come,' and John's 'Come,' are almost coincident in time; so truly does believer reflect the mind of his Lord."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He here speaks of himself, and vouches for the truth and reality of these things by saying that he 'testifies' of them, or bears witness to them."
2. "The fact that Jesus himself vouches for the truth of what is here revealed, shows the propriety of what John had said in the previous verses about adding to it, or taking from it."
3. "It is the utterance of desire in the precise language which the Saviour had used - heart responding to heart."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Even so [Î½Î±Î¹] . Omit.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Jesus Himself speaks first, testifying to that great truth of His Coming which has been the main theme of the whole revelation of this book; and adding, as suited the moment at which we have arrived, that He comes â€˜quickly.â€™"
2. "The Coming of Christ has been the source of her hope, the spring of her joy, throughout all her troubles. When she hears that it is at hand, what can she do but lift up her head and cry â€˜Comeâ€™?"
3. "The words are in striking harmony with what we have found to be the tone and character of the whole book. It was especially intended to describe the fortunes of â€˜the saints;â€™ it was written for their sakes, to encourage and strengthen them; it has now reached a point at which we behold nothing but saints in the new heavens and new earth; and its closing salutation is to them."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He which testifieth... that is Jesus... Yea, I come quickly." 
2. "Then John expresses his absolute belief in the Lord's promise: 'Amen: come, Lord Jesus.'" 
3. "For Paul's confidence in the deity of Christ and the certainty of his second coming see Titus 2:13; 2 Timothy 4:8."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ... expresses the certainty of [his coming], so that it ought not to be doubted of by any, especially by his own people." 
2. "[Christ] may have some respect, in this strong repetition of it, to the certainty of the punishment that will then be inflicted upon such who add to, or diminish from this book; for he himself will certainly come in person and execute the vengeance threatened."
3. "John... declaring his faith in it, and expressing his earnest desire after it, and wish for it: and in words at length adds, even so come, Lord Jesus; quickly, speedily as thou hast said, and in all thy glory; set up thy kingdom, let that come, introduce thy people into it, and destroy thine enemies."

### John Wesley:
1. "He that testifieth these things â€” Even all that is contained in this book."
2. "Saith â€” For the encouragement of the church in all her afflictions."
3. "Yea â€” Answering the call of the Spirit and the bride. I come quickly â€” To destroy all her enemies, and establish her in a state of perfect and everlasting happiness."
